    review: Can I give it a neutral rating? Cuz the game works. Nostalgia. Then you
      have a random crash where it says a device is removed and then restart the game...
      LOL but it definitely gives off a nostalgia vibe. Especially the different combinations
      of classes that it gives makes the game interesting. Graphics wise is still
      bad but its decent in my eyes. Again nostalgia purposes. OFC the game is outdated
      and some won't go the extra mile to actually bypass the bad UI / fix the problems
      / look for a way into the game / etc. to feel the nostalgic era of the game.
      Also i tried to make my character as close as possible to Shiroe from Log Horizon
      :D
