Simple, no storyline, just shining cats illuminating the dark and finding butterflies. \n\nThe good- easy to play, simple mechanics, very enjoyable.\nThe bad- There aren't that many levels in this game. You might get at max 6 hours out of the game, but you will smile the whole time.","timestamp_created":1603077253,"timestamp_updated":1603077445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42JK3n/UCeKbhqAI="}
