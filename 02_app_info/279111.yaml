    review: "Again, if you don't want to have all Sacred 3 achievements, or Sacred\
      \ 3 Gold Edition under your belt, and didn't acquire this DLC already in the\
      \ \"Sacred Franchise Pack\", just skip this.\n\nLike other 5 characters, Ork\
      \ Garok = simulator of clicking your LMB while performing every single attack.\
      \ Also, just like Mirak, he is annoyingly slow. You will hanging on, like, forever,\
      \ waiting for Ork swinging his axe. And I can't say he does noticable bigger\
      \ average damage, than Malaknim, for example. Therefore, his developement will\
      \ feel like mindless boring grinding. \n\nHe does not have his own story, aside\
      \ of levels from mediocre-to-appaling \"Ork Story\" DLC levels. And, considening\
      \ that Orks in Sacred 3 were implemented just as the race from \"Standard fantacy\
      \ setting\", it doesn't add anything significant to Sacred 3's \"lore\"... if\
      \ you can call it that. Ugly face, animations that hardly can be called as \"\
      fascinating\"... \n\nDefinately, there is much more reason to buy \"Orcland\
      \ Story\" than that DLC. The latter at least contain some battlefields and story\
      \ snippets... Placing \"Orc of Thrones\" to the main \"Sacred 3\" page instead\
      \ and describing \"OoT\" with the plot of independent \"OS\" seems to be either\
      \ unreasoned, or involve players to be even more puzzled, if \"Sacred 3\" just\
      \ wasn't enough for that. \n\n\n[code]\n* [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/12320]Review\
