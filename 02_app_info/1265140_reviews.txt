All you do is walk over to gems and pick them up, you should be able interact with things around you and gems should be better hidden.\n3.  The game is too dark , making sure it's on higher graphics settings helps but then potato gamers are left out so adding a torch would help.\n4. Game needs more substance , add in a great storyline like a murder investigation  or add in tomb raider or silent hill style puzzles in fact having a difficulty setting for a range of puzzles would be also  great.\n5. Game is too short even for the price one or two more levels would help.\nSo overall a relaxing game that could be much better; feels unpolished but fine for a relaxing playthrough.","timestamp_created":1609965922,"timestamp_updated":1609965922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7czc7PYCfsONwQI="}
