    review: Great game for nonograms. If you don't know what it is, there is a tutorial
      that shows you how to play and even gives you useful tipps on how to best solve
      them. The first nonograms are easy but they get more challenging the more you
      progress. There are many puzzles, so it will take some playing hours to finish
      all of them. What I like most is the smoothing music, it's super relaxing and
      helps you to retrieve from stress after an exhausting day. Unfortunately there
      are no steam achievments, I would love to have them but whatever, it's still
      a great game.
