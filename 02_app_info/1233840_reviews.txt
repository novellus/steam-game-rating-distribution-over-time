The platforming is fun and introduced a few neat tricks I hadn't thought of, and the combat had some humor mixed in with the challenge. It's overall pretty fun if you have the dexterity for it.","timestamp_created":1603156775,"timestamp_updated":1603156775,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4heLlofUCfqf8qAI="}
