    about_the_game: "<strong>Shikon-X Astro Defense Fortress</strong> is a mix between\
      \ a graphic adventure game and all the classic arcade shoot 'em ups you love\
      \ from the 80s and 90s.<br>You play as Major Daaia, the only pilot in the federation\
      \ who can handle <strong>Shikon-X</strong> \u2014a ship with advanced defense\
      \ capabilities which can also transform into attack mode when needed!<br><br>Earth\
      \ scientists have mastered the secrets of space energy gathering, and collected\
      \ vast amounts of energy into what they call &quot;<strong>Life Capsules</strong>&quot;\
      \ that form floating clusters orbiting the planet. <br><br>The world has been\
      \ at peace for decades, but a small guerrilla from planet Rolar has been destroying\
      \ our <strong>Life Capsules</strong>, and your mission is to defend our energy\
      \ source from those terrorists!<br><br><strong>Shikon-X</strong>'s story unfolds\
      \ in different ways. The game starts as a graphic adventure where you can chat\
      \ with your fellow soldiers and solve puzzles to advance the plot. You'll move\
      \ into an arcade phase that starts similar to <i>Breakout/Arkanoid</i>, bouncing\
      \ attacks with your ship's body in defense mode, and that'll quickly turn into\
      \ a shoot 'em up section like <i>Galaga/Space Invaders</i> with wall to wall\
      \ arcade action. During those arcade sections the story will keep unfolding,\
      \ so keep your eye into <strong>Shikon-X</strong>'s communication screens to\
      \ get all the scoop!<br><br>Back in the mothership you'll be able to continue\
      \ the story, and even play other mini-games like the <strong>Bounty Hunter Baby\
      \ from Space Pinball</strong> and other games to be added later!<br><br>Every\
      \ chapter will add more mini-games and more story beats, and they'll all be\
      \ added to the main game \u2014no DLC or extra things to buy!<br><br>This free\
      \ demo will only let you play Chapter 1 and the pinball mini game, enjoy!"
