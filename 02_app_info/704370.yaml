    review: 'To be honest, if you even like this sort of game even the slightest,
      it''s a great little game you can repeat and solve your way through whilst having
      a chilling conversation with a friend, or just something to do in the background
      to keep your brain even minutely functioning.


      To a degree, this even surprisingly grasps the same tier of attention-seeking,
      low effort, minimalistic quality, and simplistic charm as snakes or flappy bird.
      Something awfully basic. So basic that it wouldn''t be the thing to win you
      over to say it was the best thing to ever happen in your day. But still something
      that''s enough, something just there in the background of your attention, just
      trying its best to keep you tuned in this morning, but with the little it has
      to offer.


      Now, water you waiting for? Earn those big bucks, and rotate as many crooked,
      rusty, floating, pointless pipes as you can!

      Hey, if you think about it, it''s even watering that tree in the background.
      So, this game is even pretty good for the environment. XD'
