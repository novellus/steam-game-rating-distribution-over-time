{"1234730":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"HereSphere","steam_appid":1234730,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"HereSphere is a VR video player geared towards advanced users. It is capable of playing flat-screen, equirectangular, and fisheye videos, and uses new algorithms to enhance the immersiveness of VR videos to achieve the feeling of &quot;presence&quot;.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe player uses a distance setting to enable 6DOF in VR video. It also provides software IPD and convergence plane adjustments, which helps with the perception of scale and depth. The user can offset their position in the video and rotate it however they desire. Any FOV is supported. Spatial audio is emulated for videos with stereo audio, so the sound source shifts depending on the direction the user faces.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMultiple flat-screen videos can be played simultaneously with the multi-screen feature. Audio will automatically focus on the screen in front of the user.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nControls are streamlined for fast and efficient input for all control devices, with motion gestures and layered keys\/chords. The learning curve is a bit steep, but it is necessary to allow the user to quickly align the video's rotation and position while in a VR headset.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe UI provides directory search functionality, sorting, file deletion, and numeric\/virtual keyboard inputs. The correct projection stereo format is automatically recognized without the need for special file naming schemes.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe media library feature allows searching, time-stamped tagging, and sorting by rating, with boolean operations and equality\/range comparisons. The media library will remember video resume times and keep track of video play count.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nKey-frames can be added to the timeline to automatically load up preset projection settings, such as rotation, motion distance, FOV, IPD, etc.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWeb streaming is also supported for websites that implement the DeoVR API. If the website contains video tags, then those are also loaded and can be searched\/sorted. The categorized tags menu streamlines the tag searching process by listing all of the available tags, and has buttons for boolean search operations. Some websites will support presets that will enable the auto-focus algorithm, which enhances the clarity of an image by maintaining convergence and makes objects appear more solid and life-like.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe timeserver API allows the application to send playback information to peripherals.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOnly Windows Media Foundation is supported at the moment.","about_the_game":"HereSphere is a VR video player geared towards advanced users.
