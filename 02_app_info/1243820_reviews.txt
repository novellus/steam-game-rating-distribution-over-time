However, the one good thing with this game is the art style, it is quite pleasant to look at for a short period and then it gets boring, but the lighting is pretty.\n\nAt the least the price isn't unreasonable, could still be cheaper for what you get, perhaps they will improve the feel of the game a little and the climbing, and then at least you can call this a pretty good VR 'experience' that you'll play once or twice and then you'll show to your grandma or something.\nWish them luck with this game.","timestamp_created":1588981720,"timestamp_updated":1605893160,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553671121597290039","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxJ+s8/UCdcDChgI="}
