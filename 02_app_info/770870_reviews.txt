This is the second in the Queen's Tales series, and the heroine is persevering and loyal, as well as brave about everything except spiders.  Spiders seem to get a bad rep in these games!\n\nPros:\n- Nice art and overall visuals\n- Nice music\n- Okay story, though I found it less interesting than the first one - there were moments of humour, though, which I always appreciate\n- The in-game achievements and collectibles are nice.\n- Has most of the usual helpful aids, including a map that let's you move between places.\n\nCons\n- There is a bit of a sense of running around a couple of times\n- Not every instruction is perfectly obvious, so you end up really having to figure out what you missed\n- In a *very few* places, it feels like you have to click more than once for the game to register that you really did select the correct dialogue item.\n- Honestly, there weren't a lot of cons other than a slightly weak story.\n\nI recommended getting both games in the set, they're worth the price.","timestamp_created":1564208018,"timestamp_updated":1564208018,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552656114101409912","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpYaEmewCceOZzwE="}
