That's it. The gameplay and world is so boring and meaningless, and this is clearly unfinished. The promises of survival, farming, crafting, fishing, and mini games are dishonest and misleading; they're the most shallow versions the developer could think up. There is nothing to this game. I work for a game development company and I know what \"alpha means\"; calling this game an \"alpha\" would be generous. It's empty. Seriously, don't bother.","timestamp_created":1596955892,"timestamp_updated":1596955892,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524657726287841797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkqP/6PMCdumrmgI="}
