I can see the developer actually put a lot more effort on the first boss to make him look bad ass.\nSeeing a little of that after the first one though, even the final boss, doesn't have a 2nd stage like on the previous one.\n\nStill quite enjoyable. I like the female boxer boss where she is super fast and try to approach you for a undercut constantly. Which really stands out on the rest of the playthrough because normally I'm the one chasing the enemies.\n\n[h1]Overall[/h1]\nNot a bad game, what more do you expect for 2 dollar? And developer certainly put a lot of effort on the graphic design.\nConsider it is a bit more pricey than the first one, you would expect a bit more, but this game certainly offers a lot less replayable values: no unlockable modes, no unlockable characters, which is a shame considering that's a lot cool sprite designed.\n\nStill worth a try, keep on the hard work! Looking forward to the 3rd one as well! (Was that 1st of May or 5th of January? I can't get that date format right in the Easter egg :D )","timestamp_created":1609252613,"timestamp_updated":1609252613,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uMW71/YCd+C6vgI="}
