    reviews: "&quot;Successfully reloading a gun for the first time through sheer\
      \ muscle memory is easily one of the greatest feelings in gaming.&quot;<br>8.5/10\
      \ \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.destructoid.com/review-receiver-250769.phtml\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Destructoid</a><br><br>&quot;Receiver\
      \ is interesting for two things. One, it focuses on a single weapon, the Colt\
      \ 1911 A1, and takes it very seriously, using &quot;high detail gun mechanics&quot;,\
      \ which means you can &quot;manipulate each part of the gun independently&quot;\
      \ (the beginning of the video shows this in action). The second is that it's\
      \ a randomly-generated shooter that features permanent death. Taking place inside\
      \ a single building, every time you die, you have to start at the very beginning\
      \ again, but the entire game world is re-rolled. It's available now for $5,\
      \ which given the ideas on show, is totally worth it just to check it out.&quot;<br>\u2013\

      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Kotaku</a><br><br>&quot;Receiver didn\u2019\
      t cast me as some nigh-invincible mass of regenerating muscle. The end result,\
      \ then, was that I felt exactly how I\u2019d expect Real Me would in a combat\
      \ situation involving live ammo.&quot;<br>\u2013 <a href=\"http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/06/20/impressions-wolfires-hyper-realistic-gun-sim-receiver/\"\
