The game has a lot of problems, things that seem pointless, etc. They're so numerous that I think it's more worthwhile for me just to say, \"Buyer beware,\" especially if you want to play co-op. Upon starting the game multiple times, it always thought one of my controllers was two separate controllers; for that reason, I couldn't use my arcade stick. I had to resort to my gamepad.\n\nIn short, expect little from this one, and be prepared to refund it, in case you don't like it. I only bought it and played through the story mode because (a) it was super cheap, and (b) it's a shmup. After beating story mode on Nightmare difficulty (which wasn't as difficult as it sounds), I'm not sure that I'll ever return for another session; in fact, I doubt that I will... maybe for some achievements, but that's it.\n\nNote: My recorded playtime does not accurately reflect my actual gametime. I left the game on for hours with the intention of coming back to it after running some errands--a futile attempt, since I had to restart the game anyway.","timestamp_created":1606269198,"timestamp_updated":1606269198,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw69vG/vUCce2rsAI="}
