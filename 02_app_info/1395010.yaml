    review: "[b]The Game[/b]                                                    [strike]you\
      \ just lost it[/strike]\n+Gameplay is easy and straight forward with 3 different\
      \ goals for each level to 'unlock'. You gain coins for gameplay and these unlock\
      \ further levels, which is a cute touch. \n+The game is fairly accessible for\
      \ newbies with its simple designs. \nAlthough it can be unforgiving with mistakes.\n\
      \n-The game only allows one mistake for the beginning portion of a level, and\
      \ 2 mistakes as you progress. This is extremely limiting.\n-There is a penalty\
      \ for getting clicks wrong in this game, in which the level ends and you have\
      \ to restart.\nIt's annoying as I have shaky hands due to EDS and it means my\
      \ hands sometimes move a bit further than I plan, or click/release when I didn't\
      \ intend to and the game registers it as a mistake.\nI prefer when it lets you\
      \ make mistakes but won't progress until you get the right combination. That\
      \ way you can slowly process as you go along.\n\n[u]Visuals and Sound:[/u]\n\
      +Visually it's easy to see the selected and un-selected blocks, which is good.\n\
      +The music is calming and can fade into the background.\n\n-The numbers on the\
      \ boarder, that tell you how many selected blocks you should have, sometimes\
      \ are hard to read, so I might mix up 2/3 for example, and can get a penalty\
      \ due to this.\n-If you put the music down to a lower level of sound, when the\
      \ level is cleared the sound shoots back up to maximum and blasts out victory\
      \ music. It's really odd and disorientating. The only way to fix it is to completely\
      \ mute it, which sucks as the music isn't too bad.\n\n\n[u]What would make this\
      \ better and more accessible?[/u]\n\n[*]Larger numbers on the sides, so you\
      \ can clearly read them.\n[*]Remove the mistake penalty for relaxed playing,\
      \ that still has a consequence for incorrect clicks.\n[*]Ability to save progress\
      \ mid-level, for a more relaxed play through.\n[*]Allow more than one mistake\
      \ at the beginning, and let gamers opt into that mode instead.\n[*]Fix the sound\
      \ so the music doesn't reset to max at the end of the level!"
