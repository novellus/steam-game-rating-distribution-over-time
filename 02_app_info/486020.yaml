    about_the_game: "Welcome to Hero! A simple 3rd person fantasy action adventure\
      \ game created by Bakershah Games, a 2 man game studio based in San Francisco,\
      \ CA. Hero is a game where you the player go on quests in a world with 3 kingdoms.\
      \ You must unite all 3 kingdoms to defeat a dark enemy that has been unleashed\
      \ upon your world. The game is meant to be an homage to all the classical Action\
      \ Adventure games from the 90's. Cheesy dialogue, weird animations, but worlds\
      \ as a kid you could escape too and loved. That is what Hero wishes to recreate.\
      \ It is a simplistic adventure game which focuses on 3 basic pillars that people\
      \ like to do in these games.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n 1). Exploration: Explore open\
      \ environments. Think of Witcher 2. Semi open world with linear gameplay. <br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n2). Combat: Fight orcs and dragons throughout the game. We\
      \ use a simple hack and slash combat system that focuses on precision of attacks\
      \ rather than button mashing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3). Dialogue: Throughout the\
      \ story you will be conversing with many NPC's and the choices you make in those\
      \ conversations will affect things. Those things might happen immediately at\
      \ the end of a quest you're on or will be way later in the game where the consequence\
      \ of your actions will be shown."
