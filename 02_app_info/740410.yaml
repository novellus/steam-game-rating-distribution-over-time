    review: "Nice Puzzle game with a quirky background that's revealed bit by bit.\
      \ \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2301630418\nAs\
      \ you can see, good window and sound options, as well as plenty options to remove\
      \ stuff that lets you wait.\n\nI don't really know what penalty you get when\
      \ you fail while not using unlimited solutions, I tried and could just continue\
      \ to guess. Maybe you might want to have free solutions later on for tough stuff,\
      \ but I want to solve them myself anyway. :)\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2301670357\n\
      \nThe puzzles themselves need you to put blocks on the right places, starting\
      \ easy, getting more difficult over time. Blocks can have numbers, may be empty\
      \ (placable anywhere), or have mathematical functions going in one or more direction,\
      \ affecting the neighbouring block(s), including blocks that affect neighbouring\
      \ blocks.\n\nYou do not have to move the blocks with your character. As you're\
      \ told early on, you have a super power to move them with your mind! :)\n\n\
      https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2301643062\n\nThere are\
      \ also different colours to the blocks, affecting only matching colours, or\
      \ changing colours. And after a while shapes are added, neighbouring blocks\
      \ have to fit into each other.\n\nNew blocks are introduced in easier puzzles,\
      \ where it should be obvious what you have to do with them. \n\nThere is no\
      \ level selection, but you can start over any time, losing previous progress.\n\
      \nThere is no indication of how many levels there are. A guide on Steam here\
      \ says it is 67 levels.\n\nThe interface works fine, the graphics are ok, though\
      \ I could do without the fake 'snow' fuzzying some locations.\n\nThe character\
      \ you start watching at the start isn't the most likable, but I guess you can\
      \ imagine just watching the folks, and not actually playing him.\n\nDefinitely\
      \ recommended for people who like to jog their gray cells and chuckle at the\
      \ text now and then. Even fuzzy old me got to the end once, and I'm now playing\
      \ it again. :)\n\nEdit: After playing it some more again, I added additional\
      \ info."
