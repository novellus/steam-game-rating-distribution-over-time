Even though the character that you play as is an adventurer, you have the freedom to do anything that you want since the game's main dynamic factor is focused on gathering resources and putting them to good use in an efficient manner. There are plenty of activities available yet in the game such as fishing, mining, chopping wood, expanding the land that you own, decorating and so on.\n\nOn top of that the developer is very active, hardworking and receptive, constantly creating more and more content for the game while also listening to the comunnity's preferences on the game's forum. \n\nPersonally, i would rate this game 9/10 while i strongly believe it has the potential to become a perfect game in the future after a few more solid updates.\nIn conclusion, this game is a must buy if you are into relaxing and passive games, especially given the very low price!","timestamp_created":1587295987,"timestamp_updated":1606491145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474919974803924561","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4srCVhfYCefT5gQI="}
