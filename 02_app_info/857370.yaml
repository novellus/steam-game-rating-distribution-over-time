      hearing them when he was younger. His grandmother always told him it was just
      the pipes, he's not too sure anymore.

    review: 'The Entity: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly - a textbook case of what happens
      when REAL play testing is underrated and overlooked.


      The Good:

      +The use of a cellphone as a light source, with battery management, was a nice
      alternative to the standard flashlight trope.

      +Use of the generator as a pseudo game timer was also somewhat unique for this
      genre of game.

      +The interior cells and assets for the house for the most part looked decent
      and consistent.


      The Bad:

      -The couch in the basement was bright magenta (either it''s texture was corrupt
      or just missing altogether).

      -There is bad clipping between objects and walls; between objects and player;
      between environment and interactive objects.

      -The menu UI is cumbersome and clumsy, both on the start screen and especially
      in game.

      -There was inconsistent use of object trigger boundaries; some (notes, light
      switches) are positional (you just need to stand near their onTrigger box),
      whereas others are directional (you need to be looking AT the keys to pick them
      up)

      -These object triggers can clip through walls (I''ve picked up keys and turned
      on lights through doors and walls)


      The Ugly:

      --The "DLC" is busted and never properly starts, instead giving a black screen,
      or somehow opening the vanilla game with no changes.

      --The story writing is confused, and often predictable.

      --Some of the scenes (outdoors, heaven, underworld) look like they''re put together
      haphazardly - floating trees, clipping objects, scattered lighting).

      --Scene lighting would often break, either with lights and shadows clipping
      through solid objects, or all lights cease working.


      The Verdict: I would say "you get what you pay for," and thought $3.99 was a
      fair price...well, at first. Given the number of times the game flat-out broke,
      and that there has not been a material update in 2 years (I suspect the dev
      has ceased working on this title), this game should be put on perma-sale at
      $0.99. Only then could I say you were getting your money''s worth.'
