    review: "So I got to the final... and I'd say I'm quite dissappointed.\nThis game\
      \ claims that it could be more than it is.\n\nGraphics are okay but I didn't\
      \ like not so smooth animation and slow lazy walking of character.\nIt is 2020,\
      \ you know.\nI like art insertions of characters. As for me, it would be more\
      \ nice to see ingame graphics closer to those arts.\nOr even 3d. As what we\
      \ can see in community.\n\nThe puzzles are quite fun. \nDialogs are okay and\
      \ fun sometimes.\n(Bug report on 2020.12.29: In some moments thre looks like\
      \ there are lost audio and quite long pause before dialog starts.\nI played\
      \ English version.)\nThere is difference between what main charater says and\
      \ what is written in dialog options. \nHowever, there in not much outcome in\
      \ what you choose to say. Maybe some hints on what to do.\n\nCharacters look\
      \ promising and charismatic (their arts, too). But their story lines are hollow\
      \ and shallow.\n\nThere are a lot of unfinished story lines and stuff can be\
      \ seen here and there in the game.\nThe story about \"escape from school and\
      \ not getting caught for that\" yells to be just introduction but turns out\
      \ to be main story. Unfortunately, all other stories around are not developed\
      \ enough. Even story with band is quite broken in its final.\nThe theme of aliens\
      \ and saving the world is a decoration mostly. Those creatures just appear in\
      \ a couple of moments as some surreal trip and then dissappear with no big reason\
      \ and logic. \n\nThe ending is abrupt. I expected to be second chapter here.\
      \ Where the story of aliens would be told...\nAnd third chapter where they truly\
      \ save the worldand as a by product main character befiend with rock-girl and\
      \ bass player... But nope.\nObviously, scenario was patched and shortcutted\
      \ to jump to final.\nSeems like the intentions and ambitions were quite bigger\
      \ but this was not put into action due to deadline and/or lack of funding.\n\
      \nAs to indie developer I respect those good intentions and efforts.\nBut final\
      \ product was quite dissapointing for me just because It promissed more,\n\n\
      As a resume I'd say if you like quest puzzles and some fun then this game is\
      \ ok. \nBut do not expect very deep and developed story here."
