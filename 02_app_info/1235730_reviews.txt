I was the one who was constantly on YouTube watching others play the game that i was craving for and i was desperate to live on the island and become a mermaid and create my own story. Now that i have the game, it is not what i was expecting. Perhaps its because i am new to the sims 4 since i skipped the 3rd game, but i am having strong difficulty enjoying this expansion. The only thing i could say that i liked about this pack is the clothes during create-a-sim; i think that the choices were beautifully chosen and just amazing in general. However, as a whole, i believe that i wont be going to Sulani Island for a while.","timestamp_created":1609502983,"timestamp_updated":1609502983,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tdD23vYCd8ywvwI="}
