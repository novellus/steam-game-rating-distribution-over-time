From its stunning graphics and inspired voice acting to the active fan community this game ticks all my boxes. \n\nIn all seriousness unless you are want this for nostalgia I highly recommend saving a few bucks and getting the same amount of entertainment from reading the community posts. The thread on Putt-Putt lore and the drama within are truly worth a read.","timestamp_created":1609684105,"timestamp_updated":1609684105,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48sap5PYCdNyKwAI="}
