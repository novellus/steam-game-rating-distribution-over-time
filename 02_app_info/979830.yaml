      \ was cut off. Countries agreed that the area will be managed jointly and used\
      \ as a training ground for experimental weapons. With the passage of time more\
      \ and more soldiers began to die in the zone, too much for maneuvers and tests.\
      \ During the last operation, conducted in March 2106, a distorted radio report\
      \ came from the zone and the communication ceased. Command stopped any activity\
      \ inside the zone and sent there its best agent to investigate the situation.\

      \ player will be attacked by monsters, most of whom have shapes that are unlike\

      \ will fight or cooperate not only with mutants but also with other stalkers.\
      \ The closer to the center of the zone is the player, the stranger the mutation\
