I enjoyed it, lets make that clear, but I really am not sure what to make of it. The recent update in graphics has done very well, the game is relatively bug free, and honestly for a first time effort by a small indie developer it's quite good. In summary, it is fun, cheap, and relatively short. Buy it on a sale and try it out.","timestamp_created":1500340876,"timestamp_updated":1500340876,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrp7Sqd0CcIKggAE="}
