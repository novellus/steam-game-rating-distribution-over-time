You'd expect them to make you do every boss from the main game again, just harder... but it's just like two. So the combat challenges are very few compared to the other two kinds [puzzle and.. the other one]. \n\nI quite liked many of the challenge levels though. They were a bit more challenging than the main game was, and while not required there are some hidden hotdogs to find in each level and if you get them all you can get an extra costume which is neat.\n\nThe puzzle side of things was a bit tedious though, I didn't like how many tilt puzzles there were. Particularly getting one of the hotdogs in one of them. But doing more challenging slide puzzles was fun. It's worth it if you enjoy the main game and want more. Especially on sale.","timestamp_created":1591761233,"timestamp_updated":1591761233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xpyXzvICeKqYjQI="}
