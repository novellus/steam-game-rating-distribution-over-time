      look for the Empire Soldier Markus Kruber. The new skin is applied when downloaded

      Greatswords are one of the most famous regiments in the Empire, with tales of
      their valour and ruthlessness told from Marienburg To Talabheim. The regiment
      earned its bloody reputation after the Siege of Carroburg in 1865, where its
      soldiers successfully defended the walls of their city against the count of
      Middenland's vast army. Despite the horrific casualties and many wounds they
      suffered during the battle, the Greatswords fought on resolutely and, by battle's
      end, their white Reikland uniforms were drenched in blood. From that moment
      onwards, the Carroburg Greatswords have worn dark red uniforms in remembrance
      of that bloody battle.

    review: Cool look but would not recommend, as most of Krubers' hats are of a different
      metal color.
