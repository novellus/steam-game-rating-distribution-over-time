    reviews: "\u201CTeam Indie is a success on the whole. It combines a lot of range\
      \ of different characters with engaging puzzles and fun mechanics! The art and\
      \ music work great together and really help to make the game feel fluent and\
      \ cohesive. I had a great time controling time with Team Indie and give it 8.5\
      \ out of 10!\u201D<br>8.5 / 10 \u2013 <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=C2Ec4f6GWrs\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Glitch</a><br><br>\u201CI wasn\u2019\
      t quite sure what to expect booting up Team Indie for the first time and boy\
      \ was I in for a pleasant experience. Boasting over 50 levels, featuring 10\
      \ of the best loved indie video game characters ever and brimming with some\
      \ of the most creative and innovative level design, if you are a platforming\
      \ game fan, it would be a shame to miss out on this one.\u201D<br>10 / 10 \u2013\

    review: "I enjoyed this game at the beginning.  I got to be a kitty and the early\
      \ stages were fun.  However, as the game dragged on, the shortfalls grew too\
      \ big to ignore.\n\nWhile the idea is interesting, the execution is terrible.\
      \  Playing out each part for each hero means that you have to go through many\
      \ stages multiple times and there is a lot of forced waiting for your previous\
      \ play-throughs to sync with you, especially after you die.  There is a fast-forward\
      \ button, but it's not enough.  The game would be a lot more fun if you didn't\
      \ die from every hit; some of the windows for you to move are extremely tight,\
      \ especially in the later levels where the new heroes begin to feature progressively\
      \ worse control.  These issues combined really wear down on patience, even without\
      \ the game's buggy nature.\n\nNow, when I say \"buggy,\" I mean VERY buggy,\
      \ Sonic '06 buggy.  For starters, it is way too easy to clip inside platforms\
      \ and get stuck, especially in the later stages.  I didn't notice any long load\
      \ times, but while I was playing through, the glitches got worse.  Previous\
      \ playthroughs would break synch; some enemies I killed in previous runs didn't\
      \ die half the time.  In addition, the game froze on me multiple times with\
      \ most of the instances being when the game rewound my progress after I died.\
      \  My PC isn't top-of-the-line, but it's more than capable of running this type\
      \ of game.  However, even my whole PC crashed because of this game.  I had to\
      \ do a hard reset to get everything back up.  \n\nThe developer obviously skimped\
      \ on playtesting and quality control.  Avoid this one."
