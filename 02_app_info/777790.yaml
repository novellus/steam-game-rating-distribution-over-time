    review: 'TL;DR: Go ahead and try it if you have $2.


      Grade: B+

      This game is far from perfect. Text on screen can be blurry or nearly impossible
      to read during battles. Bullets sometimes clip through the edge of walls. And
      it is obviously trying to capitalize on the popularity of Enter the Gungeon.
      That said, I really love this game. It is fun with very satisfying combat. The
      shooting is so enjoyable that despite dying repeatedly on levels (granted I
      don''t have the best skills) I kept coming back to see if I could overcome it.
      This is a very challenging game, but not frustratingly so. And the guns are
      just so satisfying to use, paired with a substantial variety of enemies that
      force the player to change tactics (somewhat). The writing is also hilariously
      over the top and enjoyable. This is just a great little game that I know I will
      be coming back to repeatedly. Considering its price, if you think you might
      be interested at all in this game I would strongly recommend that you check
      it out.'
