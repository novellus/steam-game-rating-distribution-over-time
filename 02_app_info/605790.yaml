    review: '[b][u]Game Information[/u][/b]


      "Queen''s Tale: The Beast and The Nightingale" Collector''s Edition is a Hidden
      Object Puzzle Adventure game. The game was developed by ERS Game Studio and
      published by Big Fish Games Studio.


      "The Beast and The Nightingale" is the first episode of "Queen''s Tale."


      Since this is a collector''s edition, it comes with extra features that are
      not available in its counterpart; the standard edition.


      [b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]


      Game Visuals


      I want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely done. The visuals
      can be adjusted in the game''s option menu.


      Game Audio


      I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio
      is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game''s
      option menu as well.


      Gameplay


      There are four different difficulty game modes to choose from: Casual; Advanced;
      Hard and Custom.


      The notebook keeps track of progression in the game. Such as story events and
      clues.


      There is an interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel
      between each location quickly. It also indicates that there are tasks that can
      be completed at certain locations within the game. The interactive map is not
      automatically given at the start of the game.


      There is a padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in
      place to make it stationary.


      There are interactive items in the game. Some of these interactive items may
      require extra components before they can be interacted with.


      The hidden object scenes consist of the following: Shadow items; Reverse Objects;
      Like Pair items; Traditional word list and Find ''x'' amount items. Some of
      these hidden object scenes may require little or no interactions. Most of the
      hidden object scenes can be replayed in the game''s extra feature section.


      There is an optional mini-game: Match 3. It is only available during hidden
      object scenes.


      The puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of
      them. Most of the puzzles can be replayed in the game''s extra feature section
      as well.


      There is a helper in the game: Golden Nightingale. It can complete certain tasks
      that the player cannot do themselves.


      There is a collectible in the game: Birds. They are scattered throughout the
      game for the player to find.


      Since this is a collector''s edition, there is a bonus chapter, but it can be
      accessed only after the main story is completed.


      There are eleven different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the
      game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need
      to be completed before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game
      only.


      Miscellaneous


      There are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Bonus Hidden Object Scenes;
      Bonus Puzzles; Soundtracks; Concept Art; Wallpapers; Screen Saver; Cinematic
      Scenes and Game''s Strategy Guide. Most of these extra features can be accessed
      only after the entire game is completed.


      Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay
      value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game''s
      full price value.'
