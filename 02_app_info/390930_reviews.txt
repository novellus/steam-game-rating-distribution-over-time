I have appreciated potential audience to this notice about the extreme limitations of your simulation software, and why I am only infrequently active. I will occasionally play your Asteroids-tier simulation for a span of 10 minutes, to handle the random mobs. Officially, I am requesting AIPD groups for display, and I have awesome badges that I am not \"really\" permitted advertisement on my profile. I love the theme of this simulation-software, which for me is a glorified version/emulation of the famous Atari videogame, yet with massively greater features and functionality. At the point of writing this review, it has been approximately 90 hours of play, per SteamPowered.com listings, with 10 minute bursts of activity. These days I drop in for 1-3 minutes to handle fine-motor control functionality, with a better interest and desire for combat-specialisation simulations. I am constantly handling \"gamers-thumb\" after barely any play, due to the random mobs featured in the 3D-stylised scrolling features, and I set hands after exercises in daily life, irrespective of this simulation. In my official opinion, Atari doesn't own side-scrolling genre simulations any more than any Bullet-Hell Monday corporation. And I mean this in support: my logged hours of play have always been a \"Bull-Hell Monday\" of the Asteroids-tier genre. I prefer to play on hard mode, and refuse to play on easy mode, and compromise if there were ever a crew, on normal mode. I must capitalise this because there is no formatting feature: PLEASE MAKE THIS A MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER ONLINE SIMULATION... (conclusively: my standard hours of play are spent on High-Tech Armada, normal mode.)","timestamp_created":1580049936,"timestamp_updated":1580050593,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ztaW8e8CfvKe7gE="}
