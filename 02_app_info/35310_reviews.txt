Although it's simplistic nature - you race around collecting colored upgrades for money, nitro and even weapons, smash'n'drive through plethora of brainless zedies and finishing pretty simple racing missions a-la NFSU2 (even open world reminisce the latter) - it can't offer much more. As soon as you play Clutch for an hour and grind for car upgrades you eventually end up bored with obesity and monotonous nature of this game. Everything it tries to do Carmageddon did it much better.\nAnd I know Clutch was made by a russian developer team back in 2009 (had been playing it then for some bizarre period of time). But even then you could find other mindless racing titles a-like (Zombie Driver, DIPRIP or even Carmageddon TDR2000) and it would be more fun.\nThe music is another subject I want to point out: it's trash. As far as I remember I was playing the game with it tuned off, better off launch Winamp or some other player that you have with your own choice of tunes.\nP.S.: the game doesn't support Dualshock 4 natively even after installing DS4Win or changing Steam Controller Layout so the gamepad could be used as an Xbox ones - it only imitates keyboard usage.","timestamp_created":1610010062,"timestamp_updated":1610010062,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwy/2E7vYCfe+cwQI="}
