    review: "If you dig the base game and want more of it, this is a no-brainer. The\
      \ new characters are interesting and fit into the roster.  \nWhile not directly\
      \ OP, I feel the new guy and gals are not perfectly balanced - but that is the\
      \ case with the original roster as well. Since there are now more contenders,\
      \ a run becomes longer and more difficult. But hey, that's why are here, right?\n\
      Other than that, nothing else changed.\n\nThe in-game art and animations of\
      \ the new characters are on par with the original ones I would say. The new\
      \ stages are a mixed bag for me. I love the new snow level, the night level\
      \ is okay, the temple with the sunset is somewhat hard on my eyes.\nAs noted,\
      \ the character portraits are of lower quality (or at least a slightly different\
      \ style) which makes them look a bit displaced, but I do not really mind. All\
      \ in all, a welcomed addition."
