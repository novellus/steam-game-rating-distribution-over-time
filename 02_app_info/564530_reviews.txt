I get bored for a few years now and then, but always return. The movements of the crowd becomes obvios, so eventually you start building in patterns that are unrealistic. With that said, the challenge of the campaigns keeps you busy later on.\n\nFor it's time it had really good graphics and beautiful artwork. There's also some history thrown in as you start a new lvl or choose between the different paths you're allowed to take. Usually i means choosing between military or building. The war-aspect I find the hardest, but as long as you are a good leader and think ahead you can keep up a nice pace and move througn history. I always loved how you can check in with the townfolks and see what they (or their category) think of life under your rule. Some comments are really funny.\n\nIf you (like me) played this sim as a kid, you come back for the sweet nostalgia. I find myself just looking up the soundtrack online to have in the background on rainy days. It's really relaxing.\n\nI heard they're doing a re-make of this game. I'm definitely gonna buy it.","timestamp_created":1609818695,"timestamp_updated":1609819291,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ415+t6PYCfPjLwAI="}
