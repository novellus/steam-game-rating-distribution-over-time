    short_description: 'YOU and ME and HER: A Love Story is the visual novel medium
      in its purest form. Will Shinichi choose Miyuki, the beautiful queen bee of
      the school, or the endearingly awkward misfit Aoi? With art by Tsuji Santa,
      these beautifully rendered romances will stay with you forever.'

    review: "It's really a emotional roller coaster. I played so many visual novel\
      \ and this visual novel is clearly unique from the other visual novel. The art\
      \ is great, the music is great, the story is EXTRAORDINARY. It's really a piece\
      \ of art. \nThis is the only visual novel that makes me feel guilty to try other\
      \ routes.\n\n\nI finished the _\u0335\u035D\u033D\u0357\u033F\u0315\u032A\u035A\
      \u031E\u0321\u0317\u031F\u035C\u0316\u0331\u0323\u0349\u032E_\u0335\u031A\u0351\

      \ route but now i'm so hesitant to play other routes. It's a hell of a trip\
