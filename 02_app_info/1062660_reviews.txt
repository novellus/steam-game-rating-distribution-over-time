My biggest complaint is that the enemies spawn rate + speed make it hard to unalive them. The only redeeming quality of dying when you cant turn around and contest the literal horde of enemies is that when bloodthirst procs you get a free heart, and when you complete lvls you get a large amount of hearts as is. But there wouldn't be a need for all the hearts if you didn't die to things that are almost unavoidable unless you get lucky to get the right weapons that also go well together. the weapons are fair and balanced, however the enemies are op and will slaughter you instantly if you make a mistake making the game not worth it to play cause it just makes you mad and you feel a sense of inferiority when playing. overall its fixable redundancies (you wouldn't need the amount of hearts it gives you if the enemies were a little more balanced). but make me dislike the game, and i dont mean its boring i mean if they made the crazy pumpkin and the water ghost things slower and gave you less hearts with a slight heart modifier at the end its balance issues would be fixed.","timestamp_created":1593097466,"timestamp_updated":1593097466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwicaA9vICdN+KkAI="}
