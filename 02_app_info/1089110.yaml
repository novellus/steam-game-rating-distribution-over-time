      village used to be a quiet place where the gnomes lived happily without a care
      in the world. Then one day, Akuyaku the evil immortal vampire gnome came around.
      He enjoys wreaking havoc and inflicting chaos wherever he goes. No one is safe
      from his constant annoyance!<br>The king ordered the court''s grand mage to
      devise a solution to permanently stop the calamity of Akuyaku.<br>By invoking
      the powerful magic of the ancients, the mage materialized an imposing magical
      diamond.<br>With its great powers of vampire gnome somnolence, the diamond succeeded
      in making Akuyaku asleep without interruption for years.<br>But the mage had
      better things to do and forgot to maintain the diamond, and little by little
      it lost its power as the seasons went by.<br>Now, with the diamond depleted,
      Akuyaku wakes up again, fully restored by a good nap and with a plan in his
      head.<br>With a mighty vampire spell, the diamond was split into several shards
      that got sent to the most unreachable places around the kingdom.<br>The gnomes
      got lost trying to retrieve the shards, and now Risu, the flying squirrel, is
      the only hope for gathering all the shards back together (and maybe the lost
      gnomes).<br>Let the adventure of Risu, the flying squirrel, begin.  Release
      the Musasabi!'

    review: Great little platformer with crisp graphics and catchy chiptunes that
      really shines when it comes to movement options and pace. Good design and fair
      challenge abound, although it is a bit short.
