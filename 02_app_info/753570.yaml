    about_the_game: <strong>Overview</strong><br><br>[ The Theme ]<br><br>Rogue Buddies
      features our 4 mercenaries; Maximus (assault and grenade specialist), Smoke
      (heavy gunner and rocket launcher), Alpha Tech (shield and drones) and Duster
      (jumping ninja and katana) on their quest for gold and revenge against the evil
      Company. The game is a 2D action platformer shooter, reminiscent of the classic
      platform games such as Metroid, MegaMan and others. The game features tons of
      levels, filled with puzzles and enemies to eliminate. <br><br>[ Environment
      ]<br><br>Not only will the buddies face danger in an infested jungle, they will
      also visit lost cities, epic tunnels and the center of the earth. You will cross
      ruins, swim in the depths of caverns and scale the gold carved mountains of
      the Aztec jungle. <br><br>[ Storyline ]<br><br>The 4 Buddies are on a quest
      for gold but they will be soon interrupted by their former evil corporate bosses
      and also a savage intruder. Maximus and his team will be caught off-guard and
      trapped by the natives. Your quest is to save your crew, gather as much gold
      and take revenge on the evil Company.<br><br>[ Enemies ]<br><br>Regular henchmens,
      heavy gunners, blockers (that prevent you from accessing certain areas), the
      natives (that are quick and hard to kill) and of course the 4 Company Bosses.  <br><br>[
      Missions / Level design ]<br><br>There are over 50 levels (main and side-objectives).
      Each level can be completed with a level of stars, which are needed to unlock
      certain areas on the map. In each level you will be confronted with puzzles,
      requiring each of the character's special skills, swapping back and forth between
      your buddies.<br><br>[ Vehicles]<br><br>In the game there will be 3 types of
      vehicles (Bike, Chopper, Skiboat), that will require the player to find the
      key in that level. In some levels, the vehicle is necessary to complete the
      stage, whereas in other levels it is optional.
