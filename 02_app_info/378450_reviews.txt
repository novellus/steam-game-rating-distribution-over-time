The visuals are crisp and colourful and the soundtrack is great; it fits the action perfectly.  It's fun bunching up a load of robots around one of the explosive barrels and taking them all out with a well-timed shot. I can imagine the game would get a bit repetitive after extended play; best enjoyed in short bursts. Worth a try.","timestamp_created":1456309770,"timestamp_updated":1456309770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.433140873908996582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8fK0idMCfYLcUQ=="}
