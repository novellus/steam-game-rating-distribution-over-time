The missions are interesting and well made. It takes a diffrerent view on the CS genre, setting it in a singleplayer scenario. It's well polished, and i rarely encountered any game breaking  bugs, or any glitches that bothered me. The game can offer quite a challenge in it's hidden nightmare mode, but some levels, even on a normal difficulty are quite punishing.","timestamp_created":1610193166,"timestamp_updated":1610193166,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw67u/8/YCerHkwQI="}
