    review: 'Quite a short, weird, abstract walking simulator.

      Great soundtrack and a strange world. Oddly beautiful.


      However I cannot recommend this game at all due to it''s terrible controls,
      movement and unpolished feel, for example your cursor going off-screen.


      The world is badly designed in my opinion, the developer didn''t properly explain
      things through the game play/world, making you go places you weren''t supposed
      to go or come to a road-block where you don''t understand what you''re supposed
      to do.

      No real story to speak off and the game feels extremely unpolished. It feels
      like the developer didn''t put that much work into.

      I''m not saying they didn''t put work into it, but when you leave it a mess
      it certainly feels like it.

      They built it and decided to leave the rough edges.

      They put the food on the plate but decided it wasn''t necessary to clean up
      the plate after the fact.


      I really do enjoy these walking simulator games. I love weird and abstract games
      but do not expect me to give your game any love when you leave it unfinished
      with terrible controls and bugs that are simple to fix, like the cursor going
      off-screen.


      I wish the developer had just taken the time to polish the game up after it
      was made...
