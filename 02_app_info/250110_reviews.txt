With multiple characters each with unique weapons and play strategies AAC caters to all play styles. \n\nThe difficulty ramps nicely, the stages have unique gimmicks and layouts, and the bosses are the right kind of challenging. The final zone was definitely tough and multiple stages took a few tries before I got through them, but overall AAC is a well-balanced arcade style twin stick shooter.\n\nI had a blast with this. Buy it.","timestamp_created":1609729935,"timestamp_updated":1609729935,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46bDY5fYCea2jwAI="}
