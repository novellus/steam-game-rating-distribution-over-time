He is just a normal nice guy who likes to drink women's blood.  I couldn't figure out if he needed to drink blood for his anemia, or if it was just some type of fetish.  Making the movie about his homicidal blood drinking friend would have been more interesting.\n\nVery slow and no fright factor as far as I could tell.  I don't recommend.","timestamp_created":1478317999,"timestamp_updated":1478317999,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.669589996337890625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4udCnmdgCf7DoZA=="}
