Although it didn't have a tremendous number of reviews, the premise and mechanics seemed interesting, so I decided to give it a shot. It doesn't hurt that it often goes on sale for a dollar, either.\n\nDespite a few irritations, I ended up enjoying my time with the game quite a bit. I found it to be engaging and tense, with an awesome soundtrack.\n\nAlthough you technically \"could\" play the game as a twitchy quick kill/quick death shooter, you'll likely spend most of your time sending out \"clones\" and controlling possessed enemies. The distance that you are able to send out your clone and the duration of possession are both determined by your \"energy.\" This energy can be recharged at electrical boxes in the levels, but I found it much more effective and rewarding to refill my energy through killing multiple enemies as a clone. \n\nAfter your possessed enemy is killed, the game typically rewards your efforts with a partial refill of your energy bar. The more effective your stint as the possessed enemy, the more energy you are rewarded with. Therefore, I found it exhilarating to frantically move my possessed enemy around, looking for enemies to dispatch and weapons to equip. I was personally a fan of shotguns, although they typically dropped with only 2-3 shells.\n\nIn this way, the game allows players to feel the tension of a Hotline Miami-style game without the painful level-restart failures. If your possessed enemy dies, you may be out some energy, but you generally won't need to start the level over again (unless you left your body out in the open). There were certainly times where the game got difficult and I had to take matters into my own hands, but this wasn't tremendously common.\n\nIn addition to the loop of possessing enemies, you're given a few abilities to play with. One allows you to detonate your clone, one allows your clone to walk through walls, and one allows you to teleport to your clone. Outside of using the detonate once when I acquired the ability and walking through walls in one level that seemed to demand it, I used none of these abilities. However, I did try and use the \"chain kill\" ability (a fourth ability) as often as possible. I never really understood exactly how this ability worked, but it seemed to somehow kill enemies that were close in proximity to each other whenever I activated it.\n\nMy issues with the game included the lack of a finisher, some issues with multiple actions being linked to the same button, and the size of the levels. \n\nYou can punch enemies to knock them on the ground and pick up their weapon, but there is no way (that I found) to finish them off while they're on the ground. Therefore, they will get up again soon, run to the closest weapon, and re-engage. The only way I found to deal with this was to grab the enemy weapon and stand there, waiting for them to get up. Once the enemy was back on his feet, I put him back down permanently with bullets. However, it feels REALLY bad to just stand there waiting for an enemy to get up while your energy constantly drains due to the possession.\n\nAnother issue, though not as irritating as the previous one I mentioned, is that (at least using keyboard and mouse) the same button (right click) is used to pick up weapons and refill my energy at an electrical box. Therefore, I had to do this dance to move guns away from the box before I could refill my energy.\n\nThe last issue is that the maps are perhaps a bit too large. Developer Sleepy Studios notes that this allows the player a lot of freedom, but I also found that the open space increased the chances that I'd get shot from off-screen (Superstatic doesn't have a \"look\" command like Hotline Miami) and made it difficult to locate the exit in each map.\n\nIf you generally like these quick kill/quick death shooters, Superstatic adds an interesting twist to the mix that's worth checking out. However, I'd recommend playing only a level or two at a time due to the tension inherent in the experience.","timestamp_created":1563377141,"timestamp_updated":1563377369,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.459110468626022339","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+q+jgOwCf6rHzgE="}
