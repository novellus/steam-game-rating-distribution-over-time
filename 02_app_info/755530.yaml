      \ and a factory that combines them all: that's what's waiting for you in Factorybelts\
      \ 2. Factorybelts is a puzzle game where you complete a factory to produce different\
      \ products out of different resources. Route the freight via conveyor belts,\
      \ cut it with saws, colorize it and weld the pieces back together.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nThe game works similar to various other factory simulation games in\
      \ that you have a build and a run mode. Edit the factory in build mode: place\
      \ or remove machines, thereby building up an assembly line. Once you're done,\
      \ hit that start button to raise the factory to life and watch your products\
      \ being built. Whenever things aren't working out, just stop the simulation\
      \ and correct the setup as many times as you need to.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures\

      \ the graphics themselves are 3D and the factory can be orbited 360\xB0.<br\
      \ />\r\n- Puzzles are defined in a budget manner rather than in an inventory\
      \ manner, which means you have a limited amount of funds and machines have a\
      \ cost, rather than giving you access to a set amount of specific machines.\
      \ This will potentially lead to different approaches to solving a level, being\
      \ rewarded with different scores based on the used budget.<br />\r\n- The resources\

    review: I tried it out. I think it is a fun little game. I love games like this
      but, As of now there really isn't enough direction I guess. Cant turn the music
      off, the mouse pointer covers up the description of the parts you need to put
      down. just small things. But I did refund but will keep my eye on this game
      for updates and improvements. I think if they work on it, it could be a really
      good game.
