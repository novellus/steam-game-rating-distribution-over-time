    review: 'So, right off the bat, I''ll mention that I enjoyed the game, but the
      unskippable credits (you also can''t leave the game or pause or anything) leaves
      a bit of a sour taste in my mouth.  I didn''t even realize it was unskippable
      the first time because I watched it all, but the second time, I really had no
      desire to wait for five minutes with nothing to do.


      So, that taken care of, I enjoyed the game.  It took me two hours for the main
      game and two hours for the New Game+ mode.  I enjoyed both and thought that
      the mechanics were quite neat.  It felt like it did a good job introducing new
      mechanics and then exploring them.  And it moved on to the next thing before
      you got bored.  I didn''t really get the ending, but otherwise, I recommend
      it.'
