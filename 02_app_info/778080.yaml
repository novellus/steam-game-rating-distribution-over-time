    review: "I have to not recommend this game at all. It's a shame because the game\
      \ looks interesting and I saw an update that recently happen in NOVEMBER 2019,\
      \ after reading all the comments people posted and the reviews I had some hope\
      \ but when I launched the game I repeat literally nothing happened. Sure the\
      \ game loaded up, but that was it... the keyboard/controller for this game doesn't\
      \ work at all, I was spamming all the buttons on my keyboard and all I found\
      \ to work with the game is NumPad plus+ (which just speeds up the game from\
      \ 30-60 fps to over 100+ frames per second) and the F1, to F12 worked... I tried\
      \ disconnecting, restarting steam, the common solutions and still nothing just\
      \ stuck at the main menu which for some reason now does a weird BASS BOOST.\
      \ Please fix this the state of this game before releasing it on steam, it's\
      \ not even funny bad, same goes with the port being terrible, having to save\
      \ state which I thought people was making up, but no you actually have to save\
      \ state and besides that again controls not even working... disappointed and\
      \ requesting a refund. \n\nAnother thing I want to mention is the god damn price\
      \ of the game, who thought \xA310.29 is a great deal/price for this game, it's\
      \ an old game from the 90's for starters a lot of them are usually around 3.99\
      \ or slightly more secondly the sale which is half price should be at least\
      \ 3.99 or a bit cheaper, if you want to make money make the game cheaper, fix\
      \ the problems people are having, do better sales there are so many things you\
      \ can do to make the game better.\n\nI'm keeping the old post here, because\
      \ I was quite negative with the game... But I purchased it again on sale (for\
      \ Christmas 2020) the current price drop they've put it on which is \xA33.60\
      \ Is a bargain. The game works, at last it's improved, no longer looking like\
      \ an emulation, just an classic game. As you can see many people haven't updated\
      \ their post, but I'm going to update mine. Couple of things I didn't like is\
      \ the fact, that you can't adjust the settings slightly, there's a bit of slow\
      \ down but no frame drop, which could just be cause it's old game and also it's\
      \ emulated so what do you expect? The ps1 memory card issue has finally been\
      \ fixed, controls are finally working, you can customise your controls in game\
      \ or the menu, which the menu is quite useful to customise. Overall this game\
      \ has been improved, and I do recommend it for the hard work they've finally\
      \ done and didn't leave it to rot like companies do. Another thing is it gives\
      \ you various options on the main menu, which you can change the to stretch\
      \ the screen, have it windowed, even old TV effects which is nice. I don't like\
      \ the two borders on both side of the game though, was hoping I could just have\
      \ full stretched screen to make it like a proper ps1 game and not obvious it's\
      \ emulated/kinda arcadey."
