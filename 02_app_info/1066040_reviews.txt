Maybe they're on a timer? It's certainly not explained in-game.\n\nCrucial controls are missing - to my constant irritation, I couldn't find a way to delete any but the most recently placed obstacle.\n\nAlso, some levels contain moving platforms. The par solution usually involves them, and they unfortunately slow down the game immensely. Speed controls could have circumvented this issue.\n\nUltimately, despite my numerous misgivings about the game, I still found it reasonably enjoyable. It's just unfortunate that it falls far short of its potential due to some minor omissions.","timestamp_created":1594546992,"timestamp_updated":1608579074,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/Ziyw/YCc5zilAI="}
