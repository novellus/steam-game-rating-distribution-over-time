There are some quirks regarding the cursor, but this can be mitigated by clicking and dragging whilst terraforming.\n\nThe graphics are obviously an upgrade from the 16-bit Populous titles, and the ability to form flat areas quickly is a big plus.\n\nI'm 2 & 1/2 hours and 7% into the game (never mind what Steam is reporting, since the game can be played without opening the Steam client) and I'm still having a good time. It's becoming more difficult, but so far it has not been unfair.\n\nAlso, to whoever was saying all the AI factions only target you, I don't think that's the case, as I've seen other factions getting destroyed without my involvement.\n\nThis game is worth the low price, imo!","timestamp_created":1609987108,"timestamp_updated":1609987108,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyrWt7fYCeuiVwQI="}
