However the project seems a little abandoned. What I mean is, there is one level with a single bossfight, you press continue & you're warped back to the homescreen. \n\n I've seen other content displayed in this game than what I have experienced through reviewers & through mild-investigation I found there was a beta build of this game, and perhaps that is where those other levels come from, not entirely sure. \n\nThe game in its current state & no hope for further development makes this game a hard recommend for $11.99. Especially when I beat the game twice & I've only clocked in about a half hour.  I should have heeded the red flag of this game being in early access since 2017. Steer clear of this game.","timestamp_created":1593746890,"timestamp_updated":1593746890,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw0fOtifMCcqWukgI="}
