    review: "- Unfair levels, \n- bad menu ekeys (esc make undo last option changed\
      \ and made uncomfortable to exit of the menu)\n- clumsy character\n- bad camera\
      \ movement\nthe idea is great but these fails make the game a little worse,\
      \ i'd love top play without these fails, would be a great and funny game\n"
