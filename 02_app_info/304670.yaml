      \ variability in play, upgrades and a tactical challenge that requires managing\

      \ Command is a decidedly fun time that can take as little or as much time as\
      \ you\u2019d like. It\u2019s easy to play, quick to jump into and loads of fun.\u201D\

      Aeon Command is a surprisingly in-depth strategy game despite it being easy\
      \ to play.  I found myself playing match after match, just so I could throw\
      \ points into my fleet upgrades to see how much of a difference it makes.\u201D\
