All five songs came in as soon as I logged off and updated Rocksmith. For those, like me, who don't know, when you buy the DLC, make sure Rocksmith has a chance to update. I was so excited that I bought them and logged in the game and wondered where they were at. Simple mistake and update took ten seconds. Love this band and always have been a fan since the 90's! \n\n\"3AM\" DOES need a Capo. The only downside I can think of is that Rocksmith 2014 isn't really optimized for Capo use. I tune it correctly using the precision tuner and the second after I put the capo in the right spot, it doesn't recognize the half-step tuning difference. Sometimes I had to loosen the Capo a bit for some strings, other strings were tuned fine already. Even during the song, some strings were fine while others were having trouble. \n\nBottom line is that I would certainly recommend this DLC to any post-grunge fan looking to get their fix on a great band! Remember to update Rocksmith 2014 after the purchase to see your songs if it's not already on auto-updates. Make sure you have a capo and make sure you're ready to log hours into this game after getting this DLC!","timestamp_created":1414522698,"timestamp_updated":1414522698,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.699175477027893066","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwke+HrMkCecqrMA=="}
