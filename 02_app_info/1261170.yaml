    review: "This game is basically the exact same game as the first one, but with\
      \ much more darker words as the answers. It still is VERY VERY SHORT. I completed\
      \ it in 17 minutes as you can see above. If you make a game like this, then\
      \ please... add way more words or then make the words randomized! This isn't\
      \ that much of a waste of money though, since it's only a few cents (at least\
      \ when it's on sale.) I still would've liked to use to cents to buy something\
      \ else. \n\nTL;DR: It's way too short. It's also darker than the original."
