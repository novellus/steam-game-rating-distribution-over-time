I played just the training mission and got frustrated with in minutes! i could not target the bot ship what so ever as it just ran rings around me.  It looks ok graphically and sounds are also ok but there are much better games out there than this one where you can actually move your ship fast enough to target! At its current state its not worth the bother.   I got this at Â£1.24 so maybe ill come back after playing some other slow games lol and try again and review again....","timestamp_created":1545856761,"timestamp_updated":1545856761,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yseP9ucCeJvCtgE="}
