    review: "Sepia Tears was the first ever game I had in my library ever since I\
      \ started out in Steam. Looking back, I have a treasure trove full of fond memories\
      \ as I unraveled the mysteries between Mark and Myra. And now, 5 years later,\
      \ I went back to revisit the story that made me love the visual novel genre\
      \ as a whole. Reading through the stories in the Reprise Edition, I could notice\
      \ the lack of remastered art for Lukas, Rin, and Lillian, because I did not\
      \ count the beautiful CGs as part of those. \n\nIt's very awkward to look at\
      \ remastered Myra talking to Rin, Lukas or Lillian when their art is still outdated.\
      \ If there is a reason why the devs decided to continue on like that then I'll\
      \ just try to understand it.\n\nAs for the extra writing, I think it still has\
      \ the same magic that made me fall in love 5 years ago, and even today. The\
      \ only downside however, is that the realization that those 3 stories are the\
      \ only ones we will ever get, and Mark and Myra's story has now concluded. I\
      \ wish for more, dear writers. It's just so good.\n\nMaybe I'll try supporting\
      \ the studio's other works this time. I can't stay rooted to this VN forever.\
      \ \n\nBut still. Thank you so much, Scarlet String Studios, for making such\
      \ an incredibly written visual novel. I will always treasure this forever."
