    reviews: "\u201CImprobable Soccer is still in its infancy and shows something\
      \ to file. In any case, it can potentially be a really interesting title because\
      \ it offers a light-hearted version of football. The gameplay suitable for everyone\
      \ is simple, immediate and direct. You don't have to be a football fan to enjoy\
      \ this title: the rules are simple, run, move, roll, jump, hit the ball and\
      \ score.  The title offers the best of itself when played in the company both\
      \ in presence and online and it is clear that with the necessary precautions,\
      \ Cyberlab Studios can aim high. It goes without saying that we await further\
      \ updates on gameplay and content. We are sure that with some adjustments we\
      \ could talk about something sensational.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.ilvideogioco.com/2020/07/12/improbable-soccer-e-disponibile-su-steam/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >IlVideogioco</a><br><br>\u201CThe gaming\
      \ experience at the moment is limited because it is a bit cumbersome to have\
      \ fun in company, but the good thing is that with remote play it is not necessary\
      \ for everyone to have the game. Undeniably, it's still an incomplete product\
      \ and needs some tweaking (and updating), but the base is good and has a lot\
      \ of potential. Playing alone can become a bit repetitive in a matter of minutes,\
      \ but if you have someone to involve, laughter and fun are guaranteed, even\
      \ if you miss an empty goal or score an own goal.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.gamingitaliano.it/2020/07/12/improbable-soccer-provato/\"\
