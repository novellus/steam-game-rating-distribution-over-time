      the lack of difficulty options, this game can be difficult for beginners. Therefore,
      in this game, you can hold down Special button (C by default) to enable Auto

    short_description: This is a fan-made Touhou shmup with one single stage, similar
      to the extra stage of official Touhou games. This game has an auto dodging system,
      which gives you a choice to ignore all the danmaku and only focus on the story.
