    review: "Allmost all of these tables are great and fun.  Safe Cracker is a little\
      \ strange but not terrible. Women might be turned off by it. The womens voice\
      \ goes oooohhh an ahhhh in Ecstasy. Because the computer is supposed to be a\
      \ women.  Xenon is an older table however I did enjoy it even though its an\
      \ older table. Its got some charm. Red and Ted's Roadshow is a lot of fun. \
      \ Great looking and sounding table. Addams Family is another solid pinball table\
      \ its very well done. Thank you Thing. \n\nCyclone is a classic. Great table\
      \ and good flow and I love the sounds. Ride the ferris wheel. Party Zone\u2122\
      , Earthshaker are both solid tables. The party zone guy with the mustache looks\
      \ like the guy on mythbusters. Jack*Bot is a strange version of pinbot just\
      \ updated. Its still good just a little strange.\n\nStarship troopers is a tough\
      \ table.  I have recently gotten better at Troopers. I now use both right flippers\
      \ to move the ball around. It makes a huge difference. I have them both the\
      \ right flippers set to one button. Makes the table a lot more easy to score\
      \ points.The flippers are very far apart and the outlanes are very easy to drain\
      \ balls into. Games are over very quickly unless you really shake rattle and\
      \ roll on this table. This table to me is the second  weakest  of the bunch.\
      \  I did like the high score pictures  you can select from and the tri flippers\
      \ are fun. Its probably the toughest table in this pack. Good value if you enjoy\
      \ modern tables as this one only has Xenon as the oldest table and even that\
      \ one still feels modern.\n\nPhantom of the Opera looks and sounds great. Its\
      \ a ball eater though. Unless you shake and rattle and roll your not going to\
      \ get very far in this table. Its designed for you to lose your balls as quickly\
      \ as possible. Several shots are dead shots. The ramp in the upper right hand\
      \ corner is almost always a dead shot down the middle. The middle magic mirror\
      \ is designed to make your ball go down the center. \n\nIts also a little confusing\
      \ on how to get the mutiplyer. Instead of matching the 3 top lanes you instead\
      \ need to hit the magic mirror that is designed to steal your ball if you make\
      \ a bad shot. This is one of those tables that looks great sounds great. Flow\
      \ is mostly on the silled expert side. Even more so then Star ship troopers\
      \ and that table is made  to lose balls. Not for new people starting out. Phantom\
      \ and Troopers are made for the top pinball players. In my opinion. The rest\
      \ are solid and are newbie friendly."
