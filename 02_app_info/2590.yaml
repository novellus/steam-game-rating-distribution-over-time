    reviews: '&quot;Alpha Prime demanded something more of me than most other first-person
      shooter action games on the market. I couldn''t just waltz into a room juggling
      grenades with my guns blazing and expect to survive. I had to bring my brain
      back out of retirement and think, aim, and act tactically.&quot;<br><br>- <a
