I'm gonna keep an eye on SKY HOUR WORKS cuz their games are hidden gems though.\n\nI went into this game with... mediocre expectations. It had only positive reviews instead of very positive or overwhelmingly positive and only a few people had reviewed or played it. It's honestly a little wacky that a game with 93% positive reviews is only \"positive\" on steam. Anyway, I had played SPACE / MECH / PILOT and was interested in the rest of Project: Natura, so I bought it anyway cuz it was cheap (it was on sale when I bought it). I was honestly expecting another meh steam visual novel out of the ocean of them.\n\nSo buying this was a good idea. I'm not big on visual novels, but I love this game. It's a lovely little visual novel and it actually does a great job setting up the series. It has the same high quality storytelling and art as SPACE / MECH / PILOT which is just amazing. It makes some stuff in S/M/P make sense now that I've played the first game in the series, and I love the concept of the entire series. I am absolutely invested in this series now!\n\nIt's a bite sized story and it takes maybe an hour and a half to 100% all the achievements. You can do it in one sitting, but you can also save so that's nice. Choices also actually matter, which was kinda unexpected. I figured they'd have less effect than they do. This game also did something fairly rare for games. It made me unironically laugh. Sure, I laugh at bugs and things all the time, but this game had a joke that actually made me chuckle out loud. It's a little hard to say anything else without spoilers, so just play it. This game was a pleasant surprise, and it was a great first game for 2021!\n\nAlso: Lord Gaben please allow full profile options on both this and SPACE / MECH / PILOT I need the achievement \"Be Gay. Do Crimes.\" on my steam profile.","timestamp_created":1609916110,"timestamp_updated":1609916110,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwy8qe6/YCftz2wAI="}
