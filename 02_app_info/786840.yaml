    review: "[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers [/h1]\n\n\
      Well, it was only $1.59 USD down the drain during the Steam summer sale. This\
      \ game is not good, at all. It supposedly does one thing: RC track racing, and\
      \ some other surprises in this sandbox 90's style bedroom. Unfortunately, this\
      \ game gets absolutely nothing right.\n\nSad, because I think there might be\
      \ a good game idea here, but it's executed poorly, even for EA. The RC racing\
      \ is terrible. You basically remote control your racer around the track, highlight\
      \ all the areas of the track, and boom you get a spray can. That might sound\
      \ fun, but it isn't in this game. See, the controls are awful. \n\nIf you want\
      \ a fun RC racer in VR, try My RC Buggy! VR. Those are the types of controls\
      \ that you want. Not this crap. It's hard to even do one lap. You go as slow\
      \ as possible as to not run off the track as the controls are way too sensitive.\
      \ It's boring, frustrating, and not fun at all. \n\nYou have to put a cartridge\
      \ in the OG Nintendo to get the tracks to show up. A chair is in the way of\
      \ the track by design for reasons unknown. You teleport around the small room\
      \ into 5-6 nodes. So you need a full roomscale setup just to reach everything.\
      \ I think you can also shoot a basketball at a hoop which is also pretty awful.\
      \ I think you can also throw trash into the trash bin. Turn on the radio. Grab\
      \ the coffee cup. Did I miss something?\n\nOh well, probably doesn't matter.\
      \ I had low expectations and since I only paid $1.59 I won't refund. But I hope\
      \ the devs truly work on updating this game and make it a pleasant experience.\
      \ I would love to change my No recommendation because I think there's a good,\
      \ relaxing VR experience here to be had. But I won't be holding my breath, it\
      \ seems like the entire game needs to be reworked. Game needs full locomotion,\
      \ more stuff to do, better RC controls ... a reason to play. \n\nRate 4/10.\
      \ Good idea, poorly executed."
