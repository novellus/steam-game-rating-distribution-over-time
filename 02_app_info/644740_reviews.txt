Simple but nice!\nI think I lost couple of pounds on my first session :D When you hear the monster right besides you,  you get this adrenaline rush and you start running even faster. Love that feeling. Also it's cool that I can run forward and look behind to see where the monster is.\nHolding the grip to run was a bit uncomfortable at first, so you have to get use to it (update on that would be a good thing).\n\nReally looking forward on what the developers have to offer in the future.","timestamp_created":1496400640,"timestamp_updated":1496400640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534101665019989014","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgLebtNwCc9TGeg=="}
