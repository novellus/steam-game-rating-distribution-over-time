No music, no ambient sounds nor sounds by monsters, no settings including basic key remap and no support for high-DPI monitors (I'd expect even laziest flip to get this right and suprisingly even laziest games I tested don't botch this...). Overpriced even at 35 â‚¬ cents.","timestamp_created":1609968834,"timestamp_updated":1609968834,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3drn7PYCd/GOwQI="}
