    about_the_game: "You are Fish Glutton.\_ Eat as many fish as you can while defeating\
      \ monster bosses who will stop at nothing to keep you hungry. Beware of the\
      \ evil red laced fish that kill on contact.\_<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game brings\
      \ up an experience full of digital homemade art and music where you will be\
      \ able to discover a great variety of fish, monsters and hand-drawn underwater\
      \ landscapes as you progress through the entire game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring\
      \ all the levels in the game, you will be controlling Fish Glutton, a clown\
      \ fish, driving him through different 2D landscapes full of different fish and\
      \ monsters.  Depending on the fish edges color, you should eat it by touching\
      \ it, or avoid it by not touching it or not letting them touch you(refer to\
      \ the legend/map below). <br />\r\nYou can attack boss monsters by throwing\
      \ a trash can at them, which starts spawning only when fighting a monster boss.\
      \  Make sure to touch the trash can on time because it will leave it you ignore\
      \ it and will have to wait until another trash can spawn. <br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nYou win each level if you reach the end of each one of them with at least\
      \ one life.  You beat the entire game once you passed all 40 levels.<br />\r\
