    review: 'Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be7iKVNx1JM

      Take everything from Brigand Oaxaca and amplify them to the next level. Brigand
      Panama is a huge improvement over the base game in every aspect. The narrative
      is much more engaging and keeps the sprinkle of bizarre that was in Oaxaca.
      Every character has their own personality and backstory that is just as interesting
      as the main narrative. Brigand Panama brings in a lot more dialogue between
      npcs which helps get you attached and care for them. On the downside, you''ll
      be hurt emotionally when they die from an enemy. There are many new things to
      play around with such as different rockets and grenades, flowers for stat boosts,
      traps, new enemies, new skills, and areas that flow well with each other.


      The biggest improvements that the dlc brings are making the stats that sucked
      in Oaxaca more viable such as stealth and melee. No more instant death from
      enemies expect for one case with a boss. And, I have to mention again, the character
      development of other characters is so much better. The world feels a lot more
      dynamic because of it.


      The only downside that I can think of is that some areas feel less optimized
      for performance than others and I encountered a bit more technical issues in
      Panama than I did in Oaxaca.


      If you enjoyed Brigand Oaxaca, you''ll like Brigand Panama a whole lot more.'
