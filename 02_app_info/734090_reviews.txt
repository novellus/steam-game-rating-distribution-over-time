From the intuitive UI to the easy-to-pick-up gameplay, this is the kind of game you can just turn on while your friends are sitting around your living room trying to make conversation. \"What's this\" they'll say as you boot the game. \"Why, it's Moon Bus\" you'll reply with a wry smile. And that's all the explanation you'll need.\n\nDespite the game's simple design and structure, it's surprisingly challenging to play with ease, and once you throw three other players in there, chaos ensues. Wonderful, joyus chaos.\n\nBuy this game. It's a labour of love, and will keep you coming back. Well worth the value.","timestamp_created":1567804521,"timestamp_updated":1567804521,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4os+bhO0Ce4rk0QE="}
