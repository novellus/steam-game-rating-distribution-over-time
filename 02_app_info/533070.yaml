    review: 'This was a lot of fun. It''s an older game, but high quality, set in
      a wonderful fantasy world (in a no surprises but makes you smile at all the
      tropes kind of way). There''s a dark lord rising, and only you can stop the
      world from returning to cursed slavery under his dominion.  I hadn''t expected
      to enjoy myself so much!


      Pros:

      - nothing really special story-wise, but feels complete

      - customize the level for extra challenge

      - the right number of interesting and moderately challenging HO scenes

      - a variety of puzzles, a few that are challenging

      - nice art, perfect for that old school D&D - er, fantasy - vibe

      - interactive map that shows you rooms where the collectable item (owl) has
      been found (nice and clear)

      - enough back-tracking to be interesting, not enough to be annoying

      - you can interact with the whole map throughout

      - things that make sense generally work; some items can be used more than once

      - items in HO scenes are not "hidden" in darkness or brown colours


      Cons:

      - only in-game achievements (but decent ones with a bonus for collecting all)

      - lower resolution (but full screen worked fine)

      - limited music

      - no bonus chapter and little in the way of true bonuses (can''t replay scenes
      / puzzles etc)


      [b]Overall:[/b]  I liked it and found it very well made.  It has limited voice
      acting, and isn''t a "collector''s edition" in terms of what we''re used to
      4-5 years later, but it was fun.  I would (and will) buy it for my friends and
      family who enjoy these games. A great game to play when you''re looking for
      "comfort gaming" (if you enjoy fantasy settings).'
