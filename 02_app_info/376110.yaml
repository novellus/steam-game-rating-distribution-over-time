    review: 'Pros: still looks pretty decent

      Cons:

      * chapter 3 has a digital lock - do not leave the screen before solving it,
      otherwise game gets stuck and not work properly.

      * Simon says puzzle takes too long.


      Otherwise an okay title, but the plot is thinner than a human hair'
