Fighting is pretty fun, weapons/powerups are cool, leveling/upgrading/trading is good too, but very soon after the initial experiences, bad things started to come up.\nFirst of all, the world is pretty much empty. Aside for looking for adequately-leveled enemies and upgrades, you have no reason to explore the world. Stations are modelled after several templates and therefore most of them looks mostly the same. There is nothing to collect, find, or anything. Offered missions in ports are also very template-ish, so nothing super interesting.\nThe only thing saving this are the challenges present in the centre of each sub-world. Every one of them is different and makes the gameplay at least bit less the same. Some of them are somehow bit confusing, and in some I found myself aimlessly wandering and trying to hit all the triggers I encountered again i case I forgot something.\n\nSimply put: It is not terrible game, the base gameplay is fun, but for a game boasting with an open world, the possibilities are just too little.","timestamp_created":1531577933,"timestamp_updated":1602284238,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.659994840621948242","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwy6blh/UCduWEpgE="}
