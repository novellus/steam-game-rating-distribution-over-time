    review: "By design, one of the most cryptic games I ever played, but it does have\
      \ a compelling psychological narrative if you are willing to overcome the moon\
      \ logic. In the defense of the game, there are many creative and well-designed\
      \ puzzles, but sometimes you are stuck for 2 hours, doing some excessive backtracking\
      \ with limited visibility (assuming you can see at all). There is a section\
      \ where I walked for like 20 minutes in complete darkness which should give\
      \ you an idea of what kind of game it is. I completed the 'normal' difficulty\
      \ around 15 hours (with no hints), and as far as I can tell the madness difficulty\
      \ adds some new content. I was very close to rage quitting the game many times,\
      \ but the curiosity got the better of me.  It has a lot to offer in terms of\
      \ psychological mechanics and how you interact with the puzzles, arguably more\
      \ complex and thought-provoking than many games in the genre. Don't expect puzzle\
      \ logic, the hints will guide you maybe 25% of the time, there are many 'leap\
      \ of faith' moments where you find things by accident. \n\nYou will be very\
      \ disoriented in almost every location (I even got a headache a few times),\
      \ but the first area essentially works like a stage select, just not in a conventional\
      \ way. The game alternates between walking-simulator gameplay and difficult\
      \ platforming, and as you complete the stages, more levels will be available.\
      \ Also, it has a unique mechanic where you can interact with the world by closing\
      \ your eyes which could have all kinds of unexpected effects. Additionally,\
      \ you can make yourself smaller in order to squeeze into tiny places.  Not sure\
      \ what game I can compare it to, it's not exactly like the LSD: Dream Emulator,\
      \ but it falls into that category of exploring the faq out of your surroundings.\
      \ To say that this game is very atmospheric would be an understatement, it's\
      \ a complete mind ****** experience that genuinely made me delirious. Some of\
      \ the puzzles rely on sound, although I find that I can't use it properly, not\
      \ sure if I misunderstood the mechanics or if the sound levels are not balanced.\n\
      \n[i] Props to the developer for actually coming up with some unique ideas and\
      \ not just recycling what has been done in the past, I don't know how many people\
      \ will appreciate that cerebral aspect of the game though. I play a lot of games\
      \ in this genre that do something similar but not as good. Not sure how to describe\
      \ it properly, but it feels like the game explores anxiety on a much deeper\
      \ level. [/i]. \n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ pretty lengthy game (could take over\
      \ 10 hours with no hints)\n+ second difficulty changes some things\n+ lots of\
      \ creative puzzles that incorporate a unique mechanic \n+ very atmospheric,\
      \ occasionally funny,  interesting narrative \n+ achievements & secret areas\n\
      \n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\n[u] Exploration/Backtracking/Hints [/u] - I would\
      \ put some particle effects around the items that you can interact with, most\
      \ of them look like a prop unless you are looking directly over it. I know there\
      \ are checkpoints, but if you leave the stages you have to backtrack all the\
      \ way, I wish you could use checkpoints if they were already unlocked. As for\
      \ the hints, I think you should add more sticky notes, hide them if you have\
      \ to, some of the puzzles are way too cryptic dude - it feels like looking for\
      \ a particle of sugar on the beach. I am not sure if the sound puzzles are working\
      \ correctly, I never noticed any sudden changes in the soundtrack during the\
      \ eye mechanic, not enough to consider it a clue anyway. \n\n[u] Puzzle Design/Stage\
      \ design [/u] - the puzzle frustration was very sporadic, some of the \"easier\"\
      \ stages gave me more trouble than those near the end. For example, the stage\
      \ with 4 portals was pretty intuitive, you could logically beat it if you were\
      \ paying attention. Then you play a platforming stage (the one with the bright\
      \ fog), and you just have to 'leap of faith' in a few spots. The point being\
      \ is that some stages do a good job at hinting at the solution, where other\
      \ stages were too random with very useless hints. The one with the blood bath\
      \ was kinda misleading in my opinion, it gave me a hint toward the last puzzle\
      \ in the chain, sending me on a ghost chase. I think the game would be more\
      \ enjoyable if it was a bit more intuitive...\n\nOut of the 8 regular stages,\
      \ I enjoyed maybe 4 of them. The problem is that the first 3 platforming levels\
      \ were relatively dull when compared to some of the psychological highlights.\
      \ Now the last platforming stage had a lot going on thematically so it was significantly\
      \ better, I wish you maintained that level of creativity across the game. \n\
      \n[u] Technical Notes [/u] - every 90 minutes or so the game freezes after death,\
      \ it happened about 5 times. I also had a few Unreal Engine errors upon startup\
      \ crash but I forgot to copy them. I didn't have any performance issues, but\
      \ it uses a substation amount of GPU like most UE games (not sure if the optional\
      \ FPS cap would help). On a side note, is there a technical reason you have\
      \ to use the mouse scroll to change swimming depth? Should be toward the camera.\n\
      \n[b] Overall Thoughts: 7/10 [/b] \n\nOne of the most creative games I ever\
      \ played, more of an artwork than a game in a way (feels like self-expression),\
      \ but it comes at the price of extreme frustration with puzzles that can be\
      \ hard to digest. Don't get me wrong, I like cryptic exploration games, it was\
      \ just a bit too much - I was getting headaches because I spend so much time\
      \ in platforming stages with too much brightness. In the end, I am happy that\
      \ I finished the game, gives you that - \"Thank God this **** is over\" feeling,\
      \ in a good way (oh yeah, and then you unlock madness difficulty, nope). The\
      \ game is not for everyone, still one of my favorites just because it had so\
      \ many cool ideas. \n\n[code]Review By: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/\
