    review: 'When just jumping requires more focus on the player''s part than the
      dev put into the sound design, you know you done did bad. And the sound design
      is truly terrible. Not only are the tracks obnoxious but they completely change
      literally every ten seconds at least. And then there are the crappy controls
      that won''t even let you control jump height and left my hand aching after just
      a few minutes, crappy graphics, broken intro cutscene...


      Just. No.'
