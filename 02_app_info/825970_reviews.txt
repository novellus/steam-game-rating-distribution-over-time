This is going to sound harsh, but I hope the Devs find a way to use my negative review constructively to improve on future games. What a pile of unfinished and unplayable hot garbage this is. \n\nThis seems like it could be a fun game. If it would only work...\n\nI was puzzled by the lack of reviews for this title. I'm a sucker for cheap, indie games so I picked it up anyway and I've had nothing but problems with it. \n\nFirst, the opening text that sets up the story is a gigantic wall of text that made my eyes bleed. Paragraphs are your friend! Learn them, love them, use them! It was a huge pain to strain my eyes to read the text wall. But I did. Ugh. \n\nThis is supposed to based off true story which was intriguing. But the actual gameplay and mechanics were crap. \n\nThe controls were simple enough to understand. WASD or arrow keys for movement, click to shoot, space to jump, and a few other keys to swap weapons. I never got to swap any weapons so I'm not sure what they are. \n\nJust getting the game past the into screen should give you an achievement. I had to restart the game SIX times to get the intro screen to stop locking up the game. Oof. \n\nOnce you can actually get to the part where you play the game, everything is on high speed and it's impossible to navigate. \n\nSomething is clearly badly wrong with this game if it is working this poorly. It is in desperate need of performance patches and optimization tweaks. As it is: THIS IS NOT A FINISHED GAME. It's just some janky dumpster fire that someone put up for sale before completing the actual development stage. \n\nJust don't hold your breath for any patches or improvements. The last time it received any attention from the developer was one month after release, so it was basically dumped on Steam and abandoned.","timestamp_created":1583497227,"timestamp_updated":1583497355,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ474Pz1/ACd4q09gE="}
