    review: 'The fourth in the series, you are in Seven Oaks, ND, where a mysterious
      black smoke has taken over the town. This is the most recent missing place,
      yet, having only been in this state for a year. Can you solve the mystery behind
      this?


      The minigames are challenging, the HO scenes fun, and the plot engaging.'
