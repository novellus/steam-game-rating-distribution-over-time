    review: "[b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Puzzle Fans looking for a little relaxing\
      \ experience[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n6180 the Moon is an art piece that\
      \ still brings a reasonable puzzle challenge along with it. For a 4 dollar title,\
      \ you get a nice relaxing experience that not only has some good level design\
      \ that will challenge you with the mechanics it puts place, but one that will\
      \ put you in a zen state of mind, even if you get frustrated. While the biggest\
      \ problem it has is the games length (which lets be clear, seems appropriate\
      \ for the 4 dollar price tag), the strong presentation carries the game by making\
      \ it something you just want to look at, despite the limited color scheme. Mechanics\
      \ don't stick around for too long before moving on to the next one, and sometimes\
      \ you do have to think a little outside the box in order to move on in a stage.\
      \ All in all, if you're looking for something to test your mind but not stress\
      \ it, 6180 The moon is a solid pick up. \n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfHm0jJ2W2Q\n\
      \n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Solid puzzle elements that\
      \ introduce new mechanics in a timely fashion. Just as you master the last element,\
      \ you are introduced to a new one, or a shift in thinking to use it in a new\
      \ way. \n[*] Great presentation, using the limited color scheme to make it feel.\n\
      [*] Timing is tested here, and its in a good difficulty setting.\n[*] Pleasant\
      \ piano music really puts you in a relaxed mode. \n[*] The reversal of stages\
      \ on the way back shows some really good level design understanding and giving\
      \ a challenges. \n[*] Sound design is good, giving you the little hints you\
      \ need to react appropriate.\n[*] Animation is fluid. Yes, it's not that difficult\
      \ to get animation working, but hey, it stills is good. \n[*] The story is touching,\
      \ even in its simple, cute form. \n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]\
      \  Little hiccups with controls here and there on respawn. \n[*]  Story may\
      \ make you groan at times. It can be too cute.\n[*]  A little short. Would like\
      \ to see more given the big picture, although to be fair, at 4 bucks, that's\
      \ asking a lot. \n[/list]\n \n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding\
      \ games I've reviewed, visit my curator. [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/6861768/]Dragnix\
