    developer_response: 'Hey Amy, I''m sorry to hear you had a bad experience. The
      game is indeed very simple (after all, it''s a first solo-developer game for
      4.99$) but, to be fair, I''ve never considered that players would want to have
      an action relationship with monsters (killing them) in a Lovecraftian, horror
      game. Anyway, I found your critique on the repetition very interesting, because
      the objective stays the same only for the first two levels - the idea was to
      step up the difficulty adding the big fat creatures - that tells me that people
      get very annoyed by this and become frustrated immediately. I find this piece
      of critique very important and wanted to thank you for that.

      Once again, I''m sorry you had such a negative experience. I hope I''ll be able
      to change your mind with future updates!

      Have a good day!'

    review: very basic game, there is no way to kill the squids which makes the game
      near impossible to finish, and you end up doing the same thing every level,
      activating generators. its a no from me
