    developer_response: "Thank you for your feedback! We just released an update which\
      \ addresses some of your critiques.\n\n\"It's a bit like rolling a die to determine\
      \ if you'll randomly explode while playing Streets of Rage.\"\n\nWe'd like to\
      \ hear from players if there are some places that are too chaotic for their\
      \ own good. We are trying to find a balance between having funny unexpected\
      \ situations, but also giving the player a chance to react to them and use them\
      \ for his/her advantage. In this update, we reduced the bounciness of the ball\
      \ props to give the player a better chance to react to them, and removed some\
      \ of them from the mall level's sport shop.\n\n\"Another janky aspect of Vortex\
      \ is how you don't collide with enemies. At all. In several other beatemup titles,\
      \ walking into enemies automatically triggers a grab state without using a button.\
      \ In Vortex, you and the enemy can simply pass through each other. This can\
      \ make it harder to determine when you can actually grab the enemies, and I\
      \ generally found it to be far more effective to not even try.\"\n\nWe added\
      \ a traditional grappling mode where the player starts grappling when walking\
      \ into enemies. We forgot to mention in the tutorial section that it's easier\
      \ to succeed in grappling if the enemy is staggered first by punching him. We\
      \ added that hint to the tutorial, and worked on the gameplay guidance in general.\
      \ We added small video screens which demonstrate the most complex moves to the\
      \ first level, and loading screen and game over tips about undocumented features,\
      \ moves and strategies.\n\n\"Your general abilites are fairly standard. You\
      \ can run, jump, execute an attack string, and utilize a heavy attack, in addition\
      \ to the previously mentioned grab. All feel fine in execution, although I often\
      \ found myself wishing it was a bit easier to juggle enemies and thereby kill\
      \ them faster. Everyone (you and your foes) spend so much time lying on the\
      \ ground that it can get tedious waiting for everyone to get back up.\"\n\n\
      We reduced the time enemies and players spend lying on ground and slightly sped\
      \ up the rising animations. We also slightly reduced health from some of the\
      \ weakest enemies. On the hard difficulty levels, enemies' health is balanced\
      \ in a way that it is supposed to encourage the player to use and mix diverse\
      \ moves, like strong attacks, air attacks, grapples and air grapples instead\
      \ of relying on the basic combo strikes to beat them faster.\n\n\"At the moment,\
      \ Vortex of Pain has only 3 levels. However, the levels are not overly short,\
      \ and there're significant opportunities to test your skills in each one. If\
      \ I have any complaints regarding their structure (unrelated to how bland looking\
      \ they are), \nit's that each level feels fairly similar to me. Each starts\
      \ kinda easy, then gets hard up to about the same level of difficulty. If more\
      \ levels are added down the road, I hope the developers go back and adjust the\
      \ difficulty accordingly.\"\n\nWe are working on new levels, and we plan to\
      \ adjust the overall difficulty of the game throughout the project. The difficulty\
      \ was slightly adjusted in the new update\n(mostly by adding a few more enemies\
      \ and making some enemy types stronger) to make overall level of difficulty\
      \ higher as the game progresses. We'd love to hear more difficulty feedback\
      \ from players on the discussion board.\n\nFull patch notes: https://store.steampowered.com/newshub/app/887170/view/2896341257764404011"

    review: "Vortex of Pain is coming along, though I still don't think it's worth\
      \ full price for most people. There\u2019re only 3 levels, and there's alot\
      \ of jank. For example, I've died twice so far just from jumping. No nearby\
      \ explosions, full health, not falling out of the map or off of a ledge, immediate\
      \ death on landing from a normal jump. If you don't mind this kind of thing,\
      \ read on. Otherwise, wait for polish.\n\nVortex of Pain is a side-scrolling\
      \ beat-em-up with alot of unpolished physics interactions. Sometimes the interactions\
      \ are hilarious, as when everything or your enemies are blowing up and flying\
      \ everywhere. Other times, as mentioned above, you're dying for either no apparent\
      \ reason or for reasons that seem outside your control. There are mundane annoying\
      \ moments, like when a random enemy headbutts you out of nowhere and you're\
      \ forced to wait for your character to just get back up already before being\
      \ knocked down again, and there are awesome moments like when you find yourself\
      \ bouncing enemies in the air and against walls repeatedly.\n\nThe worst moments\
      \ haven't been bad enough to offset the fun ones. The environments are visually\
      \ distinct, if odd due to lower-end assets, and the enemy types feel different\
      \ from each other. There are standard large and small enemies, backflipping\
      \ ninja enemies, enemies that try to act like cars, mimes that grapple you...\
      \ there's at least 1 other indie beat-em-up I can think of (but won't mention)\
      \ that looks better but somehow lacks even this much enemy variety.\n\nPlayer\
      \ abilities feel fairly standard, and have been improved from when I first tried\
      \ the game. You can now automatically grab enemies when you walk into them,\
      \ which makes grappling far easier and useful over needing to rely on a grapple\
      \ button. The grappling button is still present, but I've always found it hard\
      \ to use.\n\nOverall, still fun if a little frustrating for the weird deaths.\
      \ Even if you don't buy today, I'd recommend keeping an eye on Vortex of Pain."
