    about_the_game: "The Rockwell B-1B Lancer\u2122, affectionately known as the &quot;Bone&quot;\
      \ to its crews, is a key element of the American Strategic Long Range bomber\
      \ fleet. The aircraft, while not technically stealth-capable, is designed to\
      \ present only a fraction of the radar profile of earlier large bomber types\
      \ and incorporates extremely advanced navigation, weapons, and avionics systems.\
      \ Its swing wing technology, combined with four 30,000-lb thrust turbofan engines,\
      \ creates a beautiful, fast, and instantly recognisable package. The development\
      \ of this successor to the B-52\u2122 began in the early 1960's and resulted\
      \ in a contract being awarded to Rockwell in 1970. The B-1A\u2122 first flew\
      \ in 1974 but only 3 prototypes were built. 1981 saw an order placed for a fleet\
      \ of 100 B-1Bs\u2122, the last of which were delivered in the early 1990's.<h2\

    review: Despite the reviews and the price, I do like this aircraft. The model,
      inside and out look good, and the sounds are even better. it look some time
      looking at the manual(highly recommend reading it) and trying things in order
      to get the autopilot working. Once I did it flew very well. The moving wings
      are smooth, and the bomb doors even open, but no bombs drop. Overall I love
      it
