If it's supposed to be so, then the developer should have added several options to adjust the NPC behavior like make it always blocking or jumping or performing a sequence of movements.\n  [*] A player's profile disappears after closing the game, that leads to disappearing of a gamepad custom configuration also.  Moreover, the game doesn't allow me to create a profile with the same name again although I don't see it and can't choose it.\n  [*] Uselessness of Grabs: you can just spam a Strike button, because Strikes break Grabs, then you dash or run away and spam the button again. Such the algorithm let me win the Battle Royal mode at the first attempt and apparently works well against other players. You'll never be in a situation where an enemy stuns you and then make a throw, because there is a cooldown after his hits which is longer than your stun, so it makes Grabs worthless (if the enemy uses environment that stuns you for a longer period, you will be already on the ground, so he won't be able to grab). To fix the issue the developer could change the rules: let a Grab button break other's Grabs. Then a player needs a good reaction to counter them and won't spam strikes.\n[/olist]\nFor me it's also confusing that:\n[list]\n  [*] There is no character customization, although NPCs appear with various color palettes.\n  [*] There are no regimes with ladders and tables in Singleplayer mode, although they are presented in the local multiplayer.\n[/list]\nDouble Turn has a potential and could become a good fighting, if there would be more characters, more special movements, and direct interaction with the environment like throwing chairs or stretching the ropes of the ring (it's wrestling, after all), but it's doubtful that the developer will realize the potential, because the game was long enough in Early Access without significant improvements.","timestamp_created":1605315824,"timestamp_updated":1605316260,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.58749997615814209","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwisaT4vUCc+OcrgI="}
