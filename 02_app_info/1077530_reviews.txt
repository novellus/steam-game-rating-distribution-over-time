As a designer and fan of architecture, it's really cool to sit and just build like I did as a kid. It would be so awesome to have some sort of quest involved in the game, or story. Even something small. There's something so satisfying about building and watching it come to life in this way. It seems something like this might be implemented in the future? Don't get me wrong; the creative freedom is great, but it would also be cool to have some sort of objective or story. Anyway, awesome, awesome game! Great job.","timestamp_created":1609643379,"timestamp_updated":1609643379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609753720,"developer_response":"Thank you for the review!
