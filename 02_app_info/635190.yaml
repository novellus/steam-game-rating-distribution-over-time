    review: "For .99 cents US you get what you pay for. You get three pups, I'm going\
      \ to be generous here and say corgi, husky and white mutt. It's all a reskin\
      \ of the same pup, but I didn't expect more than that for the price. So you\
      \ pick your pup, sounds or not and you can feed, pet or play with puppers. \n\
      \nPlay is tossing the ball which has really broken physics, unfortunately. Get\
      \ it for the meme factor or the cute puppers to pet, just don't expect more\
      \ than what you see. If the puppers were expanded and some relaxing music added\
      \ it wouldn't be a bad title. \n\nStrangely I noticed the puppies are more active\
      \ in meme mode and will sit up nicely. It's kind of a shame they don't do more."
