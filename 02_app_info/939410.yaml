    review: You've been here before if you played low grade Slender type games.  One
      large map with seven items to find.  Finding an item triggers a baddie which
      walks around for a few moments before disappearing.  You'll run in the large
      map from location to location and there may be creatures in the woods which
      will just disappear after they are triggered for a few moments or you just outrun
      them.  Honestly, the first one I saw was stuck in the gate of the "House" area
      and it looked like a ghost chicken spreadeagled.   I think they are supposed
      to be baby ghosts?  At the beginning of the game your journal details what the
      entire story is.  Exploration for notes and other story items is pointless in
      the game.,  There are small arbitrary scrawlings or notes that do nothing to
      add to the story.  You are just supposed to find the seven items, drop them
      in the lake, the exit is highlighted and "Game Over" when you go there.  No
      additional story.  No bosses.  Nothing.  It's absolutely not worth 10 bucks.  2
      bucks is about where this game should be and you should only bother to play
      it if you are really bored with nothing else to do.
