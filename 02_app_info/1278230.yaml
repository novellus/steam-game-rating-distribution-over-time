    short_description: Denial takes place inside your own dark mind, true or false,
      illusion or reality... It doesn't matter. It all feels the same and the stains
      on the walls still remain, maybe now it is time to clean them.

    review: 'Edit. SInce I did get a response I did decide to redownload and try again
      and after the update the problem was resolved and I was able to complete the
      game.In any case I will not be changing this review rating to be fair as I wouldn''t
      hit the like button and recommend this game but it also wasn''t horrible either
      3.7/10.  if you want a quick mediocre low budget game with a bit of jump scares,
      and I did like the music then get it, but on sale. I would delete this but through
      this you do see developers care to improve, do...and with that eventually will
      make a better game given the budget, time and experience.


      Original post: Please do not buy this game as it is now.  I will probably be
      unable to refund this game as it''s past two weeks and this is an unplayable
      game.  Let''s call it level 4 with xyz rooms that you have to unlock....I fell
      through the floor repeatedly when trying to unlock door z...everytime you have
      to restart the level when this happens....so I am unable to continue because
      of this falling through multiple floor levels and it loading but not doing anything...DO
      NOT BUY THIS GAME it is a waste of your money.  I also had this problem when
      it pulled me out of the train as it blows up and died but that only happened
      once and it loaded me back on the train to retry.'
