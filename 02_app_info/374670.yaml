    review: 'Update: Game died. Servers got pulled somewhere along half of March 2018
      and never got back up. It''s the end of April 2018, time to move on.


      ==================================================


      This is one of the most fascinating match-3 games I''ve ever played.


      It''s well polished, beautiful and even a weird kind of cute.

      On the other hand it''s chaotic, hectic and filled with destruction.


      What''s not to like?


      A match usually takes only a couple of minutes, if even that. The game boots
      fast and plays fast, so it''s a great game to play when you got less than half
      an hour to kill.'
