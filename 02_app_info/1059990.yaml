    about_the_game: <strong>Trombone Champ</strong> is the world's first trombone-based
      rhythm music game. Unlike most music games, you can freely play any note at
      any time. You're not just following along with the music, you're actually playing
      the music!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1059990/extras/storegif1.gif?t=1608439012"
      /><br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Toot your way through <strong>over 20 tracks.</strong>
      The better you play, the more toots you earn!<br></li><li>Collect all <strong>50
      Tromboner Cards!</strong><br></li><li>Baboons on nearly every screen!<br></li><li>Improvise

      the secrets of the Trombiverse and become the True Trombone Champ!<br></li><li>Absolutely

      or USB controllers!<br></li><li>Appropriate for all ages!</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Music</h2><br>Trombone
      Champ features over 20 tracks, which include anthems, marches, classical pieces,
      electronica, folk classics, and more. The game also includes tracks from exciting
      guest artists. Each track has a unique animated background that moves with the
      music!<h2 class="bb_tag">Tromboner Cards</h2><br>Use the &quot;Toots&quot; you
      earn from playing songs to purchase sacks of Tromboner Cards. These cards can
      be used to unlock new tromboners, new trombone colors, and other mysteries!<h2
      class="bb_tag">Controls</h2><br>The game can be played with a controller, but
      a mouse is recommended. Move your arm forward and back, like a trombone, and
      the pitch of the note will slide up and down to match! Click or use the keyboard
      to blow! The sounds your trombone makes are completely controlled by you. The
      closer you are to the music track, the more points you will earn, but you have
      the freedom to play anything you want at any time!<h2 class="bb_tag">Baboons</h2><br>Nearly
      every screen in the game, beginning with the main menu, features one or more
      baboons. You won't believe how many baboons there are in this game! As you discover
      the secrets of the Trombiverse, their purpose may become clear... but only a
      true Trombone Champ will uncover their full meaning.
