    review: "The base game got a positive review from me.\nIt's simply a good jigsaws\
      \ game in my opinion.\nCompletionist will go bankrupt with this game.\nIt takes\
      \ almost 600\u20AC to own every single DLC.\nAnd all of them are needed for\
      \ achievements.\nThat's a lot of money for a jigsaw experience.\nBut on the\
      \ other hand: It's a really gud game.\nEspecially for people who enjoy jigsaw\
      \ things.\nThis DLC was a waste of money, it is garbage.\nIt features only 1\
      \ puzzle, but it is just painful.\nThe colours are annoying, it's rage inducing.\n\
      Not enough gold is rewarded for this thing.\nI honestly just don't recommend\
      \ buying it."
