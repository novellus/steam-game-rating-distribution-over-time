      most solitare games are basically the same, especially if they''re made by the
      same people, so [b]marie antoinette''s solitaire[/b] by deyteris is exactly
      like [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/dohi64/recommended/1333900]maidens of
      the ocean solitaire[/url] by deyteris without mermaids, or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/dohi64/recommended/1339820]flowers
      garden solitaire[/url] by deyteris without bleeding eyes because of all the
      clashing colors, so this review is also very similar to my other reviews.


      it''s typical +1/-1 solitaire with a historical theme this time. [b]120 levels[/b]
      unlocked one by one, sorted into 12 packs, unlocked with a certain amount of
      roses. there are [b]3 difficulty settings for a change, no explanation though[/b]
      and couldn''t find any differences either. [b]levels can be replayed separately[/b]
      and prices and goals are the same on each. instead of the usual interactive
      tutorial, a help screen can be brought up, explaining what''s what on the screen.


      completion is based on two goals: [b]getting enough roses and clearing the special
      cards[/b]. roses are the local equivalent of stars and I couldn''t figure out
      what''s on the special cards. the level is failed if you can''t manage, but
      whatever money got collected during the attempt is not lost. no need to clear
      every card, in fact, the level ends immediately when the last goal card is gone,
      so keep an eye on the progress bar on top if you don''t want to finish prematurely
      with fewer roses. a minor complaint: the bar only changes after reaching a rose,
      not card by card, and it''s not always easy to tell if the final goal card should
      be clicked yet or not, hoping it''d trigger the final star.


      money is only visible in the shop and can be spent on [b]power-ups[/b]. the
      usual +1 undo, show number of cards left, wildcard, etc. no story, and they
      broke the tradition, [b]backgrounds can''t be viewed separately here[/b], which
      is a bummer, but [b]you can play dress-up in your boudoir[/b] with the items
      awarded for completing level packs. separate volume settings, some card customization,
      windowed mode and a widescreen toggle, which very elegantly expands the background
      to fill the screen instead of stretching everything. nice.


      the presentation is fine (the curly font is a bit much), the music is repetitive
      again and this time a bit ill-fitting, I think. it''s already kind of a poor
      man''s [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/dohi64/recommended/351090]regency
      solitiare[/url], they could''ve used similarly excellent piano music too. otherwise
      the usual affair, nothing special but not bad, [b]took less than 3 hours[/b]
      to 3-star every level.'
