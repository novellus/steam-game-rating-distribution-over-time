    review: 'A year, almost to the day of my review, the developer has announced the
      game is being "de-listed" for sale, even though it''s still available for sale.
      DON''T BUY IT!


      Update: 10-28-2018 The developer has responded to my review and posted an announcement
      in response. He indicates he "may" end up finishing the game. That''s not particularly
      promising, but I appreciate his efforts at updating the community and responding
      to reviewer criticism. For that alone, I will change my review to recommened,
      but with the caveat that you should check the announcements and see if the dev
      actually finished delivering the game content BEFORE you purchase.


      Original Review: It would appear this game is abandoned for one of the devs
      many other projects. I purchased this game not long after it hit early release,
      and here we are six months later, with almost no updates in four months. I guess
      they lost interest.


      One of the other reviewers likened it to an iOS game, that''s accurate. There''s
      not much depth, not much to keep you coming back, and enough bugs to keep you
      from wanting to come back. I happened to click on this game in my library tonight
      just to check it out and see if there had been any updates, and my assumption
      was right, no news since "join our group, check out our homepage."


      If any of this changes, I will gladly update my review. Until then, avoid this
      game, and, likely, this developer.'
