    about_the_game: 'Why not try these classic carriages, built between 1896 and 1898
      to the design of John McIntosh - the Locomotive Superintendent of the Caledonian
      Railway. This was the second generation of 45 foot coaches with higher arc roofs
      due to a redesign of the gas lamp flues, making them shorter. These carriages
      were intended to replace earlier non-bogie carriages. As built they were gas
      lit and stayed this way well into the 20th century. They were common all over
      the Caledonian system, mainly on branch and suburban trains. There was no provision
      for passenger emergency braking, but this was thankfully retrospectively fitted
      in the early 1900''s!<br><br>After the grouping in 1923 they were gradually
      repainted into the LMS full panel livery. These coaches lasted in passenger
      service until the late 1930''s when all were withdrawn.<br><br>This pack depicts
      the carriages as they appeared after repainting.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><br>The
