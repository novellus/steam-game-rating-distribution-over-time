    short_description: Natsuki Subaru is summoned to a parallel world on his way home
      from the convenience store. He's entranced at first by the fantasy world suddenly
      stretching before his eyes, but the cute girl he believes summoned him is nowhere
      to be found, and soon enough he's utterly lost.
