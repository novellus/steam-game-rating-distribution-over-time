Don't be deceived by its length, this is a game that deserves multiple runs as it allows you to not only experience the story from 5 different perspectives, but also to change the story by using the personality/ability of the different characters in new and interesting ways.  If this game has even vaguely intrigued you from its description, then you should absolutely give it a try.  Bonus points for having an awesome dev who responded quickly to a query I had on the steam discussion page!","timestamp_created":1589258989,"timestamp_updated":1589258989,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43PXNg/ICcLKXhwI="}
