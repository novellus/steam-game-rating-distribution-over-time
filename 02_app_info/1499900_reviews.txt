Once again thanks for bringing this to my attention so soon.\n\nThanks for the review, just tested it with your channel name and found the issue occurs for some reason if you use upper case, it works as it should if you use only lower case and I am about to fix the uppercase issue right now, will edit this response once that's done. Cheers for bringing this issue to my attention."}],"cursor":"AoJ42c7G3/YCc+27vwI="}
