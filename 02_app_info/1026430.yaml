    review: 'The combat system is simplistic and a little unbalanced at times, but
      the characters are likeable, the story is unique and engaging, and the dungeons
      are well-designed with some cool puzzles. Definitely a lot more good than bad
      here.


      Tip: When at the fairy lake, hold off on collecting the flower closest to the
      entrance for last, and leave the area, heal, and save before getting it so you
      don''t get completely destroyed by a surprise boss fight.'
