however, they also have a TRAILERS playlist. a trailers playlist with 2 videos - the other video is privated - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqHEWiRrVbM&list=PLoGtYtwZ_Y5D3q9jfmQ73VxagdjGcXBV7.\n\nluckily by typing the video link into something like google (or in my case, duckduckgo), we can see the cached version that those search engines last crawled for - the privated video was called FRENZY PLATNS - TRAILER - https://i.imgur.com/fqIzPnr.png. searching for \"frenzy platns game\" returns a link to a completely different game, apparently by a different company named MADSKILLZGAME, that released a single game called FRENZY PLANTS late 2019, then never released another game again.\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1118930/FRENZY_PLANTS/\n\ni have legitimately no idea what the reasoning behind changing developer and publisher name like this would be, but operating under multiple names isn't unheard of for shovelware companies on steam, and i'd say this company certainly passes my benchmark for one.\n\nso yeah. don't buy this game. don't buy any of the infinity bridge asset flips. probably don't buy frenzy plants either!! the reputability of this company is hilariously slim, and i'd really recommend you stay away for fear of getting scammed.\n\nanyway, i'm done researching dumb crap now. i'm gonna go refund this game.\n\npce\n-ralc\n\nupdate (2020-12-28): confirmed \"beat the moles\" (listed as simply being developed by INFINITY BRIDGE) is a very minor modification of Whack a Mole by tasonco on the unity asset store, found here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/whack-a-mole-82155\n\nit appears as though the only changes are to the name, lighting, and text position on screen.\n\nconfirmed \"hover ship\" (listed as developed by INFINITY BRIDGE) is at best a minor modification of Hovershift by SgLib Games on the unity asset store, found here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/packs/hovershift-107789\n\nthe only difference i can see between the two is two coloured bars in the top left during gameplay, although the screenshots on the unity page may be taken in some sort of developer mode.\n\nthe newly added game marked as coming soon, \"Asteroids Belt: Try to Survive!\", listed as being developed by INFINITY BRIDGE, is actually... \"Asteroids Belt: Try to Survive!\" by Allebi. https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/packs/asteroid-belt-project-2062\n\ni guess they really gave up on that one, didn't even change the name lol. yet again lighting and resolution seems changed, but the original is intended to be a mobile game, so these changes aren't too surprising.\n\ni still can't find any extra info on frenzy plants or trapped guys, so they're probably custom-developed.","timestamp_created":1608491247,"timestamp_updated":1609156901,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.620236337184906006","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iLfO1PYCdazjuwI="}
