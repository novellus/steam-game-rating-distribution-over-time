    review: 'Constructor is a DOS game from 97, where you control a mafia-oriented
      construction company.

      Although disguised as a building game, it is mostly a war of dirty tricks. After
      you build some houses and handle some tenants, the game becomes a mess of stealing
      properties, thugs wrecking havoc on the streets, gangsters killing foremen,
      and fake repairmen causing gas leaks. And it is BEAUTIFUL.


      There are 5 levels of houses and tenants, two tenants per level. Each tenant
      has different demands concerning their house and garden decoration, as well
      as money, lifetime and other stats. These tenants will provide moneys for the
      funs, but keeping them happy can be a pain. Besides those there are several
      undesireables, such as hippies, thugs, psychopaths, clowns and ghosts.


      The computer is merciless in this game. Even in the easiest difficulty they
      won''t give you  a break and you get flooded with all they got. Playing against
      3 computers is not for the weak. You can also go multiplayer, but I never tested
      that. The controls are lacking, since you must click to do pretty much everything,
      but that''s no show stopper.


      Funfact: this should not have the Windows symbol in Steam Store, since it is
      a DOS game. Ironically, it runs on DOSBox emulator which is Linux native (ported
      to Windows). Linux users can use Steam Proton to run Windows version of DOSBox
      to emulate Constructor... OR you can modify the launcher options and directly
      launch Linux''s native DOSBox instead!


      Sadly no achievements or cards here, but there is a new HD version with the
      former

      ([url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/the_holysword/recommended/579020]see my review
      here[/url]). All in all the game aged a lot but it is still buckets of fun.
      The style is very unique and if you like it, there will be nothing similar in
      the market.'
