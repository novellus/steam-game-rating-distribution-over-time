I nevertheless enjoyed the dark, mature cyberpunk setting and found Janus, Rudy, and the protagonist to be likeable characters. I was still interested in checking out Observer: System Redux, but owing to the greedy business practices of Bloober Team, I really don’t feel like supporting this studio anymore. In fact, this has dissuaded me from pre-ordering or buying The Medium.\n\nEssentially, Observer: System Redux is like that AAA game that, instead of having a free High Resolution DLC and a few paid DLCs, gets released again as a standalone experience for the price of a brand-new game with near-complete disregard for its loyal fanbase. Even AAA studios would not resort to such egregious practices.\n\nAdmittedly, there was a short time window during which a discount for owners of the original game prevailed. I did benefit from that discount, but I realize that I am in the minority. Most people were not even aware of said time window and discount. As such, I want to leave this review to raise awareness about these anti-consumer practices. At the very least, the discount should’ve prevailed indefinitely for all owners of the original Observer. However, in all fairness, Observer: System Redux should have been released for free for anyone who owns the original game.\n\nApparently, the studio is working on a solution. I shall update the review accordingly.\n\nBut, this is not unreasonable in the slightest. Take CD PROJEKT RED. They’re working on a next-gen version of The Witcher 3 with all DLC content that will be released for free for all owners of the game across all platforms. Think CD PROJEKT RED is too big for a fair comparison? Fine, they got their hands full with the Cyberpunk 2077 situation right now anyway. But still... They give it to the people for free.\n\nTake SUPERHOT Team then. They gave out SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE for free for all owners of SUPERHOT across all platforms. This is a very small studio and their new game was in development for at least three years. But still... They give it to the people for free.\n\nThere are countless other gaming studios that are leading by example and doing what’s right for the people and the community by creating value that will ensure goodwill. These studios value and respect their fans and loyal supporters. They did not forget where they came from. Why? Because charging full price for the same game, albeit with ‘new’ content is not right. Because a timed discount for owners that went largely unnoticed is unfair to those who did not know about it.\n\nGive it to the people for free. Or, at the very least, make the discount applicable for all owners of the original game.","timestamp_created":1610171112,"timestamp_updated":1610175639,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43c388vYCeITdwQI="}
