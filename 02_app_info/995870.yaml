    review: 'Now, look.


      This is apparently the dev''s first Unity game, so I''m not going to judge based
      on design altogether.

      The game concept is fine. A boss rush where you fight progressively harder bosses.

      The patterns themselves are also fine. Those aren''t really the problem, and
      were also quite interesting.

      However, I CANNOT pass up the anger I felt when I died to bosses due to your
      GIANT hitbox (you''re a whole head). It really removes any fun you could have
      as a shoot''em up player and replaces it with... a bad feeling.

      So there''s that. If you played anything of this genre before you''re not going
      to have fun, so don''t buy it.'
