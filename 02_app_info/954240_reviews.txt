So I let it stay on my wishlist until Hallowing Sale 2020, that is when I bought it. After I played it for a while, it made my realize how many good games don't get a chance in this day and age, just because they don't get enough reviews, or because they \"don't look that good\" on the store page, or for whatever other reason.\n\nTo be honest I think it's pretty unfair, but as a consumer I think is my fault too, because I'm always searching for already highly rated games. I'm a hypocrite, probably, I don't know, maybe I will keep doing the same, but with more consciousness about it I will try to give more games a chance.\n\nWell, I haven't talked too much about the game yet. I haven't completed it by any means yet either. I'm still on stage 8 or 9, I don't remember, but I have already having fun beating the stages on hard.\n\nPros:\n- It's pretty well crafted.\n- It's fun.\n- It has a story and I think it's nice (at least for me, I don't know for others). And it's what keeps moving the game.\n- You can customize your guardian with different modules.\n- Your playable character (the guardian) feels between pretty well balanced and strong, so it's good. (I don't like games were you are a weakling, unless you just start like that, but at the end you become kind of OP).\n\nCons:\n- Obscure game (I mean that the game is very lost in the whole steam store library) that most people don't give a chance.\n\nPD: I'm a avid player of shoot 'em up were you can customize your playable character (most of the time they are spaceships though) with gameplay changing upgrades. I love games like Nova Drift, Geometry Arena, Tyrian (although it's not the best balanced game ever, and some stages can be boring, it's the game that made me love shoot 'em ups, because it has a ton of content), Jets'n'Guns Gold (a Tyrian-like game), Synthetik, etc. Well, in reality I have played a lot of shoot 'em ups games, the last ones being this one and DreadStar (another Tyrian-like game, pretty nice, but short). I have also played games like Steredden, Enter the Gungeon, etc., etc. So I have experience when I say this game is good, maybe it is not the one with the most replayability, but I think that at least you should give it a chance, maybe you will like it too.\n\nI will give it a score when I finish it.","timestamp_created":1604561083,"timestamp_updated":1604562076,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556737601757049561","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlsjWy/UCfvezrAI="}
