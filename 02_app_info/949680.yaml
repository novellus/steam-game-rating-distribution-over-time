    review: 'Decent but way too buggy and incomplete. Dev is absolutely silent/gone.
      Do not buy this game. Spend elsewhere.. This needs an earlier version title
      because anything resembling completion in this game is a lie. That being said
      if more work is done on this game it might be playable. If you don''t believe
      me, buy the game and see how many saves you lose from bugs. Call me out on that.
      Aside from the bugs, including powerful and eventual game breaking ones, we
      also get a system so esoteric you won''t know if that''s how the game''s meant
      to be played, or a bug.  That keeps you playing until you realise it''s not
      playable but also you''re beyond the refund period.   If the bugs, and I mean
      bugs, are ironed out this is a decent game. The interface IS confusing but I
      got the hang of it. Otherwise stay back. Ask other players, see what they think
      too. For such a newly released game the radio silence is deafening.  This game
      has potential and if you''re willing to risk paying for that, have at it. EDIT:
      It''s a complete thorough rip off. This cant'' be legal.'
