    review: 'Pros: I enjoyed this game - it reminded me of the show "House," which
      I always watched.  One thing I liked about this game is that it is almost totally
      hidden objects.   Yes, you have to make a guess based on the evidence you collect,
      but the rest of the game is hidden objects consistently.  This is very different
      from other mystery games I usually play.  Here are the cons:  the game is expensive
      - usually $20.  I bought it on the winter sale, so it was much cheaper.  Here''s
      why this is important: this game is very short.  If you''re going to have a
      $20 game, make it worth playing.  I felt like it was WAY too short, and if I
      had paid $20 for it, I would have been very disappointed.  Overall, it''s a
      good game if you get it on sale.  Also, why isn''t there a Season 1 available?'
