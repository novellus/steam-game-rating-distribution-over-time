    about_the_game: 'Groupy is a killer app that will let you take things like Microsoft
      Office programs, Adobe Creative Suite apps, File Explorer windows, and much
      more, and put them into tabbed groups. Just like modern web browsers group their
      websites together, you can now do that with all of the Windows apps on your
      desktop, making for a cleaner and more efficient experience.<br><br>Creating
      groups is simple: drag a window to another window and combine them into a single
      window, with tabs showing in the title bar. For example, open multiple web browsers,
      all in one set of tabs, or Office applications like Excel and Word, all in a
      single, easy-to-use window. To ungroup, simply drag the tab off the group. Save
      existing groups and launch them at a later time, contained and ready to go.
      <br><br>Once a group is created, you can quickly switch between different windows
      with a simple hot-key or by clicking on the tab. Groupy can also automatically
      add launched programs into an existing tabbed group. <br><br>Groupy works on
      Windows 10, 8, and 7.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>
