      notes: Dwarf Fortress contains textual descriptions of violence, and static
        2D sprites that may have violent ends.  Alcohol consumption is required for
        a dwarven fortress to run smoothly, as described in text.  Dwarves can experience
        mental anguish, and in extreme cases this can lead to them taking their own
        lives or the lives of others.
