The dragons are really pretty, but it all seems a bit random and out of place and I never really felt like I was \"dancing\".\n\nThe second option is a free mode, in which they don't seem to have any songs of their own (the UI is also a confusing mess to navigate). It's more all player made maps, which means you might find something you like if you dig far enough but there seems to be no ranking, so you will have no idea if the map you pick is actually *good* or not. \n\nEven with some of the expert and expert + maps I played, I didn't really get that dance feeling like you do in something like Audio Trip, Beat Saber, or Synth Riders, unfortunately. \n\nI appreciate the fact that apparently it supports LIV mixed reality and foot trackers, but unfortunately I could get neither working with this particular game. The avatar in LIV would work, but then after a few seconds of being in the game it would be obscured by black screen. Holodance also could not pick up my foot trackers despite giving them roles in the Steam VR settings.","timestamp_created":1609208803,"timestamp_updated":1609208803,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ467WU1vYCfaKnvgI="}
