I have played hundreds of games since then on all conceivable computers and consoles and nothing grabbed me like the original Bard's Tale Series. It had graphics and sound like no other of its time, especially on the Apple IIgs. I played I and III to the end. For reasons I cannot remember I never finished The Destiny Knight. This newly enhanced Trilogy is everything I loved about the original with better graphics and sound and better game play. No longer do you have to slog all the way back to Adventurers' Guild to save your game. Cash is easier to collect so you don't have to resort to those pop this disk in and that one out to acquire ill-gotten games. I am having a blast!","timestamp_created":1609876809,"timestamp_updated":1609876809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40tSI6vYCfuHmwAI="}
