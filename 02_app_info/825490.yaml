    about_the_game: 'Professor Sven Lindemann and his worse student Eric, as fate
      would have it, got into an intergalactic mess-up. Professor promised to close
      his eyes to Eric''s cheating in exams if the boy helps him with research expedition.
      Eric had no idea where exactly the professor want to go, much less that the
      cynical scientist just needed someone he could easily get rid of, if the things
      go wrong... The moment when Eric, strained under a load of his gun, saw the
      portal opening before his eyes, he realised that something was wrong. But it
      was too late to back down...<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/825490/extras/promo_1st_top.png?t=1602058089"
      /><br>To survive in Crazy Science: Long Run you have not only to run fast but
      also to think fast! After your research advisor stole (in the name of science!)
      a very valuable alien crystal, angry alien aborigines started to chase both
      of you. But you can escape from them easily, all that you need is to adjust
      the hand-held portal generator and... wait, how do you adjust it? We''ll figure
      it out on the run!<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/825490/extras/promo_2nd_weapon.png?t=1602058089"
