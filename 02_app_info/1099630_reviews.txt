Like, you basically try to keep the peace on all fronts, relationships occur or not, the elderly demand respect because they have glasses and gray hair, an action is required but you can also do another, all by chance? Ehhh, some are, some are not. Like most of the choices you wanna take, you already see what it does to your economy. If one goes all the way down or all the way up, it's game over. But that is the whole thing about this game, everytime you play, it's a little story till you fail. New characters gets unlocked after you failed and you can try another story with them. New characters also get unlocked by chance, when they want to join your community during your storyline.\n\nYou also level up during any story, increasing some of your skills. Prolly for later replay with better outcome. Because when you look at the map, there is huge trail to go through. By doing the right choices and ocassionally a real chance occurs with a 50/50 outcome, there is this chance (yep another chance) that you go deeper into the map. That is considered \"exciting\" because then more possibilities are opened. \n\nThe best achievement is getting through the entire map with your community, overcoming obstacles, keeping the peace and survive!\n\nA good game for when you want to dedicate your weekend doing souly survival games. But it will become a little repetitive, so I recommend you NOT to play longer then one hour. (like I already played 30 minutes and finished 5 stories) \nIf you were interested in more actions then being a leader and making choices, but being one of the soldiers in that commiunity and able to shoot your way through with some first person action, I would recommend the game [b] The Walking Zombie 2 [/b] which is FREE on Steam. See it as an additional break from Alive 2 Survive: Tales. \n\n[h1] How far will you come? Create the best tale everrrrrr!!! [/h1]\n\n","timestamp_created":1593673606,"timestamp_updated":1593673606,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt6yWh/MCdOaPkgI="}
