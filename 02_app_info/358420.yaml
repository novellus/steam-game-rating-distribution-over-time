    short_description: Xenophage is a fighting game in the same genre as Mortal Kombat.
      This game features scrolling arenas that also zoom in and out, depending on
      how far apart the fighters are from each other. This is a unique feature in
      fighting games. The fighters all come from unique alien planets, so they look
      very cool and unusual.

    review: 'This game did have some potential but there are some issues with it.
      The graphics are okay. They looked a bit better than I was expecting given the
      screenshots but still nothing compared to the games that this is derivative
      of. The gameplay is the issue here. I have started getting into the fighting
      game genre a bit more recently so I wanted to give this a go to see Apogee''s
      version of a Mortal Kombat game would look/play like. Well, I played six minutes
      of it and that was enough for me (consisted of three matches, the first of which
      crashed the game). The gameplay is very clunky and feels awful to play. I only
      played with Toad and Selena so if there is a character that feels more natural
      to play, I don''t know.


      I would recommend remapping your keys to something a bit better than the default
      controls and turning off camera zoom which made the game look much worse in
      my opinion. There is potential here but the execution left a lot to be desired.'
