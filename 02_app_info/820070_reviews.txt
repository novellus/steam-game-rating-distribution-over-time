There will be more features, too.\n\nThe crashes have been fixed in the public test version, if that one still crashes please let me know.\n\nI should not have sold the game that early, I am very sorry for that and still actively working on it in full-time. I hope you'll have fun with it in the future :)"}],"cursor":"AoJ4rpO96O8CcszB7QE="}
