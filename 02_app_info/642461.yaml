    review: Don't know ,have not seen it. Looks like I'll not be seeing it.The STEAM
      MOVIE PLAYER is the worst I have seen since the original CYBERLINK POWER MEDIA
      PLAYER! I was planning to buy more movies ,BUT that is no longer going to happen.
      Your movie player is a black mark on what is otherwise a fine service
