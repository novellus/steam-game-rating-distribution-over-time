Even on normal difficulty I seemed to be constantly bombarded by enemies when all I wanted was to finally find the way to the next section / puzzle. I mostly enjoyed the puzzles but I finally got stuck on one only to find there are no proper walkthroughs yet. There are some gameplay videos out there but you'd have to just hope they happen to do the puzzle you need help on. I know a lot of people like to solve the puzzles with no hints at all but for those of you who use them just be aware.\n\nIf they add a \"zen\" mode that removes those annoying enemies so I can just dig and solve puzzles then I'll probably come back to finish the game, but for now, I'm done.  Good but not great.\n\nEDIT: Zen Mode added with fewer enemies.","timestamp_created":1594988455,"timestamp_updated":1606348370,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhd70gPYCdr3tlQI="}
