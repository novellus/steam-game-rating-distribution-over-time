It looks great, sounds great, and controls great. The enemy variety is good, and the various weapons are fun to use. The developer is responsive and regularly updates the game.\n\nThe roguelike elements affect stage order and weapon appearances, but they do not feel haphazard or disorganized, and there are no persistent unlocks. Even if you do not normally like roguelikes, you will probably find the roguelike elements inoffensive if the core gameplay is your thing.\n\nOne last thought - this game has particularly good feedback. I'm talking about the visual and audio bits that trigger when collecting coins, blowing up enemies, using the jetboard attack, etc. Good feedback is important for all games, but vital for arcade style games, and this one nails it.","timestamp_created":1609529716,"timestamp_updated":1609808976,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiPOF6PYCdJK/vwI="}
