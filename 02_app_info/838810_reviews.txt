Garofalo is one of just a few comedians I like: well-written and overall spunky, the video certainly offers good entertainment for well over an hour or so. I'm a fan since \"Larry Sanders\" days: more aware of herself than others interests, she delivers just the right attitude for our oversensitized (every)day (life) and age. Definitely a recommendation.","timestamp_created":1598040341,"timestamp_updated":1598040341,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oI+oifQCc/rynAI="}
