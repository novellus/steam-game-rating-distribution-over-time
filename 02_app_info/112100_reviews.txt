The main draw here will be clearing dungeons, collecting better equipment, and selling junk while building a character. The dialogue choices and reading add a layer of intrigue but otherwise you're left with simple graphics, sound effects, and background noise. I recommend listening to a podcast or music playlist while you play.","timestamp_created":1610148778,"timestamp_updated":1610149893,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uLKa8vYCdaDVwQI="}
