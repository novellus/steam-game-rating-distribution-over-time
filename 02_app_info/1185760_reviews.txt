The images are stuck in a .PDF format, which I think stinks. What makes developers think .PDFs should be the only way to package non-conceptual art? What if I wanted to set these as say, a background or uh, if I didn't have good .PDF reading software? What if I don't want to load every photo at once, or if I want to see a certain few without scrolling through a bunch I don't want? If this DLC includes loose photos in the future, I'd say [i]pick it up[/i]. Until then, stay away.\n\nAlso, the \"soundtrack\" is literally one track. A lone .MP3 file. But hey, it's calming. Put it in your bedtime-playlist. Or uh, meditation.","timestamp_created":1574494886,"timestamp_updated":1574494886,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496240615844726563","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh6vNy+4CdYGF3AE="}
