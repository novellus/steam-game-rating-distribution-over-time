    review: "A personal favourite. If I had a dollar for every time I've listened\
      \ to this album, I'd...be almost a hundred dollars richer. It's [i]that[/i]\
      \ good.\n\n   Just look at the track titles listed on the Store page. Yes, those\
      \ tracks are every bit as good as they sound. Yes, \"The Disintegration Kiss\
      \ on the Door\" [i]is[/i] a blatant Cure tribute. And the rest is 80s-influenced\
      \ synth-y goodness at its very, very best. (Okay, so there's a tiny bit of \"\
      filler\", but it's still pretty kosher.)\n\n   Five bucks is nothin' for so\
      \ much goodness packed into a single wallop. Go on. You know you want...nay,\
      \ [i]need[/i] it. Don't even wait for a sale. Buy it TODAY, you cheapskates.\
      \ \n\n   Verdict: 10/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check\
      \ out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\n\
