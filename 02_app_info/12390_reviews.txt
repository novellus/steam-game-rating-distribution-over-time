I was hoping the game would be so bad it's good, but it was actually just boring. I think it was supposed to be a stealth game, but usually you only get around 1-2 axe kills before you get caught and then it's just a subpar action shooter with mostly boring cutscenes, terrible stock music and sound effects. The gunplay itself is alright, but most weapons are useless, because the moment you peek out you get shot by every enemy in the area and so you will use the machinegun pretty much through the entire playthrough since it kills enemies the fastest and it's grenade barrel for ranged enemies. The story was also just boring and bad, but not in a comedic way.\n\nThe game is also difficult af, but it comes from all the enemies knowing where you are, firing non stop at you and they do insane damage.\n\nTime to finish the game: 7,4 hours","timestamp_created":1600045436,"timestamp_updated":1608816681,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.448818892240524292","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gsy8yvYCf6zWoQI="}
