Both didn’t know each other prior to this event, but find themselves fascinated by a pond in the middle of the forest. If you throw pebbles in this pond, you are able to grow stars. Actually, these stars have a meaning as well, because different combinations of stars influence the fate of the people living in Kyoto differently. Shingoh wants to experiment with the pond and invites Hamomoru to be his assistant. She can’t decline his offer because she had lost her wallet at some point before coming to the pond and has no means to go back home or stay somewhere else. And so both of them start to combine the stars in the pond every night and meet with some people in the daytime to see, whose fate has changed and how.  \n\nAs mentioned before,\n\nHamomoru Tachibana is the main character and Shingo’s current assistant.\nChuuya Shingoh is a scientist, who is curious about the magical powers of the pond and wants to test, how it works. He is basically telling Hamomoru, what to do.\n\nThe other characters are Nagare Toshika, Ingetsu Mashiba, Yi Xinghua and Sorata Aetama. These four characters have all different circumstances and your job is to combine a lot of stars so that their wishes come true. You want the best outcome for all of them. Since talking about their background stories is somehow a spoiler, I won’t mention it here.\n\nNext, about the gameplay: You will combine stars and that’s it. There are no choices regarding the story, but the story isn’t boring itself to begin with. You actually wouldn’t need the choices in the first place. The reason for that is that, when you start combining stars, you’re able to change the life of the four characters bit by bit. Because every combination only changes the life of the character slightly, it’s the same as, if you had chosen something. \n\nHowever, the gameplay can become tedious. Moreover, it’s definitively very tedious towards the end, when you have to combine many stars just to get a specific cluster and, if one star is wrong, everything just stops working. I’d recommend you use a guide at that point.\n\nIn my opinion, this game is still very underrated.\n\nIt is story-wise a short game (but you are going to have a lot of trial-error regarding the stars), but the story and the characters are very lovable. \n\nThe story doesn’t tire you out and I really like it that they split the story into short scenes that are influenced by the stars. The star combinations you need for a story are not random as well since every cluster you will be making does have a meaning or is a metaphor for something. Those meanings become the reality for the characters.\n\nIn addition, every story is unique and you will feel sympathetic towards every character. You will want to help them as much as Hamomoru does and you will feel truly glad, when you reach their best ending.\n\nI think this game is very special because of that. Even though, it has no romance involved whatsoever, it manages to tell the stories of people so well that you don’t want to stop playing until you have finished the whole game.\n\nThe only negative aspect this game has is that it’s very grindy towards the end. You will need to look up a guide, if you want to finish the journal. But, hey, I think we all can overlook this aspect because the rest of the game is simply amazing.\n\nSo, buy this game, if you have time for a puzzle game right now. \n\nIt’s a very good story. Adorable characters. \n\nThe story is even deeper than it looks like at first glance (because of the true story at the end). This game made me actually think about what fate is and question, how I’d act, if I were in the same situation as the protagonist.\n\nAll in all, one of my favourites and I still remember it, although I played it years ago.\n\n[url=https://xiaoran-revs.tumblr.com/post/634066887779762176/this-starry-midnight-we-make] Long Review [/url]","timestamp_created":1497525874,"timestamp_updated":1604693426,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9c/Lz/UCfqTcew=="}
