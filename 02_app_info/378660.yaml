      /><br><br>Eliot Ness, the former leader of the legendary Untouchables, wished
      only to spend the rest of his days working in his diner, not dwelling too much
      on the cesspit of corruption his city, Santa Esperanza, had degenerated into.<br>
      <br>But things rarely go as planned.<br> <br>When children suddenly start to
      disappear and the police just simply a blind eye, Eliot decides to take the
      law into his own hands, track down the culprit and bring him to justice by any
      means necessary, even if he has to abandon his dreams of a peaceful life and
      again get embroiled in shootouts with the usual array of assassins and hoodlums.
      <br> <br>Helped by various characters from some unexpected places, the player
      must guide Eliot through the increasingly morbid and decadent scenarios searching
      for clues to solve the cases in the five episodes of this season's Blues and
      Bullets.
