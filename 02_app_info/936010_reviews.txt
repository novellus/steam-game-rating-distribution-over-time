It's a clicker game, and you can either click, or after your first few upgrades, just sit back and chill as the upgrades do the work for you. Your pet then gives you unconditional love with auto clicks making hearts of affection appear.\n\nThe one thing that confused me is the target demographic. It certainly looks kid-friendly, but it will take time and clicks a plenty to unlock each pet. If you can get a bundle with the dlc you can jump between the floofy pink unicorn and I'm guessing a squirrel? Still, cute and strangely addictive at any age. Just hire the manager to keep things going while you're away.\n\nEdit: To give you an idea of how long it takes, I've played fifteen hours and only managed to unlock three additional pets. You could certainly buy more food to make it go faster, but this one is in no rush to let you get at all the pets right away.","timestamp_created":1595480308,"timestamp_updated":1597713960,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxInL//MCdsWDlwI="}
