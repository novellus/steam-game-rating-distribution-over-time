    about_the_game: They say &quot;&quot;Misery is Magic&quot;&quot;, and that couldn't
      be truer than it is for this pair of magic beasts. The Grimcorn curses enemies
      for extra damage with its Impure Strike, and the Necrocorn can bestow a Dark
      Blessing to cleanse allies. Oh, and that Tinycorn, you ask? Sure, it grants
      bonuses, but its brand of magic is extreme cuteness. Get enough copies of these
      Ultra-rare Troops to ascend them to Legendary level if you wish to, plus the
      Tinycorn Pet and a heap of Souls, Pet Food and Keys.<br><br>This Bundle is great
      for new-to-intermediate players who want to add solid attack and support options
      on their teams.<br><br><strong>CONTENTS:</strong><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>
