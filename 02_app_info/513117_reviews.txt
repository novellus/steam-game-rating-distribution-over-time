At last we have some heavy, noisy, realistically weathered wagons that feel like they've got some mass. The sounds are fantasic, loud and noisy with track joint sounds that alter significantly with speed and give a real clatter and clank over points. I can spend all day on one of the external vews listening to a train of these thundering through the countryside.\n\nI see from Google that they crop up in different countries, so I think it would be realistic to use them on most northern continental European routes.","timestamp_created":1519170168,"timestamp_updated":1519170168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzKTm2uECeZbMmQE="}
