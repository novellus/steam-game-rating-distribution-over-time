    review: 'This has been really fun so far. There is zero hand holding even to the
      point of not being sure what different items do until you perhaps find some
      way to use them. The game doesn''t really point you to any direction pretty
      much ever, so there''s a lot of wandering around wondering what to do next and
      where to go, but there are some more or less cryptic hints on the walls that
      you can read.


      At first the controls took a bit of time to get used to. This can be controlled
      solely with mouse or with keyboard and mouse. No controller support whatsoever,
      but you kinda need the mouse cursor to play the game a lot of the game is about
      hovering the cursor over the enemies to see their stats and sometimes the enemies
      are too far from the player character.


      The combat is all about looking at the stats of the player and the enemies and
      deciding to make your move with that knowledge. The enemies don''t move and
      only stand in one place, often blocking doors, entrances and items, and they
      don''t attack before you attack them. You go next to them and click on them,
      and based on their stats and your stats they lose a certain amount of HP and
      you lose too. You can see how much HP the enemies have and how much HP one hit
      from you takes off them and how much HP gets taken from you with that click
      as well. If the power of your click exceeds the amount of HP the enemy has,
      it dies and doesn''t take any HP from you during the final blow (that is very
      important to know when calculating how many times you can hit them).


      If you go ahead and fight the enemies without thinking it any further, you will
      die very quickly. It''s very important to think before you hit an enemy, because
      you have to be aware of how many health potions you have and when you should
      use them, and which enemies you should choose to fight and when.


      You will gain experience points for defeating enemies and every time you level
      up you will get your HP meter filled up, so that''s something you should be
      watching too and use that to your advantage. When you are strong enough, some
      enemies will become one-blow kills that don''t take away your HP at all and
      instead basically will give you free HP.


      The enemies don''t seem to spawn back so the ones you have killed will stay
      dead.


      Apparently there are intentional possibilities for sequence breaking too so
      there are multiple ways to go further.


      Right now I''m contemplating on whether or not to buy health potion with the
      little money I still have and if I should use that to be able to get rid some
      tougher enemy blocking a path somewhere, or if with more exploration I could
      find another way to proceed. Maybe I will end up needing that money further
      in the game...


      It''s a really good and mysterious game and especially if you like "open world"
      top down retro adventures with zero hand holding and Zelda 1 style world map
      progression (no screen scrolling) I recommend this to you 100%.'
