If you want to play both, I would suggest playing 'Ohgiya' first simply because it plays into 'Kikuya' more smoothly.\n\n✔ Fitting for someone's first Otome/VN.\n✔ Good Otome for a veteran VN fan's collection.","timestamp_created":1581312864,"timestamp_updated":1608737882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497942358255386353","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+f+PyPYCdqGn8QE="}
