Even though they revamped the game from its original theme, leading many to have mixed thoughts, I have no problem with it. Its a great game, solid mechanics, just feels a little uncomfortable to move the character a times but I can tell the amount of work that was put into this game. The enemies are unique, the stages are unique, the trial and error aspect is great, would definitely recommend","timestamp_created":1584896775,"timestamp_updated":1584896775,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tbLNgfECfeyO+gE="}
