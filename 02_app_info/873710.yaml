    review: "[h1] Fun but basic. [/h1]\n\n There's no way of knowing beforehand which\
      \ puzzle you're doing, so one has to click at random. Furthermore you can't\
      \ save the puzzles or your progress once you complete them. The pictures themselves\
      \ are fine, basic touristy photos of Paris, some are pretty but not particularly\
      \ interesting or artsy. They look like stock photos. The puzzles themselves\
      \ vary in length and are a decent way of occupying an hour. You also can't use\
      \ the Steam screenshot feature in game, so if you want to photo your completed\
      \ puzzle you'll have to Print Screen. I kind of dig how it looks like an early\
      \ 2000s webpage, that's quite nostalgic.\n\nI like to wake up early before my\
      \ girlfriend, when the flat is empty, and I'll drink a cup of coffee, smoke\
      \ a cigarette and do a jigsaw. It's quite relaxing in that sense. Yet overall,\
      \ it's a pretty weak game. It might be good for jigsaw beginner's like myself,\
      \ since it's rather easy. More soothing than difficult.\n\nI got it for 40 pence\
      \ on sale, so I'm not too bothered. I would NOT recommend it even at its original\
      \ price of \xA31.69 as even that is too much."
