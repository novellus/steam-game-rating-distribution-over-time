    review: 'It is for free..

      And it is optional (meaning, when you are creating your character(s) ) you may
      or may not choose to eat the fruit and get +10 extra points.

      Depending how bad a-s-s you feel to start the game.

      But considering that upon level up the stats may decrease, just as increase...
      having better start is not a bad thing at all!


      And again, it''s free :) lol'
