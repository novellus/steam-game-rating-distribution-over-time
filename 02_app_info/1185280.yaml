    review: "I liked the idea: you bought beer, blood, wine, chicken and so on, put\
      \ them together like blood + beer and then sold it to vampira who has eating\
      \ in your restourant. They like blood foods, drinks and so on. But they hate\
      \ garlics soap or garlic foods..\nAnother customer like garlic food, but hate\
      \ blood food and so on. There is several type customers: lizards, vampires,\
      \ humans, demons and so on. Everyone has their vaforite food and drinks, and\
      \ they have also food and drink what they hate. \nI liked to idea. \nBut there\
      \ is some problems: you can bought food once per day. Selller is not sell everyday\
      \ everything. One day you can buy winw, one day not, one day you can buy blood,\
      \ another not. That why its bit difficult game.."
