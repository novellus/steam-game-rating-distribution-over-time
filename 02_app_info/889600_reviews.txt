You have to think before doing your move when if comes to bosses or you might get one shot (if you play at higher difficulty) The character have their own unique move and one does not feel like a clone of another but with different element. \n\nIf you are familiar with persona series, you might enjoy the social link system? Well in this game it's taken to the extreme. Each. Single. NPC. Will ask for something (basically a quest) in order for you to befriend them, which then unlock access to their friend with yet another quest and so on.... Some of them are pretty much the same thing over and over so it's not that much of a hassle, it's still a great feature and makes every NPC a little bit more alive. Plus, there is a feature where you can send messages to any NPC to ask about their lives, what they like, etc. (it's a great way to learn more about your waifu/husbando!)\n\nFor once, A company did a port of a game to PC CORRECTLY.\nThe control on PC use the mouse and mouse wheel perfectly in menu, it's instinctive, fast, well.... perfect.\n\nIt is sad to see such a lovely game go under the radar, once again because \"it's a vita game\" but trust me.... Furyu is a HUUUUUUGEEEE developper but mainly focus on Japan exclusive title. If you actually buy this game, you might provide the support required for them to export their game a little bit more around the globe! ^_^\n\nI hope this review helps a bit and gives you a better idea regarding this game which is, hands down, one of the best J-RPG I played in years. Like I said, it is unique, beautiful, A-MA-ZING soundtrack and the gameplay is smoooooth (you hit an ennemy, the fight begin instantly, no cute cutscene and stuff).\n\nBUY IT! :D","timestamp_created":1609825213,"timestamp_updated":1609894156,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50354611873626709","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7urK6vYCd6bOwAI="}
