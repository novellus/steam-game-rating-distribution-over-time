This means that someone can play on the monitor at the same time as the player in VR. Clever concept. Well executed here. The monitor player is Jake who is on the run from a giant while trying to steal his gold. The VR player is the Giant and has to hunt Jake with arrows and a club. The balance is good. My son and I played it a few times, I was the Giant and found it reasonably easy to find Jake, but with practice Jake could win. Good fun game. Essentially Virtual Reality Hide and Seek simulator. If you have kids and want to play with them while in VR then this is a no brainer. Good fun family game. I purchased the game and did not get paid for this review.","timestamp_created":1545843137,"timestamp_updated":1545843180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.694409191608428955","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnuDb9ecCe7m/tgE="}
