    review: 'Another metroidlike platformer game with souls-inspired combat, something
      that usually is right up my alley so I bought it a while ago and finally got
      around to play it.


      Sadly, after about 3 hours I pulled the plug because it started to get really
      tedious due to the following issues:


      - Input lag, especially when it comes to dodging (sometimes takes several taps
      until it performs despite stamina being available)


      - Attack animations feel way too clunky and slow compared to enemy and boss
      patterns. Almost every attack feels like a heavy attack with a big weapon, even
      the twin daggers. It makes the game unneccessarily frustrating cause more than
      often it''s simply impossible to avoid attacks because your own attack animation
      hasn''t ended yet. That issue eventually caused me to quit at the Supervisor
      boss because seemingly there''s no way to get a hit in without getting hit first.
      Major disappointment!


      - There seems to be no parry or block mechanic, which is an essential part of
      souls combat (if there is then I couldn''t figure out how to pull it off)


      Positive aspects are visuals, sound, atmosphere and (if present) music


      The base is there but this game needs work, especially the combat mechnics.

      As of now, I can''t recommend it!'
