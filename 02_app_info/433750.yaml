    review: "The Grandfather is a game which is hard to review, because of how weird\
      \ it is.\n\nStory:\n\nYou play as an Old Man. You live with your wife, who is\
      \ a cold and bitter person, that never loved you and the story follows on her\
      \ coldness towards her husband. \n\nThat is the basic gist of the story and\
      \ it basically follows on the Old Mans feelings and how he deals with the situation.\
      \ It's definitely some messed up stuff and honestly it was pretty depressing\
      \ to play, but overall the story was pretty interesting and definitely was worth\
      \ going through all of it.\n\nGraphics:\n\nMost of the game is hand drawn and\
      \ I liked the art style, even though it's very rough. Some of it seven gross\
      \ to look at, especially the main characters. I liked the hand drawn art style\
      \ a lot, but I felt it suffered in places, especially the environments, which\
      \ weren't that good, they look much lower quality than the characters.\n\nAudio:\n\
      \nThe audio design is flat out the worst part of the game. The voice actor that\
      \ narrates everything, her acting is decent, but the mixing makes it sound super\
      \ quiet, where most of the time you can barely understand what she is saying,\
      \ not to mention everything else is incredibly loud.\n\nThe music is not very\
      \ good and the sound effects mix into are just an awful experience. There's\
      \ a lot of echoing whenever something happens and it's just attack on the ears.\
      \ \n\nGameplay:\n\nThe gameplay is going to be really hard to explain. Basically\
      \ you control the head of the old man and you fly around in a room of the house\
      \ and you basically try to mess around with the items in those rooms to progress\
      \ into another room.\n\nThe gameplay is not very good, for multiple reasons,\
      \ first of all it's really cryptic on what you have to do. I had plenty of times\
      \ where I had no idea what I was doing, all I did was flying around, interacting\
      \ with items and just hoping I was going to progress. \n\nControlling the head\
      \ is also not easy, as it feels incredibly slippery. It just sort of slides\
      \ out of place and it becomes annoying when you're trying to interact with something\
      \ specific. \n\nVerdict:\n\nThe Grandfather used to be a paid game and if this\
      \ was still the case, I would have given this a negative review, however since\
      \ it's free, I think it's worth it for horror fans, since it only takes roughly\
      \ 20 minutes to finish, only worth it if you're a horror fan.\n\nFinal Rating:\n\
      6/10\n\nPros:\n+ Decent plot\n+ Art style is pretty decent\n\nCons:\n- The audio\
      \ design is terrible\n- Goals of each level are pretty cryptic \n- Controls\
      \ are way too slippery \n\nIf you liked this review please consider joining\
