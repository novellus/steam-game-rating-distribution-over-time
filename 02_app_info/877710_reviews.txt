The visuals are a treat, and there seems to be enormous depth to the gameplay. The music and sounds really adds to the cool strangeness of the game.\n\nMy only regret is buying this game at 2 am in the morning before leaving on a trip because I look really forward to digging my teeth into this little gem.\n\n","timestamp_created":1593728014,"timestamp_updated":1593728014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6/LliPMCd+OnkgI="}
