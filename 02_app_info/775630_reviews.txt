The positive is it helps make use of your probably gigantic collection of EDITs and create the illusion of growing your own wrestling promotion through good booking (fan ratings really count here), savvy financing, and regularly recruiting fresh talent. Or at least in theory that's how this is all supposed to go.\n\n I love FPWW, and I totally want to support this game. But this mode, like a few others, is so bare bones I'm having a hard time understanding why it wasn't just included in the base product. I'm still having fun, for sure. But I'm also amazed someone bought this at $19.99 because I'm a little sticker shocked at $7.99. I do recommend if you are looking for more miles out of FPWW, though. If you do pick this up, be warned: save often and frequently.","timestamp_created":1609087865,"timestamp_updated":1609087865,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iorH0vYCc+/nvQI="}
