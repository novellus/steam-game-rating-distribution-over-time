Can't fully recommend it just yet, but once some updates have been made I would be glad to update this review. There are definitely some good games in here. How to play's need to be updated to be more clear on what you are doing. Every game felt like the first round was learning. More so for those where a group of people are doing something different from the rest. There also seems to be an issue with the games being dropped. Couldn't play phonanigans with 8 people. Kept dropping the entire lobby half way through.  Drawing games seem more prone to the entire lobby being dropped and a new room needing to be made. Didn't have any issues with the text games. Really enjoy the music. Like being able to change tracks, and having the ability to kick out people. The game needs some bug fixes and a bit of polish but I think could be a worth while addition to games you can play with friends online when it gets them.","timestamp_created":1609817240,"timestamp_updated":1609817240,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609825705,"developer_response":"Hey, thanks for trying out the games and taking the time to give feedback!\n\nI had put in a few fixes that I hoped would mitigate the problems with drawing games dropping, but clearly that didn't work. I've just put in an update to the server code that should entirely fix those issues.\n\nUpdating the How to Play descriptions is also something I've been meaning to do, and will try to get to soon.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any suggestions, know about other bugs that need fixing, or have any other feedback. Cheers!"}],"cursor":"AoJwnLal6PYCebHLwAI="}
