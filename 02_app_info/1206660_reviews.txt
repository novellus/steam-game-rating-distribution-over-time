So it's very bland and boring in that regard. I find the art at times charming, at least for the monsters. I mean there's a bunny on a scooter with a magic wand, what's not to love there? But some are ugly as sin, like that weird ogre looking thing seen in screenshots.\n\nBut beyond that, frequently, the visuals are an abuse toward your eyesight. Some doors are hard to even see, the floor tiles in some areas are just so ugly and blinding, and they hide NPCs in them. NPCs who are also really ugly to look at. There's just not a lot to work with to justify recommending it. \n\nOh and oddly there are five monsters in your party [once you get 5], and you can only see 4 of their information on screen at a time you have to otherwise scroll to see the 5th. I don't know if that's a limit of the RPG Maker used or what, but it's really goofy. [you can see the little arrow in the screenshots of the battles, that's what that means; a fifth monster down there]. Makes battles a bit more annoying as you can't at a glance make sure your team is okay to keep going.\n\nThere's the world's worst ice puzzle ever made. On top of that I froze the game there by interacting with a bouncy rock [why you bounce off it is beyond me]. I was inbetween a stationary rock and a bouncy one and you can interact with the bouncy ones to bounce back and after doing that and having nowhere to go it froze. And that entire cave is annoying push puzzles that do not save when you finish them, so that's fun, the save in the cave is after the awful ice puzzle. Yay.\n\nThere's a boss battle with the most padded stats ever, the battle took over 10 minutes of just beating away as there's not even access to mana restoration items before that point so you just keep attacking and using potions until the stupid thing dies.","timestamp_created":1584514001,"timestamp_updated":1584873766,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56994330883026123","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx8/1gPECe6T1+AE="}
