      \ to place a Terrain Card on a space on the board. These Terrain Cards replace\
      \ the original text on a space with new space, creating new opportunities for\
      \ strategies when travelling the land.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Burn &amp; Fireproof\
      \ Cards</h2>Burn is a new effect found in The Firelands expansion. If a player\
      \ is instructed to Burn a card, the card is then removed from the game and its\
      \ effects no longer interact with the game unless specifically stated. Some\
      \ cards are Fireproof, this makes them immune to the ravages of flame and cannot\
      \ be burnt. These cards can be recognised by the Fireproof symbol.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Fireland Tokens</h2>These tokens represent areas of Ifrit influence\
      \ that are dangerous to even the most stoic adventurer. If a character ends\
      \ their turn on a space with a Fireland token they most lose one life. Each\
      \ space can only have one Fireland token on it at any time and tokens cannot\
      \ be placed in the Inner Region.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Strength / Craft</h2>Many\
      \ of the enemies in The Firelands expansion will have a Strength / Craft Value.\
      \ If your Character encounters one of these enemies you can choose whether you\
      \ want to fight the enemies through Strength or in Psychic combat.<br><br><br><img\

      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dervish</h2>Years of training has made the Dervish\
      \ a master of any and all weapons, and he\u2019s ready to leap from one battle\
      \ to the next in order to prove his skills! When playing as the Dervish:<br><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You begin the game with a Sword and a Water Bottle.<br></li><li>One\
      \ Weapon you are carrying does not count towards your capacity.<br></li><li>You\
      \ may use two weapons at the same time in battle.<br></li><li>When you defeat\
      \ an enemy in battle and take it as a trophy you immediately move a number of\
      \ spaces equal to the defeated enemies strength. You can then encounter the\
      \ space you landed on. </li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Nomad</h2>Roaming the\
      \ land comes naturally to the Nomad. Being aware of how dangerous the land is,\
      \ she  is careful to only encounter situations she\u2019s sees fit. When playing\
      \ as the Nomad: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>When you encounter a space not in\
      \ the inner region, you may ignore all the printed text on that space and instead\
      \ treat it as a \u201Cdraw one card\u201D space. <br></li><li>When you encounter\
      \ a Place card, you may choose to ignore it. <br></li><li>Instead of moving\
      \ normally you may spend 1 fate to stay in your current space and encounter\
      \ it unless you used this ability on your last turn. </li></ul><h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Jin Blooded</h2>Skilled in magic, the Jin Blooded has developed the\
      \ ability to change their fate and gain Spells to their advantage. When playing\
      \ as the Jin Blooded:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You begin the game with 2 spells.<br></li><li>At\
      \ the start of your turn you may discard 1 of your spells to gain 1 fate.<br></li><li>When\
      \ your turn ends you may spend 1 fate to draw 1 Spell, if your Craft allows.\
      \ <br></li><li>Whenever another character casts a Spell on you, your space or\
      \ one of your cards, you either gain 1 fate or spend 2 fate to bind that Spell.\
      \ If you bind a Spell it has no effect and you may immediately cast it on a\
      \ new target. </li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Warlord</h2>As a cruel person,\
      \ the Warlord cares not for those that follow her. She merely see her followers\
      \ as a necessary sacrifice when it comes to protecting herself. When playing\
      \ as the Warlord:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>When you encounter a Follower you\
      \ may immediately conscript it. Ignore all the text on the conscripted Follower\
      \ and treat them as \u201CAdd 1 strength during battle\u201D. <br></li><li>When\
      \ you defeat another character in battle you may take on of his Followers as\
      \ a conscripted Followers, in addition to the normal reward. <br></li><li>When\
      \ you would lose a life you may discard one of your conscripted Followers to\
      \ prevent the loss of that life.</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/525520/extras/TDE_Firelands_Banner03_Endings.png?t=1594894994\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A Hero Rises</h2>The fate of the land is in your hands.\
      \ Whenever you are victorious in battle, you\u2019ll earn 1 fate in addition\
      \ to any other rewards. If you lose a battle, you\u2019ll lose one of your fate.\
      \ The first character to reach the Crown of Command with 13 or more fate wins\
      \ the game!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Crown of Flame</h2>Bitter about the history\
      \ of the Crown, the Iftirt have replaced the Crown of Command with the Crown\
      \ of Flame. When this hidden ending is revealed, a fire token is placed on the\
      \ character who revealed it, which represents the Crown of Flame. Unlike the\
      \ Crown of Command, the Crown of Fire causes the wearer to lose 1 Life, 1 Spell\
      \ and 1 Object every turn. The only way to rid the Crown is to land on another\
      \ Character and pass on the crown. The last character alive wins!<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Spreading Flames</h2>Ifrit are taking no mercy on the land of Talisman.\
      \ While this ending is in play, the number of fire tokens in play are not limited.\
      \ When the ending is revealed, each character must teleport to any space in\
      \ the Outer or Middle Region that does not contain a character, as the Inner\
      \ Region is no longer in play. Each player will then have a Fire Token placed\
      \ in the space adjacent to them. At the start of the players turn they must\
      \ place 1 Fire Token on their space. Spaces can have multiple Fire Tokens and\
      \ the characters must take one life per fire token on that space. The last character\
