Simply put, the game is unplayable.  \"Unplayable\" as in you can't progress because of game-breaking bugs.  You're supposed to switch between two universes, manipulating objects to solve puzzles and make your way through a series of areas I assume is a space station.  The problem is that the objects you need to manipulate behave as if they have a mind of their own.  When switching between universes, objects might stay where they are, but they also might decide to bounce around the room, ricocheting off of everything, or they may disappear entirely (in an area where they are clearly not meant to do so).  There is no consistency in behavior, even when you continuously reload and play the same room.\n\nI'm probably about 15-20 minutes into the game, but it took over an hour to get to this point because of bugs and the mechanic just not working right.  Now I've been stuck in one room for about 1.5 hours, trying to move some wooden crates where they need to go, and the bugs are preventing it from working.\n\nThere has been no response to posts on the discussion board, so it's pretty clear this game has already been abandoned.  Save your money and buy a game that might actually work properly.","timestamp_created":1579470807,"timestamp_updated":1579470871,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nZvz3+8Cd7r27AE="}
