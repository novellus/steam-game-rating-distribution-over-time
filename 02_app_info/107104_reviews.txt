The singers are on point, and overall this is a recommended listen.\n\n[h1] Soundtrack [/h1]\n[olist]\n[*] Get Used to it: This song features Logan Cunningham, the voice of the stranger, as he ushers you into the soundtrack, and a bit of the story of the game.\n[*] A Proper Story: Staple song for an electronic rock style, featuring several string instruments, but also an electronic industrial feel.\n[*] In Case of Trouble: One of the more funky rock songs you'll get used to hearing, as it is played quite often, Darren Korb proves that he can jam.\n[*]Bynn the Breaker: A more industrial sounding song, with rhythmic hammer like beats, and prominent violins to keep the frontier feell.\n[*] The Sole Regret: A very slow start song, that encompasses guitars, sitars, and has a nice desert vibe to the whole thing.\n[*] Twisted Streets: Has the trip hop very upfront, it feels like the start of it could either be part of a stairway to heaven or a Tame Impala song.\n[*] Terminal March: I got a weakness for industrial music, ever since (as a bet) I listened to Sasha Grey's industrial album, I've got this itch to scratch, and this song definitely scratches it.\n[*] Percy's Escape: Interesting rhythm this one takes, as it is aggressive, and the violins that encompass the background and foreground run at different tunes.\n[*] Faith of Jevel: A more somber song for the soundtrack to this point, a lot more electric sounds accompany this song, though the guitar is never lost.\n[*] Mine, Windbag, Mine: This one follows up from Percy's Escape, just heavy beating, sounds like mining, which is great. The sliding steel they used to make it, just perfect.\n[*] Slinger's Song: Long range western shootouts, that's what this song is supposed to sound like, and that's what it exactly sounds like.\n[*] Build That Wall (Zia's Theme): This beautifully sad song is the hands down, best song in the soundtrack, and have at one point or another been my obsession. This song is composed so damn well. Give it a listen, don't take my advice.\n[*] Spike in a Rail: A harmonica joins the set for this song, same industrial feel nothing outstanding, but that's being compared to the previous song at this point.\n[*] What's Left Undone: Build That Wall (Zia's Theme) is hummed by the voice actor for Ruckus (Logan Cunningham again) although out of tune, this gives the song a different vibe, a sad, tired and defeated feel.\n[*] Brusher Patrol: A more hip hop version of the trip hop sound track, feels more like a carnival with guns. With a touch of grunge. \n[*] The Mancer's Dilemma: This song is lead primarily by a harp, which I believe is a first at this point, and followed by several flutes, it's upbeat and a nice windup.\n[*] Mother, I'm Here (Zulf's Theme): A terribly sad song with great love and detail into the lyrics.\n[*] Pale Watchers: A suspenseful song piano lead,\n[*] The Bottom Feeders: A lot more psychedelic rock than anything with this one. Feels like, if it were less electronic and more physical, the song could fit on the Flying Microtonal Banana album.\n[*] From Wharf to Wilds: A very nice upbeat song featuring a trumpet as a prominent instrument.\n[*] Setting Sail, Coming: Another song in the album with lyrics, which I believe are sung by the previous 2 singers for Build That Wall (Zia's Theme) and Mother, I'm Here (Zulf's Theme) and encompasses parts from both songs.\n[*] The Pantheon (Ain't Gonna Catch You): This song is fully sung by Logan Cunningham, this invokes some very nice old Johnny Cash vibes. I love it.\n[/olist]\n\nAll in all, I'd give this a solid 8 out of 10, if every song was as much of a hit as Build That Wall, it'd be a 10.","timestamp_created":1609126942,"timestamp_updated":1609261325,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rOPc1/YCdJL9vQI="}
