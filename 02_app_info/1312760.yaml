    review: "It is a solid up/down or golf format solitaire game.  like many before\
      \ it it has a story along side the levels and the interwoven \"rpg\" type equipment\
      \ system adds to the over all theme of this game, \nthe deck feels random, as\
      \ in you cant be sure that with 12 cards left and 2 one the board that youll\
      \ pull a card you need to win.  other solitaire games ive played (all of them\
      \ or almost all) you can bet on getting the card you need with in 5 draws. \n\
      the art style is also refreshingly different than other solitaire games, and\
      \ reflects the themes well.\n\nover all if you enjoy a good casual solitaire\
      \ game, youll enjoy this one with its slightly different take on buffs and power\
      \ ups."
