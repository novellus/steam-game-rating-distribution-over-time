I have played this game for 4 hours, and i enjoyed all of it. However the game doesn't have much more to offer me i believe. As of writing this i have beaten 14 bosses, with 2 unlocked after the big bad guy. I don't know where the presumably last boss is as i can't reread the story. So now i have to replay the game again.\n\nIs it a fun game? Yes. Is it worth the 10 Euro's i spend on? maybe.","timestamp_created":1601994461,"timestamp_updated":1602014728,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541778981685638428","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9Jnh//QCdMScpgI="}
