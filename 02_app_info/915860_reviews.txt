While trying to save your company from a hacker, you progress through the building from the basement to the upper levels through hallways, offices, elevator shafts, and even outside. Along the way you pick up several additional weapons and a few upgrades to your character (roll, double-jump).\n\nThe first few levels feel basic (lacking the additional weapons and upgrades). However, they pass quickly and each new level feels more engaging as your environment changes, level design varies (e.g. an epic \"battle wave\" in an elevator a la TMNT?!?), and enemies get tougher and room setups become more sophisticated. There are a couple of slower points in the game, but there also are unexpected twists to levels that I found delightfully entertaining--and surprisingly challenging.\n\nPerhaps the biggest detractor to enjoying the game is some issues in resolution and a minor bug or two as you go through the game (enemy stuck in a crate?). None of it harms the gameplay or is overtly distracting, but things like the pause menu and cut scene fades don't center properly.\n\nAll in all, for an inexpensive game from a new developer, give it a go! Playing it all the way through I think you'll agree there's more here than meets the eye.","timestamp_created":1556921396,"timestamp_updated":1556921396,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.46531301736831665","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsuXvv+oCfri/wAE="}
