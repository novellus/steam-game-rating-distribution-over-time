    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Basics:</h2>Turn based, 4X, empire space builder,
      singleplayer, asymmetric, Emperor focused grand strategy.<h2 class="bb_tag">Core
      features/promises:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> You will feel like the Emperor
      (assassins, imperial court, granting audiences, rebels, imperial officials)<br></li><li>
      No micromanagement (no moving individual ships around or constructing boring
      farms, you deal with more important things)<br></li><li> Unique mechanics (if
      you are bored with other games and wanted to see something fresh, you won't
      be disappointed)</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">The premise behind the game:</h2>You
      are the emperor, not a logistics officer. You don't deal with low level stuff
      like building farms, factories or individual ships. Instead you focus on the
      grander scale of things. You grant audiences, make edicts, appoint imperial
      officials, deal with court factions and assassins, crush rebels, decide on production
      quotas and priorities.<br><br><br>In the game there is no micromanagement, late
      game does not drag on forever. You can play a relatively fast paced game on
      a huge galaxy without late game slow downs. You own hundreds of planets, thousands
      of ships and all this is managed on the high level by edicts and a hierarchical
      fleet system. The whole premise was to make the player make only the important
      and interesting choices leaving everything else abstracted.<br><br>Another important
      feature is the asymmetric nature of the game. The AI plays by different rules,
      and does not try to win the game. Aliens are more like creatures living in the
      galaxy than computer controlled players. Sometimes they can be valuable assets
      worthy of protection and sometimes an obstacle to overcome. Aliens are not created
      equal, some are primitive beasts that shall be cleansed from the face of the
      galaxy, some are fellow humanoids inferior to Terrans of course but considered
      sentient and worthy of compassion.<br><br>In short it's a fast paced turn based
      space empire builder with no micromanagement, asymmetric mechanics, and focus
      on you as the emperor.

    review: 'It''s like starting in the middle of a 4x generic space empires game
      with no real indication of what''s happening at all. Or why anything happens.

      Just play a real 4x instead.
