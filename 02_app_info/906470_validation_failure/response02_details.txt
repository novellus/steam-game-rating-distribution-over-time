{"906470":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Gravia","steam_appid":906470,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Gravia is a first-person action puzzle game where you create small black holes called Rifts. You'll use this power to solve puzzles, move yourself at high speeds, destroy obstacles, and hopefully not destroy yourself in the process. Gameplay alternates between pure problem solving and challenges that rely on gravity-assisted speed and agility.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe Physics system simulates the gravitational effects of having a black hole in a closed environment. From the instant a Rift forms, it begins to pull any loose or flexible objects as they &quot;fall&quot; into the Rift. Even reinforced objects might bend and break if the forces are strong enough.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nGravia has a rich, linear storyline that takes place within a high-tech research facility called `Gravia Technologies.` Each wing of the facility introduces new gravity-based game and puzzle concepts.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBlack holes are extremely dangerous, and it's very easy to kill yourself accidentally or destroy things around you. Much of the challenge of Gravia comes from performing controlled actions with a tool that is anything but subtle. On the other hand, most of the environments in Gravia are designed to be highly destructible, as there's a special joy that comes from watching the world fall apart around you. Most large, destructible objects in Gravia bend and deform as they are drawn into black holes.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nGameplay typically alternates between challenges that require pure problem solving skills, and those that require speed and timing to proceed. As your mastery of the Gravia Glove increases, you'll develop the skill to move through areas without ever needing to touch the ground.","about_the_game":"Gravia is a first-person action puzzle game where you create small black holes called Rifts.
