    review: A nice abandoned project for no-one to buy. If this game actually got
      updates to fix a couple major flaws, or if it was even play-tested before release
      to discover parts of the map being inaccessible then that'd be cool. But it
      hasn't, and it wasn't, and what you're left with is a bare bones game that you
      can play for 5 minutes before the sheer amount of spawned entities causes the
      game to run at quarter speed. Needless to say, don't get this.
