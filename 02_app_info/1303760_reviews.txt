A bit wonky at times, sure, but for a first published game it is not too bad. The major issue is lack of content. As of writing, there are three levels in the game, each only taking about 5 minutes to beat. After I completed the third (and last) level, i ended up in what i can only presume was a testing level, with a springboard that i did not find in the actual game. \n\nI think a month or two could have been spent on finishing up properly,  such as implementing some more mechanics , or at the very least adding more levels. Right now you could finish the game and refund it, as it takes nowhere near two hours. I won't do that, as it is visually pleasing and I personally like the music a lot and see some potential in this game.","timestamp_created":1589487117,"timestamp_updated":1589487117,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4rJS0ivICf9jehwI="}
