First menu seems very console like, no mouse interaction possible. That shouldnt be aproblem though. A problem comes up, when you start playing - I can hear various nefarious activities going on, but all I have is black screen and some numbers on top. Is there some undocumented dependencies for Linux? I would not like to get money return, rather a goodlooking game functioning at least for 90%, not like 5% as of now.","timestamp_created":1498341135,"timestamp_updated":1498341135,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467836260795593262","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4qeqF7twCft/0fA=="}
