    short_description: The inhabitants of a small portside town begin to fear the
      worst when they hear the news. This is the last week before the end of the world.
      With the limited time you have left you must decide which of the town's folk
      to try and help.

      \ do love this though; it's a cute little indie game with a pretty great story,\
      \ multiple endings, etc. \nNot perfect, but definitely one of my favorites."
