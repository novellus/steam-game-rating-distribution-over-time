All in all, very glad I stumbled upon this hidden gem in Steam's library of puzzle-games.","timestamp_created":1609543429,"timestamp_updated":1609543429,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uPWQ4PYCeKjGvwI="}
