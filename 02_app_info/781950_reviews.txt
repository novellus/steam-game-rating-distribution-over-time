With that said, I personally prefer games with more content and a longer amount of game play.\n\nI was hoping for more to do with the random items you can buy from random planets but all and all, it's a short, simple, and sweet game. \n\nI have to say the pixel art in this is so beautiful and the soundtrack  is very nice and relaxing.\n","timestamp_created":1522373902,"timestamp_updated":1522373902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530228734016418457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw68ejuuICe4H5nAE="}
