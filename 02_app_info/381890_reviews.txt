Using this you can get the copy to activate things that you need to be somewhere else to make use of. A lot of the levels require you to move in such a way that when the copy makes the same movements the effects or context will be different, like crossing a bridge that you can destroy or performing movements after you've moved the copy to a different location.\n\nThe main problem I have with this game is the emphasis on timing. Almost all of the puzzles require you to move in a very precise way so that when your copy makes the same movements it will be in the right position for the right amount of time, and I just don't find it fun to deal with a theoretical object at that level of precision. Furthermore the emphasis on timing means that you spend a lot of time in puzzles just sitting around to make sure your copy will give you enough time later, this breaks the cardinal rule of puzzle games in that once you figure out the solution the actual ceremony of solving the puzzle should be fast.\n\nThere's another issue on top of the timing and that's the visuals. With the isometric viewpoint it can be very hard to tell where objects and platforms are in relation to each other, and that will definitely cause you to mess up and wreck your puzzle solution from time to time.\n\nIf you like the idea of a puzzle game built around time mechanics I recommend Braid. In fact one of the worlds in Braid has pretty much the exact same central copy gimmick as this game.","timestamp_created":1608940291,"timestamp_updated":1608940291,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u5CUzvYCc/2avQI="}
