    short_description: Chaos Caves is an all-action couch game where you blast each
      other with completely unreasonable weaponry. Games last about a minute, everyone
      gets a turn at the Nuke, and failure is just as funny as winning. Next time,
      grapple out of range!

    review: "Very underestimated little game. I've played this for 50h+ with my kids\
      \ and had such a great time of it. While it has a little learning curve to it,\
      \ due to many controls and unusual interface, it's still extremely simple to\
      \ get started with. Between digging, light gravity maneuvers, and portals, it\
      \ has some complexity to it as well. \n\nIt contains some really novel ideas,\
      \ which makes this game stand out. For example, \"Sudden Death\" after one player\
      \ is out, makes the waiting really short for the dead player.\n\nSingle player\
      \ is only there for something to do when waiting for the other players. So,\
      \ don't get your hopes up on that. Aim for multiplayer.\n\nIt has some likeness\
      \ to Liero, which is a great game, though Liero is bit dated in terms of usability\
      \ compared to Chaos Caves. \nChaos Caves has support for more players and hand\
      \ controls, but less variety in guns and mods than Liero, due to that games\
      \ large amount of user-created enhancements.\n\nThere are some UX tweaks needed\
      \ to make it a bit easier to use, and it would be sweet with an update and some\
      \ new content but, it's totally playable and recommended, as is."
