Over the game's 3-hour span, the gameplay and story range from wholesome fluff to dark realism. I highly recommend Kimmy. It made me smile, and it made me cry. From the beautiful soundtrack and art to the wonderful story, it's worth every penny.","timestamp_created":1585514342,"timestamp_updated":1585514416,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+MCBlPECcvOa/AE="}
