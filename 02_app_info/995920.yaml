    review: 'Myths of the World: Black Rose Collector''s Edition, is great!  I loved
      the beautiful animation and scenery. The voice actors were very good and believable.
      I really love Eipix Games.  The best thing; I can actually solve the puzzles
      in the game!  Great, great game!!!!'
