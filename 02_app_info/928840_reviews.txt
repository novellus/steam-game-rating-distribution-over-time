It's a fun challening hybrid of a 2D Platformer and a Beat-m-Up, punishing you when you fail the timing-based combat and also sending you back to the start upon death unless you've reached the boss. It took some getting used to at first, but I did enjoy the combat overall due to it not being a simple button masher. The combat did also get some upgrades after each stage, though it made the fights a bit too easy in my opinion. The stages were also fun to go through, albeit a bit short and also linear, but they did all have their own gimmicks. But being a bit short is also one of my main issues with the game as a whole, as it can easily be beaten in an hour or less depending on skill. There is nothing else to do aside from the campaign, so when you've finished the game in that short amount of time, you're pretty much done unless you're an achievement hunter (which are satanic on Steam btw). There is a lot of potential in this game, but due to the short time and simplicity, none truly reach the potential they deserve. Despite being a time-travelling warrior for example, the main protagonist only goes to one era. It's literally just a barberian in a cyber-punk timeline, and that's it. Coins have no other functionality than buying hearts either. I'm fine with simplicity, but this game took it a bit too far and while I certainly enjoyed the game, it's not one that I'll revisit anytime soon. I would definitely be interested in a sequel however!\n\n[h1]Join our growing Gaming Community![/h1]\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Nepsgamingparadise]Nep's Gaming Paradise[/url] is not just my community; it's [i]our[/i] community.
