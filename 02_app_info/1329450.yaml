    review: It was the fun, casual game alternative to my FB games I missed when I
      quit my FB addiction, upbeat music, no pressure. I was able to progress fairly
      quickly being as I'd played many "match 3" type games on FB, which I've sworn
      off of. It was really fun, a nice escape, however, after about the 40th level,
      knowing not to be tempted by the "try it now" bonuses, I had to. Then, I couldn't
      progress any further unless I PURCHASED power-ups/bonuses. I even tried going
      way back to gain additional points from levels where I didn't get the full 3
      stars, nothing. I kept playing, but once you reach a level where you can't possibly
      pass without buying "extras", it's no fun. I might've paid a small fee upfront
      to play the game without requiring additional purchases, but at level 70, I'm
      pretty much done and have NO interest in purchasing items with REAL $ (instead
      of points)  to pass levels.
