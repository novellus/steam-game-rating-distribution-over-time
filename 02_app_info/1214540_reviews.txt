Requires skill to master efficient use.\nLots of enemy variety.\nStage challenges are interesting.\nPerfect to pick up and just shoot things, but multiplayer is definitely the best way to play.\nBeautiful explosions.\nDefinitely worth my time.\n","timestamp_created":1589924925,"timestamp_updated":1589924925,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498800963163375854","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45KG6l/ICdo30iAI="}
