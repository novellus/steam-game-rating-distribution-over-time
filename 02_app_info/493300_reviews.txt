All tables reviewed on DX11. Surprised no else did a review. Lets start with Indy 500. This is a great table and a very good challenge.  Its not an extremly hard table. However I have yet to complete an entire race. A good table. Next up the Dr. Who table. This is a hard table but fun to play on. I enjoyed this table a lot but its not the easiest table. \n\nFrank Thomas' Big Hurt is a easy table to play.  Not many cheap drains and the sound effects are good. Lots of fun to play on. I had no issues with the table. Bone Busters. I just dont care for this table. Drains are common. The ball moves to fast. Its just an annoying table to play. Table is blah.\n\nEight Ball Deluxe is a hard but enjoyable old school table. The ball does like to drain down the sides a lot. Overall though I enjoyed this table. Centigrade is a hard but old school table and its not easy. That being said I do enjoy this table even though I am not very good at this table. Fun but hard. Following that is another old school Jacks Open. A fun and enjoyable table and slightly easier then Centigrade. Both tables are fun and generally I am not a fan of old school pinball tables.\n\nGladiators is a very strange but unique pinball table. I enjoyed this table and its generally a easy table. You fight dragons and other things. Its a nice addition to this group. I enjoyed this table. This pack does include the new Dr Who pinball table made by this company. Its a good pinball table but not great. There is supposed to be one more table. So far a majority of the tables I really enjoy. My favorites from this batch are Indy 500, Big Hurt, Dr Who, Centigrade. For $30 bucks I consider it a good value for real pinball tables. \n\nUPDATE. New table Als garage rock band goes on a world tour. Fun table to play on. . the table is very fun to play. The next table up is Cactus Jack. This should be a good addition for the pack. Hope they fix the initals thing. The high score glitch has been fixed according to farsight. Just got the update.\n\nCACTUS JACK IS HERE! Loads of fun. Love the sound effects and its a easy table to play. The last table will be Swords of Fury. I am really loving this years tables.","timestamp_created":1485328431,"timestamp_updated":1504666017,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.736479043960571289","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zqvFqt4Ccq+5cA=="}
