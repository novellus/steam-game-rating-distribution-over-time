It is so far away from what I would expect at a $50 price point that I'm not sure it ever will be. This experience, at the price of a AAA game, pissed me off honestly.\n\nNo tutorial whatsoever, no mouseovers (this is minor compared to the other things).\n\nThere are only 6 planes for both sides combined. Aircraft performance ratings look really simple and arcadey. Se5a has a full circle of speed, Camel has a circle with one pie slice missing. Camel has full maneuverability, Se5a is missing a slice there. It doesn't make me believe that the in-game aircraft flight characteristics resemble those of the actual planes.\n\nI fought a dogfight, and there was nothing about the gameplay, graphics, sound, or experience at all which stuck out. The AI pilot (playing the second lowest difficulty) largely just flew in a straight line or a turn which was so shallow it actually kept throwing me off when I was trying to track and lead him. You just assume that when dogfighting, your opponent will try to turn sharply, but this AI wouldn't do what every other combat flight AI knows well to do.\n\nGraphics resembled Red Baron 3-D. Better than that, yes, but closer to Red Baron 3d than a modern game like Rise of Flight.\n\nThe management interface is a disaster. It's not readily apparent what I'm supposed to do, what the resources are, or how many I need. That's not because the interface is too complicated, but because it's so poorly put together. The fonts are messed up, it's super simplistic. \n\nIf you've ever coded, have you ever written a program and created an interface, and you're at the point where you're just testing stuff... so you've got the basic buttons and they're not sized right and it looks really ugly, but you don't care because you're just doing runs to test out numbers or screen loading or something? It looks like that, like zero time was put into it.\n\nI can't exit the settings menu without completely exiting the game. Same thing if I complete a dogfight.\n\nIn the career menu, if I select 'mission', the map of the front only covers the upper left portion of the screen and I can't interact with it or start a mission. The rest of the screen is the main squadron screen and the whole setup with the map looks unintentional. It's probably not resizing like it is supposed to, and if that's the case then this aspect of the game was not tested at all.\n\nI know that the reviews on the VR and VR controls have been poor so far. But I wasn't playing VR. I was on a standard flatscreen using an Xbox 360 controller - the controller did work without having to remap or anything, that's the one positive thing I can say.\n\nAll I can think is that this game was entirely written with VR in mind, then they realized they couldn't get VR working by their deadline, and so tried to throw a more simplified version out there so they would have something released in December. \n\nNo real positives here. I wouldn't have kept what I played tonight if it had been $5 instead of $50. Warplanes WW1 dogfight which is free to play, arcadey, based on a mobile game, and also with simplistic squadron management, is a much better title than this. As far as the more detailed sims, like Rise of Flight or WOFF, it's not even worth comparing this to them.","timestamp_created":1608619452,"timestamp_updated":1608653521,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.672160208225250244","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hpjOxfYCfLSOvAI="}
