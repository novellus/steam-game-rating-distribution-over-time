I actually found some of the puzzles rather hard; back then they expected you to work a bit more to earn progress! Fortunately, with a few hints from the Strategy Guide even the hardest ones are solvable without a skip. Although putting the skip button so close the the Guide button led to me skipping more than one by accident.\n\nI also kept forgetting (literally every time I restarted the game) that [spoiler]you sometimes need to use items from your inventory to complete the hidden object puzzles[/spoiler]. This is pretty unusual, and can lead to a few situations where progress seems completely blocked.\n\nThe story is better than many of the genre, with the dialog and voice acting (mostly) pretty decent too. The protagonists especially is quite well-rounded and shows a fair bit of emotion (for the genre; the bar has been set pretty low by a lot of other HoGs).\n\nThe graphics seemed slightly blurry in places, and certainly there are prettier games out there. But they never fell below 'easily good enough'. The cut-scenes were the only bits I felt were sub-par, but this is forgivable; I'd rather more time/resources be spent on the rest of the game.\n\nThe bonus chapter is pretty solid too, and for a change seems more than just a bolt-on afterthought knocked up just so there can be a 'collectors edition.'\n\nOverall; definitely a worthy addition to any HoG fan's collection.","timestamp_created":1590478847,"timestamp_updated":1590478847,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4waf7p/ICdOetigI="}
