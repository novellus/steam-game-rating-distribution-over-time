    review: 'I got Borderlands 2 for free in 2020. I liked the game and the humor
      so I thought I''d get Borderlands 1 to get all the back story. Well there isn''t
      much. In fact, the 2nd game is almost exactly the same as the first. I''m talking
      stupid similar but with a better interface and more polish. They should have
      just called it Borderlands The Remake.


      In 2020, it is not worth going back to play Borderlands 1. There isn''t enough
      content difference to merit it. Save your money.'
