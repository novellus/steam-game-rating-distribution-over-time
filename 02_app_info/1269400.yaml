    about_the_game: Welcome to the 100-Player Twitch Chat Party Pack, a set of games
      that let you play in real-time with or against your viewers, while they control
      their characters with Twitch Chat commands.  Imagine something like Twitch Plays
      Pokemon but everyone can control a character and it's absolute chaos.  And if
      you need to step away, AFK Mode will give your channel something to stay engaged
      with during the downtime.<br><br>Current games included in the pack are:<h2
      class="bb_tag">Happy Tanksgiving</h2><br>In this free-for all game, everyone
      controls a tank on a battlefield and it's everyone versus 100. You'll be commanding
      a large tank with heavy armor that can be controlled in real-time. And each
      of your viewers can command their own hovertank by using tile-based controls.
      They can kill you, or kill each other, but either way that last tank standing
      is the victor. A quick demo of a streamer playing it can be found below!<h2
      class="bb_tag">Minesweeper 100</h2><br>Why are we always minesweeping from the
      comfort of our computer? Why aren't we <strong>actually there on the minefield</strong>
      with 100 of our friends, living or dying together, as a team? With Minefield
      of Dreams, everyone is a minesweeper on an active minefield, frantically trying
      to work together to clear it without tripping mines. But beware! A single mistake
      will cost you your life, and the lives of those next to you. Oh, and this area
      is really prone to earthquakes, so watch out for random mines exploding. Get
      moving and clear that field fast!<h2 class="bb_tag">Bombertown</h2><br>The ultimate
      in 100-Player bomb-planting action! Control your bomber and be the last one
      standing, all the while collecting powerups and tightening the noose (made of
      bombs) around your enemies.
