    review: "Nice game for sure! The graphics, sound and design are great!\nIt\xB4\
      s an interesting arpg with a special combat mechanic as you command a party\
      \ of 4 characters (out of 18 IIRC)\nCombat is well done as you can switch characters\
      \ and combine their abilities/skills in real-time. I really enjoyed the pace\
      \ of the whole thing - not as \"hack and slash\" than PoE or Grim Dawn - more\
      \ strategic, where you need more than 1 devastating attacks to clean the screen.\
      \ \nBeing a fan of the Souls series, i really appreciate that ( i also love\
      \ and play a lot of PoE and Grim Dawn for sure) when you have to fight your\
      \ way through.\nBut enemies do not respawn, so no grinding needed !\n\nAlso\
      \ have to say the normal mode was a bit too easy as i died maybe 3 times in\
      \ my entire playthrough (with 2 of them being against the final boss). Gonna\
      \ try Hard next.\n\nAll in all it's a beautiful and well-designed game that\
      \ i recommend if you like story driven and slower arpg's\n\n"
