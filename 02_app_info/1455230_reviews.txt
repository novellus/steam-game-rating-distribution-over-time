The Dungeon Slime in my first impression was only a game a little different, but when a started to play... I LOVED THE GAME!\n  The puzzles are very challengers, and you need to be smart, not is impossibel and not is too easy. The visual is wonderful, with a great color palette, and a love the slime expressions. The music really make you feel inside the dungedon and the sounds emphasize the visual.\n  The unique problem is that it is short, but seeing the product quality and its price, it's definitely worth it experiment this game.","timestamp_created":1608921409,"timestamp_updated":1608921409,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43ozMzfYCcuOQvQI="}
