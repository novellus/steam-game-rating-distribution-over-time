Mission mode also got some extra challenges for good players. \nThere is also a manual in both languages in the game folder. It can help you to understand how each character works. \n\nYour goal is pretty much to beat the other player in puyu puyu smash bros with top music in the background and all the visual candy. \n\nThe game has some minor flaws. occasionally you will get lags. From my experience these lags mostly show up when using Aranha's method Trick Trap Tears or when you are about to lose your game. \n\nThe game is hopefully getting an online vs mode in the future. \n\nI believe that if you are familiar with the other games you won't be disappointed by this game.","timestamp_created":1555064099,"timestamp_updated":1607345069,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581589937210083008","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vOvOnvYCdq6KvwE="}
