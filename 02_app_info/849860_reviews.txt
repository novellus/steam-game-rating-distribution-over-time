Why is that? Well, because it's too late to refund it now. This is a terrible game. While I only wasted a few bucks, I hate that any of my money went to these devs. \n\nIt's a zombie wave shooter. It's been abandoned in Early Access and it's just horrible all the way around. Bad graphics? Checks. Bad sounds? Check. Very little content? Check. Low quality content? Check. \n\nYou do have full locomotion. No turning. You have a few different weapons that you can upgrade. A few different characters you can buy with different stat bonuses. However, in single player, you're only really played two different modes. You're playing a wave shooter or you're playing in the target practice arena. You put your hands down to reload. The gun angle, relative to your Oculus Rift Touch controllers, seemed too low so you have to aim higher than normal. \n\nThe wave shooter only has one map. You can choose to do the whole run, which takes less than 5 minutes to complete. Or you can choose to only do the boss fight. You can play in the target practice arena where you will try out the different weapons with infinitely respawning zombies in a very small area. Have fun with that. The game is too dark in the wave shooter area. In the practice area, where it is daylight, you can see why. The game looks worse in the daylight. It's that ugly. \n\nThen there's the multiplayer modes. Well, I did try it. On the one that requires at least 2 players to start, I was just in the queue until I decided to quit. In the other mode, where you can start with only 1 player, the mode was bugged and wouldn't start. It just puts this pop up alert that you can get rid of, so you have to manually quit the game.\n\nThis is one of the worst zombie shooters out there. Considering how many bad zombie shooters there are in VR, that's quite the accomplishment. I don't recommend this game at any price. Even if they gave it away for free, you should avoid playing it.\n\nRate 2.5/10. It ran smoothly, the upgrades seemed nice, & it seemed that the gunsights were accurate. Everything else though is absolutely terrible.","timestamp_created":1591580077,"timestamp_updated":1591580077,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551752209663391113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4vJXkyPICdpLojAI="}
