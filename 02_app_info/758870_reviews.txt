[spoiler] is there no quest line to reunite with them and rekindle our relationship? [/spoiler] there isn't any clear direction of what i should do.","timestamp_created":1609722902,"timestamp_updated":1609722902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw38a95fYCdrGgwAI="}
