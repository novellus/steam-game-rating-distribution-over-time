And occasionally shoot two times at dogs with revolver.\n\nMy main experience with this DLC consisted of getting half way through it, then BOO, I fell through the floor. Then loaded my latest save and saw that it doesn't reload latest state of the world, with various objects missing, so I couldn't progress.\n\nEh, mysterious and spooky.\naka\nEh, abandoned and buggy.","timestamp_created":1497783392,"timestamp_updated":1497783392,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539722204208374023","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8Jq23dwCfb2NfA=="}
