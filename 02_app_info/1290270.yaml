      notes: "This game revolves around vampires: amoral, blood-drinking, exploitative,\
        \ manipulative, murdering, self-destructive vampires. It tells a story that\
        \ is meant to be monstrous, but do not mistake it for an excuse to be a monster\
        \ yourself.\r\n\r\nReader discretion is advised."

    review: "It's pretty good, the only flaws I can think of are as followed\n>Julian\
      \ feels like a author's self insert and it shows though you can always tell\
      \ him to fuck off and eat shit throughout the story\n>It's based off V5 (Which,\
      \ if you didn't know, is one of the worst additions I've ever seen for a tabletop\
      \ game. I need only to speak the magic word 'Rudi' and you'll soon figure out\
      \ the crux of the problem)\n>Needed more illustrations and hell maybe even some\
      \ music since it's pretty empty in that department. \nOverall very solid for\
      \ what it was. Give it a go if you want more VTM because from the looks of it\
      \ Bloodlines 2 is gonna be pure garbage"
