They are worth their price, however do take note this is a personal opinion. My projects will always end up as bulky, so I will always find anything a place to be crammed in, and not just once ^^\nRegarding the files, one thing I will draw attention on! If you plan on releasing your game, do read about Networking rules, some DLCs' file names contain whitespace (that means SPACE in between words comprising the filename). Remove this by adding _ in the whitespace, or uniting the words together, or be met with some awkward errors. Feel free to listen or find out your own way. Do the name change before you add them ingame, or you'll also have to adjust the names in any script you've used :)\nOther than that, enjoy and am waiting for more! ^^\nHappy RPG making, you are more than good enough, you are loved and appreciated!","timestamp_created":1598215717,"timestamp_updated":1598215717,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iJDFjvQCcrWsnQI="}
