Don't expect too much from this title. Having said that, it is corny as hell with some pretty jolly music. It's stupid and really out there. There is no deep and meaningful plot but hey, where else are you going to have the chance to ram a snowman? \nFancy an hour or two of \"What the actual fu-?!\" and \"Who comes up with this shi-?\" Then this is the title for you!! \n\nI did get this during the Christmas sale for 75% off and for that price, I'd say sure, give it a lookie but I'm not sure I'd recommend it at the full price. \nThanks again my [i]\"deer\"[/i] friend (Ha, stolen xmas jokes) for letting me know about this title.
