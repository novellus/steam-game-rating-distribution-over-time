I got it because I love simple little point-and-click mystery hidden object games (which the main reason I got it was for the hidden object aspect, so mission accomplished I guess?). I wasn't expecting this to be particularly mind-blowing or anything, but it honestly was just frustrating and kinda lame. \n\nA lot of the puzzles you have to solve have ridiculous solutions [spoiler] (like having to fill up a teapot with a separate glass in a separate room instead of, y'know, filling it up in the kitchen like a normal person? Or using a boomerang to cut a security alarm wire?? Or having to use a glass cutter to open a glass cabinet because there are 'delicate' things inside, but then you use a hammer to smash open a piggy bank?? I'm sorry, what??) [/spoiler] \n\nI don't know, maybe the detective is just really stupid, but most of those solutions made no logical sense to me (as opposed to most games just like it). I didn't mind it at first, as it seemed kinda silly, but then it just became frustrating and kinda sucked the fun out.
