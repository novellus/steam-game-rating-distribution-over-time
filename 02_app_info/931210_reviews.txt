It just doesn't work. I really wanted to like this game. It's running on the Unity Engine, but it does look beautiful. There's only one court / map / environment though. There's a few different teams, but the players look pretty similar and they are difficult to distinguish. There's only one mode: practice. Ranked does not work. The only settings available are the sound settings. \n\nMotion controllers are used mostly as a gamepad. The only time you're not is when you're using a \"circle\" laser pointer to help in deciding where to pass it to or which defender to switch to. There is no locomotion, so you're in only one spot, however you get a nice 3rd person view of all the action so that's not a big deal.\n\nIt doesn't matter because like I said, the game just doesn't work. Balls will bounce out of bounds on the majority of missed shots. Dunks have a very high miss rate whether guarded or not. Your opponent will sometimes get the ball back on made baskets or the ball going out of bands (when they last touched it). The  ball will bounce on the rim and get stuck on the rim. The AI will stay stuck and your opponent will get a shot clock violation. You can double the opponent's ball handler and they will never pass to the open teammate. The game will get completely stuck and you'll have to quit and restart.\n\nAnyways, you can just see my video and you'll get to see the bugs for yourself. Every game that I played was bugged. Bugs are prevalent. There's so many that I can't possibly name them all. I only played 4-5 games. It's in Early Access, but there hasn't been an update since last September of 2019. [b][u]Refund requested.[/u][/b]\n\n[b]Rate 2/10. It doesn't work. At least it looks pretty and runs well.
