The game is really well made and looks super pretty, and I like the funky dances that he does. I really wish there was a neutral review option, because it definitely wasn't a [i]bad[/i] game, it just wasn't fun for me. So yes, I do recommend this game if you're okay with a difficult puzzle game that is tedious at times. It is definitely not worth $25, and if I had payed full price, then this review would be negative for sure. At the current price of $2.99 I don't feel like I wasted my money, but I do feel like I could have spent it better.","timestamp_created":1609824175,"timestamp_updated":1609824175,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ufC/6PYCe/nNwAI="}
