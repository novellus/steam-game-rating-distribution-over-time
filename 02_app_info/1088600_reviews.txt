On top of that, the combat just isn't engaging. Enemies just fly in straight lines while sometimes shooting at you. There's no dogfighting to speak of. If it gets any kind of updates to make it better down the road, that'd be great. For now though, if you want a space combat fix, look elsewhere. Everspace comes to mind.\n\nWhy this game has as many positive reviews as it does confuses me.","timestamp_created":1576184315,"timestamp_updated":1603396474,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.567077040672302246","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyZL4qPUCeYru4wE="}
