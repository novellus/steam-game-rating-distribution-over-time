Yes!\nIs it difficult? Yes!\nDoes it look cool? Yes!\n\nAll selling points for an Electronic Super Joy game, but where does it fall short? Well, pun not intended, it literally is too short.\n\nOne huge turn off for me is that the game plays very inconsistent until you turn on V-sync... There are games which are buggy at frame rates higher than intended, but it is clear this game comes under the category of being intended for a specific frame rate, so this should be on by default and locked away in a .ini file or something, if people want to disable V-sync.\n\nThis should have been packaged as a DLC not a standalone, would have worked infinitely better.","timestamp_created":1609610628,"timestamp_updated":1609610628,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540636062622070313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuqGR4vYCcNvmvwI="}
