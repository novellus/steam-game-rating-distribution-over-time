    review: 'I really liked this one.


      -Suit and Buggy skin looks really cool and stealth or police-like

      -Pistol reminds me of the Stars Pistol from Resident Evil which is super cool.
      But not only that the pistol is a Desert Egeal with a suppressor. Super cool.

      -Smg is cool but you can only buy Smg ammo in the following. Besides that the
      Smg has an extended mag and extremly good is sticky sittuations

      -The melee is pretty cool and somewhat good


      9/10. Get this and the Volkran pack and you would have a suppressed pistol and
      rifle which makes it really good. If you just get this it is also good. Smg
      good for rough situations, pistol for stealth, cane for... CQC?'
