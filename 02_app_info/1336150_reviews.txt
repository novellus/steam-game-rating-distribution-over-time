The initial story behind it is intriguing but doesn't have any effect on the gameplay and could be completely omitted. The dialogue could also use a writer's stylistic touch, if the creator wishes to keep it in there.\n\nFor controls, the mouse was too sensitive to me and there were no options to change that. I figured this out at the same time I discovered there was no save option (though there are checkpointsâ€”once you click out to the main menu, you start back at the beginning). Still, the arrow keys were find for the most part, as long as I remembered <> were for camera and ^v were for movement. The controller was a lot easier to work with. \n\nHowever, I only got a couple achievements where I should have had more. I saw where someone commented that they got achievements through the mouse/keyboard combo only.\n\nWith all that said, I'll be happy to see how the game progresses if the creator continues to work on it and hope to update this to a more positive review later!","timestamp_created":1607638489,"timestamp_updated":1607638489,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4+pKup/YCdb3xuAI="}
