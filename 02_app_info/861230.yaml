    review: 'Avevoatl Seven Coins is advertised as a first-person puzzle/hidden object
      game, but that might be stretching it a bit.  It''s unlike any hidden object
      game I''ve ever seen, not only because it uses first-person perspective, but
      also because the objects aren''t hidden in the traditional sense.  There are
      no scenes of jumbled objects requiring you to find a list of specific items.


      What you have, instead, is a group of 8 areas, and in each area, you need to
      collect certain objects, usually 10 qty each of 3 to 6 items.  Most of these
      items are in plain sight, but some are "hidden" in boxes, barrels, and bags.  You
      simply click on the box, barrel, or bag to open it and see what''s inside.  Once
      you collect the required items, you are shown a picture which leads you to another
      area or directs you on what to do next, sometimes requiring you to find additional
      items.  As is typical in hidden adventure games, in most cases, you cannot pick
      up these additional items until you "know" you need them (when you see the picture);
      prior to that, the icon does not change to a hand and you cannot pick up the
      additional items.


      Beside the "hidden object" part of the game, there are also some adventure elements,
      such as finding planks of wood to allow you to cross a gap, and a few simple
      mini-games.


      All-in-all, I''d recommend this to casual gamers who like hidden object / adventure
      games.  While it doesn''t follow the traditional formula for that type of game,
      I did find it enjoyable.  The only part I found overly frustrating was that
      the "hint" button (which shows the outline of items needed, allowing you to
      determine the general location of those items) can be used only once every seven
      minutes.  It would be much better if that recharge time were reduced to one
      or two minutes.'
