    about_the_game: 'Can you push back against fate, live among ruthless gangs and
      fight back the zombie horde, with just a handful of ragtag militias to help
      you? <br><br>Enjoy an unique blend of old school turn-based strategy, post-apoc
      survival mechanics and a thrilling RPG storyline. With all the benefits of the
      modern Unreal Engine, real bullet ballistics, day/night cycle, fire with dynamic
      material consumption and spread, advanced sound propagation mechanics, AI NPCs
      with independent lives and faction based morals and, hunger, thirst, wounds
      and sickness and last but not least, advanced modding support.<br><br>Starting
      as an amnesic survivor, rescued half dead by the kind people of Urban city shelter,
      somewhere in backwater south of USA, you need to raise up and become a true
      leader, rebuild the pillaged camp and bring hope back in the hearts of the survivors.
      Then venture out to negotiate alliances with ruthless factions or go to war
      against them. And finally, bet everything you have and know to survive an impending
      return of the massive zombie horde that almost ended civilization just two years
      before.<h2 class="bb_tag">REAL BALLISTICS</h2><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/710230/extras/Combat_Ranged_Auto.gif?t=1606920172"
      /><br>USG brings you the common weapon classes that you can expect to find in
      the context of the story, somewhere in a southern US city: handguns, shotguns,
      hunting, assault and sniper rifles. Each of these classes has special pros and
      cons that make them special in specific situations. Handguns and shotguns for
      example excel in CQB with excellent damage. While pistols do cumulative damage
      due to their low AP costs, shotguns have individual pellet damage adding up
      and a cone of fire!<h2 class="bb_tag">BODY PARTS TARGETING</h2><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/710230/extras/Combat_Ranged_Bodyparts.gif?t=1606920172"
      /><br>Assault rifles bring tremendous cumulative damage too, when used in burst
      mode, with frightening multi-body penetration. Provide you can come by such
      expensive ammo and afford to waste it. And finally the option to aim for specific
      body parts for either instant kills or crippling shots make hunting and sniper
      rifles true long-range exterminators. How much fun they are depends just on
      which side of the barrel you are.<h2 class="bb_tag">MELEE ATTACK MODES</h2><img

      /><br>The ranged arsenal is complemented by a wide array of stuff that can be
      used to smash, slash and punch - basically almost anything that can be wielded
      as a melee weapon in USG is a melee weapon. The melee combat is based on stamina
      management - the more tired you get, the less you will be able to dodge hits.
      And comes with its own array for special moves, for certain popular weapons<h2

      busy NPCs, with their own life and convictions. Among these you''re to find
      those willing to help you - provided you help them first. And as long as you
      serve their interests. Because in Urban everyone has an agenda.<br>Three main
      factions are fighting for control through numerous proxy groups in the town.
      Army rebels, a zombie loving cult and a ruthless gang of bikers. You''re free
      to choose one of them as ally. But be aware - no path will be easy or morally
      justified - an apocalypse comes with a dire lack of innocence. It is all about
      survival. And being able to live with your choices.<h2 class="bb_tag">SURVIVAL

      /><br>You will find the Urban Shelter dilapidated and in ruins, full of refugees
      on the brink of despair, locked down by vicious looters and roaming zombies.
      You need to regain control of the neighborhood fast. Start rebuilding and expanding.
      You have to scavenge resources and show the locals you''re the hero they waited
      for. Then start repairing and upgrading the shelter, hiring the residents as
      specialists and using the refugees as labor. Depending on the allies you make
      you will be able to unlock unique upgrades that will make shelter administration
      more and more rewarding.<h2 class="bb_tag">OLD-SCHOOL TBS (with a twist)</h2><img

      /><br>Urban Strife uses a classic Action Points system (Jagged Alliance 2 style),
      with consecutive turns &amp; interrupts based on skills.  But we''ve also tried
      to avoid the pitfalls of turn-based combat, especially against large numbers
      of foes. And zombies come first in this list of enemies everyone hates to wait
      for in TBS, because they are both numerous and slow. Hence we introduced a special
      turn for the horde, with simultaneous movement for all undead, while still letting
      each AI take individual decisions.'

      notes: Urban Strife is a mature game that displays violence and gore, strong
        language, adult situations and alcohol and drug consumption.
