    about_the_game: Ever wonder what the 'other side' is seeing when the heroes are
      running through their adventures?  <br><br>The Rise of the Goblins puts you
      in charge of the goblin attack on Sandpoint that kicks off the Rise of the Runelords
      campaign. You'll get the opportunity to wreck the havoc you previously attempted
      to solve, using a new deck of cards that turn former monsters into allies and
      vice versa.<br><br><strong>The Rise of the Goblins DLC includes:</strong><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li> A full-length campaign of 5 scenarios<br></li><li> 2 new
      Goblin characters, Ranzak the Raider and Poog the Warcaster<br></li><li> A new
      set of asymmetrical, clumsily carved Goblin Dice<br></li><li> 11 Goblin alternate
      versions of the Iconic characters from the Rise of the Runelords (Merisiel,
      Valeros, Kyra and friends), coming with new skins, goblin-specific powers and
      slightly different stats</li></ul><br>Ranzak, Poog, and the 11 Goblin alt characters
      can adventure in both Rise of the Goblins and Rise of the Runelords.<br><br>This
      new campaign draws inspiration from the <i>We Be Goblins!</i> module for the
      Pathfinder tabletop RPG. Veterans of the physical Pathfinder Adventures game
      will also recognize Ranzak from the <i>Skull &amp; Shackles</i> deck and Poog
      from the <i>Goblin Burn!</i> deck.

    review: 'The character portaits in the actual fights are just your normal portraits,
      fighter, wizard, etc, just with a tiny gobblin icon over it.


      That''s just lazy.  Why include the the new art, but not bother to update the
      button icons?'
