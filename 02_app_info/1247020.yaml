    review: "So, I saw the title, read the concept and decided this is my dream game.\
      \ Easy to say; I was wrong. For about fifteen hours I did my best to love this\
      \ game, did ever rout and explored every possible outcome and I am sad to say\u2026\
      .. I liked it in paces, which makes it worse. The Felix, clone and evil queen\
      \ routs were enjoyable enough but not only was Novas rout 60% virtue signalling,\
      \ most of the game is afraid to be truly, well, evil. Before someone notes in\
      \ their mind though, I have about 65% the same views and opinions as the game\
      \ so it is not what message it speaks of just how and in what type of property.\
      \ Nova, I am here to date you not to hear your views of the American health\
      \ care system. I am not even American, I don\u2019t care. All the character\
      \ except, maybe, the queen are way too careful to preserve your and other peoples\
      \ feeling. No actual bad language or controversial things are said, which, is\
      \ weird as you would consider villains to say something that wouldn\u2019t make\
      \ you just go: \u201Chah, he thinks he is cool lul\u201D. \n\nThis \u201Cwe\
      \ accept all\u201D message the game tries to print on all its characters foreheads\
      \ is frustrating as it has 0 subtility. The one most guilty of this is Satan,\
      \ so much of his dialogue is just discussing pointless details about belief\
      \ systems that and how everyone in them is valid. Like, why? Your Satan and\
      \ why would our evil character ask all those questions? Why is Satan, during\
      \ this villain conference defending his and other people\u2019s goodness and\
      \ explaining that hell is indeed not homophobic? All of us are bad guys, were\
      \ going down anyways, for what reason I don\u2019t care. I am still a guy and\
      \ I will still take those pants off Lucy. There are other issues too though:\
      \ the jokes are repetitive; the plot is predictable (except maybe the clone\
      \ one though I figured it out quickly) and the dialogue is often stiff and awkward.\
      \ Your choices matter little too, except one choice in Felix rout, two in the\
      \ queens, one in Lucifers and non in Novas your choice matter nothing. Also\
      \ why do all of Felix ending use the same art? Not to mention the non-skippable\
      \ mini game instructions are quite annoying.\n\nI don\u2019t want to go out\
      \ on the negative though. I enjoyed the mini games and the despite the clone\
      \ story being basic the addition of his master and their motivations was adorable,\
      \ and I approve. The art, though uncanny on some characters, is also well made\
      \ and the colour choices are nice. Overall, if I didn\u2019t want this game\
      \ to be more morally grey (being about villains, this felt like a children\u2019\
      s show in the aspect of how villains behave) witch just the normal interactions\
      \ and such I would give it 5/10 and with that a 3.5/10. Also, I am very disappointed\
      \ I could introduce the mad scientist to my gay charms. My girlfriend was also\
      \ disappointed Felix sister was non-dateble. The game has its charm it just\
      \ isn\u2019t what I enjoy so if you adore it more then your mother/father shout\
      \ it from the rooftops and I wouldn\u2019t mind."
