Because the control is IDIOTIC you want to set the shot force. Forget it because it's broken and you can't set it precisely. Eight minutes I was wondering how to take a shot and help in the game does not help, but more disturbs. If the author changes the control then it will be a great game because the music and graphics are great.\n","timestamp_created":1596646216,"timestamp_updated":1596646216,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlPrh3/MCf5fOmQI="}
