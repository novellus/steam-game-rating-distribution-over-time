That's all there is to it.\n\n   Lots of double-kick, lots of keyboards, and no end of head-banging guitar riffage. Sure, every track sounds much the same - just like a DragonForce album - but you'll get what you get and you'll bloody well like it, Sonny-Jim! \n\n   A super-easy recommend to all you metalheads out there, especially at such a ludicrously low price for eighteen tracks of slightly below-average song length.\n\n   Verdict: 8.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1568893460,"timestamp_updated":1568893616,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578096985816955566","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+JfWpO0CcLHA0gE="}
