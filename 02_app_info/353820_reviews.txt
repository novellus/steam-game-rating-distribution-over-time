It looks nice and giving  the ball a good whack is absolutly satisfying. What it does not do is realism. I do not miss a put at 2 or 4 feet. I don't. Nor have I ever putted a  ball at 20 feet. Here I miss at 2 or 4ft and I put straight in from the rough. And I am not that good in real life, no matter how I try. Will I still play. ABSOLUTLY I have never been such a good golfer in real life as I am here. Is it a good game? well if you have the basic game you have nothing, so that is a NO. If you get the upgrade you can have some fun. And remember: you are not playing the other guy/gal you are always playing yourself for that is the game of golf.","timestamp_created":1589301051,"timestamp_updated":1589301051,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530201315879821777","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ456/uhPICd+ikhwI="}
