A childcare worker senses all is not well at a home.  A little boy is locked away by his stepfather because of his psychic abilities.  It is part of an evil plan by a politician.  You are on the run with the boy to avoid the politicians henchmen catching you as you delve into the child's background.  What you find horrifies you.\nThe storyline sounds over the top, but it is so well executed that it is believable.  Graphics are crisp and sharp.  Voiceovers are good and so is the music.  It is a gripping story with an extra chapter.  HO scenes are shadow items which you use to interact with other objects in the scene.  Puzzles are on the easy side, but are varied.\nMy only gripe is that I couldn't go fullscreen in this game as the picture was tearing all the time.  Yes, I did adjust vsync to no avail.  Someone suggested a free program which helped a lot.\nIt took me 5 enjoyable hours to play, but buy on sale.  Hope they make a sequel.  8/10.","timestamp_created":1547993493,"timestamp_updated":1547993493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.663786530494689941","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44MXmtegCcsnluAE="}
