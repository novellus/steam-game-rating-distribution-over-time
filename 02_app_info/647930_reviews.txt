I love character and story driven games as well. The problem here is it started off that way, but after a few stops it very quickly turned into a puzzle game and just finding and sticking various objects in other various objects. I got so bored I started using the hint system to jump around, then i couldn't wait for it to be over.","timestamp_created":1603194406,"timestamp_updated":1603194406,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx6j1ovUCddOEqQI="}
