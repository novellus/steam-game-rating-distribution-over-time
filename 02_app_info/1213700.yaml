    review: I love games that involve puzzles and this one does not disappoint. The
      puzzles are at times difficult, especially when having to use the abilities
      you acquire later on in the game. I love the idea of this game, and the fox
      is adorable. The only thing I don't really like is that you can't save in the
      middle of a chapter, unless you hit a checkpoint. But overall I've really enjoyed
      playing it so far and may consider playing a second time to find all the hidden
      achievements.
