It's more expensive and is sold as two products for different decades but it's much better value overall and you won't regret it.","timestamp_created":1594194288,"timestamp_updated":1594194674,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlYjalvMCdeXdkwI="}
