    review: "Greetings!  Today we will be looking at the DLC \u201CFaith Undone\u201D\
      \ another Priority Assignment that includes a cosmetic item upon completion.\
      \  Is it worth the $3?  Let\u2019s find out!\n\nEvery Branch on the Way Down:\
      \  I must say that each of these priority missions seems to be getting worse\
      \ and worse.  This one only gave me one path and the reward was equally bad.\
      \   You get a cosmetic footprint skin that is little ice shards but they don\u2019\
      t really do anything but appear then disappear.  They don\u2019t crack or shatter\
      \ and the little ice effect under them would be preferable than the ice shards\
      \ itself.  \n\nThis footprint cosmetic is not as enjoyable as the acid or the\
      \ light and the priority mission itself leaves a lot to be desired, would have\
      \ taken someone a matter of minutes to come up with more twists and turns. \
      \ I\u2019d avoid this one unless you are a completionist or buying in a bundle.\
      \  Enjoy!\n"
