    short_description: SLG Remix is an alternate kinetic version of the brand new
      16-bit horror visual novel/adventure Mega Drive game Sacred Line Genesis. A
      surreal, twisted kinetic novel tribute to obscure visual novel / adventure games
      of 90s.

    review: 'This is not a game, it''s a story accompanied by background images and
      sound, in which you click the screen to progress through. I would call it a
      visual novel, except that there are no choices to be made - it is simply a story
      that you are told in the form of a .exe application. I guess this wouldn''t
      be so bad if the story itself held up, but that also falls on its face. While
      intriguing, the storyline suffers from problems such as pacing (it sometimes
      jumps from one direction to another in a bit of jarring fashion, while other
      less-important segments will drag on for some reason), or lazy plot devices
      (such as the ending... no part of it in particular, really; I don''t want to
      spoil anything for anyone, but the whole ending was some of the laziest writing
      I''ve experienced). Also, the story is a short one - you can get through the
      entire thing in 20-30 minutes or so, assuming that you''re actually reading
      everything.


      Aside from the story, the application itself wasn''t the best either. With no
      way to fullscreen the app (that I could see, anyways), you''re left to view
      everything in a window that is about 1/3 of the display. Alt+Enter also didn''t
      work. The images that accompany the story were decent, however, I felt that
      the images didn''t change frequently enough to keep up with what the text was
      trying to convey. Sometimes, the story will deviate from the scene that is currently
      presented to you on  screen, lessening the effectiveness and impact of what
      the text is actually saying. The sound is fine overall; the only real criticism
      I have in that respect was the sudden and abrupt stops to the audio that would
      follow a scene transition. It probably would have been a better choice to at
      least fade out/fade in the audio at those points, or even crossfade the two
      sections of audio together during the transition, rather than the abrupt ending
      of the audio followed by a couple seconds of silence.


      Ultimately, SLG Remix isn''t worth what is being asked for it. 3 dollars? No
      way. It seems more like a class project that someone made and decided to charge
      money for. If you really must add this to your collection, wait for it to go
      on sale for 50 cents or something.'
