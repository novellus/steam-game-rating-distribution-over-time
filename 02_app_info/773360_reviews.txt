The cart is speedy and makes it a fun game to play. \nThis side-scrolling game possesses some elements that reminded me of Mario Bros and the golden age of arcade gaming, which was nostalgic for me. I enjoyed playing Stinky Snake as well as my eight-year-old son. It is definatly a game for all ages.\n I will not spoil anything for you all. However, this game's difficulty increases as you advance. There are some tricky parts, so don't be fooled by the beginning levels. \n I liked the uniqueness of the graphics in this game. Set on a tropical island, and the creators incorporated the culture into this game. The music and stinky snakes character vocals sounded custom. There are some fun weapons in the games to take out the skunks.  I have never seen a game like this one. \n If you peek into the 'About' section in the main menu, you will see that the game appears to be created by a family, which is rare as far creator teams go.\nIf I had to list a negative, I would list  limited OS platforms. It is only for Windows 10,  albeit very common, it would be nice to see it on released on other platforms.\nOverall, Stinky Snake is an amusing side-scrolling game that will delight any player. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Mario Bros or enjoys scrolling platform games.","timestamp_created":1530673214,"timestamp_updated":1530716459,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512300431728363037","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4//HzsuQCcNSPpQE="}
