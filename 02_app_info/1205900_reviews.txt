I quite enjoyed that little title and this has 16 bit-era graphics vs. AA's 8 bit-era graphics, as well as more NPCs and a smattering of small quests.  It also has an upgrade system to the magic.  I guess it remains to be seen if it has a difficulty spike near the end as there was in AA.  A very charming metroidvania that won't knock your socks off but is well-crafted and fun to play in general.","timestamp_created":1609614426,"timestamp_updated":1609614426,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537275075912475586","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+d+f4vYCeYPpvwI="}
