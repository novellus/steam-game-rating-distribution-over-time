    review: 'I listen to the songs in this album every now and then, on a frequent
      basis, so highly worth getting if you love their music.


      [Edit]

      It comes with an illustration from the hand drawn pencil sketch of the [i]Little
      Busters![/i] gang that has lyrics on the back "jacket" and design of the album
      cover on the front.


      I truly recommend buying this for anyone who''s learning Japanese, like me,
      as they''re also quite neatly or tidily organized for convenience in such a
      manner that it''s easy to navigate when switching between songs with the title
      on top and spacing in between for the guitar riffs/instrumental solos/breaks
      in between of singing.'
