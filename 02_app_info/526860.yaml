    review: "Fantastic. Beautiful music. However, I miss the official trailer song\
      \ with lyrics. It's pretty good too. \n\nEDIT: The reason they don't have the\
      \ trailer music included is because it's not composed by them, but it's called\
      \ MONSTERS OF THE COSMOS - Symphony of Science."
