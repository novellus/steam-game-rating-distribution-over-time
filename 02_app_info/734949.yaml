    review: "Watch out for episode 10 seems that html5 player crashes for some reason,\
      \ and I have dog who likes to watch clean freak aoyama kun and he gets grumpy\
      \ when he sees go crash. Other episodes ran okay just that one failed midway.\
      \ Best find another site versus crunchyroll unless they find what causing it\
      \ fail. It also made my video display driver fail which makes me worried there\
      \ should be no issue. \n\nClean Freak is pretty funny its in all subtitle and\
      \ original dialogue Japanese but its very funny, comic and slap stick sort story."
