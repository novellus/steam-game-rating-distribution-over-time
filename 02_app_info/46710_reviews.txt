The worst thing here is that the game is very limited. You buy some ships, you make them join the battle (which takes place on some sort of empty arena) and... that's pretty much it. There's no proper campaign, no proper goals and the only things you can control during the battle are moving direction, moving speed and guns. In other words, you can give your ships an order to shoot, or ignore the enemies completely. And that'll be it. There's nothing else about the battles in this game. That alone is enough to make the game feel bad, but, like I've already said, it's also painfully slow and even at maximum speed every action takes forever for your ships to finish.\n\nAs the result, this game is literally as fun as watching the paint dry. With only three kinds of commands, very slow speed and almost nothing to achieve, it's a royal waste of both your time and money. Even with [b]90%[/b] it's not worth it.
