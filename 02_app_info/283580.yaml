    review: 'This game actually works as long as Quicktime that comes with the game
      is installed and the PC is restarted. However there is a peculiar problem reminiscent
      of Dirt Rally; it only works with 4-core CPU, not more. Also like other reviewers
      have said, the performance is poor. I had to reduce light and shadow range from
      the default 65 and 55 to 0 and 0 respectively. When glow and blur effects are
      also disabled i could get above 100 fps at 720p. However that makes the graphics
      quality and realism looks really crappy. [b]5/10[/b]


      More details later.


      [b]Update 1 - 27th Jul 2019[/b]

      My bad, it didn''t need to run on 4-cores. Disabling SMT is enough. This compatibility
      fix might be due to the latest Asus BIOS 5007 which incidentally has no option
      to disable cores.


      [b]Addendum to Update 1 - 3rd Aug 2019[/b]

      Incidentally disabling Simultaneous Multi-Thread processing increases performance
      thereby achieving consistently higher fps. This improvement can be also seen
      in many other older games  like FF XIII, FF XIII-2 and Ship Simulator Extreme
      and even in some newer games like The Crew 2, Gravel, Star Wars Battlefront
      and Doom. In Gravel and The Crew 2 for example, i was able to turn on more graphic
      options without sacrificing baseline 60 fps. Similarly in this game, i noticed
      steady 60 fps in the main menu whereas previously it was fluctuating.


      SMT seems to be more useful for desktop applications  like a video editor rather
      than in action games. Maybe in strategy genres like city simulation, base building
      or 4x games where increasing number of cities or bases requires scaling of multi-tasking
      operations is where SMT might shine. However disabling SMT prevents the PC from
      entering sleep mode. Re-enabling it disables hibernate mode; can''t win them
      all i guess.


      Therefore based on performance improvement alone, this game deserves at least
      [b]6/10[/b] IMO. Which means to say, it''s definitely playable.


      [b]Update 2 - 21st Dec 2020[/b]

      After the 1st update, i did not play the game; only saw that it worked and tweaked
      the performance. During that time i had a nominally functioning RX-470 GPU.
      I didn''t remember what was the last graphics settings, namely light and shadow
      range. However when i started the game again today, it defaulted to 1600 x 900
      (same as desktop resolution) and the light and shadow ranges were at maximum.


      Here''s the thing; it was amazing! 60 fps steady! So i cranked up the resolution
      to 1920 x 1080 and it still was amazingly steady at 60 fps! Well this is because
      now i''m using RX-580 with twice the amount of GDDR5. Alas my elation was shortlived;
      as soon as i restarted the game at full HD and maxed out light and shadow ranges,
      the fps drops to below 40 fps. I was shocked! I tried everything, tweaking the
      CPU cores from 8 down to 4 then down to 2 using both combinations of SMT off
      or on. Nothing could restore the initial 60 fps that i got with the same GPU
      and CPU config. So now i''m a little disappointed because i have to settle for
      light and shadow ranges of 11 instead of the initial setting of 100.


      I dunno what went wrong and i''m not too happy about it. Certainly it isn''t
      the RX-580 as it wasn''t even overheating and it wasn''t even at half power;
      it was running at less than 40W even in full HD. As this is only at the main
      menu, not even in the game yet so maybe in-game it might eat more power. Still
      i dun understand why the performance drop after a restart.


      While this doesn''t change my recommendation to No, it does weaken it somewhat.
      I''ll see what further things i can do to restore it back to 60 fps at max range
      but i''m not too hopeful about it.


      [b]Update 2a - 22nd Dec 2020[/b]

      My bad, i understand now. The main menu background scene cycles between night
      and day. In the daytime, light ranges makes no difference to fps but at night
      it takes a huge performance hit.'
