There is no character select, and there are only six stages.\n\nThat said, this game is remarkable for just how much game there is in these limited elements. The claws are each manipulated using the analog sticks, which leads to an incredibly expressive array of options on attack and defense. Fights play out wildly differently, and (as seen in the video) can be very short and intense. When I sit down with Claw Breaker, I often end up putting in 50-60 rounds, since matches are so brief and varied. This also means that — despite having just one character — you'll end up feeling like you're playing many different \"matchups\" since different players will build very different skillsets and take very different strategic approaches.\n\nOverall, this game rocks, but don't go in thinking it'll have a giant swath of content or ANY single-player material whatsoever. What you'll get is an immensely entertaining 1v1 dueling game with delightful gameplay and hilarious consequences. It's got a narrow scope, but within that scope, it's a total gem.","timestamp_created":1536607782,"timestamp_updated":1536607782,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501636385917663574","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx8C94uUCe/a0qgE="}
