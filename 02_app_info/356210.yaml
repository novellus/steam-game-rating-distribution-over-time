    review: "About the original game: \nI used to think this game was cool with the\
      \ Halloween theme, beautiful graphics, wacky characters and quirky but rather\
      \ irritating protagonist. \nHowever this game is hard, and for all the wrong\
      \ reasons. When you figure out a puzzle it's not a heureka! moment but rather\
      \ \"what the hell...?\" kind of. So I think some parts of the game have not\
      \ been designed and scripted well, or done so in a hurry.\nHowever, the story\
      \ is intriguing and you want to know what happens next so you keep trying.\n\
      It's gotten lot of negative reviews since it's release but I find myself coming\
      \ back to this game time and time again.\nIt's a forgotten game from the 90's,\
      \ haven't aged too well maybe but anyone who loves PnC genre and classic LucasArts\
      \ style should play it. I just wish, there was a way to play the second game\
      \ \"Rake's progress\".\nAbout the Steam release:\nThere seems to be a problem\
      \ with ScummVM games on Steam because you can't access program settings, those\
      \ have been automatically adjusted for user(how kind!) and the program is not\
      \ kept up to date. So this causes problems(bugs and crashes) and I'm not the\
      \ only one experiencing it. Given that people give money for these products\
      \ Steam really should get program settings up to date since this is not the\
      \ first ScummVM game people have problems with."
