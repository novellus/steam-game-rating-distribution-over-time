The main thing that interested me was the stencils. When I load the game for the first time, it doesnt come with any stencils, you have to go find some and add them into a folder in the game files. I never did.  \n\nThe biggest issue with this game for me is the controls. In Kingspray using my Oculus Quest I have to hold the controller sideways so that the trigger button is pointing up. This way pressing down on the trigger button is like pressing the cap of the spray can. Feels more natural. When I tried this game it felt more like a gun, shooting at the wall. was weird.","timestamp_created":1595093155,"timestamp_updated":1595093155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y7+9sfMCf9qOlgI="}
