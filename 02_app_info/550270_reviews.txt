I expected it to be more aimed at children or young girls, but it was pretty good for an all-ages show, and if it wasn't for the fact that I don't have time to watch however many hundreds of episodes this show probably has I might be inclined to finish it. In technical regards, the show is in the original aspect ratio no matter what setting you choose in the player and seems to  be unedited, but the audio is strange in that while the show itself is the dub, with no option to choose the Japanese original (which seems a bit underwhelming for $3 per episode) the opening and ending credits are the Japanese versions, with no option to use the dubbed version of the theme. It's a good show, but the pricing scheme they have on Steam is pretty awful, but let's be real here nobody can actually afford to pay for anime no matter what media format it's in.","timestamp_created":1485760706,"timestamp_updated":1485760706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.579196512699127197","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3aaP99kCddfrcA=="}
