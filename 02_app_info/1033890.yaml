    short_description: Armed with fortitude and dignity, she faces the coming days
      with a smile on her lips. And since God moves in mysterious ways, none of us
      can know the lot we shall have to bear. But it is often those of whom we least
      expect it who encounter an extraordinary destiny...

    review: 'The DLC including 2 stories, one is Theresa, which is normal and kinda
      boring, totally ignorable.


      Another one is about Johanka. Well, I got to say, it''s amazing story if you
      went to the bad ending.

      Probably the best plot in the whole game. It''s 9/10 for Johanka''s story.'
