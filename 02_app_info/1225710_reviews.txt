Can't go wrong.\n\nI don't like how there's not a seamless transition to controller (XBOX) use. Some command must be given from the main menu screen. You'll find it.\n\nI like how I have to kind of find out the story line and the ambient sound of glass and other materials.\n\nThe command to collect and use items is very buggy and constantly shimmers, but it does work.\n\nI have never been fond of the loud noise tactic and it's insanely over used. Coupled with the fact that it is strongly suggested for the user to raise their volume is ridiculous and, in America, can leave you liable of tons of legal responsibilities. Risky road you walk with this. I have seen many games have almost the same effect with a bass tone rather than what you use.\n\nThanks for the work and fantastic game. I haven't finished it and maybe I will some day. It's pretty neat but very redundant.","timestamp_created":1582967578,"timestamp_updated":1582967578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2YuOyPACfPOd9QE="}
