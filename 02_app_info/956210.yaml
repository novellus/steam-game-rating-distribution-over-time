    review: "Defense Grid clone but with not clearly defined rules and turret stats\
      \ not even available in the loadout menue. It is still not clear how to earn\
      \ the stars and if you can get them again if you replay (grind) the same missions.\
      \ Good for denfence grid veterans searching for hard game.\n\n\n\n28.04.2020\
      \  \nI am writing this from a working notebook.... I am to 85 % sure that THIS\
      \ game damaged my \n650 \u20AC preselected/delidded/liquid metal modded CPU,\
      \ with a delivery waiting time of a month....even if I would rebuy it instantly\
      \ (in corona times the delivery situation is much worse). Do not play it on\
      \ multicore CPUs, it overloads them like a burnin test..\nI wish I would have\
      \ never installed it.\n\nSmall update: after all was lost, I manually disabled\
      \ the cooling a did a real \"burn in\" for 24 h with  real  CPU overload.  It\
      \ finally repaired the weak solder point somwhere in the PC. It runs again without\
      \ problems."
