I love 3D platformers, so getting this seemed like a no brainer. It is definetly really rough around the edges, but it is still worth getting because of how cheap it is. There are 50 levels included when you buy the game which lasts for about 2 and a half hours, and there are tons of levels made by other players online, with only more levels coming for each person that has the game.\n\nKeyboard controls suck though, when you stop pressing the key you keep walking until the walking animation finishes looping, which is just pretty disorienting. You really need to use a controller with this game, but when you do the controls work pretty well.\n\nThis game isn't amazing by any means, but there is a fun time here, especially if you like creating your own levels. For the price, it's worth getting.\n\nI hope there are more updates to come in the future, what we already have is good, I hope it becomes great with time :3","timestamp_created":1605666226,"timestamp_updated":1605666226,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9cfK7PUCcdqFrwI="}
