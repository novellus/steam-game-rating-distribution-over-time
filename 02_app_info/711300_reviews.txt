I got it for $3.59 USD and if you can find it at the price or lower then you should definitely pull the trigger. Make no mistake about it, this game is hard even on normal. I didn't try the game on easy, but on normal difficulty you will die a lot just to get past the first level.\n\nUnless you're an expert shot and a master at avoiding damage, you will need to upgrade your weapons before you can successfully clear the area. There's just an endless onslaught of enemies that spawn from everywhere. It is not rare that you die because you ran out of bullets. \n\nI used free locomotion to run around. However, you do need to set up full roomscale because you can't turn with the joystick. And you need to be accurate to quickly take down enemies, in front, behind, and to your sides. So you need to be able to quickly turn and run in that direction. \n\nBe warned, there is a lot of backtracking. I think this is to artificially inflate the length of the game. Even after upgrading my guns, I found that I was going back to a place that I had just been to collect another item in that same area. However, I found the fast-paced action to be fun, even it was frustratingly difficult at times. \n\nLuckily, upgrading isn't too difficult and easy especially after you upgrade the first few times. Then you're able to kill more enemies and killing more enemies leads to more upgrades. So it's slow at the start, but then you're able to upgrade several things, making life all that much easier and more fun as well. \n\nSo you do need patience to play this game. I enjoyed the Duke Nuke'em style voiceover. It's an arcadey, action bullet hell story FPS game. Heavy emphasis on the action part. The graphics were just okay but on the bright side there was a nice variety of enemy types and weapons to unlock. You also get special abilities you can unlock and upgrade as well.\n\nRate 6/10. Buy on sale and enjoy the challenging arcade action shoot em up fun.","timestamp_created":1521692733,"timestamp_updated":1521692733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53271031379699707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ45I39peICf4aknAE="}
