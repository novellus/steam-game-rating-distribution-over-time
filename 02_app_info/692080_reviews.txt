The end result is a warship that trys to be a jack-of-all-trades but honestly can't do much beyond hack and also launch a single squadron. A Talon and a Nemesis are both cheaper and more effective, as they both play into their roles.","timestamp_created":1548216309,"timestamp_updated":1591494886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwp5ifxvICcYeBuQE="}
