You play as a \"bird\" (or at least one of the other characters refers to you this way), and you're trying to course-correct a ship that is attemtping to find a new place to live for its diverse inhabitants. You'll meet bizarre sci-fi monsters, demonic forces, robots, and even a dog, and each has an item that they are looking for (or at the very least will be receptive to getting).\n\nMost of the fun in Kilcount, in my opinion, came from just seeing what sort of wild things emerged from the imagination of developer Beatrice. For instance, one monster that you meet wants to devour you, and after you meet him, this demand is noted in your notebook. As soon as you meet him, you tell yourself, \"well, OK, that's one demand I won't be able to meet.\" However - without spoiling anything, I can tell you that it's entirely possible to meet his demand without killing yourself.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a couple of things holding Kilcount back. One is that the moment-to-moment gameplay can get a little tedious, walking back and forth from one NPC to another. This can get especially tiresome if you find a couple of items (as I did) that all seemed like they could meet the demand of a certain character. One character wants a \"collectible\" (basically), and I felt like many items that I found could fit that bill. So I kept walking back to this character over and over to see if he wanted any of what I'd found.\n\nThe other gripe I had is that the ending just fell a bit flat. It seems that the game wants to say something about generosity and service towards others, but I never felt that I connected with any of these characters. They were all just slots with various item-shaped holes for me to fill. Some of the the \"quests\" were more personal, like one particular character's search for dignity, but I just didn't feel anything upon completing this quest (or indeed the game at-large). Perhaps it would've been interesting to hear about the plans of these characters once we landed on our new world? Maybe this would've made me feel more invested in their plight. Upon completing one questline, I received an item called a Token of Love. The game made it clear that I should be proud to receive this item, but I actually didn't feel like I deserved it.\n\nKilcount is a neat little project from a single developer with a rich imagination. If you're interested in the surreal, or in quirky, dark humor, it might be right up your alley. However, I wouldn't expect a particularly exciting or emotional experience.\n\n","timestamp_created":1530821759,"timestamp_updated":1530821759,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496749639511108398","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gcqFtuQCcpWnpQE="}
