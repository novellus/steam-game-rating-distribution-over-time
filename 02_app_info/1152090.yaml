    about_the_game: '&quot;Elmarion: Dragon time&quot; is a dragon game. One of the
      ideas of the game is to let the player feel the power and strength of these
      great creatures, who most often in the games act as some kind of evil bosses.
      In the role of a dragon, a player will be able to burn large enemy troops and
      entire cities. Will the dragon be good or bad? The dragon wants to save the
      world from the undead: such is its purpose. To save the world, not people. Nevertheless,
      the situation is such that without people (and other dragons), our hero cannot
      cope. So the dragon still has to find a common language with people. Moreover,
      not all people consider our dragon to be good, and the dragon itself is rather
      arrogant towards tiny people compared to it and, in principle, can fry them
      (in the game, people may not be protected from dragon fire).<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1152090/extras/Elmarion.Arial.gif?t=1607168517"
      /><br>In the game there are various missions, for example: to help people go
      through dangerous mountains and save one of their leaders (cover from the air);
      eliminate infected people, while trying not to kill normal inhabitants; defend
      the city of people from undead invasion for 30 minutes and other missions.'

    review: I enjoyed it, but got stuck on an escort quest in thunder gorge because
      the terrain was to steep for the AI to walk over. maybe improve pathfinding,
      and soften the walkways a bit? as for the rest, minor bugs, but nothing game
      breaking. if you want to recklessly fly around scorching the countryside this
      is a great game! i do wish that the run cycle didn't feel like i'm on ice though
