But there is still room for improvement:\n1. Would be nice to have an option to always start Dennkind Dock in minimalistick mode;\n2. Another useful thing will be an option to show/hide the dock not only with hotkey, but also hiding it automatically and showing it by placing a cursor near the screen border;\n3. The library should have a more convenient editor that would allow changing icons and specifying launch parameters for applications;\n4. I believe, grid sticking for desctop containers would be another good option;\n5. Left/right screen border placement;\n6. Prohibiting the launch of multiple copies of the dock application.\n\nI wish further improvement to Dennkind Dock!","timestamp_created":1608277349,"timestamp_updated":1608278954,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518072307109832764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgaq5uvYCeK2QuwI="}
