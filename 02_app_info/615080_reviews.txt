Not Bad enough to rip with a Neg review.\nSuch a fun, unique concept, but falls flat on its face with totally bland GUI and scenery (just like screenshots above)\nThe constantly panning camera sometimes takes train completely out of view & is just pitiful, almost unplayable.\nCan only recommend this game on D-E-E-P discount - I picked up for 70% off in the recent sale, so no regrets - However, at Full price - I cannot recommend. Cheers\nOther thoughts - from an Achievement standpoint, this is the grind of a lifetime (b-o-r-i-n-g) - just lather-rinse-repeat the same levels over and over enough to connect 2000 cities on varying difficulty levels - Total BS - IMHO","timestamp_created":1575987116,"timestamp_updated":1584966891,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548659026622772217","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43+7Yg/ECfJey4wE="}
