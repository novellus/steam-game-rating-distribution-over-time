I bought this when it was on sale (I believe an 80% discount) and upon playing it, it was a greater waste of time than it was worth. It looked fun from the videos, and I thought \"the game is only about a $1, so why not?\" Turns out, it was more frustrating and annoying than it seemed. Recommendations to make this a better game: make the sounds less annoying, add basic game mechanics (settings menu, leaderboard, etc.), give it some sort of in-game story (even if it's just text, cause right now the name \"Princess Kidnapper\" doesn't really make sense to me). Some big improvements to this game are necessary and I would change my score to positive.","timestamp_created":1492242934,"timestamp_updated":1492242934,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj4WnuNsCc8Tqdg=="}
