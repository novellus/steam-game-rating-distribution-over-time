It lacks polish and has bugs, so I'd only give it a 5/10.\n\nPros:\n- some interesting rules about pieces movement and resolution of attacks (reminded me of Diplomacy board game with \"support\" order)\n\nCons:\n- pretty basic graphics\n- camera controls are clunky (you need to push the cursor to the sides of the screen to rotate the camera, and you can also tilt the board with mouse wheel). Probably they should have used an orthographic camera instead of a perspective one, or at least make FOV smaller; and more ways to control the camera (with keys, and held right mouse button) would be better, also with zoom in/out option.\n- the rook becomes invulnerable if you give no orders to it (that's the game rule). But after you've given an order to a rook there is no way to clear that order, only change direction. There must be a way to clear orders of a piece (e.g. right-click or Escape (which currently just instantly exits the game which is awkward)?)\n- even after you've learnt the rules, the exact resolution of attacks remains somewhat arcane due to the sheer complexity. Typically, after seeing the results of a turn resolution phase, I spent 1-2 minutes just trying to understand why what happened, and still wasn't completely sure why things happened they did. Especially in the mid-game, when most of the pawns have met in the center of the board, the turns are messy. This also may be due to the fact that there are a lot of pieces present on the board at start. Had this been a TBS game where you produce new pieces (like in UniWar for Android/iOS, for example, or Advanced Wars for GameBoyAdvanced, then the board wouldn't be so much cluttered and outcomes of turns would be more transparent).\n- there is a rule that a piece can \"support\" another standing piece but sometimes you give that order (yellow arrow) and sometimes you don't (just a green arrow, indicating that the piece will attempt to move to the tile where the other piece is). It's all pretty confusing. I'm still not sure if there are bugs in the logic there, or the presentation is bugged, or I just didn't understand something. Also, one time I saw an enemy bishop move onto a tile which was already occupied by my bishop. They both \"merged\", and I could still select my white bishop on the tile while only the black one was visible. So, my bet is, there are still plenty of complex bugs in there.\n- resultion happens all at once, instead I'd prefer a \">>\" button which would show each step separately (since all happens iteratively in the code anyway).\n- intitializing multiplayer always gives an error \"Error connecting to server: creating user\". \n\nThe game has an interesting core idea (chess with Diplomacy-style combined attacks + simultaneous moves) but it all crumbles upon itself due to the extreme complexity of the turn resolution logic. Understanding the exact steps would be the main thing for the game to exist here, without that the game degrades into randomness. Still, even without clear understanding, I did win the few matches vs the AI, so the AI might not be smart enough here.  \n\nThe game has very few downloads, probably because it's Chess-themed while having too little to do with chess. This could be a popular game (as far as a TBS game could be) if they chose some other setting (robots? fantasy?) and maybe even switched to some cartoonish 2D graphics. With a friendly enough GUI design, I could even imagine this game getting somewhat popular on mobile, but that may be just well above this dev's resources.","timestamp_created":1518877090,"timestamp_updated":1518878457,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566341578960418701","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yr+N0uECedGYmQE="}
