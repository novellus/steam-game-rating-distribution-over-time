I would have liked some more thoughts on design and his choices on various opacities when just focusing on the design. This tutorial is focused on a particular style in mind. More along the lines of concept art. Which is why I picked this up. I am more of a line art guy, so I wanted to get some knowledge on this type of approach.\n\nI will say you have to watch what he's doing more than listening to what he is saying. This is obviously not a photoshop tutorial, so I wasn't expecting him to explain how he uses the program, but it would have been helpful. He's moving so fast from all the years of drawing, that it's hard to retain or capture his thoughts on various design choices he's making. I'm a 32 year old in and out of drawing and my time is limited. When I buy something, I want it to be worth while. While 6 bucks may not seem like a lot, tons of content exist on youtube etc...for free.\n\nWhat I got out of the set of videos is more about reminders than technique. Here are some observations from just watching what he was doing and some of what he was saying. Leaving you to do some detective work as to why he is so successful at what he does.\n\n-Flip your canvas often to make sure your design is balanced (unspoken)\n-Move fast and get the main idea down before you commit to a lengthy process (unspoken)\n-While moving, focus on the broad instead of the narrow like faces, bust areas (unspoken)\n- If you don't like what your doing within 10 min's, move on to another design (spoken)\n- Use the eye dropper tool to find a color for blending between the dark and light tones (spoken briefly)\n\nThese are all great reminders, but honestly I was hoping for much more insight. The guy is very talented, was hoping to glean more knowledge.\n","timestamp_created":1583986759,"timestamp_updated":1583986759,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41fq95vACecnG9wE="}
