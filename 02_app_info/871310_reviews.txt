Visuals are cool. Sound effects, too. And you fly 3D, not 2D as some space games around. And it´s not super hard as some other games.\n\nLooks like I will have a lot of fun with this one.\n\nUPDATE: I got back to this game after almost a year. Sadly, it gets ridiculously hard after, like, five missions, with more than eleven to go.\n\nI don´t play games to get upset and waste time trying to find trainers and cheats that only work if you pay. \n\nI don´t mind a difficulty curve, but a game that gets this hard so early... like, how can I shoot down a cruiser if there are five, six other ship shooting at me from all different angles??\n\nIf mission five is like that, I don´t want to try to finish this game.\n\nChanging my review to \"Not Recommend\".\n\nUPDATE 2: Changing my review back to \"Recommend\". I came back to the game, changed my strategy here and there, and managed to pass the mission.\n\nThe next mission already seems hard as *ell, but the fact that I missed the game enough to come back to it was enough for me to try again. I´ll try again, one mission at a time.\n\nSo, that´s it. Be advised. I recommend it. It´s a good arcadey space ship game (if that´s what you´re after), BUT expect sudden spikes in difficulty.","timestamp_created":1566783601,"timestamp_updated":1605640430,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476169228553771973","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm5To6/UCef2I0QE="}
