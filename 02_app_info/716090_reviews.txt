Despite having the exact same rules and 'pieces', this interface was designed in such a way as to be counter-intuitive to play even for someone who knows how to play Cottage Garden. If this was my first exposure to Cottage Garden it would put me off Uwe Rosenberg's amazing games, not encourage me to seek them out. \n\nSome specific issues:\n* Stilted/bulky turns, even when all players online together and playing at same time\n* No volume scale for music or sound effects or master volume option - just (1) off or (2) blasting your ears (can't talk with friends online and run any game sound at the same time)\n* Each of the \"you need to click this next as part of turn order\" is not visually obvious. Easy to think you've finished your turn when in fact everyone else is waiting for you to hit the slightly shadowed bottom right button for 'for real done'\n* No exit/quit button for the game without having to press Esc key or Alt-Ctrl-Del\n* Instead of watching players place pieces while they're doing it, you watch an ummoving screen then when the player finishes both they and you watch an animation of what they just did. Can we just watch in real time, please? Like we do in real life when playing the original board game version?\n* The interface and method for requesting and accepting friend requests not intuitive\n* Would not be able to fumble through how to play the game without either doing the demo or having played the board game version first. If you can't just jump in and figure it out as you go, or have a 'how to' or 'what comes next' available while playing, it won't appealing to new users.\n* No reference materials available while playing if you have questions. Did not see a summary anywhere of rules, turn order, etc available on the interface while actively playing the game.","timestamp_created":1609564008,"timestamp_updated":1609564008,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5LXf4PYCesbPvwI="}
