    review: "The soundtrack is good. The game, unfortunately, isn't.\n\nSee those\
      \ cool spartan wireframe graphics? That ethos extends to all aspects of the\
      \ game's design, even to things it really shouldn't extend to, like basic interface\
      \ and combat feedback.\n\nFirst, set your mouse aside, you won't be needing\
      \ it. This is keyboard-only. I decided to write it off as \"immersion or something\"\
      \ and sort of went with it.\n\nSecond, by god, everything is so *slow.* Turning\
      \ is slow. Moving is slow. Scanning objects (inspecting) is slow. Which, hey,\
      \ that must be immersion, since you're in a stories-tall mech, right? Well,\
      \ no. You're in a \"mecha,\" which I guess is closer to a powered exoskeleton,\
      \ unless we're supposed to believe humans are busy skittering around like ants\
      \ building house-sized landmines for you to step on. In other words, you're\
      \ person-sized. Taller, I guess (?) stronger, and encased in armor, but person-sized.\
      \ Which, to me, begs even more questions:\n\n- If I'm person-sized, why am I\
      \ so slow? An unarmored person could run around me in circles and I'd never\
      \ be able to catch them.\n- If I'm person-sized, why's there this weird infrared\
      \ wireframe display thing? It made sense to me when I imagined a stories-tall\
      \ war machine that's essentially a block of steel, but if i'm just some dude,\
      \ some eye slits and a flashlight would do fine, thanks.\n- Why is there absolutely\
      \ no feedback whatsoever that I'm taking damage? If I'm person-sized, there\
      \ should be the sound of bullets ringing off the armor, the concussive effect\
      \ of the impact not being fully absorbed, maybe my I-guess-it's-infrared display\
      \ kicking static or flickering. Something beyond a sound effect of gun shots\
      \ and a number in the corner going down.\n- What's the processor on this thing,\
      \ a Pentium 2? It. Takes. So. Long. To. Scan. Anything. Is it rocking, like,\
      \ 64mb of RAM? Because the thing can't even chart a map.\n\nAt some point it\
      \ hit me. These \"aesthetic\" or \"immersive\" choices aren't intentional. They're\
      \ just lazy. Why figure out mouse control? Screw that, it'll just be keyboard-only.\
      \ Graphics? I'm no good at those, how about we make it look like a Virtual Boy?\
      \ Combat feedback? The sound effect is enough. Automap? Would take too long\
      \ to figure out, scrap it. \n\nUltimately the game's presentation feels like\
      \ it never made it beyond the prototype phase. Instead they claimed it as intentional\
      \ for immersion and style and pushed it out the door.\n\nThis isn't to discourage\
      \ the use of a style like this. It's quite cool, really. But since that kind\
      \ of minimalism *increases* the immersion, the lazy little things like no combat\
      \ feedback or auto map or consistent sense of scale *really* stand out in a\
      \ *really* bad way."
