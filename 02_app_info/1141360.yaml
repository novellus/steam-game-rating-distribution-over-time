    review: Visually this game is an rpgmaker game and could be fun..... While it
      does have good controller support and the skill sytem looks neat, it falls short
      in certain fields. There is no escape from combat, i guess they call that "roguelike".
      Then I managed to play the game for 4 hours and not recruit another character,
      4 hours and still solo? Every character that looks like they are on the one
      screen all tell you that grouping with you is akin to stabbing themselves in
      the face. It is a group dungeon crawl game where everyone tells you to *bleep*
      off? I've heard of wanting things to be difficult but going solo to level 4
      of a dungeon where level 2 will murder you? This game is highly recommended
      but has failed in all ways an rpg can fail for me. If for some reason i could
      form a party and get past level 2 i would judge the game less harshly, but how
      can one see the romance options if the game tells you to not play it 4 hours
      in?
