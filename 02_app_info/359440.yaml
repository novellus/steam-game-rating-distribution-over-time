    review: "Artifact Adventure is pure 8-bit Dragon Quest homage. \n\nYou start by\
      \ choosing a class (out of 6) for each of the 4 characters on your party.\n\n\
      The plot is simple: save the world from the Swamp King, who has turned people\
      \ into his followers (even the King's daughter) via a poisonous substance from\
      \ which his swamps are made of. The monsters you'll fight around the world were\
      \ once normal creatures, but they were poisoned by the swamps.\n\nThe world\
      \ is big and diverse for this kind of game. It has a town in the center called\
      \ Fortress, from which you can choose to go either west, east or north. There's\
      \ desert, arctic area and forests in the mainland. Every area has towns or dungeons\
      \ in which you can complete side quests. \n\nA lot of your quests will have\
      \ 2 possible endings, for example \"you found a dream world within a magical\
      \ flower, this world is inhabited by a queen who wants you to keep it secret,\
      \ but in the outer world you'd need that flower for a task. Once out, would\
      \ you pick up the flower and take it to the NPC who asked for it or will you\
      \ respect it's inner world and forfeit your possible reward?\"... All of your\
      \ decisions change the game in some way so there's replay value and I really\
      \ loved this. \n\nIn tons of areas you'll collect little creatures called jar\
      \ goblins hiding around - delivering a certain number to an NPC unlocks equippable\
      \ (optional) items. This is a direct reference to collecting tiny medals in\
      \ Dragon Quest. \n\nThere's a day/night cycle and many locations are affected\
      \ by it. Some jar goblins only appear at night! \n\nSpiritual beings which grant\
      \ you special abilities are called Artifacts (hence the game's name). They talk\
      \ and adhere to the character that's in the first spot on your formation. You\
      \ can change the order of your formation at any time outside battles so switch\
      \ characters to give them different Artifacts when you find them.\n\nThe game\
      \ is non linear so you can start and walk your way to the northern snowy area\
      \ if you want, but you'd probably die to strong monsters in the way. Grinding\
      \ is up to you. There's some steep difficulty curves depending on the order\
      \ you visit the different areas. I faced the Swamp King at level 50 on my first\
      \ playthrough and finished it in around 18 hours, but I revisited a lot of areas\
      \ just to make sure I wasn't missing anything so that made up for more EXP -\
      \ and didn't look for any guide either. You could finish the game earlier with\
      \ lower level characters if you build a good team. \n\nDying will make you spend\
      \ a lot of time recovering your losses as to revive your companions you're charged\
      \ fees that depend on their power. This is punishing in the early game when\
      \ you're still poor, but as you progress you won't be short of gold and you'll\
      \ eventually find Artifacts that allow you to bring back your injured characters\
      \ to battle. I recommend giving the major healing and reviving abilities to\
      \ your magic/intelligence user(s) and the lesser/moderate healing and reviving\
      \ to your balanced characters such as the hermit and the dreamer just in case\
      \ your mage dies.\n\nThere's no achievements. Play this only if you have the\
      \ patience and taste for late 80's RPG nostalgia - if you do you'll find it\
      \ charming."
