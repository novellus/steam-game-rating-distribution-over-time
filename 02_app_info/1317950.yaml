    review: "Eternal Dreamers originally caught my eye because I thought the character\
      \ art looked appealing, and I was pleasantly surprised to find this eye-catching\
      \ variety carried over into the gameplay too. With the 8 characters you're given\
      \ control of, I did stick mainly to 4 for most of my time playing with occasional\
      \ dabbling in a few others (my main 4 being Anna, Sakia, Reiketsu and Natsume).\
      \ The game is very grind-focused in terms of combat so finding a team you like\
      \ and optimising your style of play feels like one of the main aspects of the\
      \ game to me, and giving options to expand the characters more via the use of\
      \ bonding events (of sorts) to upgrade their stats, and also the spirit system\
      \ was a nice touch. \n\nThe game did appear to be a standard RPGMaker style\
      \ game which all tend to clash together for me, but something about this one\
      \ stuck out long enough for me to give it a shot and it did end up hooking me\
      \ for a while as I found the battle system to be enjoyable and satisfying when\
      \ finding the combos you like to pull off. It follows a standard turn-based\
      \ approach but I feel it does it well with a combination of little mechanics\
      \ that tie together the moves you can use at any given time. The gameplay loop\
      \ in general feels rewarding and also just very relaxing to play, the kind of\
      \ thing I can grind away at whilst watching something on another screen.\n\n\
      There were a few things I thought would've been nice were they to be implemented.\
      \ One is that I wished there were more chances to develop your characters in\
      \ terms of skills and strength, as past your stat upgrade of choice on a bonding\
      \ level-up, it felt like I was mostly just hoping for good drops at the end\
      \ of the combat rounds. Perhaps a small skill tree, or choices every few levels\
      \ for more prominent upgrades could be cool to opening up wider character customization\
      \ and how you want to build your party. It also seemed like once you learn your\
      \ character's 5-6 skills, there aren't any more for you to learn later, only\
      \ level upgrades to the skills (I could be wrong as I haven't progressed to\
      \ the end content yet, but it's my impression after around 10 hours or so).\n\
      \nIt could also feel a little slow at times, as it only seemed to give you loot\
      \ and XP when you clear a full round of enemies, which could range from 4 and\
      \ more encounters in a row depending on the difficulty of the area you're tackling.\
      \ This could be a little frustrating when one person gets KO'd unexpectedly\
      \ (keeping in mind reviving party members isn't really an option, with one sort-of\
      \ exception) and you're forced to end your run, as being one or even two members\
      \ down really halts your progress particularly on the boss rounds. \n\nI had\
      \ other minor complaints such as how small the bonding event talks last (only\
      \ a few lines or so), no clarification on stats gained on level-ups or just\
      \ a general feel of lack of progression, which could just be part of the issue\
      \ with grind-heavy games in general. I imagine a lot of these things would be\
      \ ironed out or more expanded upon in the final release, but who knows.\n\n\
      Eternal Dreamers has some fun and relaxing grind appeal and a lot of potential,\
      \ and I'd be curious to see how the game grows and gets polished and more refined\
      \ over the coming months. If you're looking for some solid grindy gameplay loops\
      \ and don't mind the general RPGMaker aesthetic, I'd say it's worth looking\
      \ into."
