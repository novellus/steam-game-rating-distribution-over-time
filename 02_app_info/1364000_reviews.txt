The jump scares weren't obvious like in a lot of games, and offered a good sense of fear throughout the game. The additional content after you complete the game was great. A lot of action in a small amount of time, and added more depth to the story of Hanesfield Asylum. Definitely a great buy for less than $10.","timestamp_created":1606269766,"timestamp_updated":1606269766,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwl/HI/vUCeP2rsAI="}
