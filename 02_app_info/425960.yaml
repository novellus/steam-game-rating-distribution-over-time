    review: 'If there is one thing that can really earn a boardgame ire and dislike,
      it has to be a poor ruleset. This is a game that has such an excellent premise
      - yet, it doesn''t execute the rules to play the game. Looking at the rulebook
      is a nightmare, sometimes rules aren''t in the rulebook, knowing what to do
      is pretty well up to the player....


      I don''t recommend this one.'
