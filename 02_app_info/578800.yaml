      the player needs to design by themselves, Phantom provides only the most basic
      &quot;function block.&quot; Second, these &quot;function blocks&quot; all follow
      Newton's law, they are alive, players can interact with them. Then based on
      the construction system, in theory, the player can create any highly interactive

      physical constraints, and even guts and so on. But in the Phantom world, electricity
      is almost the only need to be considered. Although it seems to greatly simplify
      the survival part of the game, but in fact it is a challenge of the distribution
      and management of the electricity, because in the Phantom world to do almost
      everything needs electricity, alive need electricity, running, fighting, construction,
      and so on all rely on electricity. more terrible is that those who build the
      functional blocks are all in need of electricity to operate. Power is very limited,
      then how to allocate power according to the situation is to challenge the players.<br></li></ul><br>When
      physical construction is combined with single source power survival, I believe
      that Phantom provides a unique gaming experience.

    short_description: Phantom is a hard sci-fi survival game. It is very different
      from other survival games; the player is a robot rather than human. At the same
      time the game has a pure physics-based construction system, which makes survival
      and fighting become very fun and different.
