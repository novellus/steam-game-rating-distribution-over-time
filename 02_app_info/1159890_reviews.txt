If you have been wanting a proper challenge in this Genre, this is the best game yet and will highly recommend to any fan of the drift car racing. Did I mention this game has the new Mercedes concept car (best car)? Please keep up the good work, PLAYWHIZGAMES you have done a great job awesome game kudos to the team gg (all I would like is some extra cars, please!)","timestamp_created":1570621949,"timestamp_updated":1570622011,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458598732948303223","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4576X2O0Cee7m0wE="}
