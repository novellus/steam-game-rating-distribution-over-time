      that challenges you to build up and unleash your rage against a never ending
      onslaught of undead!<h2 class="bb_tag">About This Game</h2>The more you destroy,
      the more rage you build up. What you do with rage is up to you by slotting different
      powers into your Gauge Of Rage. These powers will activate if you can keep your
      rage high enough. Build it all the way up to use a screen-clearing extermination
      move - but be careful as these moves will deplete all of your rage! Survive
      as long as you can and unlock all kinds of new powers, guns, levels, and mobs
      to fight!<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Chaotic
      and gory arcade style action against increasingly aggressive hordes of undead<br></li><li>Customize
      how you use rage by stacking your Gauge Of Rage with a variety of different
      powers<br></li><li>Upgrade and customize your guns with extended mags, longer
      barrels, rapid fire, laser sights and more<br></li><li>Over a dozen melee weapons
      including baseball bats, crowbars, laser swords, and guitars<br></li><li>Level
      up to unlock all kinds of new powers, weapons, maps, and mobs<br></li><li>Plug
      and play Xbox controller support featuring twin stick controls (the game also
      controls great with a keyboard and mouse)</li></ul>

    review: I've played a few hours of Gauge of Rage, and had a great time. I want
      to review this product so that this game can get an actual average and other
      gamers can find this little fun romp. Gauge of Rage is a zombie horde game,
      incentivizing rapid zombie kills to fill your Gauge of Rage(makes sense). The
      items and ultra moves are all entertaining, and at times hilarious. If you want
      a fun distraction for a few hours, and enjoy top down horde shooting with light
      progression mechanics, you can't really go wrong with this game. And besides,
      it's 4$. you'll easily get that much fun out of it within five minutes. Get
      it, enjoy,  review, and spread the word!
