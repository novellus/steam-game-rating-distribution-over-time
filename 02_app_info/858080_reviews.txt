Like other sandbox games (Mario Maker), enemies are going to be spammed in levels. The problem is that the enemies range from a fast moving bouncing projectile from a plant, a ladybug that throws balls at you at the worst time possible, and a spider that climbs along the roof and rains down death on you. I really feel like the enemies only add artificial difficulty to levels, since if you put enough of them in one area one of them will kill you sooner or later\n\n- The scoring system\nThe scoring system is the main competitive aspect to the game, but it is also pretty poorly designed. You get score for 3 things, collecting fruits/killing enemies, beating the level quickly, and special bonuses/collectables. This sounds fine, but the special bonuses ruin it for me. There are 2 special bonuses. One is for beating the level without getting hit, which is usually very hard when there are so many enemies in every level. The other is killing every enemy in the level, which is still hard (and sometimes impossible) to get in most levels. These 2 bonuses give points based on how many points you have previously (+50% and +30% respectively). That means that not only do you have to beat a level as fast as possible, you have to beat it as fast as possible, without getting hit by a single attack from the seemingly endless amount of enemies in levels. \n\n- Badges\nTo make scoring points and beating levels easier, they added badges. These range from gaining 2x points for a little bit, to 10 seconds of invincibility. The problem is that you have to spend coins for these badges, and they are a one time thing. That means that the top spot on the leaderboard goes to whoever happens to get lucky and use badges at the right time. I presonally think that using badges should sisqualify you from the leaderboard.  \n\n","timestamp_created":1543673673,"timestamp_updated":1543673673,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40t6HtecCdYmXtAE="}
