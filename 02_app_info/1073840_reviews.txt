Contrary to popular belief, throwing around loads of colourful adjectives is not the same thing as painting a scene. Also, inserting a decidedly American attitude into one of the most iconic British pieces of folklore has never been successful. Kevin Costner says hello...\n\nAlso, the many downright pointless anachronisms along with weird popular culture references do by no means blend in well with the classic saga. I am very fond of the legendary context of Robin Hood and have read a lot of different literary takes on the material. So the thought of a complex 'choose your own-adventure' game appealed to me. But I ended up feeling betrayed.\n\n\"Ask a dragon lady to help you with the ticket sale for a ball attended by ugly, chubby fairies\"?\n \n\"Have an 'archeologist' called  Jones pester you about sponsoring an excavation, with your character suggesting that his first name might be 'Indiana'...\"?\n\nSeriously?\n\nAs a fantasy parody aimed at teenagers, I can accept this. But as a serious take on the Robin Hood genre, hardly. Least of all for the ludicrous price of around 17 Euros.","timestamp_created":1603813689,"timestamp_updated":1607384101,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593774914741516113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iN7jn/YCe7W7qgI="}
