    review: 'Review slightly accommodated to reflect the changes from the latest update
      (2020).

      Dear Betamaximus, please remember that when you reply through any way to a review,
      a mail is sent to the person who submitted it if they have mail notifications
      ebaled.

      -------------

      As someone who has played Tetris and Tetris-like fangames for a long time, I
      would not recommend this to anyone in any skill level.


      Let''s go step by step WHY.


      Because like every good reviewer, I play the game before reviewing it.


      [h1] UI / UX, and overall game appearance. [/h1]

      The UI looks like a 15 year old that just began to learn how to use UnityUI
      designed something. It''s just buttons slapped all over the place with eyesearing
      colors on Arial. Not to mention the title screen which, if it moved, would cause
      seizures to people because of how clashing it is.

      ---

      2020 update: It''s still bad, and even worse now with the huge menu button.

      Some parts of the UI flat out do not work, and parts of the high score panels
      are broken.


      Also, the expansion pack is not even up in the Steam store.

      ---

      The game itself is also very basic looking. The playfield is mostly black, the
      blocks (normally called minos) are a very bleak gray that changes with "danger
      elements", the "danger elements" look like 3D shapes anyone with basic 3D can
      do in a few minutes...

      The UI overscrolls in certain parts, the buttons are unstylized, some strings
      that have the player''s name, for example, aren''t present...

      It really doesn''t look good.


      [h1]Sound Design[/h1]

      The game has a singular background BGM. It plays ONLY on the title screen. The
      in-game itself has no BGM, and BGM only plays when some danger elements are
      present which, in all honesty, sound really bad, especially the "ghost" one
      which has a small loop where the lyrics are just "ghost... ghost..."


      The sound effects for the pieces falling are passable, but not good enough or
      fit for the aesthetic the game''s... uh, trying to reach.


      [h1]Gameplay[/h1]

      Where do I start...

      The default controls are horrible and you can''t reconfigure the controls once
      you''re inside the game. You can only do so through the Unity Resolution Configuration
      dialog, and you can even see some of Unity''s default input buttons are still
      present. The game has no [url=https://harddrop.com/wiki/DAS]DAS[/url], which
      means you would need to tap several times the side keys to be able to move the
      active piece quickly to the other side. Not 0 DAS, [b]ABSOLUTELY no DAS.[/b]


      The game boasts in other social networks for having over 30 pieces, but the
      management of these pieces is horribly uneven. The [b]memoryless[/b] randomizer
      present does not take in consideration pseudopolyomino (minos can be or not
      next to each other) and polymino which means you will end up with an array of
      very unbalanced pieces. The pieces also are in a strict 3x3 mino grid, which
      means you WILL NEVER see an I4 (I shaped, 4 minos) piece. Along with that, the
      rotation center is always the center of this so-called grid, which means the
      O4 (O shaped, 4 minos) piece has its rotation center in a CORNER instead of
      the center of the piece.


      The multiple piece playstyle is also really bad given the default controls.
      Cycling through more than two pieces at a time gives a very bad problem and
      that is the lack of proper focus for each of the falling pieces. Not only you
      have to deal with the default controls that are very unintuitive,


      [url=https://oshisaure.itch.io/puzzle-juggle-trouble]The game that is being
      thrown shade at in the Steam Store description[/url]

      ---

      INTERMISSION: 2020 update--

      The shade thrown at the game mentioned above was removed, but does not excuse
      the fact it was already done.

      ---

      does a better job at managing both the multiple kinds of pieces you can generate,
      and the dual piece management as well, in which you just have to press a single
      button to alternate pieces. I recommend checking this one out, it''s free.


      The hard drop style present in this game is [url=https://harddrop.com/wiki/Drop#Hard_drop]Sonic
      Drop[/url] instead of a locking Hard Drop, which would be fine if the [url=https://harddrop.com/wiki/Drop#Soft_drop]Soft
      Drop[/url] would also lock the piece in place when colliding with the ground.


      The only thing I can give props to this game is because of the leaderboards,
      which is given by Steamworks, but even that''s exploitable...

      ---

      2020 update: Still is.
