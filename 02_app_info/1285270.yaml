    about_the_game: 'A fast-paced couch competitive farming game for up to 8 players.
      This farming life isn''t as calm and peaceful as you''d expect: to become the
      best farmer you will need unusual methods to prevent your enemies from succeding.<h2
      class="bb_tag"><strong>FAST PACED</strong></h2>Farm Your Friends matches lasts
      5 minutes, making it a frenetic and chaotic experience. Try selling as much
      as you can to be the winner while facing other players. You have to find the
      balance between taking care of your farm and sabotaging the other''s - but you
      won''t have time to think it through.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>ITEMS</strong></h2>You
      will not only receive rake, watering can and other tools for taking care of
      your farm, but also unexpected items that lead you to the victory. You''ll receive
      crates containing <strong>bombs</strong>, <strong>handcuffs</strong>, <strong>boxing
      gloves</strong>, <strong>tasers</strong> and many more! But don''t worry, there
      will be defensive items too, such as <strong>spike fences</strong>, <strong>scarecrows</strong>
      and <strong>force fields</strong> to keep other players away from you and your
      crops. Remember to always watch your step so you don''t fall in <strong>landmines</strong>
      or <strong>beartraps</strong> on the ground.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>RANDOM
      EVENTS</strong></h2>Beware of random events: they may be useful, confusing or
      even dangerous. A <strong>meteor</strong> might hit your farm, or a <strong>bolt</strong>
      strike you during a rainstorm, or someone could even get infected and start
      a <strong>zombie invasion.</strong><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>CHARACTERS</strong></h2>Choose
      the character that fits you the best, from a farmer boy to a literal scarecrow.
      You can also unlock even more unusual characters, such as a snowman and an astronaut.'
