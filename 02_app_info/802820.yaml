    review: "If you like montages to chip tunes BOY do I have the movie for you.\n\
      \nFar too much of this \"movie\" is just padding. Lots of shots following people\
      \ around walking to funky music. Not enough SEEING the games and SEEING the\
      \ development. \n\nIt's so bad that you don't see all of the games...in a movie\
      \ about making 12 different unique games.\n\nAnd don't let the title fool you,\
      \ only 30 minutes is dedicated to the jam itself, then its 30 minutes of presenting\
      \ the two winners to some big name companies, which just isn't waht I was expecting.\n\
      \nAlso for how much they are charging the movie isn't even an hour long, and\
      \ if you cut out all the bit-tune montages it'd be closer to 30 minutes. \n\n\
      Again I love the idea and certain parts of the movie were really interesting\
      \ and fun to see. But so much time is wasted on looking at big houses or shiny\
      \ looking events than the actual development of the game. If that's your thing\
      \ then enjoy but for anyone wanting to watch a close hour long film about the\
      \ JAM itself and the stress/drama it causes and how teams work so well in such\
      \ a small amount of time. This just isn't for you. Disappointed."
