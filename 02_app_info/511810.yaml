    short_description: CHEXS is an evolution of chess, a new take on the old classic.
      It is a strategy game played on a hexagonal board where both sides move all
      of its pieces within a single turn, then all movements are solved simultaneusly.

    review: "A chess-themed board game with simultaneous moves and complex, non-obvious\
      \ mechanic of attack resolution. It lacks polish and has bugs, so I'd only give\
      \ it a 5/10.\n\nPros:\n- some interesting rules about pieces movement and resolution\
      \ of attacks (reminded me of Diplomacy board game with \"support\" order)\n\n\
      Cons:\n- pretty basic graphics\n- camera controls are clunky (you need to push\
      \ the cursor to the sides of the screen to rotate the camera, and you can also\
      \ tilt the board with mouse wheel). Probably they should have used an orthographic\
      \ camera instead of a perspective one, or at least make FOV smaller; and more\
      \ ways to control the camera (with keys, and held right mouse button) would\
      \ be better, also with zoom in/out option.\n- the rook becomes invulnerable\
      \ if you give no orders to it (that's the game rule). But after you've given\
      \ an order to a rook there is no way to clear that order, only change direction.\
      \ There must be a way to clear orders of a piece (e.g. right-click or Escape\
      \ (which currently just instantly exits the game which is awkward)?)\n- even\
      \ after you've learnt the rules, the exact resolution of attacks remains somewhat\
      \ arcane due to the sheer complexity. Typically, after seeing the results of\
      \ a turn resolution phase, I spent 1-2 minutes just trying to understand why\
      \ what happened, and still wasn't completely sure why things happened they did.\
      \ Especially in the mid-game, when most of the pawns have met in the center\
      \ of the board, the turns are messy. This also may be due to the fact that there\
      \ are a lot of pieces present on the board at start. Had this been a TBS game\
      \ where you produce new pieces (like in UniWar for Android/iOS, for example,\
      \ or Advanced Wars for GameBoyAdvanced, then the board wouldn't be so much cluttered\
      \ and outcomes of turns would be more transparent).\n- there is a rule that\
      \ a piece can \"support\" another standing piece but sometimes you give that\
      \ order (yellow arrow) and sometimes you don't (just a green arrow, indicating\
      \ that the piece will attempt to move to the tile where the other piece is).\
      \ It's all pretty confusing. I'm still not sure if there are bugs in the logic\
      \ there, or the presentation is bugged, or I just didn't understand something.\
      \ Also, one time I saw an enemy bishop move onto a tile which was already occupied\
      \ by my bishop. They both \"merged\", and I could still select my white bishop\
      \ on the tile while only the black one was visible. So, my bet is, there are\
      \ still plenty of complex bugs in there.\n- resultion happens all at once, instead\
      \ I'd prefer a \">>\" button which would show each step separately (since all\
      \ happens iteratively in the code anyway).\n- intitializing multiplayer always\
      \ gives an error \"Error connecting to server: creating user\". \n\nThe game\
      \ has an interesting core idea (chess with Diplomacy-style combined attacks\
      \ + simultaneous moves) but it all crumbles upon itself due to the extreme complexity\
      \ of the turn resolution logic. Understanding the exact steps would be the main\
      \ thing for the game to exist here, without that the game degrades into randomness.\
      \ Still, even without clear understanding, I did win the few matches vs the\
      \ AI, so the AI might not be smart enough here.  \n\nThe game has very few downloads,\
      \ probably because it's Chess-themed while having too little to do with chess.\
      \ This could be a popular game (as far as a TBS game could be) if they chose\
      \ some other setting (robots? fantasy?) and maybe even switched to some cartoonish\
      \ 2D graphics. With a friendly enough GUI design, I could even imagine this\
      \ game getting somewhat popular on mobile, but that may be just well above this\
      \ dev's resources."
