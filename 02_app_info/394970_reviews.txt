With undead.\n\nThis is probably one of the most original games I've ever touched in terms of control schemes and gameplay. Instead of getting a top-down view, you are instead given a 2D view horizontally slicing buildings, displaying enemies on different stories. If you're curious why they went with this decision...\n\n[spoiler]Vampires[/spoiler] walk on the ceilings.\n\nSuch a simple little gameplay gimmick forces you to switch strategies, since you can't take cover from enemies shooting at you from the ceiling, and guards up there spot you easily. However, none of these guards ever thought to bring a flashlight, so taking out the lights is a valid strategy for messing up enemies. \n\nThis game is hard. As in \"I stealth killed 20 enemies and destroyed a safe, then the objective changed to 'GET OUT' and about 40 enemies suddenly stormed in through the front door and are heading straight in my direction.\" Thankfully, you have the [strike]least[/strike] most useful ability to turn into smoke, so long as it's to travel through vents. While occasionally lifesaving, its usefulness varies quite dramatically depending on the stage layout, which I found frustrating since you can't depend on it.  \n\nThe game is also somewhat short, featuring a total of [spoiler]27[/spoiler] levels, but these include jarringly well-handled boss battles, a rarity for games similar to Hotline Miami. Story is surprisingly compelling, and workshop content is available to add more stages and content to the game for those interested. Lore is pretty interesting and very in-depth for such a short title, very good work on the developers' end - would love to see a sequel, especially after seeing their work with Risk of Rain 2. \n\nIf you like hard games that keep your heartbeat racing and demand split-second reactions, this might be for you - look up some gameplay, and see how you feel about it.","timestamp_created":1609818497,"timestamp_updated":1609818497,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/puq6PYCeu/LwAI="}
