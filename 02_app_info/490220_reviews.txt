Also, not really a card game. There's no deck, and both players have the same hand of 'cards' to play from, which is always full. So it's more like a unique board game or something with a card aesthetic. Give it a shot, it's free.","timestamp_created":1603421756,"timestamp_updated":1603421756,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwpsvYqfUCcunEqQI="}
