    review: 'Controls are clunky. Game even suggests that the delay can be fixed by
      restarting the game in the dialogue of the game.

      Movement and jumping feels clunky.

      Most traps are unavoidable. They appear and hit you without any warning.

      There''s no way to block against enemies so when you attack you just have to
      take a hit.

      You hit a game blocking bug about 10 levels in when you get a new ability for
      your spear. The game gives you 1 shot with it to defeat one enemy but no way
      to recharge it.

      Levels all look the same and play the same.'
