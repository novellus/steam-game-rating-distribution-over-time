While the game is definitely not finished, it has potential. The basic building blocks of the game are all there; it just needs a story and some polishing. I've left the review as \"not recommended\" for now, since there are some serious issues with its current form, but I look forward to seeing the finished product.\n\n\nORIGINAL: This game is obviously not finished. The controls are glitchy, the levels are poorly planned, there's no story, new items and monsters are introduced with no explanation, and the only form of attack you're given is some sort of freeze-trap which is basically useless. This game is artificially difficult and poorly made. However, if these were fixed, I'm sure the game would be good.","timestamp_created":1526514099,"timestamp_updated":1528752479,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524169206619262695","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1526977078,"developer_response":"Hi, AndroidMonkey!\nThanks a lot for your review!
