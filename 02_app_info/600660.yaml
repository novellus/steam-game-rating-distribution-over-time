    review: Kimmy is a visual novel-style game about friendship, emotional vulnerability,
      and loss. Over the game's 3-hour span, the gameplay and story range from wholesome
      fluff to dark realism. I highly recommend Kimmy. It made me smile, and it made
      me cry. From the beautiful soundtrack and art to the wonderful story, it's worth
      every penny.
