Decorations and such are lacking in that you can't place multiple items and click/drag them to a better spot, no distinction between salt and fresh water fish/decor aside from judging how they look...not only that but it looks like a primary school child designed the food options...\n\nAll in all, not worth the money...if I could return it, I absolutely would... Hopefully the devs plan to update or fix their description or actually tweak the game to be what they say it is...","timestamp_created":1580411493,"timestamp_updated":1580411493,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qLP3++8Ce76R7wE="}
