      /><h2 class="bb_tag">An RPG-puzzle hybrid with focus on story. Unveil an emotional
      tale about dark and bright times!</h2><h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2>Grouchweasel
      is lost in a life he doesn't desire, but cannot escape. Nothing is unusual.
      Nothing is spectacular. He feels himself stagnating, becoming a mere vessel
      of emotions he is forced to contain. <br>When he realizes he can't go on like
      this any longer, he is tossed into a realm of dreams and reality. Or was this
      reality all this time? Grouchweasel must find out soon, however, because his
      stay may be cut perilously short. In this alien world, Grouchweasel will embark
      on the journey of his life. Everything is unusual. Everything is spectacular.
      And nothing is right!<h2 class="bb_tag">List of Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Hand-drawn

      class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2>RPG, action, skill and puzzle - Dark and Bright
      combines several genres. Each level must be navigated and cleared to continue
      Grouchweasel's journey for the truth. Within these levels, the player must collect
      certain magic orbs, and avoid touching enemies. An elegantly simple action battle
      system, as well as four playable characters with special abilities, makes this
      RPG a whole different experience!
