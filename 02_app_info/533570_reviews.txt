Apparently those are all remixes by Akira Yamaoka or Erika Ito. Also, some further music that plays in the game isn't included in the soundtrack, though most is. For the price I wouldn't recommend this package, the art book and comic are pretty enough but don't justify it to me. Though I will say some of the tracks on the soundtrack are absolutely beautiful.","timestamp_created":1595680506,"timestamp_updated":1595680506,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiYj+wvMCfcm6lwI="}
