    review: "I was expecting when I purchased this module for fantasy grounds (for\
      \ the price of 26,99 euro) that I would get a slick and easy functioning module\
      \ - I was wrong.\n\nOne thing that I have noticed is that the moment you criticise\
      \ the quality of this module, the developers of the said module or many other\
      \ players go out of their way and say that \"This is not D&D.\" I know this\
      \ is not D&D, this is Call of Cthulhu. That is not where my grievances lie with\
      \ this module.\n\nThe theme is first of hideous and does not suit the narrative\
      \ for the Call of Cthulhu. This weird beige colour (which can be changed) just\
      \ ruins the mood and the icons of which you find your NPC'S, vehicles, character\
      \ sheets, maps and so on are low-grade at best. \n\nI have used fantasy grounds\
      \ for well over two years now and I have had a great experience with this fantastic\
      \ program. I have used the D&D module, the pathfinder module, the starfinder\
      \ module and the call of Cthulhu module.\n\nThe Call of Cthulhu module is bleak\
      \ in comparison to the others when it comes to the quality of what you are paying\
      \ for.\n\nThere is no easy way for you to share images of NPC's (monsters) should\
      \ they appear. The vehicles section is empty even though the rule book mentions\
      \ that vehicles do exist, the chases tabs are nonsensical, several items are\
      \ missing when it comes to character creation. \nThese parts can be downloaded\
      \ separately created by users on the fantasy grounds forums as \"modules.\"\n\
      \nWhat you are getting is a drag & drop feature of some items, character sheets,\
      \ a list of occupations and that is it. It feels like you get the rulebook as\
      \ a PDF but it is in the fantasy grounds program which makes it hard to read\
      \ at times. You would be better off with purchasing this module as a PDF on\
      \ Chaosium's website and running your game on Roll 20 since the character sheets\
      \ there are free. It is cheaper, way way way way cheaper and less hassle.\n\n\
      Do not buy this."
