The actual tactical depth and variety in these combat encounters is good enough that this isn't a huge detriment, but it does make a lot of the combat feel 'same-y' as you explore each area, with the main variation being which enemy type you're fighting. Having more mixed-enemy battles, like the ones against rival parties, would have been fantastic. The AI is at least decent challenge, not so weak as to be trivial but not so smart as to be frustrating to fight. \n\nThe occasional puzzle and puzzle room is a great change of pace, and the music is remarkably good, with each area also having its own theme and combat music.\n\nMy main problem was how quickly it all ended. I explored a bit too far and found myself having beaten the game before I was really satisfied with it, and then it dawned on me how small the game really is. This stands out especially due to the procedural generation, which in hindsight almost feels out of place given the small scale. This is perhaps a larger issue than it would normally would be because of how engaging the core gameplay can be, so it's more disappointing to 'run out of road', so to speak.\n\nStill, the price is definitely right for what you get, and it's a pretty fun experience if you're into party building and turn based combat.","timestamp_created":1609029874,"timestamp_updated":1609030021,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+LXq0PYCc8jJvQI="}
