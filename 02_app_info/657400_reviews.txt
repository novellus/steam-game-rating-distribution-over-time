Why can't I hang on the vine when I loose up, but fall down? Why can't I jump when I press the Direction key facing the wall?\nI can see that the design is good, and I also like this style, but do you really testing the difficulty of the game?\nThis game is definitely abandoned by people because of operational problems.","timestamp_created":1540916992,"timestamp_updated":1540917715,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g8z24uYCfdbSrQE="}
