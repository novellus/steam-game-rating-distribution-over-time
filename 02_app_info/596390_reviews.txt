I really like the mechanics of the two characters, and the visual style of the game is great other than some of the levels looking kind of dull. Overall, I'd recommend picking it up if you're into this type of game.","timestamp_created":1591570726,"timestamp_updated":1591570726,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx7/AyPICc/3ljAI="}
