The first four regular playgrounds, added in DLC, don't require players to have necessary level, so they may be used for grinding XP and gold... But after that, there is only a little chance you will return. It's plot is extremely cliched, we just fight agains the leader of Orcs, who pretend to be like \"defender of grimmocks\". However, he obviously wants fame and gold only for himself, he makes a reversation about that EVERY time he talk, and he talks just too much. Yawn. No further descriptions are needed.\n\nThe leader on the final level himself, however, is probably the hardest enemy in the whole game, unless you are equipped good enough, and your level is high. His spells literally kill you in a matter of 1-2 seconds, and if you are not prepared for that battle, even in multiplayer mode you really have no chance to fight him down. This, and the fact, that at least two levels contan very horrible parts where you should be extremely fast and accurate, otherwise easily losing your life, probably are the reasons why even in parties players ofter avoid entering levels added by this DLC.\n\nLevel design is also extremely boring. There are only a few developers who can make desert levels look attracting. Keen Games does not belong to that league at all. Even the low price of this chapter is a little excuse of total lameness developers showed us in its design.\n\nP.S. The game itself never explains that orks were turned into \"grimmocks\", it just names orks as grimmocks. Only Steam description from developers has that explaination.\n\n[code]\n* [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/12320]Review of the \"Sacred Gold\"[/url]\n* [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/225640]Review of the \"Sacred 2 Gold\"[/url]\n* [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/247950/]Review of the \"Sacred 3\"[/url]\n   * [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/279110]Review of the \"Sacred 3: Malakhim Hero [DLC]\"[/url]\n   * [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/261161]Review of the \"Sacred 3: Orcland Story [DLC]\"[/url] (you are here)\n   * [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/279111]Review of the \"Sacred 3: Orc of Thrones [DLC]\"[/url]\n   * [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/279112]Review of the \"Sacred 3: Z4ngr13f Weapons Spirit [DLC]\"[/url] \n[/code]","timestamp_created":1551718681,"timestamp_updated":1557599656,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49933210015296936","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhJOL1OoCc8akvAE="}
