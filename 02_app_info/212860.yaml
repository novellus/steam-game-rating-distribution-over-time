    about_the_game: "<p>Splice is an experimental and artistic puzzler. Immerse yourself\
      \ in its microbial world and start splicing! Every level (\"strand\") consists\
      \ of a number of cells that you will need to rearrange into a target structure\
      \ in several moves (\"splices\"). Exploration and experimentation are key in\
      \ determining how the curious little cells react to each other. Predict the\
      \ sequence of splices you'll have to make in order to successfully arrange each\
      \ strand. Re-sequence, mutate, and splice your way through this unique puzzle\
      \ experience, and you'll exercise your ability to visualize sequential series\
      \ of shapes over time. Solve your way to the final strands and you'll be left\
      \ with a heady sense of mental accomplishment!</p>  \n\n<p>Splice is the fourth\
      \ title out of Cipher Prime Studios, and was the Best Puzzle Game winner of\
      \ the 2011 Intel Level Up contest.</p> "
