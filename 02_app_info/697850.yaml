    review: "I remember finding this game randomly on Steam before it was released.\n\
      \nThe idea really intrigued me, I really got hyped for its release. I really\
      \ can\u2019t say the idea is bad, but the execution\u2026 Oh boy.\n\nI don\u2019\
      t want to be too harsh since this game is clearly made by a small company or\
      \ maybe even by one person alone, so I will say the good things with the game\
      \ first:\n\n- Good idea, as I just said.\n- Good achievement farming game. This\
      \ game clearly has achievement farming in mind, and many games like this exists,\
      \ but they tend to be utter bullshit, dirt in the eye, shit in the stomach,\
      \ games you would rather fuck a donkey than to play it again. So if you have\
      \ in mind that this game is another achievement farmer, it is great actually,\
      \ maybe the best of this category.\n- Sound effects on point.\n- Really creative\
      \ name.\n- Did not make false advertising in the Steam page. This is the minimum\
      \ every game should do, but the fact that the video is a simple gameplay and\
      \ not an overly-edited video, really captures how the game actually is, instead\
      \ of trying to be misleading.\n- Really cheap.\n\nThat sums up all the good\
      \ things, now let\u2019s see the bad ones.\n\n- Fucked up graphics. Don\u2019\
      t get me wrong, I don\u2019t mind graphics, I am used to playing old games so\
      \ really I don\u2019t give a shit about how the game looks, but FPS is just\
      \ too much. The game is apparently made in Unreal Engine, which makes the lighting\
      \ and motion blur beautiful, and the gun is well-made, but everything else is\
      \ just a solid color, not even a gradient. You either make a realistic game,\
      \ or a simple-looking game, you can\u2019t do both, or it looks like shit. The\
      \ text after finishing a stage is also a solid color, doesn\u2019t even have\
      \ border colors, and it is the most basic font ever.\n\n- Lack of music. Seriously,\
      \ just watch the video. It feels soooo empty and makes you give up quickly,\
      \ but hey, it\u2019s better to have no music than to have a 3 second loop of\
      \ an annoying, ear-bleeding song, so maybe it\u2019s not THAT bad.\n\n- Only\
      \ one type of puzzle. For a game of which its entire premise is to be a \u201C\
      Fun Puzzle Shooter\u201D, all you do is shoot balls through squares.\n\n- Shit\
      \ physics. Sometimes it just doesn\u2019t work well. Your ball just bumps into\
      \ the corner of a square and goes flying.\n\n- Repetitive. This is obvious,\
      \ but you WILL get bored. I can\u2019t see someone playing this game for more\
      \ than 20 minutes. I have played for a little over an hour but it really feels\
      \ like it was eight hours.\n\n- The game is yet another achievement farmer.\
      \ I know this was sort of a good point before, but you just see how much blood\
      \ and sweat the development team put in this game: NONE.\nI\u2019m sorry, but\
      \ you can\u2019t make an achievement farmer and expect us to take the game seriously.\
      \ If you want to make a respected game, then don\u2019t make another game that\
      \ people buy only to show off their achievements on Steam. I really struggle\
      \ to respect a game made for the sole reason of being used as a token, or as\
      \ a braggin mechanism.\nIn the beginning I said I didn\u2019t want to be too\
      \ harsh, but just the fact that this is an achievement farmer makes it hard\
      \ for me to cope with the developers. Y\u2019all aren\u2019t making a game,\
      \ y\u2019all are exploiting Steam and people. It\u2019s not a surprise that\
      \ a lot of achievement farmers end up getting removed.\nIt\u2019s not cool to\
      \ see 50 achievements popping up per level if you want to have a good experience\
      \ playing.\n\n- It\u2019s cheap, but it should really be cheaper, for real,\
      \ possibly free. I would have neutral opinions about it if it was free.\n\n\
      For the gamers, do yourself a favor and don\u2019t buy this. To the developers,\
      \ please make a game with your heart and soul. Many people would kill to be\
      \ able to create what you did, but you clearly made it without any love, any\
      \ attention, and without worrying about the game itself.\n\nTo end it, the game\
      \ is good in the first 2 minutes, then it's boring, then it's bad. I would rather\
      \ use the money to buy one (1) small snack, and I am not overreacting.\n\nAbsolutely\
      \ do not recommend."
