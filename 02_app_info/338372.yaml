    review: 'After having spent two weekends with finnish vocabulary, this is my synopsis:


      Nice game [b]if[/b] you simply want to increase your vocabulary knowledge or
      repeat the words you already know... But Influent is not really suitable to
      learn an additional (new) language. Furthermore, you only get the words for
      the stuff, that can be found in the flat... would have been nice if opening
      the front door was possible... thus seeing more stuff and maybe even meet some
      neighbours (and be able to hear some standard sentences...)

      Handling is okay although steering the drone needs getting used to.


      Conclusion: It was fun to learn some finnish words, but the game will never
      never never ever be enough to teach you any level of language proficiency that
      is needed for even the most basic conversation. If you really want to learn
      a language on your own: there is quite a number of free-of-charge applications
      for your mobile phone that will really do the job... Still... i did not regret
      the time spent with influent...'
