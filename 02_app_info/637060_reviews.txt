The graphics looks good as usual, but the voice acting was strange at parts and the story was just generally lacking. I  would highly recommend you check out one of their other HO game series before you check out this one.","timestamp_created":1609566906,"timestamp_updated":1609566906,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6bzq4PYCfuXQvwI="}
