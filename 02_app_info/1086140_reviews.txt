Now, if I were to sell a game like this, I would want money, but $0.99 originally seems like a stretch. So, if you're thinking of buying this game, my advice is to wait for it on sale.\nAnd, sorry if it may seem like I'm picky, but can you make the coins bigger? It's very hard to collect them with my late reaction times.\n\nOverall rating: 8/10 (IMO)\nIt's a great game to play on the go or when you have a few minutes of spare time.","timestamp_created":1560037518,"timestamp_updated":1560037518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535186052322387695","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwq+3enOsCfNKEwwE="}
