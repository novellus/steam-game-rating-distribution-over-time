    about_the_game: "Return to Sender is a competitive horde mode first-person shooter\
      \ with retro graphics reminiscent of Wolfenstein 3D and a multiplayer mode inspired\
      \ by Tetris.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo what is a competitive horde mode, and how\
      \ can an fps be inspired by Tetris? Two players fight off hordes of enemies\
      \ in their own instance of the map, never directly interacting with each other.\
      \ However, the better one player does, the harder they make things for the other.\
      \ For example, every enemy killed is sent to the other player and upgrades can\
      \ be purchased to make enemies sent to the other player even stronger. Last\
      \ man standing wins."
