      \ a novelist struggling to write the most important book of his career while\
      \ trying to be the best husband and father he can be. The Kaplans have come\
      \ to a remote coastal home for the summer, unaware that they\u2019re sharing\
      \ the house with a mysterious ghostly presence: you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRead\
      \ the family\u2019s thoughts. Explore their memories. Uncover their desires\
      \ and intervene in their lives. But stay out of sight; you can\u2019t help the\
      \ Kaplans if they know there\u2019s a ghost in the house. It\u2019s up to you\
      \ to decide how Dan\u2019s career and family life will evolve, but choose carefully;\
      \ there are no easy answers, and every choice has a cost.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      Dan\u2019s relationships \u2013 to his work, his wife, and his son \u2013 react\
      \ and shift in response to your choices. With a different sequence of events\
      \ in every playthrough, The Novelist gives life to a unique experience each\
      \ time you play.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe decisions you make will define the Kaplans\u2019\
      \ lives, but they may also tell you something about yourself."
