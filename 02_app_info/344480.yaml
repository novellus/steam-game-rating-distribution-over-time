    about_the_game: '<strong>Quell is an enchanting puzzle game of logic and relaxation.</strong><br><br>The
      game-play is simple: slide a little water droplet around a window-pane, avoid
      the spikes and collect the pearls. Easy, right?<br><br>Absolutely, but the beauty
      of Quell is in the perfectly pitched difficulty curve - it''s just taxing enough
      to test your powers of logic, but never so much so that it stops being fun.
      The gentle music (by acclaimed composer Steven Cravis) and ambience create the
      perfect setting to allow your brain to engage fully with these ingenious puzzles.<br><br>If
      you''re willing to dig deeper still, there''s a side narrative which tells a
      touching story of love, loss and nostalgia. Either way, Quell is a haunting
      experience that will stay with you long after you''ve finished it. <br><br><strong>Fall
      in love with Quell...</strong>'
