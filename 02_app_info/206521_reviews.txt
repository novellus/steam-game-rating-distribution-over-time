The rewards you get from completing the missions are nice and the gimmicks are fun. Great with friends but still enjoyable solo. A must buy if you're a fan of Spiral Knights.","timestamp_created":1608851454,"timestamp_updated":1608851454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg5/By/YCeLzzvAI="}
