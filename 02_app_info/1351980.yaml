    review: "For my full review with pictures, visit: https://jamespwmartin.com/2020/07/28/review-2945-vr/\n\
      \nEDIT: \nSince posting my review, many changes have been made to the game,\
      \ which address a lot of the critiques I mentioned:\n-The vibration of the controller\
      \ has been greatly reduced to a micro-vibration.  While it is less distracting\
      \ than the previous vibration, it still feels unresponsive to what is happening\
      \ in the game.  The controller vibrates anytime your ship is firing at an enemy,\
      \ but it could feel more responsive, such as if it vibrated every time the ship\
      \ was hit by a projectile, or if there were variations in vibration based on\
      \ the weapon used.  The vibration doesn't seem to add anything to the experience\
      \ and could be better utilized.  \n-You now have to hold trigger in order to\
      \ fire your weapon, while this helps with the timing of certain weapons, holding\
      \ the trigger the whole time can get tiring.  Also, since trigger is now used\
      \ for firing, special abilities and bullet time now seem to be unmapped on the\
      \ Index controllers and I can't get them to work, pressing every button.  I\
      \ can't tell if these features were removed or if this is an issue that needs\
      \ to be fixed.\n-The environment shifted from being inside the spaceship hangar\
      \ to being outside in the vacuum of space, which visually, makes more sense.\n\
      -Leaderboard has been added, though it is difficult to understand have two different\
      \ numbers next to the name and I don't think it displays accurate scores, as\
      \ I know I got a higher score that it isn't showing.\n-There are weapon modifications\
      \ that can be picked up from fallen enemies.\n-The price was reduced to $13,\
      \ which I think definitely makes this game worth full-price, given how responsive\
      \ the developer is.\n_____________________\n2945 VR, by developer, Pineapple,\
      \ is essentially an evolution of the Xortex mini-game from Valve production,\
      \ The Lab.  Anyone who played Xortex will find that 2945 VR feels very familiar\
      \ and adds upon the core concept introduced by Valve.  Both games have you maneuver\
      \ a spaceship with your hand to dodge bullets and fire your own, by pointing\
      \ at enemies.  The controls are exactly the same, with trigger initiating your\
      \ special ability. \n\nThe gameplay is very recognizable; I was a big fan of\
      \ Xortex, which is why 2945 VR grabbed my attention.  No artificial locomotion\
      \ is required, which is a big plus for those who get motion sickness.  The way\
      \ you can shift your hand across the room to perform impossible flight maneuvers\
      \ almost feels like cheating \u2013 and exemplifies what can be achieved in\
      \ VR that a joystick could never accomplish.  The space that you can move around\
      \ in is bigger than Xortex \u2013 and you\u2019re going to need it.  Seated\
      \ and standing play is possible, but a larger play space will give you more\
      \ of an advantage in gameplay.\n\nThere are many comparisons to Xortex and that\
      \ is just unavoidable.  Many of the enemies are similar in how they function,\
      \ however the models of the spaceships and enemies in Valve\u2019s iteration\
      \ are more visually appealing and varied -- but effective character design is\
      \ just Valve\u2019s thing and it's hard to compete with.  The pace of Pineapple\u2019\
      s iteration starts out slower, whereas Xortex introduces more varied enemies\
      \ sooner; however 2945 VR evolves into far more complex gameplay.\n\nGetting\
      \ into the more advanced stages is where 2945 VR sets itself apart from the\
      \ competition, requiring you to take full advantage of your play space to dodge\
      \ massive barrages of bullets, while doing your best to keep aim.  The gameplay\
      \ becomes incredibly frantic with the addition of heat-seeking missiles and\
      \ varied patterns of bullets.  The laser enemy in Pineapple\u2019s iteration\
      \ is far more aggressive in how it whips across the arena -- an example of how\
      \ 2945 VR heightens the gameplay.  In general, the gameplay is more intense\
      \ than Xortex and more rewarding.  There is also a Hard Mode that skips the\
      \ easy levels and gets right to the challenge.\n\nThe bosses that you fight\
      \ between waves are another area where 2945 VR excels beyond the competition.\
      \  The boss fights are varied and offer different challenges from the waves\
      \ of enemies.  In my experience, the waves are harder than the boss fights,\
      \ simply because there are more enemies firing more varied bullets your way.\n\
      \nThe gameplay reminds me of Geometry Wars, in which you have to navigate through\
      \ different-acting projectiles, while also shooting back.  Except the level\
      \ of control you have in 2945 VR is completely impossible to achieve with a\
      \ standard joystick controller.  Moving your hand over your play space or stepping\
      \ out of your play area to dodge a wall of bullets almost feels like cheating,\
      \ but really is an example of the expanded possibilities in gaming, unbounded\
      \ by the limits of a 2D screen.\n\nThere were also instances in which I died\
      \ and I couldn't tell what killed me and even felt as if the game registered\
      \ a hit on my craft when there wasn't one.  Perhaps that is the ultimate downside\
      \ of VR, that a flaw in the motion tracking could result in an untimely death.\n\
      \nThere are three ships to chose from which all play differently but feel powerful\
      \ in their own respects.  That power may not be apparent at first, as you will\
      \ have to level up the power of their abilities with the currency you collect\
      \ by killing enemies.  I found the nuclear bomb weapon to be too bright and\
      \ it would block my vision of other things happening.  As I was playing, I ran\
      \ into a bug which wouldn\u2019t let me purchase certain enhancements, when\
      \ I clearly had enough points to buy them \u2013 a re-installation of the game\
      \ did not fix the problem.\n\nI also have to mention the vibration of the controller.\
      \  Every time you shoot at an enemy, the controller vibrates, but not in a way\
      \ that is responsive to your weapon or in a way that feels impactful.  It almost\
      \ feels like I\u2019m holding a vibrator in my hand and the whole time I\u2019\
      m playing, I can hear it buzzing.  Especially with the level of vibrant vibrations\
      \ exhibited as possible on the Valve Knuckles in Half Life: Alyx, improving\
      \ the vibration to be responsive and varied between the different ships, could\
      \ really enhance the experience.\n\nAs of now, there is only one location to\
      \ fight enemies in -- it looks like some kind of spaceship hangar that enemies\
      \ appear in.  The textures are nice and shiny, but it leaves me wanting more.\
      \  I think 2945 VR could benefit from more creative or visually striking backgrounds\
      \ to play in.  When fighting a barrage of spaceships, it really makes sense\
      \ to be out in the vacuum of space, or maybe surrounded by alien planets, as\
      \ opposed to inside the hangar of a spaceship.  The uniform location causes\
      \ me to crave visual variety as I play.\n\nIn Xortex, the motivating factor\
      \ to keep playing is beating high scores on the leaderboard; in 2945 VR the\
      \ motivation to keep playing is to get more currency to upgrade your weapons.\
      \  However, I imagine that at some point, you upgrade every weapon to max and\
      \ beat the last boss and then there is nothing to progress towards as you play.\
      \  It would be nice to see the implementation of a leaderboard system, though\
      \ there is a natural hindrance there, as a result of it being a new game with\
      \ few players.\n\nThe Steam update page notes 8 new weapon add-ons being added\
      \ to the game.  It would be nice to see more future updates that provide more\
      \ content, like more locations, enemies, or playable ships.  I wish I had a\
      \ better understanding of how the development will progress over time \u2013\
      \ if I did, it would be much easier to recommend 2945 VR at full price.\n\n\
      If you loved Xortex and want to play a more sporadic, challenging version with\
      \ multiple ships that can be leveled up, the full asking price of $16 for 2945\
      \ VR is pretty reasonable.  However, considering a very close competitor is\
      \ available for free, you might want to pick this one up on sale, if more challenging\
      \ levels and bosses aren\u2019t enticing enough for you.\n\nReviewed on:\nValve\
