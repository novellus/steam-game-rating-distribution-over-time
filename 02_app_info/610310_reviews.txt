Good RPG with choices galore, and failures will still help you make you stronger and unravels more of the story for further attempts. I finished the game with 11 hours of pretty dedicated gameplay, but there was still more to explore. The developers did a good job.","timestamp_created":1609267835,"timestamp_updated":1609267835,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h8711/YCcePDvgI="}
