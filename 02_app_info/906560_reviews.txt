You know, given the sexual exploitation the adult industry puts women through, I think we oughta throw ’em a bone.\n\nSo uh, [i]death to men (except for that one brooding guy in chapter seven!)[/i][/strike]\n\nVestal waits on the shores of Jali. She is approached by a shadowy figure, who seeks her mother Kayori. She passed away, leaving Vestal to take her place. The figure escorts her to her submarine, where they sail to Glwtwn. There, they exchange fish to append their travel funds.\n\nTo my understanding, the remainder of the story involves the adventures of the figure, and her newfound servant Vestal.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe titlescreen was boring, but serviceable. I didn’t appreciate the off-centered text, but the user-interface as a whole is stylish. You may select a variety of game modes from the main menu, but I could not spot any “options” or “settings” — this is unacceptable. The mouse cursor is disabled, which is a minor nuisance. Having a mouse cursor would have dramatically increased the ease of navigation between menus.\n\n[table][tr][td]To read the full length \"Visuals\", check this review out on Wombat Trap (dot-com).[/td][/tr][/table]\n\n[b]- The Goods-[/b]\nSex scenes are sprinkled within chapters of the visual novel. They look pretty alight, and consist of static CGs. They include some. . . kinky scenes that I’ll admit were right up my ally. The user-interface is hidden by default, making them the best sexy stuff this game has to offer. I wish more effort was put into the anime content and visual novel; had it been, I think the sexual production value could have been bonkers! Expect female-on-female and male-on-female sexual content.\n\n[table][tr][td]To read the full length \"Goods\", check this review out on Wombat Trap (dot-com).[/td][/tr][/table]\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nI find it difficult to recommend this game; but at the same time, I almost feel bad. There is a ton of [i]love[/i] and content in [b]Bare Boob Brawlerz Visual Novel: Vol 1[/b]. While I found the story to be grossly overwhelming, I could tell that there is more than meets the eye. I think this game would most appeal to pre-existing fans of the Bare Boobs Brawlerz universe. This game is too rough around the edges for my taste; however, if you’re interested in this game, I think that it is reasonably priced, especially when it goes on sale.\n\n[table][tr][td][url=https://wombattrap.com/review/bare-boob-brawlerz-visual-novel-vol-1/]To read the full length review, click here![/url][/td][/tr][/table]\n\n[h1]Support the Wombat[/h1]\n[b]<3[/b] Follow the [b]Wombat Trap Curator[/b] page for more reviews!
