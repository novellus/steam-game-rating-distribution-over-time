    review: I had fairly low expectations going in, and I was pleasantly surprised
      to find the final experience very engaging and well polished. While the game
      starts off fairly trivial, each mission is changed substantially enough to actually
      benefit from playing strategically. While I wish there was a way to turn up
      the difficulty a little bit to make this more apparent, terranova affords many
      different strategies to win a mission. What is extremely surprising (in a good
      way) is that missions are quite often quite different from what intelligence
      was able to supply - which makes those missions much more engaging and immersive.
      There are many small nitpicks I have, such as the AI not listening to your orders
      100% of the time, shooting at enemies directly above you, and a very corny story,
      but the core of the game is fantastic and far surpasses other shooters on the
      market today.
