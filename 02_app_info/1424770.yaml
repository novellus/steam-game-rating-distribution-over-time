    review: "TL;DR\n\nPro:\n\nIt's Pretty.\n\nCons:\n\nLevels do not link together\
      \ properly.\nBGM doesn't work.\nLimited options.\nPoorly implemented story with\
      \ bad grammar and spelling mistakes.\nFlight mechanics are TERRIBLE.\nDifficulty\
      \ is artificial.\nGame is very short.\nACHIEVEMENTS ARE BROKEN.\n[b] Developer\
      \ releases new games with same problems and never fixes them. [/b]\n\nI hate\
      \ to leave bad reviews.  Even with games that aren't particularly fun or original,\
      \ I still generally rate them favourably.  Making a game is hard work, and anyone\
      \ who does should be commended, unless as is the case here, there are too many\
      \ problems with the underlying systems.  And even more egregiously the developer\
      \ seems to continue to release games with the same problems and does nothing\
      \ to address the issues.\n\nThe game looks gorgeous, and I did enjoy looking\
      \ at the magical realist worlds.  Each level has a different shader in effect\
      \ which leads to some rather ethereal views and does make for some occasional\
      \ breathtaking moments.\n\nUnfortunately, that's really the only good thing\
      \ going for this game.  It looks pretty.\n\nThis beauty is superficial, and\
      \ right from the outset my alarm bells were ringing.  The options screen is\
      \ so very limited.  Audio options are three sliders for main, music and sound.\
      \  Controls are for invert Y and Sensibility (sic).  Graphics have a fairly\
      \ generous range of resolutions.  That's it.\n\nAs soon as I started the game,\
      \ the silence was deafening.  There is no background music in this game, besides\
      \ in the opening menu screen.  I checked on the discussion thread and this is\
      \ a known issue.  The developer responded to another user by essentially asking\
      \ \"did you check the sliders were fully up?\"  Of course changing the sliders\
      \ makes no difference, and so you must swoop around these pretty worlds without\
      \ so much as a breeze blowing or the sound of your wings flapping.\n\nAt the\
      \ start of each level there is an obnoxiously long \"story\" thread which cannot\
      \ be skipped.  It is often nonsensical and is littered with grammatical and\
      \ spelling errors.  Of course everything has to have a story these days, even\
      \ Doom Eternal has a story, but really here it is unnecessary.  A brief opening\
      \ line or two would suffice.  My biggest issue is that often these lines of\
      \ story are describing something which is not representative of what is happening\
      \ in the game.  This rather takes you out of the experience.\n\nAfter completing\
      \ a level, the game throws you back to the initial stage.  There is no progression.\
      \  You must quit to the main menu, and start again.  The map screen does unlock\
      \ the next level, but it does not flow through them in a natural way.  This\
      \ is true of EVERY level.\n\nNone of the achievements unlock upon completion\
      \ of a level, nor does completing the game unlock them.  ACHIEVEMENTS ARE BROKEN.\n\
      \nThe actual flight mechanics are terrible.  This does not feel like flying,\
      \ rather you are simply moving forward at a fixed velocity.  Diving towards\
      \ the ground does not cause the bird to accelerate.  You could replace the model\
      \ of the bird with anything else and it would feel as much like flying.  Someone\
      \ else described it as flying a brick and I would totally agree.  We can only\
      \ change direction, and even that feels stiff and unnatural.\n\nIn each level,\
      \ you are tasked with finding a number of feathers.  These give off light, but\
      \ regularly bleed into the background to make seeing them more of a lucky happenstance\
      \ than requiring any actual skill.  You will need eagle eyes of your own.  This\
      \ artificially increases the difficulty.  This is hardly surprising as the game\
      \ is very short.  I completed all levels in around an hour.\n\nAlso, while I'm\
      \ on the subject, why the heck are we a PARROT?  So many beautiful birds known\
      \ for their grace and aerial superiority, and we are a parrot.  It feels more\
      \ like an ex parrot.\n\nAnd worst of all, from reading reviews and discussions\
      \ for the next two games, all of these same problems exist in those games too.\
      \  The developer releases new games without addressing issues with past games.\
      \  This is BAD PRACTICE.  \n\nIt's also worth noting, all the positive reviews\
      \ seem to be from accounts with very few games or other reviews.  I'm not saying\
      \ they are all from the same source or paid for reviews, but I am thinking it\
      \ very loudly:\n\n\nSweet Girl says \"This game helps you relax, the flight\
      \ is especially well worked out.\"  \n\n\uE04A \u263C\u0141\u0113\u2716'\u03B1\
      \u0158\u263C \uE04B \u262D  says \"I like to relax to my own music more, so\
      \ I turned it off in the game (don't thank the life hack for this).\"\n\nNot\
      \ Jelimazu says \"In short, an exciting and soothing game with a pleasant visual\
      \ map and relaxing music..\"\n\nempira's full review reads \"Looks very bright!\
      \ I haven't bought new games for a long time, but now I could not resist ...\
      \ the 20% discount influenced my choice. The game captures with its atmosphere\
      \ and freedom. But the game is only suitable for a short time\".\n\n\nAll of\
      \ these reviews seem to be in the same vein.  They misrepresent, they fail to\
      \ mention any of the problems and they all share a similar tone of voice.\n\n\
      Like I say, I hate to leave a negative review but I could not in good conscience\
      \ support this developer.  I feel a more representative review is necessary\
      \ to either warn others away; or to make the developer sit up and take notice\
      \ that people who have actually paid for the games are not happy with the lack\
      \ of support and apparent disregard for their complaints.\n\nA real Dodo."
