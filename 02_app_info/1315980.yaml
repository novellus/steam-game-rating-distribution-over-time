    review: This game has a ton of potential, though it could probably benefit from
      even a small amount of additional tutorialization.  It throws you in right away
      with only a manual for help and you're left to your own intuition to figure
      out how things work or what things mean and how to fix them.  However the manual
      basically just lists what things are and what functions they have and what error
      codes mean, and not how to fix or prevent any of said errors.  Might make some
      people bounce off it if it's not clear what even is going wrong.  Also, and
      this is just my opinion, it would be great in VR especially since it uses a
      two hands holding things system, but that'd just be an extra.
