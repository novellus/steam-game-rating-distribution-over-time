This changes up the GameHouse formula just a little bit. In the first fifty levels, you move between locations as it makes sense for the story instead of being confined to one location for ten levels at a time. The mini-games are no longer timed which takes a bit of pressure off.\n\nMy one criticism is that the final upgrades come at a time when you no longer have levels to play, making them useless.\n\nI am very excited for more Detective Jackie games since this one ends on a HUGE cliffhanger!!","timestamp_created":1609542156,"timestamp_updated":1609542156,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7oeM4PYCe9HFvwI="}
