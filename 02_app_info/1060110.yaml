    review: 'I bought this game as a joke (although originally thought there might
      be something worthwhile)


      - graphics are oversized and designed for mainly a enormous 37 inch flat screen,
      i''ll assume that when the game is full screened to 4k HD resolution, the entire
      game won''t look like some kiddy''s playtoy getting shoved into a game!

      - options & game options etc aren''t available at the first screen, instead
      you need to start a game to access the proper menu system (most likely the developer
      has little or no understanding of game design & layout)


      beware that due to the second point mentioned, the game will blare out the atrocious
      soundtrack that can''t be turned off until you get into a saved game etc, make
      sure you do not have your sound system turned on or up high!'
