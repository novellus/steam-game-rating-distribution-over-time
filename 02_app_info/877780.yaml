    review: 'To be clear, the only smart ones here were the devs. This puzzle uses
      cat-shaped cuts (among others), and the resulting abominations are not the cute
      kittens in the original pictures. Level ten will haunt my dreams forever as
      an example of why man must never play God. Seriously, though. The pictures aren''t
      super crisp and the kittens look super deformed from the puzzle cuts. Is it
      worth .49 cents USD on sale? If you love all kittens, even the ones most people
      would not, then yes.


      The sad thing is, with crisper photos and the deformities from the cuts fixed
      it could be a good if small game. If that ever happens, I''ll happily flip my
      review to a recommend as some of the kittens remind me of those posters from
      the 1980s.'
