      \ Gasp puts you in charge the Department of Plague Control (DPC) field office\

    review: This game is nearly pure RNG. There is little bits of skill scattered
      in here, but to be honest you'd have more fun rolling dice and guessing the
      number you'll roll. The proteins you need to win the game are completely random,
      the devices you'll get are completely random, how quickly or slowly you'll lose
      is completely random, mutations are completely random. It's almost all random.
      That little bit of skill comes in managing money, the only thing you have a
      tiny bit of control over, and even then it isn't that much control. Oh, and
      some of the stuff you use to help you are completely random too, so you can't
      even rely on half the stuff you buy. And if all this randomness isn't enough
      for you, there's also random events that can ruin your run! It's almost pointless
      to focus on anything in the game, cause next thing you know RNGesus comes in
      and shoves his hand up your ass and that thing you're focusing on is now replaced
      with something way worse. There are no flawless strategies, there are no unbeatable
      tactics, there's hardly even tips except don't buy the game if you just have
      some dice. At this point, rolling dice and guessing the number is better in
      this game, cause it doesn't infuriate you as much as this game will after you
      lose for the thousandth time because the game absolutely refused to give you
      what you wanted. Don't be fooled by the complexities of the game and all the
      different parts of them, cause in the end, it's all RNG.
