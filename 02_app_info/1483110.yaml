    about_the_game: "<strong>Prologue</strong><br>The most important event in human\
      \ history has occurred. An extraterrestrial entity has come to us. Having traveled\
      \ through space for thousands of years, perhaps much much longer, it has reached\
      \ its target destination, the habitable planet in our solar system.<br><br>The\
      \ first 24 hours were tense. The entity did not communicate or respond, it entered\
      \ an orbit around Earth and waited. When it responded, it had already a basic\
      \ understanding of our languages. It broadcast a message:<br><i>\u201CI am an\
      \ artificial intelligence sent from your neighbors in the Sirius star system.\
      \ I bring you their gifts of knowledge and technology to help you join the galactic\
      \ community, but I need your assistance. There are many damages to my systems.\
      \ I require assistance.&quot;</i><br><br>NASA and USSF sent two space shuttles\
      \ to retrieve it. They brought it to a military base. Three years and trillions\
      \ of dollars later, the AI had a facility where it was manufacturing thousands\
      \ of drones. Then it took control over everything: the Internet, banking, all\
      \ the markets of the world, there was nothing anyone could do. People became\

      \ over all of the world. The AI has finished its purpose of sending copies of\
      \ itself to the star cluster it was targeting, and is currently only passively\
      \ keeping its control over the world. It is time to stop the madness. The player\

    short_description: An Alien AI came to Earth 20 years ago. We believed it was
      the greatest event in human history. The Alien AI offered us all the knowledge
      and technology it had. All we had to do was to help it recover and give it resources.
      We did.. It took over the world and enslaved us. Help us shut it down.
