Steam is a great portal for learn new stuff, in games we play daily as well as movies its provides. I guess I will never see that kind of documentary on TV /I dont watch TV anyways xD/. \nWe know so much about US, Mexico, UK and tnt., I wonder who and is it possible, someone to make a documentary movies about some other places in ths huge world, those places people are not aware? \nI live in Bulgaria, we have significant history, a magnificent culture, we have so much to tell, and yet I havent seen/heard anything, not just in Media /because Media sux/, but nowhere. I think /and not just me/, that this is with meaning and makes me/us angry!\nI hope for more and more documentary in future about everything , everyone in this world - it is very interesting and full of knowledge.
