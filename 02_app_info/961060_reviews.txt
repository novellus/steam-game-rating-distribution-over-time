I love Unity engine. Game looks beautiful, but this is waste of money for now.  Game needs some polish, like Options Menu or level complexity. To many ways to go at the begining with hidden stuff without reasonable tutorial. I spend 22 minutues playing. That was few days ago. Now I'm gonna to uninstall it. Will come back later if game get more updates. For now there is no fun for me in that game.","timestamp_created":1550693141,"timestamp_updated":1550693141,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.479052841663360596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oPGghukCf8OzuwE="}
