    review: "A green-skinned young witch named Mabel Syrup turns into a big, bouncy\
      \ eyeball (why not a boob, liver, or buttock?) to recover her stolen magical\
      \ ingredients in this incredibly novel take on the breakout subgenre.  While\
      \ smashable blocks [i]are[/i] there in plenty, the majority of the challenge\
      \ comes from the huge roster of foes and their extremely well-animated attacks,\
      \ which increase in number and swiftness with the jump to hard mode.  Normal\
      \ is pretty dang easy on the whole -- almost [i]casual[/i] in spots -- so I\
      \ would encourage veteran 2D gamers seeking a bigger bang for their buck to\
      \ immediately go for hard after beating the base game; all bosses are noticeably\
      \ beefed up, not with more life or attack power, but with trickier patterns\
      \ and maneuvers, and this is objectively the [b]correct[/b] way to do such things.\
      \  Bravo! \n\nSince we're getting to a spot where the average Steam user has\
      \ about 1000+ games in his library, the amount of attention the typical indie\
      \ gets is plummeting like a cartoon anvil, with experiences that \"open up\"\
      \ later frequently being discarded before they get a chance to shine.  On that\
      \ note, I'd like to reassure anybody on the fence with this one that the depth\
      \ and wildness of [i]Witcheye's[/i] invention [b]explodes[/b] after the first\
      \ world, which is merely a fun, but admittedly staid training gauntlet -- so\
      \ stick with it if you want to get into all the super-fun (and legitimately\
      \ funny) stuff.  \n\nShort, clever, highly replayable, pretty as heck, bug-free,\
      \ and with a crazy diversity of jazzy tunes, [i]Witcheye[/i] is worth it at\
      \ full price, and an absolute steal on sale."
