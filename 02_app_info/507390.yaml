    review: I really wish I could say more good things about this game, but I'd be
      lying. I like this game. It was good for the 49 cents it costs right now, but
      I wouldn't recommend it. The story is short, the text is confusing, and I felt
      like it didn't really convey the theme it was trying to. It was a cool experience,
      but very chaotic. I never truly understood what was going on until near the
      end.
