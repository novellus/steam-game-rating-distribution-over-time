    review: I just about finished this DLC and now my game is bugged at the end of
      the Rust and Vengeance questline because the Headmaster Raul Salaberry is no
      where to be found in Harmattan and Berg so I am not able to complete the main
      quest. I had to look up help and a few people had the same issue with no fix.
      Once this bug gets fixed I will change my review to positive as the rest of
      the DLC was a joy to play.
