This RPG has most all of the elements you want in an RPG - a good turn based battle system, a unique cast with different abilities, exploration, crafting, side quests....it took me about 30 hrs to complete, with all side quests and optional bosses (although there was one I finally gave up on). \n\nYou start off in a town and are told to pick your team of 4 to go save the king. From here you can pick from every class imaginable (practically). That will definitely the replayability, since you can choose many different casts. I started with the warrior, cleric, wizard (or mage), and bard. But you can choose a rogue, witch, knight, monk....just to name a few. Then your journey starts off - pretty straight forward. Thankfully you can back track, which helps with quests, mining, etc.\n\nThe only con I would say is that the characters didn't interact with each other, nor was there as much of a story, as in the previous games. That was one of my favorite things in the first game particularily, how saucy some characters are. However the game play/battle system was definitely much improved, as was the crafting, mining, quests....One of the best things about this game is how visually beautiful some of the maps are, and the music works well with the mood, and isn't your standard stuff.\n\nDefinitely a thumbs up, and worth playing. I'm looking forward to more games from this developer!\n\n","timestamp_created":1609548473,"timestamp_updated":1609548473,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qpSk4PYCf9/IvwI="}
