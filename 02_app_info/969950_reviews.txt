Harvestable trees are randomized though, so those of you who already own WS11 could get a bit of use out of it by replaying the first two missions a couple times each I guess.","timestamp_created":1574560381,"timestamp_updated":1574560381,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.574096500873565674","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hJfHze4Cd7Og3AE="}
