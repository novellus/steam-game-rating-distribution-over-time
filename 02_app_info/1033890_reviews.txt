Well, I got to say, it's amazing story if you went to the bad ending.\nProbably the best plot in the whole game. It's 9/10 for Johanka's story.","timestamp_created":1610002794,"timestamp_updated":1610003350,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn7Dr7fYCcNmawQI="}
