    review: 'I have to say that this game is surprisingly fun.  By that, I mean that
      I purchased this game for my son to play because he really enjoyed the single-player
      game [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/453750/Tyto_Ecology/]Tyto Ecology[/url].  Figured
      it would be his first MMORPG.  But I found myself playing this game together
      with him to do the puzzles and then kept on playing after he went to bed "so
      I could help him out better" the next day.


      How is the game?  It''s an educational game!  Designed to be fun!  And it succeeds
      in both.  My son was so busy collecting pets [spoiler]PEGACORN![/spoiler] ,
      outfits, and stuff for his in-game home that he really got into all of the puzzles
      and learning quests.  We''re talking simple things like which animals eat what
      food to complex things like heredity and behavior.


      How is the Early Access?  I haven''t seen any bugs or had the game crash at
      all.  There is new content and improvements added on a regular basis and regular
      (31 as of this review) communication from the developers here on Steam.  Basically,
      everything you should expect from Early Access.'
