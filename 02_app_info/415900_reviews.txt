Just playing through the tutorial was finicky. Since the controls are unintuitive and cumbersome it's not good for a casual multiplayer game. Someone compared it to smash bros. I guess that's a good way to look at it. I was looking for a more casual game that new players could jump right into and understand. If your friends want to spend time to acclimate to the unique controls and mechanics you may enjoy it. I can tell the developer cared about the game, but it just wasn't for me or my friends.","timestamp_created":1580774938,"timestamp_updated":1585067189,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sLzXhvECfYmK8AE="}
