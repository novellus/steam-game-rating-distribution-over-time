    review: "this game is ... bizarre?? theres only 1 objective and thats to find\
      \ 10 little blue balls by listening out for them, it was pretty easy for me,\
      \ but thats all the game is. a few times i saw a sort of monster or creature\
      \ and thought maybe, possibly something interesting would happen but nah. its\
      \ just a barren clearing filled with rocks that you walk around and find little\
      \ balls in. and even worse, when i had found the 10th ball, the game congradulated\
      \ me... and then told me that ONE of the balls i had picked up was actually\
      \ a \"dark blue\" ball and that clearly i wasnt listening to instruction and\
      \ was to be liquidated... so they killed me and the game was over.\n\nthis was\
      \ a weird experience, very boring in places but had potential in others. but\
      \ i feel like it should have been a free game, although it is only $1 so if\
      \ you really want to play it then at least its not expensive,, \n\nGame Rating:\
      \ 1/5"
