It works smoothly, uses a wide screen without distortion, and has an interactive map.  The game also has a fully integrated guide, although it is less necessary than for many of these kinds of games. [Forgot to mention in original review: the bonus chapter is short and felt contrived (more than usual).]\n\nPros:\n- excellent dry humour\n- coherent, interesting story\n- continuing character (protagonist)\n- the special feature of the game (acquiring certain living statues with different functions) is used intelligently by the writer(s), and feels much less gimmicky that expected\n- collectibles aren't obvious, but are reasonably noticeable if you're looking\n- about the right number of HO scenes (word lists)\n- excellent cut scenes, I enjoyed the fantasy movie feel :)\n\n[a note on the HO scenes:  they're not easy, but all of the objects are distinct and visible; for the most part, objects are hidden by being well-placed; however, there were a few instances where there were too many neutral colours, or objects were hidden within a spot of the same colour]\n\nCons:  none to mention except as immediately above.  This is an excellent game for any HOPA collection; a 9/10","timestamp_created":1594795786,"timestamp_updated":1594839861,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.613054215908050537","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48KD3qfMCcb+ylQI="}
