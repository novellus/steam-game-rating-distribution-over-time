    review: Cool classic RPG. The world are wide and there are lot of things and places
      to explore. The story is deep and twisted. Even tho sometimes it was hard to
      find the quest items, but u can finish them all by doing some exploring and
      talking to a lot of NPC because their quests sometimes solve other quest. Overall
      it was a fun experience with this game.
