It sets theme wonderfully and is great example of what you can do with synth.  Listening it to the first time I kept saying things like, \"Huh, why is this next song called 'It Will All Be Okay'? ... ... OH YEAH *THIS* SONG THAT IS TOTALLY WHAT THAT IS.\"\n\nIt's probably not going to have that effect for you if you didn't like the game.  But if you did then this is a fantastic addition.","timestamp_created":1530487904,"timestamp_updated":1530487904,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8IKMrOQCfsP0pAE="}
