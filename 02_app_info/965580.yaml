      \ effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the wandering <strong>Vagabonds</strong>\
      \ who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some\
      \ may sympathize with the Alliance\u2019s hopes and dreams, these wanderers\

      \ <strong>Eyrie</strong> have found a new commander who they hope will lead\
      \ their faction to resume their ancient birthright.<br><br>The stage is set\

      \ /><br>The most recent conquerors of the forest, the <strong>Marquise de Cat</strong>\
      \ plays a game of engine building and logistics while policing the vast wilderness.\
      \ By collecting Wood they are able to build Workshops, Sawmills, and Recruiters\
      \ to help her score victory points. Marquise de Cat has the largest army in\
      \ ROOT, but numbers alone won\u2019t be enough to secure the forest...<br><br>The\
      \ Marquise de Cat builds a mighty industrial war machine to subdue the forest.\
      \ Each time the Marquise builds a Workshop, Sawmill, or Recruiter, you score\
      \ victory points. The more of the same building she has on the map, the more\
      \ points scored. However, to fuel ongoing construction, the Marquise must maintain\
      \ and protect a strong, interconnected economy of Wood. While it may be tempting\
      \ to overwhelm your opponents with sheer numbers, this leaves you at great risk\
      \ of spreading yourself too thin and ultimately not being able to keep up.<br><br><img\

      \ /><br>The <strong>Eyrie Dynasties</strong> once ruled the wood, before the\
      \ coming of the Cats. They must retake control by capturing territory and building\
      \ Roosts before they collapse back into squabbling. The Eyrie are proud and\
      \ bound to the decrees of their leaders. Each leader brings with them different\
      \ specialties and advantages. The right leader at the right time could lead\
      \ you to victory, but the wrong leader could cripple your chances of reclaiming\
      \ the forest.<br><br>During the Evening, the Eyrie score victory points based\
      \ on the number of roosts on the map. The greater their presence in the Woodlands,\
      \ the greater their gains. However, the Eyrie are bound by their Decree, an\
      \ ever-increasing set of mandated actions promised by their leader. Each turn,\
      \ they must take all of the actions on their Decree, or else fall into turmoil.<br><br><img\

      \ /><br>The <strong>Woodland Alliance</strong> doesn\u2019t take kindly to despots\
      \ - old or new. Marquise, Eyrie, they\u2019re all the same. Only through the\
      \ will of the people can this wood be ruled! The Woodland Alliance are masters\
      \ of guerrilla warfare, they begin slowly but can build into a late-game powerhouse\
      \ - but only if they can manage to subvert the other would-be rulers along the\
      \ way.<br><br>The Woodland Alliance works to gain the sympathy of the various\
      \ creatures of the forest. Each time the Alliance places a sympathy token, they\
      \ may score victory points. The more sympathy on the map they have, the more\
      \ victory points they score. Gaining the sympathy of the people requires supporters.\
      \ These supporters can also be put toward violent ends, inciting outright rebellion\
      \ across the forest. When a revolt erupts, the Alliance will establish a base.\
      \ Bases allow the Alliance to train officers, increasing their military strength\
      \ and flexibility.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/965580/extras/ROOT_Factions_Vagabond_Button.png?t=1608249508\"\

      \ will explore all over the map, beyond just it's clearings, into dense woods\
      \ to find items and ruins. You can trade and lend aid to the warring factions\
      \ of the forest to help you complete your own secret quests.<br><br>The Vagabond\
      \ plays all sides of the conflict while going on quests to increase his renown\
      \ throughout the wood. Each time the Vagabond improves their relationship with\
      \ another faction, or removes a warrior belonging to a faction hostile toward\
      \ them, the Vagabond scores victory points. You can also complete quests to\
      \ score victory points. To move and act effectively the Vagabond must manage\
      \ a pack of items, expand your selection by exploring the forest ruins and providing\
      \ aid to other factions.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/965580/extras/RootFooter.png?t=1608249508\"\
