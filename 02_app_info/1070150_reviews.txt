There's a lot of hurtbox jank, where you are placed and where you are sent by moves seems very arbitrary. The aesthetic is incredibly bland and inoffensive, blizzard sure did strike gold with Overwatch and I will never not dislike it. I don't know if it's the camera, but one of the two battlefields (3 stages btw) this game has is incredibly large and top platform is not easily accessible without hella commitment. All of the game feel feels incredibly stiff yet flaccid at the same time outside of the honestly distracting amounts of hitlag. I really don't know what they're going for with the right stick's functionality, I have no clue whether or not it's supposed to be a smash stick and a special stick, or they just don't have full movesets programmed yet, or what. This is incredibly rambly but that's because I can't be arsed to write a review for this when there's so much that needs to be fixed before this was put on steam for 5 dollars as early access.\n\nWhy did they give the zoner of the cast a special designed to force approaches instead of literally anyone else, why does she have 2 different porportionally GIGANTIC projectiles, one of which kills and trades on hit, why does she have a short hop double nair, why did they give her an aerial down special with very little tell (if it's not near instant) that covers more than her entire body, and a back air the size of a moon and kills at 60 and has ROB pushback so it's incredibly hard to punish outside of the conceptually cool but very rough-feeling shield. Spy makes me think that she was designed by an ultimate zoner main who really had a hard on for blazblue despite being equally bad at it, too.\n\n I will revise if patches tweak this game up, but this is yet another platform fighter that wants to be melee but with quirky movesets and \"fixing the bad parts\". That's great and all, but there is 0 reason to play this over melee unless you want to bring this to a local because you're tired of spending 5 dollars to go 0-2 and you really want to be the best player in the venue at SOMETHING.\n\nI'd genuinely rather play Icons than bust this out again.\n","timestamp_created":1609524077,"timestamp_updated":1609524077,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4nIzH3/YCdfa7vwI="}
