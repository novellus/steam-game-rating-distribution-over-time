    review: 'The trailer shows everything there is.

      You walk along with different backgrounds and music thats best described as
      ambient noise.

      Starts pretty easy but once you have 18 forms, 4 options to pick and they move
      around it gets frustratingly hard.

      One wrong or late click is game over so there is no real gameflow. Interesting
      as one-man-project but needs QoL-Updates to be enjoyable such as checkpoints,
      longer-lasting runs or forms connected to buttons because once the L-shape is
      on spot 1, and with the next hole the cube is on spot 1 and the L is gone until
      it appears again.'
