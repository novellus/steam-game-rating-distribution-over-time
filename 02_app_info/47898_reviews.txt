The Sims 3 Generations is arguably the best expansion pack for the Sims 3. There is no playthrough where you will not use this pack. Want to run a daycare? We got you. Want, not one, but FOUR, different variations of bunk-beds that haven't come to Sims 4 in six years? We got you. Sign your children and teens up for NUMEROUS after-school programs that give them skills. Attend ballet recitals and award ceremonies (Rabbit holes). Want to deck your backyard out with TONS of new toys for all ages? We got you! Three different variations of tree houses! I could go on and on about how fantastic this pack is. Teenagers have personalities. Children have personalities. The older life states are not ignored either! This pack is a MUST for the Sims 3. You will never not use it, from bachelorette parties to retirement, from the cute toddlers to the grumpy elders! It adds SO much.\n\nBecause this game is so old, I'd wait until it goes on sale. However, compared to the base price of $40 that Sims 4 packs demand, this expansion pack is well worth the $20 it asks for because you will actually get your money's worth.","timestamp_created":1608596887,"timestamp_updated":1608596887,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43ZL2w/YCf/6HvAI="}
