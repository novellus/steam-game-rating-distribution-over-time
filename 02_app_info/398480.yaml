    review: "Yes this game is goddamn adorable and I wish I could recommend it I really\
      \ do but there are a couple game-breaking issues.\n\nThis game was clearly developed\
      \ for convention spaces where the oculus rift was being showcased because it\
      \ just does not translate well to playing at home. \n\nNow, this game uses 2\
      \ main mechanics creatively, looking with the oculus, and sound. \n\nThe looking\
      \ bit translates very well to mouse, all you have to do is stare at enemies\
      \ or shake your \"head\" (or mouse I guess) in order to get them to go away.\
      \ \n\nSound is the issue here. \n\nDespite the game's description claiming \"\
      \ If you're not sure if you want to shout 'n sing just yet, simply turn off\
      \ the audio-option!\" this option does not actually exist. This means that you\
      \ do require a microphone in order to play which should clearly be stated. The\
      \ closest you can get without a microphone is playing quick game mode which\
      \ lets you choose which enemies appear. So in a best-case scenario without a\
      \ microphone you get to fight half the enemies and not play the campaign. \n\
      \nThe second sound issue is there is zero calibration for whatever mic you have.\
      \ Now I am fortunate enough to have spent the money on a condensor and audio\
      \ interface rig but even with that I have to crank my mic up quite high in order\
      \ for it to be loud enough to fend enemies off at a quick enough speed. What\
      \ this means is most people who own microphones with much less power behind\
      \ them or use laptop/webcam mics will be screaming at the top of their lungs\
      \ to maybe be able to progress. An issue that was probably not thought of by\
      \ the devs since the convention spaces they displayed the game at wouldn't require\
      \ people to be even relatively quiet. \n\nThe other sound issue which is also\
      \ calibration related is pitch. One of the enemies requires you to \"sing\"\
      \ high notes... I tried for quite a while until my throat was sore and I either\
      \ am simply unable to hit a note high enough for the game or it wasn't registering.\
      \ So I had to whistle which isn't great because I have trouble whistling. So\
      \ there's a physical requirement for this game, you either have to be able to\
      \ sing very high notes or whistle. \n\nThe last issue would be that although\
      \ this game would be amazing to try out in a convention centre I don't see any\
      \ replayability at home besides for small children (but who honestly wants to\
      \ give kids an excuse to scream at the top of their lungs?). The game simply\
      \ recycles the same enemies and throws on goggles, watermelons, etc.  so you\
      \ essentially have the exact same 4 mechanics of: staring, shaking your head,\
      \ yelling, and whistling/singing high-pitched. This gets old very fast. \n\n\
      Besides that there's not much to talk about, very basic graphics options (you\
      \ get to choose between low-good-very good-fantastic) which don't seem to change\
      \ much as evidenced by the game starting out in low to begin with and even on\
      \ high the FPS counter still shoots up to 900 frames which is ridiculous and\
      \ I don't notice any visual changes."
