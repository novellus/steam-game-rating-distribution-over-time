However it has some bugs which I could forgive but the most Major Bug is you get to the end of LVL 2 and there is no more game, despite it showing there is 8 lvls at least, until this is fixed do not buy this game.\nTLDR: bug stops you playing game\n\nUpdate to review: the game also send tcp data over port 27030 with no indication of why / what its doing (stay safe folks), they did fix so lvl 3 is avalible but progress now does not save so if you exit out back to lvl 2 for you, y do I still play this keen for next update","timestamp_created":1594011082,"timestamp_updated":1595827507,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.597156405448913574","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48+mux/MCe8CYkwI="}
