    review: Super cute game! I really love the retro style and sound effects, and
      though they are enemies all the monsters are super adorable. I encountered a
      few bugs but that can of course be forgiven because the game is brand new, and
      as far as I know I'll be the first person to write a review lol. I think the
      idea of having to advance through levels to get new building blocks is really
      fun, but I already can teleport to most of the islands and I am level 9, which
      I have achieved in playing the game for about 30 minutes. I think it should
      be a lot harder to advance in levels! I'm sure what I've been critical of will
      improve as the game's development continues. I can't wait to keep supporting
      this game as it rises to popularity!
