      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Dynamic 3D Pathfinding</h2><br>Both colonists and monsters
      can find their way in your world. Build bridges, tunnels, stairs, overpasses
      and underpasses to make sure your colonists get where they want to go, and monsters
      don''t! Plant a banner to start your colony. As you recruit more colonists,
      more monsters will try to invade your colony! Build walls, dig moats and construct
      forts to deal with the increasing threat. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/366090/extras/sp2kk.jpg?t=1598521365"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Dozens of different jobs, unlockable with science</h2><br>Use
      an extensive science system to unlock jobs, blocks, upgrades and new weapons!
      Your colony will start small, with a couple of berry farmers, slingers and a
      copper miner. Expand your colony and start using new metals like bronze, iron
      and steel. Producing them will require new fuels like charcoal and cokes. Use
      more advanced metals to unlock crossbows and matchlock guns for your guards!
      Add wheat farmers, bakers, flax farmers, tailors and many other jobs to your
      colony. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/366090/extras/tropics.jpg?t=1598521365"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Explore and settle a large, diverse world</h2><br>Large,
      advanced colonies are able to unlock the glider and Colony Starter Kits, allowing
      them to settle new lands. Take to the sky and explore a world with multiple
      continents and biomes. Start a colony in far-off lands to get access to new
      jobs, crops and resources.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/366090/extras/fareast.jpg?t=1598521365"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Co-op: play with friends without problems</h2> <br>Easily
      launch a co-op server from the main menu, and invite friends to join your world.
      Share ownership of a single colony with multiple friends, or build your own
      colonies and trade items and science. It''s also possible to use our advanced
      server tool to set up a more complex system. Extensive mod support allows players
      to customize their experience exactly as they want.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/366090/extras/sp3kk.jpg?t=1598521365"
