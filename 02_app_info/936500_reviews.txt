I will vote yes as the game comes with very reasonable price tag. \n\nTransport Inc offers original, more abstract approach to transport genre. As a player you more or less decide \"which two cities, what vehicle and what price\". Your decision is based on existing transportation demand between cities and (affordable) vehicles. Although you can micromanage repairs, this task might be automated (for a price). Higher level automation is possible (branches), but I found very little benefit compared to its major cost. \n\nHowever, quite a few areas are too raw or unbalanced to my liking: \n- Although UI is generally neat, some areas are atrocious (e.g. adjusting price). \n- Information unavalable or must be paid for (e.g. ticket price must be found by guessing, speed and comfort requirements can be identified by research - which is sometimes more expensive than vehicle!). \n- ROI of vehicles is very unbalanced, you will be using like 2-3 vehicles mostly (which is especially bad as there is little variety of vehicles from start)\n- Demand is generated randomly at the beginning of mission and might make your start easy or near impossible. Many routes might be unfeasible as vehicles do not match generated demand and criterias (hubs are trying to somewhat address the problem, but I found them not working well and too much hassle in general)\n- I repeatedly run into bug where game stopped deduct monthly interest and salaries, makes game too easy\n- AI - In last campaign mission all ai opponenets went bancrupt before I even expanded into their territory\n\nIt is passable game that should give you 20-30 hours of (sometimes frustrated) fun, especially, if you are logistical enthusiast.  With some more polish and few more ideas this might have been great game.","timestamp_created":1610113326,"timestamp_updated":1610113520,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmNKP8fYCfaPFwQI="}
