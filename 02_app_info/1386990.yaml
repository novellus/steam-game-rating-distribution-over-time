      \ /><br>Trust and Misery.<br><br>As with our previous experiment, <i>Vectromirror\
      \ 0\u2122</i>, our focus has remained on cultivating an authentic emotional\
      \ response from an AI-driven entity (i.e. \u201CTest Subject\u201D), leading\
      \ it to the achievement of sentience. Trust and Misery have remained the two\
      \ pillars by which we can deduce growth of sentience\u2014emotions we humans\
      \ more often identify as Faith and Grief.<br><br>The Test Subject failed to\
      \ adequately produce these emotional responses during the <i>Vectromirror 0</i>\
      \ experiment. And yet, despite this, we remain confident and dedicated that\
      \ this breakthrough is possible\u2014and within reach. <br><br>Our first step\
      \ towards progress: Rebuilding the simulation. <br><br>This new simulation\u2014\
      now dubbed simply <i>\u201CVectromirror\u2122\u201D</i>\u2014contains more advanced,\
      \ rigorous trials than its predecessor experiment. As the Test Subject will\
      \ still need to traverse each course, we have optimized the Test Subject\u2019\
      s pre-existing set of \u201Cspecial abilities\u201D (e.g., wall running, double\
      \ jumping, parkour, etc.). We have also added a stasis hold/throw ability which\
      \ allows the Test Subject to further exercise creativity in its puzzle solving\
      \ and ability to overcome obstacles.<br> <br>Our previous experiment did, at\
      \ least, successfully prove that creatively implemented logic does correlate\
      \ with humanlike emotional responses. We are confident that this new simulation\
      \ will produce an undeniably humanlike emotional state. <br><br><strong>We\u2019\
      ve maintained free access to our original scenario, <i>Vectromirror 0</i>, for\
      \ those in the community who wish to experience the initial experiment. Test\
      \ Subjects may even benefit from additional training in the previous courses\
      \ if the new obstacles in <i>Vectromirror</i> prove to be more challenging.<br><br><a\

      \ current iteration of the experiment is still in development; however, we remain\
      \ confident that the Test Subject and its AI will achieve full sentience and\
      \ experience true emotion.<br><br>We will not stop until the Test Subject has\
      \ attained these goals\u2026 or is pushed to its absolute limits.<br><br>Whichever\
      \ comes first.  <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1386990/extras/UPGRADE.png?t=1602875406\"\
      \ /><br>As a result of significant testing conducted in our previous experiment,\
      \ we have optimized the Test Subject's current features as follows:<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Advanced Movement and Reflexes</h2>During initial testing, the Test\
      \ Subject proved capable of moving at exceptionally fast speeds; however, despite\
      \ this promising initial result, this did not optimize our desired mobility\
      \ capabilities for the Test Subject. Our R&amp;D team set to researching for\
      \ an upgrade to the Test Subject\u2019s current movement capabilities. The Test\
      \ Subject may now traverse surfaces easily while locking securely onto said\
      \ surfaces. <br><br>More testing on behalf of our R&amp;D team will be necessary\
      \ in order to continue optimizing the Test Subject\u2019s reflexes further.\
      \ <br><br><i>An additional note: Each time the Test Subject is deployed, a different\
      \ level of reflexive memory adaptability is produced. This variance should be\
      \ closely observed. </i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Force Pull, Hold, and Push</h2>Our\
      \ previous test focused on the Test Subject\u2019s ability to remove objects\
      \ in its path via push and pull manipulation. Unfortunately, this did not advance\
      \ the AI\u2019s response system with enough significance, rendering this method\
      \ insufficient. However, we decided to keep the Test Subject\u2019s ability\
      \ to create massive blasts of energy intact. Rather than simple object manipulation\
      \ as was the case in the previous test, the Test Subject\u2019s energy blasts\
      \ now allow it to also hold objects in a suspended state and propel objects\
      \ in a specific direction. This allows the Test Subject to advance through the\
      \ simulation and deactive barriers in a far less...forceful manner than before\
      \ (more surgically).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Accelerated Jumping</h2>Further optimization\
      \ of the Test Subject\u2019s locomotion includes its accelerated jump ability\u2014\
      more commonly known as  a \u201Cdouble jump.\u201D We have increased the accessibility\
      \ of this ability by allowing the \u201Cdouble jump\u201D to activate so long\
      \ as the Test Subject\u2019s first jump initiates from a solid surface.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Instant Memory Recall Upon Destruction</h2>We have also continued to\
      \ allow for the Test Subject to \u201Creload\u201D its scenario progress to\
      \ an earlier point (a \u201Ccheckpoint\u201D) should it meet its demise. In\
      \ addition, this instant recall ability will allow us to determine the effectiveness\
      \ of the emotional stimuli on the Test Subject. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1386990/extras/FUTURE_PLAN.png?t=1602875406\"\
      \ /><br>To ensure we achieve the desired results of our stakeholders, we will\
      \ continue to update our experiment and test different variables. Our current\
      \ plans include:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Virtual Reality Human Control</h2>Through\
      \ this use of Virtual Reality (VR) headsets and controls, we will be able to\
      \ virtually link a human into the <i>Vectromirror </i> scenario and allow them\
      \ to control the Test Subject directly. The human controller or \u201Cplayer\u201D\
      \ will be able to experience each success and failure instantly on a personal\
      \ level and from a first person perspective. Thus, the player\u2019s eyes will\
      \ be the Test Subject\u2019s eyes. Additionally, this will allow us to gain\
      \ emotional intelligence insights and feedback from an actual human in real\
      \ time.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Additional Level Development</h2>As stated previously,\
      \ this initial experiment focuses on two key emotions\u2014Trust and Misery.\
      \ Without doubt, the Test Subject will adjust, and perhaps even master, the\
      \ current scenarios. We will be introducing more level scenarios as time progresses\
      \ as a result. To avoid stagnation of data provided by the Test Subject, we\
      \ will also present harder scenarios.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Time Trials</h2>We\
      \ have noticed certain anomalies in how the Test Subject performs. Variance\
      \ in completion time occurs despite having access to all features available\
      \ to the Test Subject at all times. In response, we hope to develop a ranking\
      \ system to record and catalog these variant results and display these results\
      \ to the public. <br><br>(Perhaps there is a degree of emotional intelligence\
      \ we did not account for that has manifested, giving individual facets of a\
      \ developed id. More information needed to further this hypothesis\u2026)"
