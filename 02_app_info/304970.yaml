    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Part module</h2>SolidFace Sketch automatically\
      \ creates parametric reference for modeling features that can be edited in a\
      \ very simple and interactive way. This is an in-house developed module and\
      \ fully integrated with the 3D module.<br><br>SolidFace allows multiple bodies\
      \ creation. A powerful tool helps in the development of dependent parts from\
      \ a single part file.<br><br>The parameterization allows not only an easy model\
      \ editing, but also parts family creation that is an important issue in automating\
      \ creation of variant models with the same constructive basis, such as fasteners,\
      \ automotive, hydraulic and civil components. From a parametric part you can\
      \ automatically generate dozens of others parts through parameters association,\
      \ such as thickness, length, number and diameter of holes, color, material,\
      \ information, text, etc.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Assembly module</h2>Easy, accurate\
      \ and effective, this module enables you to build assemblies using modeled parts\
      \ and sub-assemblies. The automatic link between the modules facilitates the\
      \ manipulation of assembly parts, thus any editing on a part or assembly, results\
      \ in an automatic change in the assembly that references this component.<br><br>You\
      \ can build assemblies by inserting components created outside the assembly\
      \ document; this is known as bottom-up assembling or if you need to construct\
      \ a component that needs dimension references of some assembly components, you\
      \ can create it, within the Assembly module. This operation is called in-context\
      \ or top-down part creation.<br><br>To facilitate the assembly process, the\
      \ part elements can be enabled or disabled at any time without interfering the\
      \ process of inserting (bottom-up) or creating (top-down) new components.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Drawing module</h2>Besides the 2D draft capabilities explained\
      \ in the SolidFace drawing product, you can also insert parts and assemblies\
      \ into the drawing module in order to generate automatic orthographic, sections\
      \ and details views. These views and dimensional annotations are created according\
      \ to DIN and ANSI norms. Personalized by the designer. The 3D models views can\
      \ be displayed in several model styles. The sections or details views are automatically\
      \ created and aligned with the base view.<br><br>Another advantage of the automatic\
      \ link between the modules is the ability to copy and paste 2D geometric entities\
      \ to the 3D Sketch module in order to use it as reference geometry to 3D features\
      \ operations like extrude, revolve, etc.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Exploded view</h2>An\
      \ exploded view is a diagram, picture or technical drawing of an object, that\
      \ shows the relationship or order of assembly of various parts. This allows\
      \ the components (parts and sub-assemblies) to be visualized with defined displacements.\
      \ The exploded view can be enabled or disabled at any time of the project creation.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">3D Direct modeling</h2>Interact directly with the geometry\
      \ of the model. Manipulate it by pushing, pulling, or twisting.<br><br>Keeping\
      \ the steps that create the final model, direct modelling allows the features\
      \ geometry to be parametric modified by editing the feature used to create the\
      \ new faces.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">2D/3D Movement simulation</h2>One of the many\
      \ capabilities of logical conditions is to enable the system to detect the collision\
      \ of components assembly. The collision or the simulation process can be aborted\
      \ and analyzed at any time. This makes possible not just a simple mechanism\
      \ video demonstration but also a real-time movement simulation.<br><br>The parameterization\
      \ capability is one of the greatest advantages of SolidFace and it is present\
      \ in all design steps. 3D Motion simulation is no different; the simulation\
      \ is updated simultaneously with the movement. Another important capability\
      \ is the simulation of 2D mechanisms, which can be performed either in 2D drawing\
      \ or in 3D sketch module.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Product specification</h2><ul\

    review: '[h1]Audience?[/h1]

      The audience is probably engineering, construction management, and drafting
      degree students that like to game.  In those type of degrees, a significant
      mistake on a draft can result in a large profit loss.


      [h1]Expensive?[/h1]

      It was the first drafting software available on Steam.  Much of the prices on
      the more professional software available through Steam are kind of smokey, if
      you know what I mean.  For example, Maya, Modo, and Substance Designer/Painter
      all have modified licenses for use and some are less capable.  This is the full
      version of SolidFace with full licensing, with the catch being drive locked.  The
      opensource options for drafting are BRL-CAD, OpenSCAD, FreeCAD, and LibreCAD.  The
      opensource options, except for BRL-CAD, are very young compared to SolidFace.


      [h1]The Pros - SolidFace 2015[/h1]

      1. SolidFace does good prints

      2. SolidFace does good 3D drafting (2016 supports STL)

      3. Works though feels a bit quirky with tool use (2016 feels less quirky)

      4. It''s a reliable solid modeler

      5. It''s inexpensive

      6. The geometry outputs I''ve done have reliably imported into other programs

      7. the crash testing appears to be reliable in testing animated geometry crossing
      geometry


      [h1]The Cons - SolidFace 2015[/h1]

      1. The tutorials are not equal to tutorials available for opensource drafting
      software

      2. Not 2016.  2015 on Steam was experimenting with the Steam market, which was
      considered not profitable enough to warrant bringing 2016 to Steam.


      [h1]Conclusion[/h1]

      It''s a capable CAD modeler available with the convenience of Steam on a non-rental
      basis.  That''s a lot to like.

      (*) mged, in [url=http://brlcad.org/gallery/]BRL-CAD[/url], is useful for 3D,
      and it''s markup is wonderfully logical, though it doesn''t seem designed toward
      2D drafts.'
