Looking forward to my next session, when I can find the time. I found the AI worked exceptionally well and my Dwarves behaved in the fashion which their characteristics (which are comprehensive and interesting) eluded to. I also found the background music very atmospheric and appropriately balanced. All-in-all an excellent game already, even though it's early access. A lot of thought has gone into this game and I recommend to anyone who enjoys all things Dwarvish (like I do) to become part of the development journey of this game.","timestamp_created":1574636524,"timestamp_updated":1574636524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524844765663146973","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwntLpz+4Cd7q93AE="}
