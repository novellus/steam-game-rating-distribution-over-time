I  just couldn't get into.\nThey added this backstory father/daughter thing which I found was more an annoying backdrop that reall wasn't needed. Its not whether it was a male or female character. It was things like its dabbling in the basement vs some super science wonderful thing. The limited description of the C64 era was enough. My imagination could fill in the rest. Instead we get these dopey things like of noooooo the child didnt listen to pappa and they went back in time woooooo.\nDidnt need that. ITs an arcade game. Its okay to have arcade games.\nThe on map game play felt fairly okay and true enough to the original. I didnt put in much play time which at this point means I should give it a negative review. I didnt really feel I was getting the game I would enjoy.","timestamp_created":1518181527,"timestamp_updated":1518181527,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552534401416778564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43fWqveECeIS0mAE="}
