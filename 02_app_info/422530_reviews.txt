It's supposed to be a Rom-Com because it's about relationships and there's a certain amount of comedy.  In the end it's an observation of human character.  Will might just as well have been Bill Clinton, and the never seen Sarah might just as well have been Hilary.\n\nThis film observes, and gives voice to the words that people don't usually find \"in the moment\".  It alternates this with some humour.\n\nRoza Salazar and the script was very close to capturing the train wreck / hot mess.\nAdam Pally's delivery of lines and more were fine so it seems cruel to criticize, but I'm not sure he \"has it in himself\" to be the beta male that the character is written as.\n\nIf you \"imagine\" that the film continues after the ending, Kevin, maybe dumped soon after by Madeline, unemployable, with nothing and no-one left to believe in, eventually kills himself.  Maybe he finds a new career as a priest.  Perhaps you'd prefer to believe they lived happily ever after - but I don't think so.  Madeline, hot mess, maybe drifts into alcoholism and sad middle age, maybe kills herself, or maybe loses the spark but finds some kind of equilibrium.\n\nWill and Peter.... you never can tell.  Bill Clinton or Harvey Weinstein.  Their ending is unknown and somewhat  unknowable.  Life  is complicated.  Get over it.\n\nThis film is not a Rom-Com, it is a tragedy, - and if not perfect a pretty good one at that.","timestamp_created":1527475069,"timestamp_updated":1527475069,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hPym0uMCfdy7oQE="}
