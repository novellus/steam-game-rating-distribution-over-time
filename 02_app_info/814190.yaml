    review: 'Concept is great: we all love bunnyhopping and running like madmen in
      our favorite FPSes. Why not make a game to make that as fun and exciting as
      possible, dedicated to just that?


      Now let''s make every bad decision you can aside from the visuals;


      [h1][b][u]The Bad[/u][/b][/h1]


      [b][u]Atrocious controls:[/u][/b]

      Sorry man, not EVERYONE wants space as their jump. I actually despise it. At
      least you can adjust mouse sensitivity.


      Keeping in mind you cannot remap at all, you want to build (and maintain) speed
      so you''re expected to hold shift. But you can''t use right-shift because you
      need your right hand for the mouse to move.


      Now, if you release space, you immediately fall quickly to the ground. You should
      anchor that too, most of the time--unless you like sudden Jupiter gravity when
      you''re bouncing on the moon.


      Do you see the issue here? You''re expected to anchor 2 keys on your movement
      hand and STILL use WASD. Movement is not like Source engine, so you press a
      key and you move in that direction. If you release all movement keys, you only
      descend downward.


      You''ll probably just end up anchoring W to keep consistent movement. Now you''re
      anchoring 3 keys, with brief releases of space every second or two to initiate
      a jump.


      Now, while you''re doing all this with just your left hand and changing directions
      with your mouse, you''re expected to hit left click or right click and hold
      those for periods of time to shift your color to green or blue because if you''re
      not the right color when you hit colored platforms, you die too.


      There''s too much crap going on here.


      [b][u]God-Awful Pacing:[/u][/b]

      Pacing is horrible in this game. You need to maintain max speed no matter what.


      If you lose max speed, you''re bouncing around on small platforms over and over
      while you continuously move in a circle and try your best not to miss or fall
      off. You also only gain speed running, so it''s gonna take a while because most
      of your time is in the air. Sometimes just because of how things generate, it''ll
      be nearly impossible to continue without ever slowing down and losing tons of
      speed.


      If you''re wondering "why not just gain speed on straight-aways?"... well you
      don''t get those. Just small platforms and walls. You''re always jumping.


      Oh, by the way, that while it''ll take you to build speed? You can''t afford
      it since every section is timed and will collapse below you if you stop for
      a few seconds.


      [b][u]Poor Procedural Generation:[/u][/b]

      You''re forced to stay moving quick, but you only get to see the stage in sections.
      Once you hit each checkpoint, the next section right in front of you shows up,
      giving you no time to react and often meaning blindly running off the ledge
      or just jumping and hoping to correct your bearings in time.


      Sometimes the random gen just decides to give you a nearly impossible section
      with no time to think and/or requiring nearly perfect play. Sometimes I don''t
      even see the next section show up and it basically causes me to lose instantly.
      When they say broken, they meant it.


      [h1][b][u]The Good[/u][/b][/h1]

      The game doesn''t have much going for it... sometimes it''s visually appealing,
      but sometimes it''s just meh. The simple style makes understanding what you''re
      looking at easy though.


      [h1][b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b][/h1]

      This game as it stands isn''t worth the 99 cents I spent on it. It''s gruelingly
      difficult, somewhat unintuitive, and has some of the worst controls I''ve seen
      in a movement-based game. I''d make the following changes:


      [b][u]Revamp controls:[/u][/b]

      Add momentum so you can keep moving and adjust more comfortably. This also means
      airstrafing becomes more of a thing, which people tend to like from Source engine
      bhopping/jumping. It doesn''t need to be as strict or difficult as Source though,
      where holding W ruins everything or where A/D have gradual effects.


      Stop forcing me to anchor shit: max speed always; momentum as explained above;
      releasing shift not ruining your jump and throwing you downward.


      REMAPABLE CONTROLS, please. This should be expected of any game where controls
      are so damn important.


      [b][u]Level Design:[/u][/b]

      Many more platforms, possibly larger on easier difficulties (add difficulties,
      man), and some straight-aways to give you a rest and/or add variety.


      [b][u]Game Mechanics:[/u][/b]

      Color shifting is a bit meh and boring of a mechanic, but just makes things
      more difficult. At least a switch to turn it off would be nice.


      Remove time limits for sections: that ain''t fun.


      Lastly, let me see the next section at all times, and hitting a new checkpoint
      lets me see the second section forward. This means I don''t have to react blind
      and always see what''s coming.'
