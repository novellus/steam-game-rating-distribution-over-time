Levels or rooms inter-linked with one another through portals with a very brief loading time \nbetween each. The game play consisting of walking around with a torch avoiding the occasional trap with some\nfreaky audio and and sometimes visual effects. There don't seem to be any monsters. If you die from a trap\nit's game over and you have to start over so you have to manually save your progress from time to time. The traps can often be deactivated by pushing a box into a trip wire or sensor beam, the boxes generally being convieniently placed next to the traps.\n\nDespite the dark look of the game and the reasonable sound effects and music the levels are far too small and simplistic\nand many don't seem to differ in layout very much from one another. Many of the levels don't seem to have traps or any\nchallenges.\n\nGenerally from where you port into the level theres a choice of 3 or 4 directions. If theres no traps, you walk along \nan often straight corridoor for literally 5 seconds to the sound of some freaky sound effects to the next\nportal at the end of the corridoor. So you are spending seconds not minutes on each level even with traps, which\nbe fair I felt was frustrating because I just wanted to explore some big, dark, complex levels.\n\nWith bigger, more complex levels and more challenges, maybe a few monsters within, this could be a reasonable game even with the purly exploration with a torch based game play. \n\nTo be fair I didn't exactly dislike the game it's just it was far to quick and easy to complete. Stumbled upon the exit within 38 minutes of total game play even after dieing the first couple of times and learning to save progress. Played it some more to try and explore but didn't realy find that much more to it.\n","timestamp_created":1509400583,"timestamp_updated":1509400583,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505173206329345703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4taPSt98Ce5L0iQE="}
