    short_description: After You is a narrative game with puzzles, but it is not an
      easy game, here you will not have indicators or tutorials, nor can you save
      when you want. In After You you need to put all your attention and use paper
      and pencil to move forward, if you're looking for an easy game, this is not
      your game.
