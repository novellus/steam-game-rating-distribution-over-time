I do like the variety they give you on how to play the game with spells, range weapons and melee.  The music is upbeat and fun and doesn't get boring fast.  There are a few other options that are under construction since this is an early-access.  The controls for the Valve Index are not perfect to match the instructions in game so don't expect perfect functionality as the developer may address them, hopefully soon. I will update my review and place a video on my VR channel soon. Happy Gaming.\n\nA review was created on my YouTube channel: Tales form the VR.\nhttps://youtu.be/_nE-VErZz_U","timestamp_created":1603332991,"timestamp_updated":1603866049,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4nrf3tvUCf/CsqQI="}
