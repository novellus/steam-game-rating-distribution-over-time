I'd rather watch somebody play it on Youtube.\n\nThe game's got really outstanding artwork and soundtrack. It's stunning, really. Sadly, the actual gameplay is more than boring. You basically spend half your time walking around in pointlessly vast areas, trying to find whatever you have to find in there, and the other half \"fighting\". By which I mean \"holding down lock and fire buttons and moving around until the enemies die\". Besides, the shmup tag is unjustified here. Shmup-like bullet patterns don't alone make a game a bullet hell. You're virtually invincible, due to your shield, potions, the ridiculous size of your health bar, and the many ways you have to regain lost HP.\n\nIt's easy and repetitive. Probably good for gifting your kids, but stay away if you like feeling challenged even a little bit.","timestamp_created":1490201127,"timestamp_updated":1566242031,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.655704736709594727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42ZjT1ewCfKCAdQ=="}
