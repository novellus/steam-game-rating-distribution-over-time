    review: "I would recommend this product... only if it's on sale. I don't think\
      \ it's worth forking over $40 just for the actor career path with a few other\
      \ things tossed in. It didn't really change my overall experience very much.\
      \ The added clothing was cool, and becoming famous is cool, but there were a\
      \ lot of little things about it that annoyed me that lessened the coolness of\
      \ these things. \n\nDon't buy it at full price is my best advice."
