The developer clearly cares a lot about this game and If you are a fan of games where you grind to get the highest score on the leaderboard, if you want to be #1 and compete with others, this game is for you.\n\nThis game puts you in a hostile environment where you have to survive for a set amount of time, or in the horror mode, as long as you can (with enemies that get stronger and stronger as the game progresses). The end goal is to gain the highest score that you can get by killing animals, building, crafting, ... Basically it roughly comes down to your APM (actions per minute).\n\nEven though this is the first real game made by a relatively new company, it is already in a very nice state and with all the planned updates the devs mentioned on discord/twitch, it seems like this is the kind of game every lover of the Survival, roguelike, or builder genres will fall in love with.\n\nDefinitely give it a go! At the current price it is a total bargain and there will be much more content and gamemodes to come!","timestamp_created":1541973350,"timestamp_updated":1541973350,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw58KxgucCcbzMrgE="}
