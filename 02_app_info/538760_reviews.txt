For the same price, you can get a Q2 and every VR pinball table on Steam and never run out of floor space in your home.","timestamp_created":1609665805,"timestamp_updated":1609665805,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rN/j4/YCftqBwAI="}
