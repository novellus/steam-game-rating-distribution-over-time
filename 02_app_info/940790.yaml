    review: "O jogo tem a hist\xF3ria que \xE9 at\xE9 boa, alguns inimigos que enfrentamos\
      \ como os werewolves e jack-o'-lantern (as famosas ab\xF3boras do Halloween)\
      \ que temos que plantar. Mas eu achei muito pouco para um jogo que tem como\
      \ tema Halloween. Acho que faltou uma personaliza\xE7\xE3o tem\xE1tica nos recursos,\
      \ nos mapas, nos personagens, inimigos\u2026 Na verdade nos mapas at\xE9 tem\
      \ mas sei l\xE1, n\xE3o me senti jogando um jogo com o tema Hallloween. Parecia\
      \ que eu estava jogando qualquer outro jogo da s\xE9rie.\n\nO jogo continua\
      \ simples, divertido e gostoso de ser jogado assim como toda a s\xE9rie. Pra\
      \ mim a dificuldade continua a mesma, ou seja, inexistente. \xC9 verdade que\
      \ nesse, algumas fases requerem um pouco mais de aten\xE7\xE3o mas nada que\
      \ seja t\xE3o imposs\xEDvel como em outros jogos do g\xEAnero.\n\nA trilha sonora\
      \ \xE9 bem legal. Como o tema \xE9 Halloween no menu principal e no mapa tem\
      \ um estilo Dark mas que beira mais o c\xF4mico.\n\nAgora como ponto negativo\
      \ eu destaco o alto pre\xE7o cobrado pelo jogo: 28,99. Eu peguei na promo\xE7\
      \xE3o com 90%, ou seja, 2,89 e recomendo quem quiser jogar tamb\xE9m esperar\
      \ uma promo\xE7\xE3o pois ele por mais que seja um jogo muito bom n\xE3o merece\
      \ ter esse valor. Simplesmente ele n\xE3o tem conte\xFAdo que justifique esse\
      \ pre\xE7o.\n\n[b]Pontos positivos:[/b]\n\n- Hist\xF3ria legalzinha\n- Bons\
      \ gr\xE1ficos\n- Trilha sonora agrad\xE1vel\n- Boa jogabilidade\n- Conquistas\n\
      \n[b]Pontos negativos:[/b]\n\n- Pouca personaliza\xE7\xE3o sobre o tema Halloween\n\
      - Repetitivo\n- Muito f\xE1cil para jogadores mais exigentes\n- Pre\xE7o muito\
      \ alto para um jogo t\xE3o simples\n- Faltou cartas colecion\xE1veis\n\n[h1]Recomendo\
      \ se estiver em promo\xE7\xE3o para quem curte o g\xEAnero e para quem \xE9\
      \ Achievement Hunter pois podemos dizer que \xE9 a chamada platina f\xE1cil.[/h1]"
