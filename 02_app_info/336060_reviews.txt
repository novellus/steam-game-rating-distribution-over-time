I bought it for under Â£1 on sale, even though I already have the DOS version from years ago - 'cause, hey, achievements are cool, right? The DOS version is still being sold though, and works with DOSBox. Go get that instead. :)\n\nThis 2015 port doesn't add much to the DOS version, other than a couple of graphical extras to the HUD and explosions which you probably won't notice, and an ugly (in my opinion) but optional \"HD filter\" which smears out the pixels. Saves are buggy - It'll create new \"profiles\" instead of overwriting, and you can't tell which is which other than how much money you had.\n\nYou can play it with the keyboard, but I prefer using the mouse. However, mouse controls (in my experience) are buggy, with sticky X axis in menus and in game, and you can't move your plane all the way to the right of the screen. Maybe some sort of DPI issue? \n\nMaximum resolution doesn't go very high in fullscreen - Though with old pixelated graphics, that may not matter so much. It can be played in windowed mode instead, but if trying to play using the mouse, it won't stay within the game borders without third-party fixes. \n\nPeople were complaining on the forums about these issues back when this was released in 2015, and the dev was aware of them, but didn't get around to releasing a patch. I could've lived with the other bugs, but not the mouse issue. I was hoping it wouldn't be as bad as people were saying.\n\nAs I said, it's a shame - I think a game as a good as Raptor deserves better than this, but I also hear that the original programmer is apparently making a proper remake, so good luck to him. :)","timestamp_created":1609605674,"timestamp_updated":1609635290,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuavv4vYCddPjvwI="}
