    about_the_game: Here is a simple and interesting arcade game in which you have
      to go along with the assassin in the distant jungle in search of adventure and
      crystals! You will be trapped by deadly traps, huge abysses and evil enemies
      who strive to destroy you! The path to the goal is thorny and difficult, but
      very interesting! And you have to go through it with the hero, so be prepared
      to plunge into the atmosphere of amazing adventures.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Easy arcade controls<br></li><li>Great platformer maps<br></li><li>Nice
      graphics<br></li><li>Suitable for Windows, Mac and Linux</li></ul><br>This game
      is a great way to pass the time and quench your thirst for adventure. In the
      distant and dangerous jungle you will find a whole lot of them. You will have
      to show all your skill and ingenuity to go your way - hiding from enemies or
      ruthlessly disposing of them. The game has a lot of hidden crystals, but they
      are quite difficult to find - it will need to carefully examine each level.
      Nice graphics are sure to please your eye, and easy control of the game allows
      you to play it even for children. The game will develop skills such as attentiveness
      and skill, so you will spend time not only with interest, but also with benefit.
