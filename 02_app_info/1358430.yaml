    review: 'A old-school style game that is fun and doesn''t take a gigabyte of storage
      in 2020?  Crazy!  Seems to be extremely optimized as it is small but brings
      with it a bunch of fun online matchups.  3 units, ground forces, a tank and
      2 drones.  I think I am best at the tank as it is easiest, but splitting up
      the ground forces and controlling individual groups of them with two joysticks
      on the same controller at once is awesome!   Units can''t turn around (they
      can''t and it seems intended) so the game is a simple match up once you go to
      War War!


      Also if you are playing with 4 people if you die you can control the animals
      on the screen and they can be a lot of fun in a disruption sense!


      Overall great game if you like the old-school style graphics which you can see
      in the video, it shows it off pretty well.'
