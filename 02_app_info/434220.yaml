    review: This was an interesting game. I definitely felt like a fnaf clone though.
      Sometimes the game seems impossible due to where the bears will spawn but once
      you kind of figure out their trick it becomes a lot easier. The jump scares
      only really scare you if you are absolutely non expecting them otherwise they
      just get annoying ove time. I'd still recommend the game if you like strategy
      games though. For those iffy on the game feel free to check out the playthrough
      for nights 1 and 2 that I made
