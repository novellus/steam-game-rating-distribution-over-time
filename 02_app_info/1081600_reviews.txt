Really wanted this to be awesome, but it is not. I dive in and get lost in a good fractal on my VR often, but have yet to find a better option than youtube on my virtual desktop, with the screen stretched as big as I can see. This \"game\" is just a small collection of still shots, a couple animated fractals, and a odd view of the mandelbrot set that dose not zoom in or do this piece of mathematical art justice at all. I would not buy this even if the fractals are updated regularly, it just lacks the trippiness I'm looking for.","timestamp_created":1593485198,"timestamp_updated":1593485198,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497925341129302979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwq9DHgfMCeb/BkQI="}
