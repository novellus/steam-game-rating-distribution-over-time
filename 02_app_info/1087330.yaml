      \ time killer.\u201D<br />\r\n5/5 \u2013 Marimar Latagan<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      \u201CFirst of all let me say: This is a very interesting game. I was a big\
      \ fan of Sword and Potions, and Sorcery Quest. And it is very nice to see games\
      \ that have some ideas based on them. Something that would make the experience\
      \ better is the possibility to change the order of the characters. Keep up the\
      \ good work :-)\u201D<br />\r\n9/10 \u2013 Cristiano Diel<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      \u201CAmazing game, like Merchant.\u201D<br />\r\n8/10 \u2013 Eduardo Miranda<br\
