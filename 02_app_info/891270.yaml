    review: I have searched for such a game and it is as I wish basically but it is
      very basic. It would be better if there is a overview screen where I can see
      all the important infos at once like the XP stars I have/get when I train or
      make a practice round. Furthermore the design could be better and some visual
      effects. The game could be much better with less text/infos, but more action
      buttons in one screen that there is no need to switch the windows so often.
      I dont know exactly but I miss something with this game, maybe the named things
      are not exactly that, what I mean.
