    developer_response: "Thank you for playing the game, I am sorry to hear you are\
      \ not entirely satisfied with some of the features. \nUnfortunately the game\
      \ was not tested on a 4k display. \n\nI would like to ask if I can make some\
      \ changes such as:\n-Being able to change the field of view,\n-Adjust the font\
      \ on the instructions/menu,\n-Adjust the mouse sensitivity for movement\n\n\
      Would this help you to get a good experience and view of the game? Please let\
      \ me know if you are interested to test these, give the game another chance\
      \ and I can  look to provide an update."

    review: 'Edit: The developer made some changes and my review is now no longer
      applicable. Specifically, the fonts and stuff work great on a 4K display now,
      and the window is resizeable like a normal one. Additionally, the FOV and mouse
      sensitivity are not just fixed by adjustable. Since these where the big things
      I ranted about, and they are fixed, I''ve removed my previous comments.


      I have also ticked the box ''received this product for free'' since the developer
      kindly provided an additional key, after I returned the original for a refund,
      so that I could test the changes and comment on them.


      There are still some ''features'' that are not optimal, but since the developer
      is open to suggestions and actually fixes things, I am changing my review from
      a don''t recommend to recommended, but note that this game is very different
      to most and is probably an acquired taste.'
