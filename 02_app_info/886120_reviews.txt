In 0,8hrs my flatmates and me played through all content. The most fun thing was the soccer-like game.\nWe had fun, but it is really not much content; the maps are also too similar.\nThe tackle-mechanic is a bit wonky but aside that the conrols were fine for me.\n\nI think it's too expensive at the current state. Not because of the lack of content (as this is early access), but because of the lack of updates.\nThis might change in the future but I don't know honestly :D\nUntil further notice, this is a \"don't buy\" from me - will edit this with future updates.\n\nFeedback:\nThe problem the game has at it's current state is the low amount of content.\nThings we need are more maps, but more importantly with new mechanics in each level. Think of older games which introduce a new kind of obstacle or mechanic variation to have a higher variation. I want more interaction with the surroundings.\n\nPossible gimmicks:\n- things that make you jump high, like a trampoline\n-- a possibility to tamper the trampoline so the user gets thrown off and is stunned for a moment\n- portals\n-- throw objects through portals\n- movable platforms\n-- switches to turn platforms on/off\n-- switches to change platform movement path\n- a level on water where you slam a boat with the tackle to move it into a direction\n-- put things on your boat and get the items to an island\n- a level where people are tied by rope\n-- you could possible carry more stuff using the rope by pushing\n- a wreckingball\n-- just put it into a level; players can tackle it and cause more mayhem. Yeah it's hanging from a ceiling, in such a strange world it's probably normal :D\n\nI dunno if it fits the idea in any way, but I'd love to see some co-op stuff (not gonna write ideas as the game's idea is possibly not intended this way)","timestamp_created":1607216993,"timestamp_updated":1607216993,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509803950786590576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4rqLmmvYCf+zRtwI="}
