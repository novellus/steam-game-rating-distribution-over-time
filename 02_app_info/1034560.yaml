    review: "So, some time ago I posted a review of a partial playthrough of Red Peril\
      \ and gave it a good review because I liked the Tales of Nebezem series and\
      \ at that time the game didn't have any reviews yet.  I wasn't able to complete\
      \ the game at that time but I went back and restarted and finished it over the\
      \ last couple of days.  I was 4 hours into it on my first review, Steam says\
      \ I have 18 hours now.  I must say there was not nearly enough plot to justify\
      \ 14 hours, which is why I have changed my review from positive to negative.\
      \  \n\nI believe the author put a lot of work into this game particularly into\
      \ balancing, since it keeps about the same difficulty throughout.  Also the\
      \ in battle skills are all generally interesting.  But you'd have to really\
      \ love this kind of jrpg turn based combat to enjoy this game.  Because I as\
      \ I already said there is hardly any plot at all, and this is surprising because\
      \ that was a really strong point about Elemental Link that made up for the relative\
      \ lack of difficult puzzles.  \n\nThe writing itself isn't bad.  The characters\
      \ have almost too much personality.  But their characters never develop anywhere.\
      \  I think maybe this is due to them not really interacting with the plot and\
      \ having an effect on it.  They follow the trail of the arsonist, they learn\
      \ their identity and motivation, they defeat the arsonist.  Who they are as\
      \ characters never comes into it, not to affect the plot or to be affected by\
      \ the plot.  Their having personality only exists to allow them to provide commentary.\
      \  (which is itself nice since there are 8 possible characters, though only\
      \ 4 will be seen in the game).  This set up reminds me of Seiken Densetsu (Secret\
      \ of Mana) 3.  There you chose a main character and two sidekicks from a choice\
      \ of--I think--6 total characters.  But in that game, the main character provided\
      \ the main storyline for the game and each sidekick contributed a substantial\
      \ sidequest to the experience.  I think in many ways it was the most replayable\
      \ RPG ever because all those combinations were really different experiences.\
      \  This game could have use a similar system were different events in the world\
      \ triggered for different characters, as opposed to the same events just triggering\
      \ different dialogue from them.\n\nI've kept my original review below, because\
      \ most of what I say there is still true, and it addresses the plot and battle\
      \ system in more depth.  I still love the Nebezem world and will buy the next\
      \ title, but I do kind of wish I'd better spent my time than put 14 (or 18 total)\
      \ hours in here.\n\n\nI usually wait to finish a game before I give it a review,\
      \ but I thought I'd make an exception since this is a long game and it doesn't\
      \ have any reviews yet. I will update my review once I've finished the game.\n\
      \nTales of Nebezem is a great series of adventure games on Kongregate. This\
      \ is the second of two premium games in the series. The first, Elemental Link,\
      \ was a story driven adventure game which strangely had less of an emphasis\
      \ on puzzles than the Kongregate games, but it still served up an interesting\
      \ story to which this is a close sequel. You will be interested in the plot\
      \ of this game if you've played Elemental Link.\n\nSo far the game is about\
      \ one of the gray people from the end of the previous game who works as a guardsman\
      \ and whose house was burned down by an unknown arsonist. You quickly find out\
      \ that the same thing has happened to other people and you take up the culprit's\
      \ trail. Interestingly. for both the main character and the first two companions\
      \ you are given a choice between two options. I'm not sure how much difference\
      \ this makes to the overall plot, but it makes a lot of difference to the dialogue.\
      \ I think that probably in the long it will make the whole game replayable at\
      \ least one time.\n\nThe gnomes are back, and this time they are particularly\
      \ interested in what's making wildlife attack everyone who comes near which\
      \ brings us to what makes this game different from the others in the series:\
      \ the addition of combat. The combat is turn based without positioning and reminds\
      \ me of earlier Final Fantasy titles. I'm not a big fan of this style of combat\
      \ and I wouldn't be playing this game if I wasn't invested in the series. It\
      \ just feels like you do the same thing over and over again in every fight.\
      \ However, the magic system is interesting with different schools of magic working\
      \ better against different enemies. If your character isn't magic, you have\
      \ skills that you can use like spells but that require you to be attacked by\
      \ the enemy so taunt is more useful in this game than in any other similar game\
      \ I've played. I think if you like this sort of combat this game should be different\
      \ enough to appeal to you. I just long for a world where grind was a thing of\
      \ the past.\n\nI haven't seen a lot of puzzles yet, which is disappointing,\
      \ but I have hopes they are coming. The main reason to play this game so seems\
      \ to be the story, and the interesting characters inhabiting the world. I sure\
      \ hope the robot from the most recent of the Kongregate games shows up soon.\
      \ :)"
