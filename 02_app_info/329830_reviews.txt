Walking Sims are my jam and this one doesn't disappoint in the writing category. Where this game is rough on the other hand, is its presentation of dialogue resulting in text sometime overlapping or being presented in an awkward order as well as general player movement. Running into awkward invisible walls when trying to explore a house or just moving too slowly is all too common in this game but its worth it for the visual presentation (great retro feel) and its ending. The ending makes any shortcoming the game has worth it with a great built up to a satisfying conclusion. Just like A Wolf in Autumn, the game is about half an hour long and costs the price of a coffee. For such a low price of entry, it's hard to make an argument against checking this game out. Short, sweet and definitely worth your time.","timestamp_created":1609967418,"timestamp_updated":1609967418,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqafi7PYCep2OwQI="}
