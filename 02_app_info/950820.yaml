      notes: "Violence: There is a character death in one story. Both stories in this\
        \ volume also include an assassination attempt, as well as mentions of torture.\
        \ \r\n\r\nSex: There is a suggestive line about being \"quick with your fingers,\"\
        \ but nothing beyond that."

    review: 'Stelsa is a workaholic who talks a mile a minute and also needs some
      relationship advice. She''s an ok hang, kinda fun.


      Talking with Boldir is a joy. She''s got a vibe I just love. It''s hard to describe...
      She seems to know a lot about Paradox Space and she''s very friendly. The protagonist
      is finally able to relax for once and spend time with someone they aren''t trying
      to impress.'
