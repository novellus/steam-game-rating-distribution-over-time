Firstly, this is a game that is heavily dependent on luck and chance. The best of players can lose because of bad luck, and the worst of players can do pretty dang well because of good luck. There will often be times when you hate the game because it's just throwing everything bad it can at you, and sometimes the luck is just so satisfying that you absolutely love it.\nSecond downside, although this one is heavily based in personal opinion, FTL falls into the worst of the spectrum between quick sit down and play for 10-20 minutes, and play a long term campaign that lasts for days or even weeks. Runs in FTL are just long enough to get you invested into your ship and crew, but not long enough for anything satisfying to come of that investment. You can't just 'do whatever because re-spawn is only 10 seconds', but you also don't really get to set up any real goals for the long term. It's just in the awkward in-between phase where you don't get long term investment, but you also don't just get quick unrelated half-an-hour game times.\n\nBut, even with these flaws, it's still a fantastic game. I've had it for less than a week and already sunk 20 hours into this thing, that should speak for itself. It's got some great game-play and different styles, so while it does have its flaws that keep me from giving it a stellar review, it's still definitely earned my money and a positive review.","timestamp_created":1610084454,"timestamp_updated":1610084454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5+Gg8PYCdra7wQI="}
