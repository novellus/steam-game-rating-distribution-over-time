    review: "Preemptive TL;DR: Not a bad rpg maker game, it's fun and the story is\
      \ good enough. I'd dare to even call it a really good  rpg maker game. Always\
      \ look at the chasm first, then touch the egg for bad end or leave it alone\
      \ for good. Given some of it's faults, it's only really worth the buy when it's\
      \ on sale. I don't think I'd be nearly as kind to this game if I had paid the\
      \ full 10 bucks for it.\n\nPros:\n\n-Fun game\n\n-Good enough storyline\n\n\
      -Usually straightforward progression. \n\n-Never gets too hard, lot of fights\
      \ only take 1-3 turns the entire game save for the boss fights.\n\n-Bosses are\
      \ challenging enough compared to the other monsters\n\n-Items EVERYWHERE. You\
      \ find them or get them from fights, you will never run out. Ever.\n\n-Likable\
      \ characters. Granted they aren't super fleshed out but they aren't totally\
      \ cardboard either. 2.5D\n\n-Salesman, I like the character they're cool. \n\
      \n-Beautiful pixel graphics.\n\n-Mapping glitches. There are a lot of them in\
      \ almost all of the maps of this game. I list them as a pro because you can\
      \ kite monsters into them if you don't want to fight.\n\nCons:\n\n-It never\
      \ gets too hard. I listed it as a pro, but that's because I greatly prefer button\
      \ mashing my way through fights to get back to exploring and the story.  If\
      \ you like rpg fights, these might bore you to tears.\n\n-Bad eventing. Most\
      \ of them are minor things that effect the graphics but the rest are bad. The\
      \ main ones that come to mind are all at the end.\n   + The egg, that if you\
      \ get it before looking into the chasm it will cause the game to crash because\
      \ it can't handle the event switches being flipped out of order.\n   +Two boss\
      \ fights at the end, where once you beat those characters the devs forgot to\
      \ make their character events passable, so the player character will bump into\
      \ the invisible events rather than go through them.\n   +On of the party members\
      \ in one of the last scene just stands there after all the characters converge\
      \ on the main character. I'm guessing they had all the characters set up as\
      \ events and forgot to event her moving in with the rest of them, or set her\
      \ movement to skip if she couldn't move.\n   +Not related to the ending. Sometimes\
      \ events just won't recognize when they're being interacted with, or is misplaced\
      \ from where it seems it should be. With enough persistence you can get the\
      \ events to work, but it's just weird that they just won't even with the related\
      \ switches activated.\n\n-Missing tools and under used ones, A.K.A. \"where\
      \ is the damn broom?\" and \"Why do we keep the shovel again?\". \n\nThere are\
      \ many mentions made too the broom throughout the game,  in the blurbs for the\
      \ other tools and even a character at the end of the game makes mention that\
      \ \"You made your way through this place with nothing but your wits and a worn\
      \ broomstick\". Except I never got the broom! I've played through this game\
      \ twice now and I dunno where it is. All the chess pieces are easy to find.\
      \ The sledgehammer and the pickaxe are found easily as you're led to them through\
      \ story events. The broom isn't given that same treatment. I don't know where\
      \ it is. \n\nThe shovel has the opposite problem where we get it, use it once,\
      \ then we NEVER use it again. What was the point in keeping it? It says it can\
      \ be used to dig up secrets or find extra passages, but they're no where to\
      \ be seen. Most of the secrets are very easily telegraphed, and it just bugs\
      \ me that the tool is just extra weight from an idea that never came to be.\n\
      \n-Disjointed character development. While the characters are a little deeper\
      \ than your standard puddle, some of their dialogue is off. It's like you're\
      \ missing conversations between them and some of what they say can come off\
      \ as cold or outright mean. They get along more towards the end, but it's still\
      \ really weird seeing them be mean to eachother to being more like friends.\
      \ It feels like there's missing conversations that would have smoothed that\
      \ out.\n\nI also suspect that the missing broom leads into this, since we may\
      \ have been able to get into the oil room/treasury much earlier in the game\
      \ as it's blocked off by what I can assume is a sweepable pile of debris. I\
      \ say this because there is a place for the merchant and it's a big open area\
      \ with no monsters, and those are normally the locations where the MCs rest\
      \ and talk. The devs at least had enough forethought to make it so that the\
      \ pile is gone by the time you end up looped back to that area, since you have\
      \ to do a fair bit of back tracking at that point in the game and would have\
      \ been stuck otherwise.\n\n-Inconsistent item hints. This is mostly in regards\
      \ to early-mid portions of the game, where it seems like the devs couldn't decide\
      \ if they wanted the player to work out and find what they need on their own,\
      \ or use the sparkling graphic to telegraph it as both are used in the game.\
      \ It makes it a bit confusing, and then including some events just not registering\
      \ interactions? It can make a player miss an item they need, like the torch\
      \ for the oil room because it didn't let them take it after interacting with\
      \ it a couple times, wander the monastery, only to come back and NOW it lets\
      \ them take it.\n\nNitpicks:\n\n-One switch to decide your ending. There are\
      \ two endings to this game and in a game that was this big, I'm not really a\
      \ fan of there being just one switch to decide which one you get. I think it\
      \ would have been better for there to be a variable system to decide your ending,\
      \ which considering a character that plays a part in both endings it could easily\
      \ have been made into three or four endings.\n\n-All the cultists just sitting\
      \ there at the end. They just sit there when they could swarm the MCs, be destroyed,\
      \ or have clouds of smoke come off them as they finally die for good. Leaving\
      \ them standing there after everything just seems lazy. \n\n-No flavor text.\
      \ You can't interact with everything and get a bit of dialogue for it. Granted\
      \ it lets the game be more streamlined so the player knows they don't have to\
      \ waste their time selecting everything, but I'm one of those that likes having\
      \ that bit of extra dialogue to help discover more of the lore. \n\n-The Controls\
      \ are wrong. The Z key is entirely nonfunctional for this game even though the\
      \ beginning control explanation says you can use it. It's the default interact\
      \ key as well so it's a bit weird having to always hit enter.  It left me going\
      \ between the Z and enter keys just because I kept forgetting that Z doesn't\
      \ work. I'm also a bit sad they disabled shift to run, which would have been\
      \ great to have for some of the longer back tracking segments.\n\n-That the\
      \ achievements are hidden until after you complete them and sometimes not even\
      \ then. This is mostly for the chess one, since even after placing down the\
      \ chess pieces I don't have the achievement for it."
