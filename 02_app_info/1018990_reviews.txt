I am giving it a mild recommendation because I did have fun with it for a few hours, and because I like the warm and friendly vibe, but it could be so much more with just a little more development time invested.","timestamp_created":1609831162,"timestamp_updated":1609831162,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwicTa6PYCfaPQwAI="}
