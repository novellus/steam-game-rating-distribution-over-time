    review: 'My opinion on this DLC is pretty much the same as the previous volume,
      so I''ll just copy paste that review. It''s very good.


      "The addition of an original soundtrack greatly improves the mood and atmosphere
      of the comic. It''s probably the closest we''ll get to an actual Half-Life film."'
