The voice actresses make their characters sound cute and innocent. Nagisa’s actress injects the character with a sense of unspoiled purity and playfulness. Saya’s actress maintains her character’s seriousness and stubbornness but is also able to make the audience empathize with her during quiet moments. Ai’s character is very cute and innocent. She’s almost child-like and too good for this world. During sex, Nagisa’s actress plays up her initial inexperience but soon shows the player just how good she sounds pretending to take it in the pussy in the booth.\n\nThe game contains limited sound effects. Noises you’ll hear include cameras taking pictures, doors opening and closing, bustling crowds. I spotted a lot of missed opportunities in which a scene would’ve felt livelier with even generic sounds.\n\nMUSIC\n\nSAKRA KLIKER has wonderful music. The game is comprised of original instruments like the electric guitar, keyboard, piano and drums. You also hear the trumpet and other wind instruments during some songs. Music in (insert game) is fun to listen to and adds to the enjoyment of the game.\n\nThe soundtrack has good variety. You hear soft, intimate melodies, followed by cheerful, upbeat tones that put a spring in your step. You’d expect to hear these tunes in a traditional slice of life anime. There are also songs specifically designed for dramatic or intense scenes, and silly comedic moments.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\ncookie clicker\n\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nThe graphics are top tier. The game takes place at multiple locations, both indoors and outdoors. The artists demonstrate their mastery over the brush with backgrounds showing different lighting depending on time of day. The lighting and shading is well utilized. The level of detail in the background artwork ranges from heavily detailed to simplistic. The diverse locations add a layer of realism to the world.\n\nAs mentioned before, a glitch prevented me from seeing characters on-screen. This is a very big and glaring error since 90% of the scenes should feature the character sprites.\n\nThe game features a library of CGs with multiple variations. Variations include moving the character’s head around, blinking or changing facial expressions. All the characters have cute designs with small, perky breasts, although they do suffer from the insidious ‘Same Face Syndrome’.\n\n\nHENTAI\n\nThe game’s hentai content is completely separate from the main game. There are three scenarios to choose from. These are all hypothetical scenarios that explore what you and Nagisa would do, if you had a sexual relationship.\n\nIn all of these scenarios you two sneak around, having kinky sex wherever you can. In the first scenario you strip Nagisa of her pesky virginity, but not before you suck on her tits and finger her pussy until she cums. In the second scenario Nagisa gives you a blowjob in the office. She tries her hand at deep-throating you and gets a face full of cum! In the third scene the two of you fuck doggystyle in the studio while she is wearing her idol outfit.\n\nSex scenes in the game are short but hot. The play by play from Nagisa is super lewd to read. Certain parts of the artwork are animated, showing Nagisa’s body rock back and forth as she rides you like a bucking bronco. Sexual artwork has limited variants during a scene apart from cumshots and changes to faces.\n\n\nCONCLUDING WORDS\n\nKirakira Stars Idol Project: Nagisa I mean sakura clicker is a decent hentai visual novel i mean clicker game with cute characters and a believable premise. It has a few glitches and a generic story. The soundtrack is fine, but the audio needs improvement. If you like hentai games where the sex is a surplus, grab this title and maybe you’ll rub one out eventually.
