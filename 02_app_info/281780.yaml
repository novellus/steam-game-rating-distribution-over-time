      \ the comic strip I honestly can\u2019t describe why this game is so fun. Gabe\
      \ and I played it for hours last weekend and had a great time. It\u2019s got\
      \ some puzzle elements that you can choose to engage with if you want to but\
      \ you can also just dig. It\u2019s a very relaxing game and you can lose a couple\
