One thing I liked about this game is that it is almost totally hidden objects.   Yes, you have to make a guess based on the evidence you collect, but the rest of the game is hidden objects consistently.  This is very different from other mystery games I usually play.  Here are the cons:  the game is expensive - usually $20.  I bought it on the winter sale, so it was much cheaper.  Here's why this is important: this game is very short.  If you're going to have a $20 game, make it worth playing.  I felt like it was WAY too short, and if I had paid $20 for it, I would have been very disappointed.  Overall, it's a good game if you get it on sale.  Also, why isn't there a Season 1 available?","timestamp_created":1517375223,"timestamp_updated":1517375223,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zY6npeECdeLMlwE="}
