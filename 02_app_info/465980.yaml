    review: "S\xE3o musicas encantadoras, bonitas, relaxantes, elas marcam a identidade\
      \ do jogo e transmite com maestria o clima da narrativa ao jogador. Um \xF3\
      timo aditivo para os f\xE3s da franquia. Considero indispens\xE1vel ter essa\
      \ trilha sonora na biblioteca!\n\nO pacote traz arquivos \"cr\xFAs\" de \xE1\
      udio, de qualidade m\xE1xima, no formato PCM (WAV), que n\xE3o possui compacta\xE7\
      \xE3o. Se a preocupa\xE7\xE3o for o espa\xE7o no disco, uma convertida pra formato\
      \ como MP3 e depois apagar os WAV resolve."
