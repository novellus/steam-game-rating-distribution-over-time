The music and pixel art are delightful, so is the attention to detail - especially on the decks of cards that are crafted to each monster's interests. The fact that Sandwiches and Samson can be played in real life with an actual set of cards is pretty lovely. I did have a little trouble with the hit boxes every now and again, but ultimately the game is nicely polished and super wholesome! I'd certainly recommend to anyone who enjoys cute, short, positive, or narrative games - make some friends in Monster Pub!","timestamp_created":1543565423,"timestamp_updated":1543565423,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553718984127044678","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mebqsecCf4eJtAE="}
