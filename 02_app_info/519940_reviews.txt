It is a lot of fun.  You won't be playing this game for 20 hours... but it is a great game that has a short learning curve, aka, let your friends play, or if you want to play something for just a couple minutes with little time invested.\n\nAs for people saying it is too hard, I actually have the opposite complaint, the speed ramp up maxes out after 100 rows or so, and if you can hold that, you can just play forever.  I played to 1000 rows just to see if there was a \"Great Job, you beat the game\" or award or something... spoiler alert... as of 1100 or so rows, there isn't.  Once you hit that point, it gets boring.  I wish the speed ramp kept going.","timestamp_created":1590785518,"timestamp_updated":1590785518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm5WNsfICcJWJiwI="}
