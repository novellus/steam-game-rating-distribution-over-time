    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Description</h2>Ever squashed bugs as a little
      kid? Well even if not, now is your chance! Get into Wurst Defender Coop Edition
      and improve your typing skills by writing different words from numerous categories.
      Create your own word packs with the theme you like most and play them afterwards
      in the game. Share your word pack creations on the Steam Community Hub or the
      Facebook community page for other players to discover and play. <br><br>The
      more words you type, the harder they become, but no worries, you can slow down
      the game by choosing a lower difficulty. Ease yourself into the game with a
      partner, who has a much easier job of nursing a plant. With a watering can and
      some fertilizer crumbs, the life of the writer gets either easier or harder,
      depending on the mood of your fellow player nursing the plant. Social interaction
      and maybe conflict guaranteed!<br><br>The campaign sets you on a journey through
      all word packs. Defend the sausage, level by level and upgrade your upgrades,
      which make it much easier to withstand the waves of approaching ants. Get a
      shield for example, zap the ants with a little bit of lightning or channel the
      inner healing powers of the sausage, however that is possible but yes, the sausage
      is healing itself, who would have thought! <br><br>Visit the Facebook page to

    review: "Ein Spiel, das nicht nur den Wortschatz erweitert, oder bei dem man schneller\
      \ schreiben lernt, auch der Humor kommt mit lustigen Worten nicht zu kurz. Au\xDF\
      erdem erinnert mich das Spiel daran, den/das eine oder andere/n  Film/Spiel\
      \ wieder einmal anzuschauen/ zu spielen.\nEs gibt eine Kampagne, einen Mehrspieler\
      \ und Endlosmodus."
