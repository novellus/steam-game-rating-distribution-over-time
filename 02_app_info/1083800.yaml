    review: "Smooth easy to pick up AFPS game with its own mechanics. Currently no\
      \ servers up, but the p2p netcode is surprisingly good, no problems at all from\
      \ one side of the US to the other when hosting games,. We even had some dudes\
      \ from Australia and Thailand playing in my game last night and they were still\
      \ having fun despite having a 200+ ping connection. This game is shaping up\
      \ to be an awesome game to play with your friends, and the capture the ball\
      \ mode is awesome!\n\n\u65E9\u671F\u30A2\u30AF\u30BB\u30B9\u3067\u3082\u3068\
