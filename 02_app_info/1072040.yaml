      \ latest technical standards.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The king of wargames is back</h2>Easy\
      \ to play and at the same time extremely deep, its fine-tuned turn-based gameplay\
      \ style means that it\u2019s the quality of your decisions, not the speed of\
      \ clicking, which will determine the outcome of your battles. Don\u2019t outpace\
      \ your enemies, outsmart them! <br>In-depth gameplay mechanics model unit movement,\
      \ combat, spotting, encirclements, weather, capturing enemy equipment and much\
      \ more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A massive amount of content</h2>Panzer Corps 2 is\
      \ all about content. You can play for every major power in the European theatre\
      \ of the Second World War, and unleash over a whopping 1000 unique different\
      \ units on your enemies! Every single unit in the game has been painstakingly\
      \ modelled and animated. No other game covers as many authentic World War II\
      \ vehicles as Panzer Corps 2!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">All of World War II at your\
      \ fingertips</h2>Panzer Corps 2 comes with a massive branching campaign including\
      \ around 60 scenarios: lead the Wehrmacht in the entirety of World War II, carrying\
      \ over your battle-hardened veterans from one battle to the next. 4 additional\
      \ single player scenarios are available and another 10 scenarios carefully designed\
      \ for a balanced Multiplayer experience. On top of that there is an advanced\
      \ random map generator for Skirmish mode, offering six distinct map types and\
      \ four mission types.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The ultimate wargame online experience</h2>Challenge\
      \ your friends or play on coop against the AI. Panzer Corps 2 offers a wide\
      \ range of Multiplayer options: hot seat, server-assisted play-by-email (Slitherine\u2019\
      s PBEM++) mode, and a true online Multiplayer. In the latter mode it is even\
      \ possible to play your turns simultaneously with your coop partner, which basically\
      \ reduces waiting times to zero!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A comprehensive editor</h2>Modding\
      \ was always big with Panzer Corps series. For this reason, Panzer Corps 2 includes\
      \ the most powerful Scenario Editor we have ever created, which is also very\
      \ user friendly and easy to use. Using the Editor, you can create your own campaigns,\
      \ single scenarios and multiplayer maps in no time, or you can enjoy content\
      \ created by fellow players. If the prequel game is any indication, literally\
      \ hundreds of user-made scenarios will be available for Panzer Corps 2 in no\
      \ time, for unlimited replayability!"
