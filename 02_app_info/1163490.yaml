    review: '"Gangsters 1920" should be classified as a "Walking Simulator" since
      that''s primarily what you will be doing.  Walking through a maze of 215 rooms
      that all look the same without any map.  So you are required to have graph paper
      and lots of free time on your hands.

      The game is supposed to be randomly generated, but it is the same exact map
      layout each time you start a new game.  The placement of the informant, gramophone
      and guard are always in  the same locations every time you play. Even the password
      never changes.  It''s always: "Gramophone". So I don''t see any of the mentioned
      replay value. There''s some issues with grammar and a random problem where a
      saved game loads showing full health, but in reality the player only has half-health.  But
      it doesn''t really matter, because even if you die, you can still Load or Continue
      where you left off and keep playing.  There''s no penalty for dying.  In fact
      I finished the game is one sitting.  It''s very easy, simplistic, boring and
      repetitious. Not at all challenging as mentioned in the description.  Just monotonous.  For
      anyone who purchased this game and is stuck, I created a map below. You begin
      on the Yellow Square and end on the Brown Square.
