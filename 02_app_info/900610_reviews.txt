Knowing 1st hand how it looks and feels I'd give this model 4 out of 5 stars.\n+ The design really looks great and the animations of the rider make it feel like really racing the bike.\n- The engine sounds a bit too much like a big dirtbike. It's not really bad, but could be better.\n- Instead of using the iconic LED headlights and turn indicators they choose the old, conventional ones. I know the bike in this game is for racing and not for showing of but in real life I've only seen this configuration once and didn't like it ;-)\n- The Temperature show the Fahrenheit value with a Celsius sign. I don't think Tenerife will reach 75.3Â°C during summer :-)","timestamp_created":1595335272,"timestamp_updated":1595335554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540636062622070313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvZbauPMCcpvZlgI="}
