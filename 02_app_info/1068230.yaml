    review: 'I got this game to play with my daughter. I really wanted to like it.
      But I have to be honest, it is pretty boring even for a four-year old. Basically
      you have 365 versions of the same puzzle with different "seasonal" graphics.


      Pros:

      Cute and relaxing, until you get bored.

      Good concept, it could have been a decent Zen Relaxation game with a little
      more work.


      Cons:

      Limited UI, you can''t even rotate the camera.

      Nothing to interact with outside of the game tiles.. no animals to discover
      or cute animations to make it interesting.

      Very limited variety.'
