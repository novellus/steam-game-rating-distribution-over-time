    about_the_game: "Delta Force \u2014 Black Hawk Down: Team Sabre is the official\
      \ expansion pack to the #1 best selling PC game in North America. Team Sabre\
      \ was developed using the Delta Force \u2014 Black Hawk Down engine and it requires\

      \ but the missions are fictitious and not based on any actual real events. \
      \ The expansion follows the Team Sabre Squadron as they are deployed to take\
      \ out targets and carry out mission objectives in two separate single player\
      \ campaigns (*approximately 5 missions each) that take place in Columbia and\
      \ Iran.  The multiplayer feature boasts 30 new maps and an enhanced level of\
