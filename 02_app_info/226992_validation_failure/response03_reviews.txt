The narrator sounds amazing, adding drama to your play.\n\n[u]V8[/u]\nVisually and audibly gorgeous, and features some creative and challenging mechanics.  Forces you to eat your vegetables first by learning how to light kickbacks, since it's so easy to drain on the sides.\n\n[u]Shaman[/u]\nA passable table, but not very memorable.\n\n[u]El Dorado[/u]\nThe most amateur table available for Pinball FX2, featuring extremely muddy visuals and a narrator that sounds like a college student on marijuana speaking into a cheap microphone.  However, it kinda grows on you, so it's not too offensive.\n\nI'd recommend picking this up on sale due to the tables being so hit-or-miss.","timestamp_created":1500102652,"timestamp_updated":1500238067,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ404bKpt0CfbL/fw=="}
