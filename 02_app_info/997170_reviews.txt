Unlocking new weapons is always fun (As is utilizing them on the zombie horde that inevitably presents itself for slaughter). I played this game on mobile previously, and have a lot more time on it there. Definitely worth the asking price!","timestamp_created":1608674116,"timestamp_updated":1608674116,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmuCcxvYCfdujvAI="}
