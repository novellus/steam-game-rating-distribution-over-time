I really love the retro style and sound effects, and though they are enemies all the monsters are super adorable. I encountered a few bugs but that can of course be forgiven because the game is brand new, and as far as I know I'll be the first person to write a review lol. I think the idea of having to advance through levels to get new building blocks is really fun, but I already can teleport to most of the islands and I am level 9, which I have achieved in playing the game for about 30 minutes. I think it should be a lot harder to advance in levels! I'm sure what I've been critical of will improve as the game's development continues. I can't wait to keep supporting this game as it rises to popularity!","timestamp_created":1600558203,"timestamp_updated":1600558203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.616502046585083008","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h4Ct1PQCccrvogI="}
