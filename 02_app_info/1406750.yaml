    review: 'I''ve only played the first 5 stages so far, but thought I''d put out
      my early impressions in case people want more information about this game, since
      this seems to be the first review for this game.


      The rules are fairly straightforward. You have a weapon in one hand and a racket
      in the other (you can switch which one is in which hand).  Each stage (so far)
      consists of three waves where you defend against drones.  Use your weapon to
      destroy the drones, matching the color of your shots to the color of the drone.  Some
      drones will shoot projectiles at specific tiles in the arena, and you must defend
      these tiles by deflecting the projectiles with your racket, matching the color
      of the racket to the color of the projectile.  Other drones shoot directly at
      you.  These shots can''t be deflected and must be dodged.  If a drone hits you
      or a tile, you take damage.  Take too much damage, and you lose.  Completing
      a stage earns you points that can be used to upgrade weapons or unlock new ones.


      There are two difficulty settings.  On normal difficulty, it started out pretty
      easy but got challenging pretty quickly.  Later stages add multiple platforms
      that you must defend by teleporting back and forth between them, multiple simultaneous
      drones, and drones that fire multiple shots.  I currently have three different
      weapon types unlocked, which I''m guessing is all of them based on the selection
      interface, but there seems to be plenty of upgrades for them left.


      Based on my experience so far, I would definitely recommend this game.  The
      gameplay is fun and the visuals are quite good.  Played on an HTC Vive with
      the Vive controllers.  I do have Index controllers but haven''t tried them yet,
      and I have the HP Reverb G2 on preorder, so I may update later with how it plays
      using these.


      Update:  Tested with Vive headset + Index controllers.  Works great.'
