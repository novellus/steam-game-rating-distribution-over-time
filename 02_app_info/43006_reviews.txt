You can only get points for upgrades by playing with other players and nobody, I mean NOBODY, plays this anymore.\n\nThe couple of times I did get to play with other people, long ago, it was pretty boring anyway.  I wish they'd just unlock all of the upgrades so we could just build cool looking wanzers.  I'd consider reinstalling just for that.\n\nAnyway, don't waste your money, this thing is DEAD.","timestamp_created":1500599618,"timestamp_updated":1500599618,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.737123250961303711","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnaGtsd0Cf4TAgAE="}
