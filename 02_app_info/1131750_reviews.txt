It's up to you if you think that is good or bad\n\nAndi is better as a writer than a game designer. So, the gameplay mechanics are quite shallow and not very many. But to me he overcomes this weakness by focusing the game on characters and the world itself instead of the gameplay.","timestamp_created":1609075317,"timestamp_updated":1609075317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kJuX0vYCfdLfvQI="}
