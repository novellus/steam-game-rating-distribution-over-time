While some of the motifs can feel a bit generic the instrumental choices are anything but and there's clearly a lot of artistic vision in Sanchez's work. Weryt in particular is one of the best boss themes I've heard in the past decade. Overall the album can be entertaining out of context, but is most effective accompanying Immortal Redneck, which it enhances greatly with its creative mix of Egyptian and modern Rock themes, both soothing and invigorating in and out of combat.","timestamp_created":1545705136,"timestamp_updated":1545705136,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533073961734771729","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+JPN8ecCeJaptgE="}
