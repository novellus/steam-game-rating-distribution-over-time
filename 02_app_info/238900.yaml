    about_the_game: 'The Japanese enter the fray on Luminith: their faction has a
      very strong military and a very strange pantheon: their gods are much more aggressive
      than their Greek and Norse counterparts, and each has three god creatures rather
      than three god tokens.  Learning to play this new faction effectively is a fun
      new challenge: given how powerful the Japanese military and mythology are, you
      have to be very creative in how you help the Norse and Greeks drive back this
      threat.  Remember, no faction is supposed to dominate the other!<br><br>Hamlets
      are new non-combative, non-factional villages that can be built in the remains
      of the fallen towns.  But it''s never that easy!  Hamlet buildings can only
      be placed from a limited queue that cycles as you place them.  Hamlet buildings
      generate (or lose) Culture depending on what pre-existing tiles were adjacent
      at the time you placed them.  Culture allows you to activate four powerful new
      abilities, including creating Large Towns or even turning back time.  Amass
      enough Culture and Sunstone and you can even win the game via a new Cultural
      Victory!<h2 class="bb_tag">Game Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Japanese

    review: 'If you want to reach top scores, get this DLC and play a Japaneses VS
      Vikings game in higher difficulties, as they offer the best combinations to
      develop the game chaos/score.

      Hamlets are the key to obtain new superpowers, which even allow things such
      as removing the unremovable, skyrocketing the score by x20, or rolling back
      by 10 turns to keep playing forever.

      Excellent additions to an already great game.'
