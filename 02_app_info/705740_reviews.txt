Not a whole lot of content compared to other games in the same genre, but that is not necessarily an issue.\nIn fact, after playing many idle games that requires more than 200 hours of gameplay, it feels quite good to play a new one that can be completed in about 20 hours.\n\nIt is currently on sale (-90%), so if you are looking for a \"quick\" idle/clicker game, I recommend this one !","timestamp_created":1609575841,"timestamp_updated":1609575841,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zseM4fYCf7HUvwI="}
