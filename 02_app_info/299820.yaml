      \ of it makes any sense.  I don\u2019t know how this all happened but I do know\

      \  I don't know what's going on and in the city I am totally alone. <br> <br>I\

    review: "Paradigm Shift is a horror adventure game where you try to survive a\
      \ zombie apocalypse. \n\nStory:\n\nYou play as an unnamed man. You awaken from\
      \ a nightmare and find your city of River Lake devastated by a chemical plant\
      \ explosion that turns animals and humans into flesh eating monsters. Your rations\
      \ are running low and you decide that it's time leave.\n\nThe story is pretty\
      \ bares bones, you do get notes scattered around and they try to explain the\
      \ story slightly, but not by much. It's really not that good and only is there\
      \ to set up the puzzles you solve. \n\nGraphics:\n\nThe graphics are absolutely\
      \ awful. Paradigm Shift is an adventure game and you know that looking for items\
      \ is a big part of games like these. The environments look really low resolution\
      \ and there's these really ugly scratch marks across each screen, which sometimes\
      \ obscures crucial items you need to pick up.\n\nEnemies also look stupid, they\
      \ have these really weird photoshop stuff on them, that makes them look funny\
      \ instead of scary.\n\nAudio:\n\nSince this game is basically a flash game,\
      \ the audio is super compressed and crunchy. The sound effects are all awful\
      \ and are actually quite hilarious, like the zombies attacking you. The only\
      \ good thing I can come up with the audio design is the end credits song that\
      \ actually sounds pretty good (probably a hot take of mine).\n\nGameplay:\n\n\
      As said before, Paradigm Shift is an adventure game where you pick up items\
      \ and use them to solve puzzles. As I said before, the crucial items are impossible\
      \ to see in certain sections because of the dark environments and film grains.\n\
      \nLet's talk puzzles, as they are the meat on the bones of these type of games.\
      \ The puzzles are awful and barely make any sense. Most of them are pretty easy,\
      \ but there are a few puzzles that are so stupid that I got stuck for quite\
      \ a while. There's also combat, but it's so barebones that I just want to mention\
      \ it that it exists. Every so often an enemy will pop up and you press on them\
      \ to take them out. \n\nVerdict:\n\nParadigm Shift is awful in every way. Terrible\
      \ graphics, awful puzzles and just overall low quality, make this game a waste.\
      \ It's roughly 20 minutes long and it's just not very good, yes it's cheap,\
      \ but so are so many other games, so just get one of those and skip this. \n\
      \nFinal Rating:\n1/10\n\nPros:\nN/A\n\nCons:\n- Puzzles are awful\n- Horrible\
      \ graphics\n- Terrible audio design \n\nIf you liked this review please consider\
