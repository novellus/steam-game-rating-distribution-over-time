I completed the full game in less than 20 minutes. However the love and effort that has went into crafting this has not gone unnoticed. Everything from the nostalgic 90s point and click style graphics to the soundtrack really paints a scene not to dissimilar to Blade runner and other neo-noir classics. \n\nI also loved the voice acting. For a small production team they have really made the story feel alive, not once was I drawn out of it due to cheesy line deliveries. The story it's self also had my attention the whole time, the only thing I wish is that there was more of it. The game feels like a prologue to something bigger.","timestamp_created":1609826313,"timestamp_updated":1609826313,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4soTI6PYCd9bOwAI="}
