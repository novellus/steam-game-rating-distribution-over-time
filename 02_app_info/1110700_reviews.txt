Each outfit costs 2 of these. The reason why it costs $40 is the devs always intended for these to not be easy to get. So I only recommend it if you really wanna support the devs. Like me....cause I bought it like a lunatic.","timestamp_created":1566073667,"timestamp_updated":1566073667,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552524089813232422","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42/fQ0OwCc7HG0AE="}
