    about_the_game: '<strong>Ruin everything.</strong><br>You are a banker. You want
      to extract as much wealth from the world as possible--or, at least, more than
      everyone else. You will manipulate the global economy in order to siphon money
      into your secret Swiss bank account. Whoever has the most Swiss money in 12
      turns wins the game.<br><br>Play solo against the AI or multiplayer against
      people who will imminently cease to be your friends.<br><br><strong>Buy votes.</strong><br>Unlike
      most strategy games, you will never have access to armies and never directly
      control territory. Instead, you will spread  your influence throughout the globe
      by purchasing votes in parliament, or selling your votes to incite a military
      coup. You always share power with your rivals, waiting for the moment when you
      can backstab them.<br><br><strong>Make free trade agreements.</strong><br>Re-route
      industrial wealth throughout the world, from Mines to Factories via exploitative
      trade agreements. Remember: your goal is to make a profit, NOT to improve the
      world.<br><br><strong>Manipulate the IMF.</strong><br>Control the International
      Monetary Fund to force policy decisions without a regional parliament''s approval.
      Basically, screw over your opponents without them being able to do a thing about
      it.<br><br><strong>The map is upside-down</strong><br>Because why not.'

    review: 'To be honest, you generally play this brilliant game only a few times
      before it becomes repetitive but it''s well worth the price and even triple
      :)

      I teach economic history in college and use this game regularly. In fact I''m
      just reinstalling it at home right now to use in my remote Coronavirus session
      tonight!'
