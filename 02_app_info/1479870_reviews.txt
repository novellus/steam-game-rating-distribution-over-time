Hard to find where to click (it IS a point&click!), active zones not present until the story progresses, so you just have to roam all the locations availables at the time again and again. No map, no jump, just slow walking. Too short, too easy puzzles, even if some objects where really hard to find/catch because of scene construction and lack of zoom. No speed control for the text, I missed half of the dialogs because they scrolled too fast. I love HOG, but this is not one of the good ones, at least not this version.","timestamp_created":1608342879,"timestamp_updated":1608342879,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sZetvPYCcs+puwI="}
