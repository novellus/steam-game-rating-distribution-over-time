I'm really enjoying the concept and the style but at the moment there is a significant playability issue. Each player simply has too little to control. You can only move your bat in a very short range above your blocks (essentially three positions). Sometimes you can redirect the ball in flight (the rules on this are a little unclear) and sometimes you can shoot. Most of the time is spent watching the ball bounce around and waiting often for quite a long time before it hits you.\nTo put it into perspective I played a 4 player round with my two daughters and no-one in slot 4. The game took a long time to finish and slot 4 came very close to winning. The outcome was very nearly random.\nI think if each players bat was given freedom of motion about the whole quadrant of the play area and/or some ability to tilt, it would improve the pace of the game and the level of interactively dramatically. This game definitely has promise if that defect is fixed.","timestamp_created":1597279580,"timestamp_updated":1597279580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1597387431,"developer_response":"Thank you for the feedback! It's appreciated.\n\nI could add a slightly different option that would allow you to move your bat 'further out' giving you a wider range of movement - similar to the 'Shunt' powerup. You would be able to switch between the current bat position and the new bat position on the fly, say with a button press. I would probably increase the size of the bat as well. This mode could only be enabled when no other powerup affecting the bat is in place.\n\nThe controlling of the ball you mentioned is activated when you hit the ball, with the right joystick used for directing the ball. You can only do this for a period of two seconds OR until the ball hits another object. I am going to change this so you can still control the ball after it has hit other objects.\n\nWhen you are shooting the bullets are can be directed by moving the right joystick in the direction you want them to go. There is still room for improvement with this though."}],"cursor":"AoJw9oXS8vMCec2NmwI="}
