Keep watch and see what, if anything, happens.\n\nUpdate 8/21/2020 - DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  IT IS ABANDONED AND UNFINISHED. \n\nI just wanted to post a quick positive review for this early access game.  It is still pretty early in development, but there is a lot here to enjoy.  It's not the most mind-blowing game ever, but it's pretty unique and just good old fun.\n\nYou play a guild.  You have a stable of dudes and gals in your guild, and you manage their skills (and possibly stats as they level up - I haven't gotten that far yet), and equipment.  Then you form them into parties and go on quests, which are mainly combat oriented quests so far.  I haven't seen anything other than go to a place, find out what the problem is, accept the quest, and enter a combat to defeat the bad guys.  You get loot, fame, experience and gold for completing quests.\n\nYour Guild Hall is your base of operations, where you rest, train, equip items, gain new skills, and possibly some other things that aren't fully implemented yet.\n\nThe best part is the developer is EXTREMELY, no joke, extremely active in the forums and very quick to listen to player feedback, criticism, and suggestions.  I've just played for a very short time and already the developer has put out a very nice update.  He says he will continue putting out updates all the time, daily, hourly, whatever it takes.  \n\nSo, it's still pretty early in development, but the developer has a good track record of finishing his games in a timely manner.  I enjoy Zavix Tower by the Batholith, and this one looks to be a lot more interesting.\n\nSo . . . a nice recommendation from me for now.  I look forward to see how the rest of the development goes, but I know we'll have constant, quick, and meaty updates.  Good stuff.  Great developer!\n\nUpdate 8/21/2020 - I am changing my review to very negative.  The developer has abandoned the game, left it very unfinished, and does not even have the balls to come to the Steam forum to give his customers an explanation.\n\nYet, he continues to sell it for full price.  For shame, Batholith dude.  For shame.\n\nUpdate 11/12/2020 - Developer has started posting in the forums again.  Keep watch and see what, if anything, happens.","timestamp_created":1553482169,"timestamp_updated":1605198236,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.597192525863647461","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwlqnR3vUCesXivQE="}
