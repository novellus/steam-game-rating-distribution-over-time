Gameplay is just F*cked\n2. you're going to die sometimes (I know that sounds stupid)\n3. Probably level 6 is not possible to pass\n4. Graphics isn't bad (I know really helpfull)\n5. Gameplay is probably for 10-15 minutes (I gave up after 8 because of 6th level)\n6. No music (Quiet gameplay) \nfinal results: -2/10","timestamp_created":1590521867,"timestamp_updated":1604324050,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxcjKxPUCdr+8igI="}
