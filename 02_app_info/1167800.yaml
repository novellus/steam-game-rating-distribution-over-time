    review: This game feels like a love letter to the old arena shooters during the
      late 90s. The game's fast, with good controls, fun powerups, pretty and varied
      maps, and good gamemodes and AI opponents. Definitely worth checking out for
      the price, if you like 2d space shooters mixed with arena shooters.
