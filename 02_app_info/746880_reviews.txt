The animations are very clunky and basic. The premise as far as I can tell is basically Terraria. The spell crafting system looks fun but I haven't got that far yet. I died and lost my pick within the first few minutes so I had to create a new character to get it back as I couldn't mine anything without it. \n\nI recommend this because I think it has potential, but it's going to take a lot of work to get it to a good state. Hopefully the devs keep up with this.\n\nEDIT: Change to not recommend since there hasn't been an update","timestamp_created":1553803807,"timestamp_updated":1608705639,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.59789508581161499","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pYCVx/YCfbqCvgE="}
