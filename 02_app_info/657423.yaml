    review: "I originally bought this pack for Excalibur table based on reviews I\
      \ found.   Now that I own it.  I feel Excalibur is an okay table.  Not quite\
      \ as good as I was hoping.   When  I first saw Epic Quest I wasn't sure I would\
      \ like it.  After playing it quite a bit.  It's one of my favorites.  It's very\
      \ playable, clear objectives, and the music and talk / sounds are amusing. \
      \  \n\nThis pack is worth the price just for Epic Quest in my opinion.  Excalibur\
      \ is just icing on the cake."
