It does seem to have some intricate puzzle design and helps a little in understanding how the game works. However, what takes away from the game is not exactly describing what does what.\n\nLike, what does the colored orbs do? What different kind of spells do what? What is the objective of this game? I know I'm to defeat the dragon, but I don't get a lot to work with besides that? There's so many questions I find myself asking as I'm just simply clicking around at colors as they do intended effects. I've only ever progressed past three enemies before losing and before that, I've lost a few times because of how fast the game can end.\n\nI just found myself lost in understanding completely as to what I'm to do to get the maximum amount of fun here. Every time you lose a game, you have to sit through the small tutorial again and again. That'd be fine to help me understand HOW to play the game. But I bear to repeat - what am I doing and what is what!?\n\nAnd speaking of lacking it's instructions, rather more in-depth instructions, there's not a whole lot to tinker with in settings. Actually, there is nothing to tinker with for settings. No resolution changes, no sound options and none of that to be found here. It's just run the game, try to understand it to the best of your abilities and go from there. Well, I appreciate the sentiment, but I don't have the patience for games that cannot bother to introduce players to it and give them reasons to enjoy it.\n\nAll I can say that's good about it, is that it has nice visuals, gives you an arcade-feel and it can be fun. But what can make it more fun is if it clarified everything revolving around what's in the game. Those qualities alone though, don't really make me want to recommend this and I hate to be the first to review this game since nobody else has reviewed it to not recommend it. I hope in the future, since it's been released this year, that development continues and more things are added.\n\nBut for now, I'm refunding.","timestamp_created":1576791320,"timestamp_updated":1576791320,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556541025638580322","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3MSFkO8CcoG05QE="}
