Most of my (short) playtime was spent knowing already how to get to the next area, or how to solve a puzzle, but just waiting for treeker's pudgy butt to shift into gear. Yes I know about the sprint button, nearly got a cramp from holding it down so long. This game is needlessly self-indulgent in how slow the character moves, and how environmental items move/shift position.\n\nI have a feeling I didn't even reach the real meat of this game, but I think to get there would've put me beyond the threshold of refunding. (Don't even remember when or how I got this game)","timestamp_created":1594871239,"timestamp_updated":1594871239,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lfruqvMCccXKlQI="}
