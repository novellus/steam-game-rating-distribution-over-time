I would recommend it to any lover of this classic genre. \n\nHowever, it is not without some flaws. The three that stuck out most would be the combat, the 2D animated cutscenes, and (some of) the voice acting. \n\nFirstly, the combat. Personally, I don’t feel that point and click games mesh very well with any kind of combat system. In my mind, it should be about using your brain, not your reflexes. To put it lightly, combat felt very clunky and unresponsive. I ended up actively running from any combat that wasn’t scripted, unless I was grinding materials for the merchants. Even then, when there was any more than two or three enemies on screen it felt very hectic and I found myself constantly taking damage and draining my reserves of potions. This kind of active combat system just seems out of place in a point and click adventure. Going back to the “brains over reflexes” philosophy behind point and click games, if there had to be any kind of combat, I would’ve preferred some kind of turn based encounter system akin to classic RPGs.\n \nSecondly, the 2D animated cutscenes. These were very unappealing. The artistic incongruity between the cutscenes and the beautifully crafted portraits, backgrounds and sprites was jarring to say the least. The first time one played I thought I had accidently alt+tab’d out of the game and some horrible youtube animation had started playing. The characters were unrecognizable. I didn’t know what character had been bribed by the mage until I later entered the tavern and got some complimentary dialogue. I said out loud, “Ohhh, THAT was supposed to be Pug? Really?” They reminded me a lot of the Zelda CDI animations, meaning rushed and done without care. It would’ve been far better and probably far cheaper to just use the portraits and dialogue boxes for those plot points as opposed to these awful animations.\n\nThirdly, (some of) the voice acting. This one is mostly a nitpick. The overwhelming majority of the voice work was great. There were just a few voices that seemed subpar or annoying. However, if it was just some minor characters, I wouldn’t be including this point. The biggest offender in this category is the initiate himself, D’arc. I don’t want to blame the voice actor for this. I’d rather blame whoever was directing him. I feel that he wasn’t given much context or direction in the booth. Many times the reads feel out of place, with a complete disregard for the mood of the situation in his inflections and tone of voice. Most of this could’ve been fixed with some better direction and more takes. A lot of the lines feel like they were the first take, like the actor had just read the line for the first time. This wouldn’t have been a problem at all if he hadn’t been the protagonist, being that the player hears his voice in every interaction with the world or other characters. But I’d like to reiterate, the vast majority of the voice work was great.\n\nNow with the negativity out of the way, I’d like to talk about the many positive aspects of this game. First off is the art. It is absolutely stunning. All of the environments feel alive and unique. The forests feel brimming with life, the town is wonderfully lived-in and the various rooms of the Mage’s Tower are each pieces of art on their own. The portraits, as stated before, are stellar. Especially when compared to ADG Interactive’s past portraits (I’m mostly familiar with the King’s Quest remakes), the vast improvements are evident. Every character has a unique design and it always lends greatly to their characterization. Although, I still think D’arc looks suspiciously like Adam Driver.\n\nNow on to the puzzles. There is nothing better in my mind than roaming around a densely themed world and searching for the answers to roadblocks. Most of the puzzling was satisfying to figure out. My favorite “Ah-ha!” moment in the whole game was how to acquire strong liquor. The use of magic was also a great layer to add and widen the scope of puzzle solving. The more tools in your arsenal the better. However, one nitpick I had (sorry to get back to a negative) was the difficulty of distinguishing certain interactable items and the background. One was a drain, one was a fence and another was a helmet. Those caused me a decent amount of frustration. But overall, this aspect of the game was sterling. \n\nThe story. Oh, the story. I thought I had it all figured out. Get three mcguffins, a story as old as King’s Quest 1, I thought to myself. I even thought I saw the twist coming, but it had me totally surprised. I fell for it hook line and sinker, and I had never been so happy to have been wrong. I could say much more, but I’ll restrain myself.\n\nI suppose I’ve prattled on about this long enough. In summary, although the game has some glaring flaws it proves to be a satisfying revival to a genre so often overlooked. I hope that the developers will listen to the compliments as well as the criticisms of all the lovely reviewers here and take them into consideration for the much anticipated sequel to this marvelous work of art.\nThank you Himalaya Studios.","timestamp_created":1607661839,"timestamp_updated":1607662052,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqoSIqPYCd7P8uAI="}
