    review: 'Tetsoidea Eternal is the first sequel to Fateholders of Tetsoidea, and
      does not improve on the original. The names aren''t quite as stupid and there''s
      no utterly terrible acronyms, but it''s still a distinctly amateur 1.5 hour
      RPG Maker game featuring several stupid names and packed with awful jokes that
      were probably not funny to anyone except the author and their close friends.


      Likewise, the mechanics are similar, a linear progression from one map to the
      next with frequent save points that restore all of your HP and MP, but the combat
      mechanics never reach "interesting" in this one - you have one person who has
      a whole-party regeneration buff, one person who puts a HP drain debuff on bosses,
      one person who is completely generic and never does anything interesting except
      in fights that go so long he builds up 90 TP, and a wizard who blows up random
      encounters once you get her. This didn''t really leave much room for any different
      combat strategies in any situations, unlike in the original.


      Story-wise, it''s still disjointed and aimless, except about some evil scientist
      or wizard who is doing evil wizard science with a crystal. You chase him and
      his assassins across the map, kill him, and then kill a big demon named Diaperius.
      The end.


      Not recommended, and more strongly than Fateholders of Tetsoidea, as I wouldn''t
      recommend this one even if you already own it for some reason.'
