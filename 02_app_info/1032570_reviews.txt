I would pay up to $5.\n\nThe unpleasant: \nCutscenes are unskippable, forcing a 5-minute long exposition backstory that seems to bug the game if you hammer on your keyboard.\ntext cannot be sped up or skipped, \nsoft-lock bugs occurred twice in 20 minutes, \nlimited audio and graphical options, \n\"heartbeat\" sound effect played constantly from the first point of damage onwards, \nmoving up and to the left played an annoying spraying sound that was absent when moving down and to the right, \nno option to zoom out from craft leading to a limited and cramped viewpoint, \n\nThe Pleasant:\nAesthetic\nInteresting concept, didn't get far enough to pass the first dungeon in total (beat the first boss, but stopped playing).\nShip variety\nGood concept for paying to access some trait rooms, while keeping others open by default, adding a meta of storing up \"points\" to afford either health or new trait rooms.\n\nI'm sure there are other positives, but I did not play long enough to see them, the audio bugs, soft-locking, and inconsistent controls frustrated me too much.\n\nI didn't really enjoy how moving and shooting force your ship to orient in the indicated direction. What I mean is that your ship will only shoot forwards, so it always rotates to shoot. However, your ship also always tries to face the direction of movement when you press the direction keys (no built-in strafing). The result is a fight between aiming and movement causing the ship to weeble-wobble-rotate every time you change direction unless you hold down the fire buttons in the desired direction. \nIt's hard to describe, not to my taste.\n\nI appreciate what the devs are doing, I can see the work they've put into the concept, but I do not view this game as worth $10 in its current state. \nI would like to see the early bugs ironed out, movement smoothed out (make the turret itself rotatable separate from the ship, or increase the ship's rotational speed), and slow-scrolling cutscenes made completely skippable. I'm not playing a roguelite for the story :P\nSome more game options would be nice, especially difficulty, enemy spawn rates, dungeon size, and weapon modding.\n\nI cannot recommend this game today, but I would be happy to revisit after a couple updates.","timestamp_created":1559438910,"timestamp_updated":1559438910,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo6zziusCeKnIwgE="}
