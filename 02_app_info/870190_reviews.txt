The story is so beautifully romantic and well written, I couldn't pull myself away from it until I've finished a full route. (Seriously, don't leave the stove on while you play!) Although the story has elements of magic, it is very much a slice of life with a sense of maturity that I don't find in most other otome games. The events in the game are often mundane, with the characters having very relatable conversations about daily life. It makes the story feel very relatable!\n\n8.5/10 - Highly recommended\n","timestamp_created":1548482549,"timestamp_updated":1548482549,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40JKwxOgCfpGeuQE="}
