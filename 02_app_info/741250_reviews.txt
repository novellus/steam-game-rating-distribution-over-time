We finished the first one (Crooked man) already and just recently finished this one.\nThe graphics are nice, at least in my opinion, but one has to like the pixel style. The controls are okay and fairly easy. The first maybe half of the game was amazing and really fun, very different from the first game. Both my friend and I expected the story to go a different way though and think that it lacked something towards the end. There is a character that we expected (and wished) to take on a more important role, maybe be evil etc. The end of the story sadly felt a bit rushed and unfitting for the previous story. \nThe main character is also constantly changing in how they react and think, especially in the last few scenes, which ruined our immersion.\nThe game has a lot of potential and great ideas, not always used up to their full potential sadly, but still very much worth playing.","timestamp_created":1609246401,"timestamp_updated":1609246401,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nuyj1/YCf7C3vgI="}
