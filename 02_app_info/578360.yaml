    review: '[b][u]Game Information[/u][/b]


      "Dark Dimension: City of Fog" is a Hidden Object Puzzle Adventure game. The
      game was developed by Daily Magic Productions and published by Big Fish Games
      Studio.


      "City of Fog" is the first episode of "Dark Dimension."


      Since this is a collector''s edition, it comes with extra features that are
      not available in its counterpart; the standard edition.


      [b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]


      Game Visuals


      I want to mention that the visual for the game is nicely done. The visuals can
      be adjusted in the game''s option menu.


      Game Audio


      I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio
      is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game''s
      option menu as well.


      Gameplay


      There are no game difficulty modes to choose from.


      The notebook keeps track of the progression in the game. Such as story events
      and clues.


      There is no interactive map in the game. The player has to remember where to
      go in the game.


      There is no padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in
      place. The inventory panel does slide up when it is being moused over.


      The hidden object scenes consist of the following: Traditional word lists. Some
      of these hidden object scenes may require little or no interactions.


      The puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of
      them.


      Since this is a collector''s edition game, there is a bonus chapter, it can
      be accessed only after the main story is completed.


      Miscellaneous


      There are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Game''s Strategy Guide;
      Soundtracks; Concept Art and Wallpapers. Most of these extra features can be
      accessed only after the entire game is completed.


      Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay
      value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game''s
      full price value.'
