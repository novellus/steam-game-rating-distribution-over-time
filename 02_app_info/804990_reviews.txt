This could be my fault in not understanding what the developer had in mind but it did take away some enjoyment a little.  Sometimes in these HOG's I come across a puzzle I can't solve without using the skip button. In this game you fail an achievement, no big deal for me but some people will not like this.  This was a pretty game with nice music and a thoughtful story. There is a pet animal that helps you. Nice variety of HO puzzles as well as other types of puzzles to keep you interested. This game not only had an extra chapter but a very short, hidden chapter as well. Seems like a good value for your buck. I like this game and recommend it highly.","timestamp_created":1607995418,"timestamp_updated":1607995418,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2dz/sfYCd5KougI="}
