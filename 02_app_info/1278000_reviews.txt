There's also Flipside Studio, which is still online and free. So this app isn't exactly anything new, except it's geared towards educators. In fact, it is free to educators. \n\nHowever, the rest of us can purchase it on the Steam store and I'm proud to support it. It's a useful tool. I've already had fun playing around with it. You can act the fool as Mark Twain, Abraham Lincoln, Benjamin Franklin, Harriet Tubman, Tecumseh, George Washington Carver, Abigail Adams, and Sonia Sotomayor. \n\nThere are things that I do hope improve or are added. I do hope they make it easier to delete takes that you didn't like. I also wish there were more characters, props, and environments. Lastly, it would be great to have the ability to have multiple characters on screen that you could act out. In fact, even better would be the ability to have online multiplayer for group projects with those multiple characters. \n\nIt's running on the Unity Engine. It ran fine for me on my 1060 GTX. The video exports were fast and easy (I just wish they were mp4 versus webm). I did not experience any issues. Anyways, I'm happy to support developers who made this free to educators. I hope many teachers take advantage of this tool. It sounds like something that would be very fun for the classroom.\n\n[i]Please note: This did NOT work on Windows Mixed Reality[/i]","timestamp_created":1597369584,"timestamp_updated":1597369584,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.640405356884002686","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmLGp9fMCcJeomwI="}
