    review: '"Partial" controller support is right, there''s constant issues with
      it, such as me being forced to move backwards for a very long period of time,
      and having no momentum after some jumps, and up on the analogue stick being
      bound to jump. Until this game gets more fluid control methods for gamepads,
      i don''t think i''ll touch this one for a while.'
