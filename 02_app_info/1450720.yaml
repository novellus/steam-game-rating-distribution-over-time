    developer_response: 'Hi! Thank you for playing Street Massacre.

      We are sad because you were disappointed with the fast playing experience. We
      are working to improve this game. Even more so because most people like the
      game (the fights, the girls, the opponents). We are working on the development
      of more levels and we think that we will probably have a better product in 30
      days. We are learning, and you are our teachers. I respect your right to get
      your money back. However, I hope that you can contribute your opinion in the
      next version that we are preparing.

      Remember, your opinion is very important to us. Happy new year for you and your
      family!!'

    review: "I loaded up Street Massacre.  I was enjoying the beat-em-up action! \
      \ And then, it quickly ended . . . \n\nSTORY:\nThere isn't one.  You pick one\
      \ of two women.  You beat up people in the streets.  That's it.  No intro; no\
      \ ending.  \n\nGAMEPLAY:\nAs mentioned before, Street Massacre is a brawler\
      \ game.  You use punch, kick, and jump kick to defeat your enemies.  You will\
      \ occasionally find a weapon that has limited use.  You fight the baddies for\
      \ four stages.  \n\nPROS:\nI enjoyed the beat-em-action.\n\nCONS: \nStreet Massacre\
      \ is the shortest game I've ever played.  It took me six minutes to get through\
      \ the game.  And I spent two of those minutes looking over the options!\n\n\
      OVERALL: \nIf it were longer, Street Massacre would be a good game.  But the\
      \ length of time it takes to get through it makes Street Massacre earn a thumbs\
      \ down recommendation."
