Instead it requires to keep the right mouse button pressed. Just no.\nAlso, it uses random keys like E or S for actions, instead of sensible ones like ctrl or space.\n\nVisibility: 2/10\nThe illuminated areas are so dark that I can't even see enemies while they are on me. The mage's light is a joke.\n\nLegibility: 1/10\nTutorial texts cause strain because they are too small.\nNPCs texts are even smaller and disappear after half a second. That's utterly ridiculous.\n\nGameplay: 3/10\nWhile there's nothing wrong with old school hack n' slash, having to walk through every corridor/room at least twice, i.e., at least once with each character, is a big freakin' NO.\nIt's a single player game. The other brother should follow, or teleport, or whatever.\n\nGUI: 2/10\nNo save/load. No controls mapping. No font size options. No text speed options. No useful option whatsoever. ESC doesn't work in menus...\n\nI'll stop here. There is a lot to fix before that thing becomes remotely enjoyable.\nBy the way, the unskippable intro is so long and boring that I almost went for an instant refund, before reaching the actual game.","timestamp_created":1593592062,"timestamp_updated":1593592062,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg6TfhPMCcPftkQI="}
