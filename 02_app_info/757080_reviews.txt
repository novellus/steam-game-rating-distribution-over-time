You now manage a theatre all your own and must make important choices when it comes to plays, actors to hire, and factions to please or ignore. Will you survive your first season?\n\nWhile not as, perhaps, hands on like Hollywood Visionary (another great game by Choice of Games - which I loved), it has a unique vibe and feel to it where you can choose to seek the trust of the elite or the everyday man, hold secrets or sell out to help your theatre thrive. The political climate that surrounds such means of entertainment is almost educational in a way for the game and it really allows for you to seek out who you are as a character and test the boundaries of entertainment in the mid 19th century.","timestamp_created":1546645296,"timestamp_updated":1546645296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuMrPjegCerXCtwE="}
