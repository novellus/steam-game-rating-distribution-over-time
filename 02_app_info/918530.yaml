      notes: The Dark Room is a game that does not visually depict any violence or
        gore, but it does describe it in detail to the player. This violence and gore
        is usually directed specifically at the player, and describes the players
        violent demise. In addition, there are themes of death and suicide, and the
        player is sometimes told to kill themselves by the games antagonist. The games
        antagonist is aggressive and will also berate the player.

    review: 'An excellent interpretation of one of my favourite shows ever.

      I used it to introduce 5 new people to the game.

      We played it as a group taking turns in as best an approximation of the real
      experience that we could, and it was great fun.

      We did reach the "end" of the early access after pretty much exactly an hour,
      but it was a good time for the full hour.'
