    review: 'The aesthetics are cute, but this game is extremely short ( < 2 hours
      easy) and the level design choice leaves a lot to be desired.  Only half of
      the control mechanics are explained if that and the game does a terrible job
      with darkness.  Half the platforms are black, which results in a lot of blind
      jumps and when you activate a switch, you have to go all around trying to figure
      out what to do.  The final boss is also very poorly implemented with zero concept
      explanation prior.


      Avoid this one.'
