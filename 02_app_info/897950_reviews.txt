It is a training project that the dev decided to sale. Well... I HOPE he considers it as a training project and not as his masterpiece.\n\nFirst it is very dark, so dark that you barely can see the floor, your character while moving or the enemy.\nThere is no sound and no music, only a sound of a light breeze. Noting. More.\nThe level design is terrible. Absolutely terrible. One of the worst I ever saw. For example a closed door at the end of a loooong path. And the lever to open it at the start of this looooooooooong path.\nTextures are horribles.\nThere are bugs. Plenty of bugs. Such as dialogue that don't start despite of me hurting the key E, such as enemies that stop having a hitbox, such as infinite fall from a pit. And crashes, of course.\n\nOf course, dear dev, you have right to do mistakes because this is the way everybody learn. But, please, DON'T SELL your mistakes.\n\nNasty review for a nasty game.","timestamp_created":1581456962,"timestamp_updated":1581456962,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwncaLm/ACdJLY8QE="}
