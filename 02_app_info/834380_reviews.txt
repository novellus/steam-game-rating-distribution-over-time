Its not the best looking game in my opinion, but the puzzles are tight and logical, and overall I enjoyed the flow of the game. \n\nNot sure how much more I will play, but I feel I got my money's worth for 0.62 CAD.\n\nI would recommend this game, as it was a lot of fun!","timestamp_created":1608507020,"timestamp_updated":1608507020,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrqqfwfYCdb/puwI="}
