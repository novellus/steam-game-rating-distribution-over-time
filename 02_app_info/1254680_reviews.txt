My thumbs down recommendation is specifically for this DLC.\n\nYou get the playing cards, but not the heroes or other card art.\n\nYou also can't do some other things, such as in use the Card Creator with your own uploaded images.\n\nSo, how do you get the heroes and other card art (backs, mats, cosmetics), you can either grind gold, which only seems to be achievable by the single player campaign, as I've been unable to find a match in multiplayer for a game, or you drop more cash to buy what they call marbles.\n\nHonestly, if the game didn't seem so... empty from a player perspective, and if the Card Creator wasn't locked behind another pay wall, then I'd not regret this purchase. As it is, I regret it, and I'm giving my warning to others to heavily consider passing on this, UNLESS you don't care about what's not included.","timestamp_created":1588650116,"timestamp_updated":1588650321,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.627661049365997314","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xoS88fECftrThQI="}
