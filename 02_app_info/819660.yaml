    review: "Total trash. If you are interested in donating to charity, your money's\
      \ better spent just donating to charity, rather than buying this turd of a game.\
      \ \n\nThis game is a total scam asset flip unity garbage. The graphics, sounds,\
      \ and music of the game are actually quite good, but the gameplay is total crap,\
      \ a pile of donkey dung. Games need more than good graphics, sound and music,\
      \ they need also gameplay. That is why they are called \"games\". \n\nThe controls\
      \ and camera is horrible, no inversion options, gameplay is mediocre randomly\
      \ generated crap, with only 1 level in the game. I don't think there is a finish\
      \ line on the end of the level, just the same turrets over and over with randomized\
      \ rocks and tree locations, trying to get a \"high score\", as if it matters.\
      \ There are supposed to be 3 levels but the other two levels say they are \"\
      coming soon\" (which means never.) Honestly this game is an insult to cancer\
      \ patients, if you're going to make a game to help a charity, at least put some\
      \ effort into the d**n game, this is embarrassing. I don't even know why people\
      \ put this kind of crap on steam, it just clutters up the library. Second I'd\
      \ look into holistic healing for cancer instead of relying on the scammy and\
      \ corrupt medical system that overcharges patients, I've heard of people being\
      \ half a million dollars in debt after getting cancer treatment, it isn't morally\
      \ right and its a form of systemic oppression. And also there is no such foundation\
      \ called \"the American Cancer Research\", the closest thing I could find is\
      \ \"American Association for Cancer Research\" so I'm not even sure if any of\
      \ this money is even going to any charity and its probably a scam. If you want\
      \ to cure cancer it starts by not uploading games like this to the steam library\
      \ in the first place."
