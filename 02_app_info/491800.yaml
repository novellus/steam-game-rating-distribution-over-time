    about_the_game: "Across the Line is an immersive virtual reality experience that\
      \ combines 360\xB0video and computer generated imaging (CGI) to put viewers\
      \ in the shoes of a patient entering a health center for a safe and legal abortion.\
      \ Using real audio gathered at protests, scripted scenes, and documentary footage,\
      \ the film is a powerful hybrid documentary-fiction depiction of the gauntlet\
      \ that many abortion providers, health center staff, and patients must walk\
      \ on a typical day in America.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe experience consists of\
      \ three scenes. We begin inside the health center, finding ourselves in an exam\
      \ room with a young woman and a compassionate doctor. The scene fades as we\
      \ travel back in time to follow the patient and her friend as they drive up\
      \ to a health center lined with protesters holding graphic signs and shouting.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThe final scene uses computer-generated graphics. The viewer\
      \ becomes the patient and must navigate a group of intimidating protesters shouting\
      \ highly offensive remarks aimed at shaming and stigmatizing the patient. The\
      \ audio montage, captured from protesters across the country, anchors the viewers\
      \ experience in the reality of what thousands of people across the country face\
      \ during anti-abortion protests outside of health centers."

    review: 'The title of the app is "Planned Parenthood" and it sounds and looks
      like a propaganda piece, indeed. It depicts women in a misogynist way: The actors
      are bad, don''t show much respect for the situation and act as if they lack
      empathy and reason. It would be comical if it weren''t tragic.'
