    review: 'An absolutely fantastic adrenaline buzzed homage to possibly the greatest
      game of the "golden age" of arcade and possibly all time.

      Instantly playable, and easy (initially) to get into blast fest ! that gets
      eye searingly frantic on later waves, (C''mon guys, if y''all want something
      non challenging and relaxing , go play animal crossing!).

      Probably the best pure Stargate/Defender game i have ever played and for the
      asking price, this is the Steam deal of the Year!

      The programmer obviously loved defender/Stargate and boy, does it show.!  full
      of that old school arcade vibe and some nice extra wee touches mark this out
      as something REALLY special for the Defender/Stargate fan.

      If anyone was ever remotely into defender/Stargate as a kid and wants to relive
      those lost schoolboy times of bunking off school and hanging round your local
      arcade (or was that just me?) , then you owe it to yourself to get this absolute
      gem.


      So strap in, grab your controller and get blastin'' !!    Score 10/10.  !!
