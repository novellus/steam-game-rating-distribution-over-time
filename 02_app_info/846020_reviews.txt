I really enjoyed it. Even though the battles were difficult, they made me think about how to win and that to me is great to see in a game. I don't like just grinding to win and this game shows that even if you have good equipment, that you still need to plan before each battle. The story is really cool and the gameplay does something different and I loved it. The visuals and the music are great. My only real problem with the game isn't even something that I can really complain about considering that the game was made in a month. It is that that the game had some really bad slowdown.\n\nI highly recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1573395748,"timestamp_updated":1573395748,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536817073822021484","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyrrsqu4Cc4KU2QE="}
