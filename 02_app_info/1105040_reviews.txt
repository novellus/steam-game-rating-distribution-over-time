Not a full game. Not polished Not worth the money. Would look out for this company since it looks like a pattern of theirs.\n\nI would love for there to be a good game on this theme but I get the impression that this company is making it a practice to ship barely half of a game in a pretty packaging. For what little has been modeled, it looks great, but there is no depth to the game. I like that they didn't go with fixed recipes (that would be pointless to play even) but with the manipulations available, you arguably remove the most fun parts of what should be an alchemy simulations - experimentation and the interaction between reagents. Now you can easily figure out the best recipe for each potion and rince&repeat; update parts as new tools become available. The choice of reagents etc can make for a good tutorial but also means there isn't much to discover. There are also some odd decisions that just make the gameplay less interesting and directly clash with each other - such as the knife sharpening and the highly restricted storage; and annoying seeming 'bugs', such as dried items disappearing over night and the cleaner getting stuck. Missing incredibly basic settings such as mouse sensitivity. Already seen all of the relevant challenges of the game.\n\nWould have liked to see more thought to the gameplay and the mechanics (I think what I do on my own is more fun frankly) and for it to have been developed into a proper game. With the current content, not worth the price, and also don't think these practices should be encouraged.\n\nThe Chemist is probably a better game to try.","timestamp_created":1609225466,"timestamp_updated":1609919247,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491011619567871094","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qcaq6/YCdrOuvgI="}
