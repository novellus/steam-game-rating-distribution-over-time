    short_description: Tricked into joining Chris and Elise on a ski weekend, Dan
      is determined to ruin everyone's fun on the slopes. But when a storm separates
      the three, trapping Dan and Elise together in their holiday cabin, they are
      begrudgingly forced to put their differences aside and communicate with each
      other.
