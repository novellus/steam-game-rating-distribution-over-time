    review: '[b][u]Game Information[/u][/b]


      "Azkend: The World Beneath" is a Match 3 game. The game was developed and published
      by 10tons Ltd.


      "The World Beneath" is the second episode of "Azkend."


      [b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]


      Game Visuals


      I want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely done. The visuals
      can be adjusted in the game''s option menu.


      Game Audio


      I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio
      is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game''s
      option menu as well.


      Gameplay


      There are two game modes to choose from: Challenge and Adventure. Both modes
      do have a timer.


      This is a match 3 game, the objective is rather simple, you have to make matches
      of three or more of like tokens to clear them from the board. There are several
      different types of match 3 styles: "Swap;" "Chain" and "Group." The "Swap" style
      is where you have to switch two tokens either vertically or horizontally. The
      "Chain" style is where you have to link all the like tokens together that go
      in any direction. Such as "Up to Down;" "Left to Right" and "Diagonally." The
      "Group" style is where a bunch of similar tokens are cleared from the board
      in one move. The match 3 style that is used in this game is "Chain."


      There are sixteen different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the
      game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need
      to be completed before they can be unlocked. These are in-game achievements
      only.


      Miscellaneous


      There are five different trading cards to collect. Only three of those trading
      cards are given out by the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the
      trading cards: Purchased from the Steam''s Community Market; Trade with friends;
      Booster Packs and its Booster Pack Creator.


      Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay
      value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game''s
      full price value.'
