    review: "My Jigsaw Adventures - A Lost Story is the sequel to MJA - Roads of Life.\
      \  However, they are separate stories and you can play them out of order.  Took\
      \ me around 15 hours to complete and get 100% achievements using a mouse (13ish\
      \ hours on the bulk of it, extra time on the bonus puzzle).  Difficulty is easy,\
      \ with bigger puzzles and differently-shaped pieces if you want more challenge.\
      \  \n\n- This game comes with 20 story puzzles, 15 special puzzles, and one\
      \ super special puzzle.  \n\n- There are two modes.  One is Normal, and one\
      \ is Challenge.  Challenge sets a timer and you win crowns if you beat it under\
      \ a specific time.  \n\n- There are three shapes of puzzle in story mode: Regular,\
      \ Square, and Arrow.  And you can choose how many pieces each puzzle is in the\
      \ main menu.\n\n\nPretty sure every other review covered that.  I just wanted\
      \ to stay in the loop.  Here's the real review:\n\nNo one is allowed to thumbs\
      \ down My Jigsaw Adventures.  It's a rule.  This is the only adventurous jigsaw\
      \ series I know of that provides what you want and then some.  The music's adventurous,\
      \ the art is great, and it's fun to play as a whole.  That said, the story in\
      \ this game feels simpler than Roads of Life.  Where the story in RoL is jumping\
      \ sharks with dragons, swords, stumbling across the wildest unknowns, all in\
      \ a quest to save the one you love (as stated in the very first scene, I'm not\
      \ ruining it for you), and you're on the edge of your seat screaming, \"What's\
      \ going to happen Next?!\", A Lost Story is more general scenery.  I had trouble\
      \ following the story to this one because some of it seemed detached from the\
      \ art (What was up with the wolf?) and the plot felt sad as a whole.  Sometimes\
      \ the music felt off, too, swinging from chill to SUPER EXCITING AND I DON'T\
      \ KNOW WHY!  This was extra weird because the some of the art in the Special\
      \ puzzles felt like it could've provided a much more adventurous story concoction.\
      \ \n\nThat's not to say the game is bad.  The puzzles are still fun to do, and\
      \ the art is still great.  On top of that, A Lost Story adds in the special\
      \ puzzles feature, offering a whole new set of enjoyment and spontaneity.  I\
      \ clearly had no issues 100%ing everything over here because of how fun and\
      \ chill everything is.  And you can dl the art after you beat the puzzles and\
      \ get the soundtrack for super cheap, so that's cool.  Puzzles!  Woo!  Got it\
      \ for 5 bucks, too, so it's also entirely worth it."
