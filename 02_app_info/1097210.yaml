    developer_response: Thanks for the review! In the current version, cows will start
      producing milk once they have a baby (it will happen randomly if there is an
      adult male and female in the same barn, and some free space for the baby)

    review: Fun farming game,  you have to make things instead of buying which is
      kind of awesome, but I got to winter and still hadn't found a bucket to milk
      the cow, so very little money was coming in so I just started a new game, I'm
      hoping I can figure out how to milk the cow, it would help get through winter
      as well as being able to cook, but I really like the game and its kind of being
      made as we play.
