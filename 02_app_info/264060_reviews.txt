I just start exploring and solving puzzles and I lose track of time.  The world is massive and tightly connected like a Metroid game and the puzzles are really clever, using a wide variety of interesting mechanics.  Exploring and solving puzzles are one in the same, since the puzzles are all about how to get from one place to another by pushing or destroying different kinds of blocks, and you can always rewind time to try different solutions.  The areas are pretty surreal too.  And like any good Metroid-ish game, the map will tell you which rooms still hide treasures, secrets, and doors, so you always know where to look if you're getting stuck.\n\nIf you like puzzle games like Fez, Escape Goat, Escape from Puppy Death Factory, Toki Tori 2+, etc, try this game.\n\nThe only thing I don't really care for in this game so far is the writing.  It's not particularly interesting, and it has lots of typos.  But that's easy to overlook due to the large amount of freedom this game gives you to roam its world with tons of optional treasures to find.\n\nI recommend playing this game with a keyboard rather than a gamepad.  It's fun to play with a gamepad at first, but the inputs get a little too demanding in the late game and it's much easier to move diagonally using WASD than with a joystick.","timestamp_created":1606220842,"timestamp_updated":1606954427,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p9T8kvYCfrydsAI="}
