    review: 'This is a tower defense title, whereby you place building that fire at
      the pirate ships that sail past them on the river to the end. Your objective
      is to sink the ships before they made it to the end. If 20 ships reaches the
      end, you lose.


      There are 5 buildings which you can place, but the game doesn''t give an explanation
      about their capability. There''s a crossbow tower, an antenna-light building,
      a hammer, cannon and a crystal. From what I gathered, the crossbow is a rapid
      fire tower, while the cannon is slower but is effective against larger ship.
      Both the laser and the crystal are more powerful, but the sharp wooden hammer
      inflicts the most damage.


      These pirate ships come in various sizes, the bigger it is, the more attack
      it takes to sink. The more ships you sink, the more golds you earn. These golds
      are needed to upgrade existing building, or construct more building. Unfortunately,
      the game doesn''t display how much gold is needed to upgrade the building. These
      buildings can be level up twice. A max level crossbow can wipe out a fleet of
      ships very easily, and when you have several more of these maxed level buildings,
      you are practically invincible. In fact in my first gameplay, I was so overwhelming
      powerful, I went through more than 10 waves of ships without doing anything
      much (the ship waves seems to stop getting more powerful after certain waves,
      so they got sinked almost as soon as they appear)! I ended up quitting the map
      to the main menu because it was going on forever, and I see that the rest of
      the maps are still locked.


      Speaking of maps, there are only 3 playable maps, 1 of which is only playable
      from the start. In other words, this title is severely lacking of content too.


      This game make use of content in terms of VR capability too. you can shift the
      map up/down left riight with the trackpad, but you can''t scale nor rotate the
      map. The VR support brings nothing to the table for this game. The background
      just keep going too and it gets rather repetitve.


      Due to these reasons (unbalanced gameplay, repetitive, lack of contents etc)
      I am rather regretful to say I can''t recommend this title. If you wish to see
      what I mean in this review, check out my gameplay video of the first map below
