Immediately noted that this DOES NOT support my Saitek X52Pro stick/throttle set. I find nothing to change that. It appears that it only works w/rodent & keys. Maybe some of y'all that use console-type control thingies will have better luck. The grafx are decent on my 2020 model homebuilt gaming PC. So far, it looks like it MAY be a fun game, but for me, a long-time flightsim/gamer using a nice controls setup, I'm already wishing I didn't buy it. I'm a dumba$$, I 'spose. Anywho, gotta go fiddle w/control-keys setup. Grrr... Recommended? Nope, at least not yet. Dagnabbit.\n  I'll play w/it a lilbit more, til my patience expires, and finish this review.","timestamp_created":1596946082,"timestamp_updated":1596946082,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.450017780065536499","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwje3Z6PMCf4qpmgI="}
