At all, except the screen resolution which doesn't do a lot for graphics quality. \nThe game has no lighting and the textures are just plain colors, which isn't bad for the style but everything is so dark. \nThe movement is spongy and the mouse sensitivity can't be adjusted. \nThere are no tutorials whatsoever, you are just thrown into the game without a menu or anything else like that.\n\nI have let it run for five minutes just so I can write this review. It's not even worth the 99 cents.\nIts literally unplayable.","timestamp_created":1569766535,"timestamp_updated":1572737859,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.747390806674957275","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42+eel+4Cdq6L0wE="}
