Its easy to pick up. Don't let all the pen options and whatnot overwhelm you, you only need half to create some amazing pieces. Coming from drawing on paper, its a bit of a challenge to get use to, but still, its great. It works with most art pads, (mine is the artist pro 12, which OpenCanvas  nearly feels made for--as will pretty much all pads), it will always detect your pen properly, and it is easy to made slight details and edits to make your art great. Its amazing for those of you, me included, who want to draw anime, as it almost feels natural. A great buy, never crashes and its juts overall fun!","timestamp_created":1609805271,"timestamp_updated":1609805271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/eH35/YCeL3GwAI="}
