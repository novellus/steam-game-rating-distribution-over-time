Myself coming from Nex Machina and Pacman 256. I needed another high scoring nostalgia type of game. And this is where the Bounty comes in. This is not your ordinary RPG game. It's a high scoring RPG. A humorous one at that. This is described as a Dragon Quest type of game. Which could be true but I've never played those. But this game reminds me of nes classics like Zelda, Final Fantasy and Uncle fester's quest(music wise). The music is really good in this game. Really captures the feel of the 8 bit era. The game is not super hard but challenging enough. The puzzles really challenge your common sense. I can even use a Dog whistle to signal a partner for my battle. Overall. It's a fun game. I recommend playing this especially for $4.99. It's really worth it.","timestamp_created":1518075483,"timestamp_updated":1518075483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t7KWuuECf86mmAE="}
