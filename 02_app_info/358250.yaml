    short_description: What's green with red spots, has suction hands, and has an
      overbite like Bart Simpson? Of course, the answer is Cosmo! Cosmo is a young
      alien on his way to visit Disney World with his parents. That is, until their
      ship is struck by a blazing comet, forcing them to land on an uncharted planet.
