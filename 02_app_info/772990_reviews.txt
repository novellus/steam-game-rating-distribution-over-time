I gave this a chance to understand why this was a waste of both time and money. I understand this more after completing the game.\n\nFirst of all, this game has not much to offer than just a walking simulator with a relaxing music theme. The voice acting is very bland where the pronouncing of certain english words are done in a really bad way. It's alright if the company itself is east european, but the voice actress has too many pauses in the sentences which ruins the mood of being interested in the actual story.\n\nThe story itself isn't bad but it lost its touch because of the lack of exploration and the monologues was unclear in the context of the case the female narrator is telling us. I wish I liked it more.\n\nIt's a okay walking simulator overall, but could've been much better if better voice acting and more exploration. Play Firewatch instead, which has more to offer than this straight forward walking simulator.","timestamp_created":1596741523,"timestamp_updated":1596741523,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ448LN4vMCdKfpmQI="}
