    about_the_game: "The core objective in Billion Road is pretty straightforward\u2014\
      travel all across Japan and earn more money than anyone else. You earn money\
      \ by landing on property squares with investment opportunities, like a sushi\
      \ restaurant in Ginza or an animation goods store in Akihabara. After you invest,\
      \ you\u2019ll have to wait until March rolls around for those investments to\
      \ pay off. In the meantime, be on the lookout for errant monsters that may shower\
      \ you with riches...or throw a wrench in your plans! You can also earn extra\
      \ money by landing on item squares, which can either help you reach your own\
      \ goals or simply ruin your rivals\u2019 plans. If you finish the game with\
      \ the most money...you win!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1. Brains, Bravado, and Lucky\
      \ Breaks! Dice and random events will help decide your fate...but you\u2019\
      ll also need to invest wisely, take calculated risks, and rely on the whims\
      \ of unpredictable monsters if you want to become Japan\u2019s next billionaire!<br\
      \ />\r\n2. Over 30 items and 50 monsters! You\u2019ll encounter dozens of items\
      \ and monsters, each with their own effects. Use them to push your opponents\
      \ around, ruin their investments, and generally make their lives miserable.\
      \ But be careful, because while they may help you earn money and pull ahead,\
      \ they can also make bad purchases or investments on your behalf. This can change\
      \ the game at a moment\u2019s notice, so study the monsters well to make sure\
      \ you know when to walk away, and when to run!<br />\r\n3. Multiple Modes Means\
      \ Maximum Mayhem! Tournament Mode is a single-player version that lasts for\
      \ 30 in-game years, while Skirmish Mode is a quick multiplayer experience that\
      \ lasts a mere 36 months. Whether long or short-term, it\u2019s sure to get\
      \ the adrenaline pumping!<br />\r\n4. Show Your Friends Who\u2019s Boss! Play\
      \ with your buddies locally or play online!<br />\r\n5. There are hidden playable\

    review: "it is not even richman...the game is actually very boring after a couple\
      \ of games because there is very little decision making \n\n1. monsters are\
      \ almost the same, there is nothing new to explore\n2. there is only one map\
      \ and it is not very big either\n3. followers are too powerful, so whoever reached\
      \ the goal gained a HUGE advantage\n4. there is actually no strategies about\
      \ buying properties either because the revenue is sooo low\n5.game is low and\
      \ same music -.-!\n\nit is not worth $20 at all, maybe $12"
