    review: 'I''ve only played through 1 ingame day/night cycle so far, however the
      dialogue and characters are interesting, and witty. There seems to be multiple
      systems put into the game that will be fun (the fishing minigame is pretty cool,
      cant wait to try to fill the fish exhibit in the museum)


      Overall seems like a lot of potential for relaxed, low stress fun.


      Anyone who likes Harvest Moon, Animal Crossing, Littlewood, or Stardew Valley
      should find a lot to like here.


      I plan on updating this review as I play more, and especially once the game
      hits 1.0.'
