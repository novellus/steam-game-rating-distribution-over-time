    review: "!OBS! Dane bias\n\n+The name applies historicaly names after naval tradition.\
      \ But the KDM flag is incorrect, the Navy used/uses a swirl tail version.\n\n\
      +Ships may repair faster than in your average IRONCLAD game, this is also the\
      \ first time I have seen vessels fighting fires succesfully.\n\n+The games are\
      \ often on sale and cheap when they are.\n\n-Sinse I happen to run out of ammo\
      \ a lot... you would expect the crew would be smart enough to bring more pr\
      \ gun... can't sink enemies without shells.\n\n-There simply aren't enough shell\
      \ onboard your average gunboat to destory medium warships. The game may easily\
      \ feature ship sections or other features which makes it impossible to destory\
      \ one ship just with pure stern chasing.\n\n-The AI is stupid... the only real\
      \ danger are ships with pivot guns, everything else you can outflank and peper.\
      \ This is common in all IRONCLAD and IRONCLAD II games.\n\n-Once you've played\
      \ your first battle, there really isn't more to the game... sure you can sail\
      \ around endlessly till you can afford Monitor ships but that's it.\n\n-The\
      \ game handles poorly, loading a saved game might crash it, getting a note from\
      \ Steam will \"darken\" the screen. a darkened screen will freeze/crash the\
      \ game if you check other open taps. \n\n-Window mode doesn't work correctly.\n\
      \n-The game is full of technological hiccups.\n*Enemy ships are able to accelerate\
      \ and deaccelerate as they please\n*Damage seems to work at random (could be\
      \ armour)\n*Clouds from impacts appear randomely in the air rather than on the\
      \ ships.\n*Although cannonballs were/are prone to bounce on water. The game\
      \ seems to give a 2nd opinon to a lot of shots and let you hit, even if the\
      \ splash was far away from an enemy ship."
