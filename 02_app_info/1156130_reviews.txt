The graphics are what you see in the trailer, and presumably there are animals. But in my two attempts, including one after a reinstall, I would hit countless invisible walls which kept me in the mini area I guess the developer does hint at in the description.\n\nAlso, you'll be jumping a lot of the tiniest bumps in the ground. Maybe that's meant to simulate being in the park, but it was frustrating. I managed to find and collect the trash, but if a bird was on the first map I never saw it in over twenty minutes of searching. \n\nIt's OK if you want to snap a few scenery pics, I guess, but the rest of the mini maps don't unlock until you find the elusive bird. I don't know if the asset didn't load or I just missed it. Also, this game really needs optimized. Something with these graphics should run smooth as silk, even on a computer from the 90s.\n\nI honestly can't recommend this game, even at the current price of $1.99 USD.","timestamp_created":1592768605,"timestamp_updated":1592768605,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tIWa7PICeJayjwI="}
