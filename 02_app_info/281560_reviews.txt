The game itself felt unfinished with no storyline in place. \n\nThe game has very awkward controls, with even more awkward camera angles which were fairly hard to change. The dwarfs themselves moved very slowly, taking longer than it should to complete certain tasks. The game overall just felt unfinished, the tutorial was decent though sloppy in some aspects, being quite confusing in the actual objectives. \n\nOne of the major downfalls for this game is there is no way to hotkey actions. This required the player to constantly click tiny, and I mean tiny, action buttons with their mouse, which gets quite tiresome after a while.\n\nOverall, it was confusing and awkward. The game has an amazingly interesting concept and could be taken further and improved, to make the game so much better. The state it's in now, it feels sloppy and unfinished.","timestamp_created":1453533142,"timestamp_updated":1486175666,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":26,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.777869999408721924","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9Z++g9oCcPf4Tg=="}
