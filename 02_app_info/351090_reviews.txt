The theme is definitely its biggest strength- the artwork, simple story, missions, and items all tie together very nicely and make the game feel more engaging than your standard abstract card game. The story is very simple, just a few lines before each chapter, but I think it's best that way- it could drag if it attempted to go deeper. The power-ups are fun and mitigate frustration from bad luck. It's easy, even on hard mode, but it sets up a relaxing vibe. It's also short but has high replayability. Based on the length, I'd recommend waiting for a sale, but even at full price, Regency Solitaire succeeds at what it sets out to do.","timestamp_created":1609926317,"timestamp_updated":1609926317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vMLF6/YCdpb6wAI="}
