    review: '25 December 2020:  I have had the subscription for 5 days. It is not
      usable. I have tried to talk to STEAM, they say the problem is not of their
      creation and to contact help.ea.com. When I try to message help.ea.com they
      will only speak to "active subscribers." The phone numbers they have listed
      do not work. Even though I am unable to use the subscription STEAM will not
      refund my money because I have had the "potential" to use the subscription.


      UPDATE: It is now 04 January 2021:  Finally, after sending a copy of my receipt
      to support@swotor.com they replied and changed my status to subscriber. They
      were also helpful in pointing out that people in the EU are entitled to a refund
      within 14 days of subscription, even though STEAM says no. They are are working
      to resolve the problem which kept me from subscribing with them originally.
      I will continue to do it through them but not STEAM. This will be ONLY a platform
      for keeping a library of non-MMO games which I own. I have lost my faith in
      STEAM to maintain a balance between profitability and how to best serve the
      customer. Shame on you STEAM.'
