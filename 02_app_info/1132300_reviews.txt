The controls are way too loose and slippery for my liking tbh. Also I feel having camera controls would really help with navigating around.\n\nThis also feels like playing it has no purpose. Maybe an online leaderboard or something? Idk.\n\nCan't really recommend this right now tbh. Probably gonna refund.","timestamp_created":1567245196,"timestamp_updated":1567245196,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505353331565856934","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1567251269,"developer_response":"Thanks for you feedback. Glad you like the idea.\n\nI'll consider adding a leaderboard and mouse/controller sensitivity setting option to improve control for I only tested this game on my own mouse and Xbox Controller."}],"cursor":"AoJwrvvF8+wCd4y20QE="}
