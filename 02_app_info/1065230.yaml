    about_the_game: <img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1065230/extras/logotrn2.png?t=1595147625"
      /><br>This is my first indie game on Steam. I played a lot of puzzle games before
      and found the puzzles in these games are limited to the game itself. I want
      to bring a different game experience to players, so I designed some puzzles
      which need players to find the answer out of the game itself. It makes our real
      world part of the game, but is our world real? <br><br>The game has seven endings,
      corresponding to seven achievements. Complete all levels to unlock the first
      achievement, and for other endings, it requires players to find out the secluded
      room to unlock.<br><br>Finding hidden secluded rooms in the game is also a great
      pleasure and achievement of the game.<br><br>I want to use this game to expose
      the relationship between human and the God, where the future of mankind is,
      the relationship between human and nature, the final end of mankind and the
      way home. Everyone is the performer of their own destiny, life, old, sick, dead,
      love, hate, parting, and so on.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1065230/extras/end.gif?t=1595147625"
