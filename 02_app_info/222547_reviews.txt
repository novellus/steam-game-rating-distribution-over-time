All you get is one livery and three scenarios, and the one career mode scenario they made is completely stupid. The train doesn't even have a headlamp, but they expect you to drive in the dead of night for those 1000 points. It's impossible to see! How are you supposed to complete a nighttime scenario when you don;t have a light?!\n\nIf you have the Class 421/423, skip this one entirely. To my knowledge, nobody uses it in third party scenarios, so just skip it.","timestamp_created":1598241666,"timestamp_updated":1598241666,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvY6oj/QCdcuznQI="}
