    about_the_game: <strong>Cross Pixels</strong> is a collection of over 350 handcrafted
      Picross Puzzles. It is a grid based puzzle game solvable through logic. Other
      names for this kind of puzzles are Nonogram, Paint by number or logic square.
      The concept is easy to learn and well explained in the optional tutorial. Use
      the numbers on every line of the grid and  reveal the hidden picture.<br><br><strong>No
      unlocking required.</strong> All the level are sorted into different sizes.
      Start with whatever you feel is appropriate for your skill level. Solve levels
      with sizes of 5x5 up to 25x25 or even bigger ones in the workshop. Sizes up
      to 50x50 are possible.<br><br><strong>Make your own puzzles.</strong> The included
      Editor allows you to easily create your own puzzles and share them with the
      community. All levels are automatically checked if they are solvable and if
      the solution is unique. <br><br><strong>Community:</strong> Cross Pixels integrates
      the Steam Workshop. This allows you to both play all the community created levels
      and to share your own creations.<br><br><strong>Triangle Game Mode:</strong>
      In addition to normal rectangle puzzles Cross Pixels offers Triangle Puzzles
      with which even experienced Picross players can challenge themselves.<br><br><strong>Player
      Comfort:</strong> We tried our very best to ensure that you can enjoy your time
      with Cross Pixels. Features like &quot;undo&quot; allow you to easily correct
      mistakes. Next to the cursour the current number of blocks placed in the line
      is displayed to avoid unnecessary counting. Several colours allow you to try
      out solutions if you are unsure, without the risk to forget where you had already
      placed blocks. Adjustable autocomplete and coloured numbers features allow you
      to configure the game behaviour to your liking and reduce unneccessary busy
      work.<br><br><strong>Hint:</strong> If you ever should get stuck our hint function
      may help you by pointing out possible steps and explaining the neccessary concepts
      to you. Hints are given in multiple stages. First you'll find out where to look
      and then learn how to deduce new cells. You don't have to use it but if you
      should ever need it, it will be there for you ;D<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><br>-Over
