      I could add a slightly different option that would allow you to move your bat
      ''further out'' giving you a wider range of movement - similar to the ''Shunt''
      powerup. You would be able to switch between the current bat position and the
      new bat position on the fly, say with a button press. I would probably increase
      the size of the bat as well. This mode could only be enabled when no other powerup
      affecting the bat is in place.


      The controlling of the ball you mentioned is activated when you hit the ball,
      with the right joystick used for directing the ball. You can only do this for
      a period of two seconds OR until the ball hits another object. I am going to
      change this so you can still control the ball after it has hit other objects.


      When you are shooting the bullets are can be directed by moving the right joystick
      in the direction you want them to go. There is still room for improvement with
      this though.'

    review: 'At time of review (Aug 2020) this is currently early access. I''m really
      enjoying the concept and the style but at the moment there is a significant
      playability issue. Each player simply has too little to control. You can only
      move your bat in a very short range above your blocks (essentially three positions).
      Sometimes you can redirect the ball in flight (the rules on this are a little
      unclear) and sometimes you can shoot. Most of the time is spent watching the
      ball bounce around and waiting often for quite a long time before it hits you.

      To put it into perspective I played a 4 player round with my two daughters and
      no-one in slot 4. The game took a long time to finish and slot 4 came very close
      to winning. The outcome was very nearly random.

      I think if each players bat was given freedom of motion about the whole quadrant
      of the play area and/or some ability to tilt, it would improve the pace of the
      game and the level of interactively dramatically. This game definitely has promise
      if that defect is fixed.'
