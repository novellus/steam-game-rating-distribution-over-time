      \u3063\uFF01&quot; is a unique VR rhythm game (RhythmGame) based on the operating\
      \ modes of various popular rhythm games on the market. The game has been licensed\
      \ by SQUARE ENIX's well-known IP &quot;Aozora Under Girls!&quot;, so we have\
      \ created a special customized &quot;Ginga Kagekidan - \u653E\u8AB2\u5F8C\u304F\
      \u308B\u30FC\u305A\u3063\uFF01&quot; for VR users. The game is a special single\
      \ version. The song used is supervised by Japanese music teachers. The Japanese\
      \ style is strong and the most distinctive feature is that the rhythm is very\
      \ strong. As the music rings, the mood will be taken away by the rhythm of tension.\
      \ Even if it is delicate and delicate, the song that is laid-back on holidays\
      \ is like strolling on the street, running and jumping.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      Join us and enjoy!"
