It brings that first time of playing a new IP that is certainly exciting by virtually imprinting a strong sense of a space base environment as the main theme of the game.\n\nGameplay is much more forgiving compare to grand titles like portal 2, its less fustrating as it challenge first timers with interesting puzzle but not to a point you really stuck or have to search for youtube playtrough for it. The game has a solid average 2hr+ play trough time for those who speed run and up to 5hrs+ for regular and casual players.\n\nThe game mechanic utilize refreshing \"body transfer\" ability much similar to the game soma in theory except that you can instantly experience different perspective at an instant, with that it would be up most interesting to see if the game would use this feature to its advantage for any possible dlc or a sequal with this as its intention.\n\nStory isn't a strong point of this game, its kept simple which is most likely the developer's intention but basic enough to follow trough breadcrumbs of each section to unfold the story as it goes along.\n\nControler is left much to be desired. At first its disorienting to not have total camera freedom by just binding the free view on to a mouse, having to constantly hold right mouse is a bit of a tiring option especially when the game encourage viewing around for potential interactive object. The need for an option to change control bindings is desperately needed. On a side note the game is thoughtful of allowing players to review the key function option just at the bottom left corner.\nOn a possitive side note the key is real time responsive and the transition and move around is very smooth.\n\nOption to be able to switch between windows screen and the game is instantaneous and best of all it doesn't lag which is always a welcome option as I multi task a lot of stuff and most of the time I would get load lag even when modern games offer \"window screen\"\n\nOverall I give this game a solid 7/10 among most of the other game that is most likely coming from indie studio base on graphics, audio, control, presentation, story and potential. Its one of those hidden gems that isn't discovered due to tons of games bombarding the steam store everyday and just so happens that this game pop up a brief moment on my store page. Worth supporting for the product it delivers with that price tag.","timestamp_created":1517639194,"timestamp_updated":1517639194,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2YqWreECcsntlwE="}
