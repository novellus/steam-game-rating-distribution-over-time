    review: "I picked this game up years ago and it is still one of the only original\
      \ titles that sees play in my library (other than space pirate trainer of course).\
      \ My wife absolutely loves this game and whenever I ask her if she wants to\
      \ play a VR game this one is the first thing out of her mouth. \n\nI haven't\
      \ seen any words from the developers but I think the game has received many\
      \ themed updates that keep it fresh. For example: around christmas time you'll\
      \ see special santa babies and reindeer and in October you'll find spooky vampire\
      \ babies and such. For a cheap price this cute arcade game really is a hidden\
      \ gem it's a shame it didn't get more popular, this thing is perfect for convincing\
      \ your wife or SO that the 1k$+ purchases you made for VR were worth it.\n\n\
      Funny story: When she first played it, she wasn't that good and would actually\
      \ get sad but not from failing levels, she got sad because she thought she was\
      \ accidentally drowning babies. 8/10 would watch my wife have an existential\
      \ crisis about helplessly throwing babies in the ocean while trying to convince\
      \ me she wanted to save them again. Highly recommend if you like cute things\
      \ and want a cheap game with great mileage."
