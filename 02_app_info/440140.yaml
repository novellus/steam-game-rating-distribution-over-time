    review: There is a lot to say about this film. First of all, I would like to mention
      that this is a film that wasn't made by a big name studio. That doesn't mean
      it's bad though. I feel like the story and concept had and still has an amazing
      amount of potential. However this is a film that was made on a low budget, and
      it suffers from that sadly. I will say that there is a certain charm about films
      made on low budgets. For instance, in the beginning, the movie you are greeted
      with the main character and a nice long stargaze followed by a car ride. The
      reason that this is so amazing here vs big name productions is the camera position.
      Because there is a cameraman instead of some drone with a camera attached to
      the thing it just feels more human. This combined with the music in the background
      allows the piece to bleed with emotion and feelings I can only get when stargazing
      myself. That charm is what made this movie for me. As you would expect this
      fades away as the film goes on, however, the fact that it's there at all is
      an amazing thing that big names like Disney can't even do. Overall, a neat little
      film worth checking out, just don't expect that much.
