    review: "Don't go into this expecting \"the one\", i.e. the only painting tutorial\
      \ you'll need. That tutorial doesn't exist. You need to see a bunch of different\
      \ ones by different tutors to fill out your skills, and each tutor will add\
      \ a new aspect to your knowledge.\n\nRobotpencil's plus here is that he's teaching\
      \ the student not to waste time being fussy, or sweating details to the point\
      \ that the soul of the created face is lost. What's important is that you come\
      \ out of your work with a picture of a fictional person who seems real because\
      \ he/she is looking back at you, and drawing every pore in that face doesn't\
      \ really add to that sense. So, he's not going into facial proportion, texture\
      \ or colour. In fact, he's teaching you a valuable lesson to just forget about\
      \ that and trust your eyes, and to use the major advantage of digital painting\
      \ to put the facial features into a layer system at first so that you can grab,\
      \ move, rotate and transform these things as you go. \n\nSome of what he's doing\
      \ is only possible to recognise when you've seen someone else explain principles\
      \ in much greater detail. On the other hand, I've watched videos with exhaustive\
      \ detail before, to the point where the lesson loses flow and I want to go to\
      \ sleep! Ultimately, you learn more from a demonstration that focuses on a limited\
      \ number of concepts than one that tries to dump everything into your head at\
      \ once. Each approach has its value, of course, and you'll need both sides to\
      \ form a good foundation for your understanding.\n\nOverall, a good video at\
      \ a decent price. I certainly took something new away from it, and I've sunk\
      \ quite a lot of money into other tutorial videos over the years."
