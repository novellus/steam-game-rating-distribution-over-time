The developer confirmed that he didn't know why his page showed this support (he'd never tested it) and didn't mean for his page to show it and said he couldn't remove it.   Could never get it to work, the game stopped being supported later and it disappeared into my list of VR games to be forgotten.   Until I got my Rift S.\n\nSomething told me to boot this back up and try to see if the Rift S controllers were any better with it.  You wouldn't figure it would be, but I got curious.  Turns out it worked much better, although clunky for some reason.  I found out on an old youtube comment that the controllers detect touch on the buttons in addition to pressing them, which complicates things.  So if you went into the Steam controller settings for this specific game (Steam VR options, Devices, Controller Settings, then pick the game from the list on the right) and DISABLED the touch feature on the A, B, X and Y buttons (I also did this for the triggers as well, just to be safe), then the game works!\n\nIt's a fun game, easy to learn, has some humor in it. and the ability to move around and change distance from the map in 3rd person gives it a cool atmosphere, almost like you're the character and the DM.  If you like D&D type dungeon crawlers I'd recommend it for the $10 if you have a Rift S or a Vive.   \n\nTLDR (short) version - You can get this working with the controllers on Rift S with some minor adjustments in the settings and it's a fun dungeon crawler for ten bucks.","timestamp_created":1567320616,"timestamp_updated":1567320616,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwxNXl9ewCdcC90QE="}
