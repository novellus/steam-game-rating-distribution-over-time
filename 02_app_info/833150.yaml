    review: 'I initially recommended this game, but I''m going to have to change it
      after playing it for a bit more...


      A nice simple game (you''re a fish eating other fish) - easy controls, nice
      aesthetics, promising upgrade system.


      However, the defining drawback is that, no matter how good you are, the game
      is far too grindy to get most of the upgrades, which effectively locks out the
      end game. The reward/upgrade system really limits what you can play without
      feeling like you''re playing a chore.


      EDIT: Having played a bit more since my review (which I stand by), I have two
      suggestions to improve the game (and would change my review to a recommend).
      (1) Improve score to pearls ratio. (2) Increase the conversion rate options
      between pearls and gold (100 is too small when you''re expected to farm 1000s
      of pearls).


      EDIT 2 (this will be my last, I promise): Having played a bit of survival now,
      I''ve noticed two things, which I think are bad for the game. (1) As you buy
      upgrades for your fish, your rewards get WORSE each game. (2) There is zero
      difference in reward between survival mode difficulties.


      It''s a nice game, but the demoralising grind hampers the purpose.'
