      /><br><br>Curse of the Sea Rats is a stunning platform adventure in the 'Ratoidvania'
      style! Lovingly crafted with hand-drawn animations and gorgeous 3D locations
      it charts the epic journey of four crew mates, turned into rats by a pirate
      witch, as they attempt to regain their human bodies.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1453900/extras/lavishart.png?t=1608630187"

      /><br><br>Beautiful 2D, hand-drawn animation breath life into the game's characters
      - inspired by the likes of Disney and Don Bluth and reminiscent of the golden
      age of 2D platforming action. These combine seamlessly with detailed 3D environments
      and enhanced by light and shadow to create a 2.5D platforming experience of
      incredible quality.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1453900/extras/freedom-exploration.png?t=1608630187"
      /><br>Chart your own progress though a huge, non-linear game world as you attempt
      to track down the pirate witch who cursed you. Shipwrecked on the coast of Ireland
      in the 18th Century, you'll need more than just your swashbuckling skills to
      forge your path to freedom.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1453900/extras/fourplayable-characters.png?t=1608630187"

      /><br><br>Whether you play alone or with up to three friends, there are four
      playable characters to chose from - Douglas, Buffalo, Akane, and Bussa. Each
      bringing their own unique fighting styles to the adventure to help you get the
      better of both enemies and the environment!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1453900/extras/enhance-upgrade.png?t=1608630187"
      /><br>While each character has their own strengths and weaknesses, you'll be
      able to improve their abilities as your adventure progresses - unlocking new
      special skills, boosting your offence and defence, or unlocking powerful magics!<br><br><img
      src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1453900/extras/huge-adventure.png?t=1608630187"
      /><br>A labyrinthine network of hundreds of pathways, rooms and discoveries
      lay before you, in a substantial quest of over 12 hours. Can your master each
      character's abilities, find all of the game secrets and unlock all the multiple
      endings?<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1453900/extras/wishlist_illustration.png?t=1608630187"
