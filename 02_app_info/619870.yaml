    review: 'Tres bon jeu de plateforme qui fait immediatement penser a MARIO BROS
      ! les graphismes sont presque identique et la meme jouabilite en plus ! Ca fait
      penser aussi un peu a Wonderboy pour le cote non lineaire et les monstres rencontres
      ! bref un tres bon jeu assez facile d acces pour tout le monde mais qui rescelle
      mille et un secrets ! (un peu court comme jeu mais quand on aime...)

      Un bon achat !
