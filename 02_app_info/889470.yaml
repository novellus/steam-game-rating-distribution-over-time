    review: just got this game again to give it another try. nice new screen page
      in the option tab there was volume graphics and a few other things to ajust
      but there was no controls option for keyboard and mouse / gamepad / steering
      wheel. so on entering the game there is some vehicles a truck a bus and some
      cars and a monster truck but on entering the game the player just kept moving
      around on the map and i could not find anyway to sort the controls usually you
      set some deadzones so ye didnt get to try any vehicles out maybe give the devs
      some more time to work things out.
