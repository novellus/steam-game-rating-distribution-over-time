    review: A deceptively simple game that actually is fun for everbody, including
      first time users like me. Controls are excellent, and the different enemies
      pose a variety of challenges, while still being exceedingly satisfying to eliminate.
      This is a polished game that avoids all the pitfalls of Early Access. More content
      is coming, but you don't need to wait to get your hands on a great VR game.
