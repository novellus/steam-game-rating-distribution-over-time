    short_description: Decades since we last heard the Gods spoken. The evil soon
      broke into our world with the full power, causing it to tremble. The world had
      changed. Colors left us for many centuries, and a new powerful entity dwells.
      We divided. The matter of blood has never been so important before, as it is
      now.
