This was the last and most advanced production Mustang. I think it kicks! If you like climbing like mad, this will sometimes give you 3500+ fpm up to about 28K ft.  I've never tried it with all of the the fuel tanks and externals full, though. Do you really need that much juice for local flights? During  approaches it will have a tendency to crab to the left. There is a knob to trim it or you can just hold a bit of right rudder. You get 6 or 7 different paints, but they're all similar.  The Merlin engine has a sweet sound.  Highly recommended.","timestamp_created":1556405020,"timestamp_updated":1556405020,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.651898741722106934","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1vy9sOoCfvKNwAE="}
