      \ thrilling game is as open with its goodies as it is creative in its card design.\u201D\

      \ variety of game modes and a solid reward structure complement each other,\
      \ and the draft format is hard to beat if you're a fan of limited-style gameplay.\
      \ If you're looking for something off the well-worn digital card game trail\
      \ that has a great foundation and lots of room to grow, check it out!\u201D\

      \ takes one big step toward Hearthstone from Magic: The Gathering. It looks\
      \ and feels a lot like Hearthstone in practice, but brings back things like\
      \ 'instant' cards that can be played during your opponent's turn, mana cards\
      \ with specific colors for each faction, decks with any number of factions mixed,\
      \ and declaring which of your minions will attack and then letting your opponent\
      \ choose their own blockers. The key here is Eternal has managed to make all\
      \ these things quicker and more satisfying than most other digital CCGs that\
      \ try them, not sacrificing depth for accessibility.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/the-9-best-digital-card-games-that-arent-hearthstone/\"\

    review: 'New edit:

      You know what, this [i]is[/i] a good game. (I finally recommend it.)

      I don''t know when I changed to thinking this was good, but it is an awesome
      game.

      Nominate this as a good game, and if you want extra cards go watch Eternal streamers
      on Twitch (you might just get a free pack).


      Hearthstone/Magic The Gathering.

      It''s okay.

      Just, why would I spend time on it?

      Playing it doesn''t make me warm and happy on the inside.

      There is no final destination to reach, and declare victory.

      I''ll just go play my other games.


      EDIT:

      I would spend time on this because a friend plays it.

      Yup, only had three hours on this thing to start...
