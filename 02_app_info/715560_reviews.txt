As much of an \"open world\" Eastshade claims to be, it's actually gated behind fetch quest after fetch quest. No, you can't swim or even wade through knee-deep water, there's an invisible wall in the way and you need to go get a raft. No, you can't stay out in the open at night, you'll need to buy a coat to prevent hypothermia. No, you can't sneak across a toll bridge that nobody's guarding, there's another invisible wall in the way and you have to pay up. No, you can't just buy a map, it's another reward from another fetch quest. Okay, so I'm supposed to go from point A to point B in this game, but why the hell am I walking so slow? Even the sprint speed isn't all that impressive. Guess what, you need to buy a bicycle for that. Where do you get that? It's actually from a vendor inside a city called Nava, and you need 3 recommendation letter things from people OUTSIDE Nava for security reasons. No, not INSIDE the city, OUTSIDE, because clearly outsiders are so trustworthy that a guard has to be stationed between them and the city. Seriously, who wrote this?\n\n Alright, maybe I could use some console commands to increase the walk speed, but the problem is the command SetWalkSpeed only works when I'm walking backwards, so now I'm practically sprinting backwards while still walking at a snail's space if I want to go in any other direction. Okay, fuck it, how about flying? The flight speed on the other hand, was way too fast for indoor traversal, forcing me to drop out of flight mode every time I enter a building. The flight controls are not that great either, with no buttons bound to ascension and descension, relying on the first person view angle to climb or descend.  \n\nThere are other issues I have with this game as well. Apparently it's not possible to rebind any keyboard or mouse controls, nor could I view what the controls are bound to, which is a really weird design decision. The presentation of this game is also a mixed bag. While objects generally look pretty from afar, the plants will look like they're made out of paper if you look closer. The NPC model designs are already terrible enough, but the talking animation really freaks me out. The voice acting is also a bit hit or miss, ranging from pleasant to downright annoying. The drawing mechanic isn't very fleshed out either. Pressing E to take a screenshot and drinking tea for some additional effects feels a bit lackluster, and it feels more like photography rather than painting.\n\nAll of these issues culminates in a very frustrating experience, and I could no longer bring myself to play this game anymore. I understand that this is an indie game, but the progression system is so infuriating that it is impossible for me to enjoy what would otherwise be a world that truly fits the definition of \"every frame a painting\" under most circumstances.","timestamp_created":1610195479,"timestamp_updated":1610195479,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4naXI8/YCfKrlwQI="}
