    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Avoid Midair Colllisions!</h2>The seventh version
      of Airport Madness offers players a 3-dimensional air traffic control experience,
      from a control tower perspective.  You get to sit in a virtual swivel chair,
      able to pan around the airport with the drag of your mouse.  Choose good weather
      or bad, adjust the tower height to your preference, then do your best to manage
      jet traffic into and out of five different real-world airports, with more airports
      coming soon.   Listen to human pilot voices as the aircraft obey your every
      command.  Watch as the animated windsocks react to gusty winds. Scan your radar
      screens for potential conflicts between aircraft.<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/445770/extras/concorde.jpg?t=1489877546"

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">It feels real!</h2>Our terrain is built from real-world
      earth data.  Airport designs are based on real-world layouts.  Game play has
      been designed by real-world air traffic controllers and commercial pilots.  Even
      the aircraft flight characteristics are highly realistic.  Watch as the airplanes
      actually raise their nose during the takeoff rotation, and during the landing
      flare.   Sounds are authentic.  We've added the rumble of an aircraft's takeoff
      thrust, and the whine of a jet engine as it spools up at the gate.<h2 class="bb_tag">Airport
      Madness 3D is a game you've got to play!</h2>We've worked hard to compare our
      air traffic control game to that of 3D simulations that are currently for sale
      elsewhere, and what we feel everybody wants is a game that's easy to grasp,
      lots of fun, and highly addictive.  Airport Madness 3D is all of these.  <br><br><br><img

    review: "[Gameplay]\n\u2610 True fun, a must-have game!\n\u2611 If this is your\
      \ genre, go for it.\n\u2610 So bad, its actually funny.\n\u2610 Total waste\
      \ of your time.\n\n[Story]\n\u2610 Simply brilliant. They should write a book.\n\
      \u2610 Fine, for sure. It was given some love.\n\u2611 There is one, but it\
      \ adds nothing really.\n\u2610 As bad as a cheap sunday afternoon movie.\n\n\
      [Grind]\n\u2610 There is no grind. Just play!\n\u2610 Only if you hunt achievements.\n\
      \u2611 Yeah, okay, its kinda grindy.\n\u2610 Like twerking in a club, oof.\n\
      \n[Graphics]\n\u2610 Amazing, need new underwear.\n\u2610 Good, such graphics!\
      \ very wow.\n\u2610 Meh, average shizzle. but its okay.\n\u2611 My 3yo niece\
      \ can do it better\n\n[Sound/music]\n\u2610 As if angels piss in your ear.\n\
      \u2610 In balance. It adds to the game.\n\u2611 Meh, its not ear rape at least.\n\
      \u2610 Turn it off and play spotify.\n\n[Moneys worth]\n\u2610 Worth every munnies!\
      \ Buy twice.\n\u2610 Fair price actually, go get it.\n\u2611 Kinda expensive,\
      \ buy at sale.\n\u2610 Overpriced for what is really.\n\n[Developer]\n\u2610\
      \ 10/10 eP!C D3vz!\n\u2610 Professionals. Trustworthy.\n\u2611 Good so far,\
      \ no complaints.\n\u2610 Scamming money grabbers imo.\n\n[Bugs]\n\u2610 None\
      \ or fixed at light speed.\n\u2610 Some, but often quickly fixed.\n\u2611 Some,\
      \ fixes take a while too.\n\u2610 Bug infested bag of leftovers."
