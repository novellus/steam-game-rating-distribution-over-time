This game came out in 2017, they only have the early access title so they can take your money and give you no reason to complain. I mean they did say its early access and that the game may not progress any further. Even though it came out in 2017 and the last update or dev comment is from 2018. But sure, still early access. Just get rid of that stupid nonsense and be honest. This game was probably popular for a bit and the devs did a cash grab and abandoned it. Don't waste your time or money with this game.","timestamp_created":1601235608,"timestamp_updated":1601235608,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwnIzF6PQCc7+/pAI="}
