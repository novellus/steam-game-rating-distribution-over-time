But, in it's current state it is in. It needs to be fixed. The controls are a bit weird, but the mechanics and the hand sometimes glitched inside the gun. But the worst part is if the gun had fallen on the floor, it will clip through and sink into the ground making it impossible to reach to complete the tasks. Wished that the devs are trying to find these glitches and errors and fix them.","timestamp_created":1609191090,"timestamp_updated":1609191090,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532467544078826904","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9ezQ1fYCdpqevgI="}
