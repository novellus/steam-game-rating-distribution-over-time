Every time you want to play, even once, you have to sit through the entire story line. You can't skip, you can't fast forward, and it defaults to \"Yes, explain the lengthy tutorial which also cannot be skipped or fast forwarded\" by default, so if you're bored to tears and spamming to try to skip ahead, you're punished by having to repeat the tutorial over and over again. This means, even if you've sat through the tutorial 47 times before, you absolutely must sit and read every line of text as it slowly, and irritatingly fills the speech bubble, then carefully, and with calculated strikes, hit the mouse to continue the story so you can play for 11 seconds and lose.\nThen the game starts, and you can't win. The dealer literally never busts, I don't think it's even possible, so you lose constantly. I love blackjack too, probably my most favorite card game on Earth, but this game is truly terrible in all regards.\nI simply don't have the patience required to sit through the entire story 500 times to unlock anything, I regret everything, and this game is unplayable trash as far as I'm concerned.\n\nTL;DR - Not worth putting 5 minutes of story for 30 seconds of gameplay, just browse the screenshot gallery.","timestamp_created":1609100598,"timestamp_updated":1609100598,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr9P30vYCf4PvvQI="}
