All the crazy proportions from the characters look great. I love the way this plays with scale. Telekinesis is pretty awkward, but the game has no fail states so just take your time and enjoy.\n\nHonestly feel so spoiled to get to play this. I have no idea how they justified making it but I'm glad they did.","timestamp_created":1609542611,"timestamp_updated":1609542611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g+aN4PYCcvLFvwI="}
