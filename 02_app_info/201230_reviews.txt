The amount of content in this game is overwhelming. You can play for many, many hundreds of hours and barely scratch the surface of all the different things that you can do, see and achieve.\n\nOf course there is the straght-line play, go from lvl 1 to 100 as fast as possible then do raids for great gear and accumulate riches that will allow you to play as a subscriber without paying real money, thats a perfectly viable playstyle, but there is an ocean of content that you will miss. In this game, it is worthwhile to visit all zones, levels and content during any time and level of your character. The whole world is being put to use, not just a small percentage as you level or when you reach max level.\n\nThere is a lot of easily available filler content, mostly aimed for fast leveling or casual fast play, but there are also tons of hidden stuff and elaborate quests for the players that are more curious .. for players that can stop dead in their tracks, and just take one moment to look around them. Players who like exploring and investing more effort into straying off quest lines or not simply just power level.\nMore often than not, the rewards for pursuing some of the strange questlines found in remote areas are quite surprising and with such an immense, ambient sprawl of activities to do from the moment you start and all the way up to max level - is to me what an \"MMO\" or \"Open World\" should be.\n\nIndeed, not only is the game very lengthy but also, broad. Playing Everquest 2 is like getting lost in a jungle. No matter where you decide to go and what you decide to do, you will find adventure....or adventure will find you as the case may be.\n\nThis game offers lots of content for every taste.\nYou want to solo from start to finish and still get great gear and do dungeons? No problem, game offers plenty of ways to do just that.\nYou like direction and hand-holding, gps quests and casual stuff? Lots of that in the game.\nYou like to break your head with difficult quests that require some inquisitive thinking, time and dedication? Unforgiving challenges that makes the rewards all the more worthwhile? Hundreds of hours worth of this kind of content.\nYou like crafting? You'll be overwhelmed, crafting is insane in this game, its more content in the EQ2 crafting sphere alone than in the whole worlds of other mmos and depending on your attentiveness while crafting - the quality of the product and outcome will reflect in your performances. For instance, if you fail to flatten a bubble in the iron of a blade or miss out on cooling it in time, the blade may turn out Crude in quality.\n\nThe character progression and roleplaying features has no equal. Just the alternate achievement skill-trees alone are way and beyond the whole progression system of other games. You decide how you divide the experience gained between the character leveling and the AA (alternate advancement) level, which works like talent points. There are over 400 talents and lots of trees to work out as you go. Personally i like to channel all the exp into AA, that way i get quite overpowered at low levels, which for me is quite satisfying. \nFor instance you can be a very powerful level 20 with lots of talents, who can tackle higher levels simply because your character is much more trained than a higher level might be. There are many parameters to your characters. Skills has to be trained to perfect techniques ect. \nSpeaking of talents though, there are different talent trees in every class too and you can earn talents from all kinds of directions, from solving puzzles to simply exploring.\n\nThis game was never very appealing to the younger players, nor to the ones that only come to talk random stuff in world chat or expect the game to be like most other mmo out there, as is the case in other mmo that are different from the typical themepark mmo.\nAs a result the game seems quiet and tranquil, which for me is a good thing. I dont need a lot of players jumping around aimlessly in the start areas and talking smack ( i call them cheerleaders because thats what they really do in these games). Sadly there are a lot of players who need these cheerleaders to consider the game as being \"alive\" and not \"dead\", or every mmo game in existence to run the exact same way Wildstar or World of Warcraft does - many whom i assume has rated this video game as Negative on Steam.\n\nThere is a lot of poison thrown around on the internet regarding this game, many of whom I have opened conversation with only to discover they know not what they talk about or have even played the game to any extent at all.\n\nThere are a lot of big and hyped features being released in the more popular mmo titles today, that have existed in this game since the very beginning .. it is a shame because many players will miss out on one of the most underrated, best mmos ever made, way ahead of it's time and definitely the biggest one yet.\n\n\n- Scrawny old veteran since 2005.","timestamp_created":1485086150,"timestamp_updated":1503072621,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.630734801292419434","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nIKH+90Ccp2dcA=="}
