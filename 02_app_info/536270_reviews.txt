The graphics are very nice and the exploring and learning part are kind of fun...at first.\n\nThe Bad: The game controls are not very good, particularly for combat. (Who throws a help tip screen up right in the middle of the screen during combat?) I experienced glitches that cause clan member avatars to get stuck several times and restarting the game was the only way to get them unstuck.\n\nThere were also some game mechanics that didn’t make any sense. Like clan members not being able to feed themselves or sleep if required unless directed by the player.\n\nMy Take: I spent one night away from my settlement in the jungle with two members of my clan and on retuning none of the clan members I had left behind had slept, eaten, or had a drink since I had left the day before. Seriously?! You have to be there to feed and rest the clan members you aren’t in immediate control of if you are away from the settlement for any period of time? Even the adults aren’t smart enough to eat and sleep on their own. And, there is not option to switch back to them unless they are close by. If this is how it was 3 million years ago I'm amazed that our race didn’t die off from starvation and sleep deprivation!\n\nI found the game got very grindy and boring, very fast. I seemed that all I was really able to accomplish each day (in game time) was to feed and water all the clan members, do a little socializing for mating purposes, and if time permitted gather and stockpile some extra food. No time for exploration or much of anything else at all. After almost 50 days I felt like I had done nothing but gather food. (Maybe I should be playing Farming Simulator instead.)\n\nThe poor combat mechanics was another thing. The controls are counter intuitive. In addition, a help tip screen pops up and obscures what is going on in the middle of combat. Before you can read and react the fight is over and your clan member is either maimed or dead. In two separate encounters three of my clan were killed; one immediately, the others later from injuries I didn’t know how to treat, or couldn’t figure out how to treat in time to save them. This pretty much put an end to any reasonable chance at my clan’s future.\n\nI have to say that for something that looked like it would be a lot of fun, I was very disappointed.\n","timestamp_created":1609869526,"timestamp_updated":1609869837,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rIju6fYCdNDiwAI="}
