      /><br><br>PolyGangs: A 3-person sandbox world action game in LowPolly style.
      A gangster simulator in a large American city. Heater will be able to choose
      whether to become a felon or an undercover policeman. The action of the game
      takes place in the fictional city of Lopolis, where gang wars are commonplace
      and the police always start shooting first.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1480060/extras/gif02.gif?t=1609855291"
      /><br><br>In the game, we have the entire city at our disposal, along with the
      surrounding areas that we can freely explore. The game world is full of places
      and situations with which we can interact. As a gangster, our task will be to
      take over local businesses, robberies, trafficking in illegal goods, killings
      and various other criminal activities, often with slight frostbite and a good
      dose of humor.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1480060/extras/gif03.gif?t=1609855291"
      /><br><br>In the game we will be able to choose which gang we will be a member
      of, we will choose from: Italian, Chinese, Irish, Russian, Jewish, Mexican.
      We will start the game as a minor criminal and lead the gang during the development
      of the game. It will be up to the player to choose a criminal path or to investigate
      the gangs as an undercover policeman.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1480060/extras/gif04.gif?t=1609855291"
      /><br><br>The main elements of the game are driving a cars, chases, shootings,
      assaults, assassinations, the development of our hero and other gang members,
      and the management of the criminal business. We will be able to use various
      vehicles from motorcycles, through passenger cars to trucks, we will have a
      wide range of weapons, from knives to firearms to rocket launchers. Our hero
      and gang members will be able to gain new skills such as speed, strength, resistance,
      and charisma.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1480060/extras/gif05.gif?t=1609855291"
      /><br><br>The world in PolyGangs is very dynamic, full of characters who often
      have very unpredictable behavior and physical objects that react to collisions
      and interact, introduce an element of chaos and fun.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1480060/extras/gif06.gif?t=1609855291"
      /><br><br>The production will appear on Windows, Android, and IOS platforms.'
