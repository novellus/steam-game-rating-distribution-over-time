    review: "O jogo tem uma qualidade gr\xE1fica e sonora muito boa,porem  o que mais\
      \ faz falta mesmo \xE9 o tutorial, uma ajuda em indicar para onde o jogador\
      \ deve ir, grande parte do tempo se perde vagando pelo jogo sem saber para onde\
      \ ir,e isso acaba frustrando bastante. Mas fora isso o jogo \xE9 foda!"
