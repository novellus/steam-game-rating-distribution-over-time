    about_the_game: Le Grande Story:<br>The border of the universe is some serious
      stuff, they protect it much more seriously than the tavern in Krivodanovka.
      It's no secret that the border of the universe is protected more seriously than
      anything inside it! After all, the parallel worlds begin, the mischief goes
      all the way. So, you will protect this border, or so you thought. Aha, not a
      chance! You will play the LEGS from another dimension, no less. They are so
      huge they could have <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/716230/Galactic_Lords/"
      target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"  >galactic lords</a> for lunch if they'd want
      to! They've decided to cross the line of the universe and nobody stops 'em.
      What for? Who the heck knows, maybe it's just out of curiousity what's all this
      guard about. Well, in general, we'll see in the game who will win!<br><br>Contents:<br>-
      6 bosses<br>- 16 procedurally combined appendage types<br>- 4 different enemy
