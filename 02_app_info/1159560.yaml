      Citadel, home of the Brotherhood, you'll be able to recruit new and old allies,
      as well as improve your equipment and skills, before deciding which mission
      to perform next. With dozens of unlockable weapons with different natures and
      behaviors, preparation before a mission is crucial and may be the difference
      between an overwhelming victory and the bitter taste of defeat.<h2 class="bb_tag">Improved
      formula</h2><br>Ziggurat 2 has been redesigned from the ground up with the goal
      of improving over the original in all areas, and offer an even smoother and
      faster experience, with quicker, more intense sessions, and more interactive
      and fulfilling progression.

    review: "Rogue like FPS games with varied characters and abilities, I can't get\
      \ enough. \nBlazing fast combat, lots of character/weapon/amulet unlockables/upgrades.\
      \ Extra game modes for one hell of a challenge.  9.5/10 I want LOTS more of\
      \ these types of games\n"
