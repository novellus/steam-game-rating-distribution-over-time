    review: 'Low-budget visual novel.


      Well, more of a short story. As is common with this genre, graphics and music
      serve to back up the story, but that''s not what the work is spent on. The technolopgy
      is established an unexciting: you read forward until you come to choice, rinse
      & repeat. So the appeal of this VN stands and falls with the writing. And I
      didn''t connect well to that.


      Part of that is because I want a story to show me something new; but this game
      asks me about the protagonist''s life on his deathbed, and the choices I made
      in the first few minutes in 2015 are then reflected back to me as important
      moments in that character''s life (1995, 1975, 1955, 1943), and only the 1955
      moment actually developed some character -- but ends on a note of deus ex machina.

      I didn''t really understand this character''s life from this game, and because
      of that, it remained uninteresting.


      I would not recommend this game to others; mostly because I couldn''t predict
      who''d like it. I think that''s actually ok: no author expects to connect with
      all of their potential audience. It''s ok to like this game. But I did not.'
