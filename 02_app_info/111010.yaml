    review: 'This could be a great Hidden Object Game but it has issues with pixel
      finding and determining what to do next.


      Unfortunately the resolution is not great and can be problematic clicking on
      items in the Hidden Object Panels.  Have experienced issues with items not being
      able to click on due to being behind items (even though it sticks out), and
      some items assume it is wrong item only to be sent back by the help - and many
      clicks later it is activated.


      This version of the clockwork man is not as linear as the previous version and
      is more like an adventure game, making it near impossible to determine what
      needs to be done when.  reminds me of the old adventure games where you would
      wander around for hours clicking on everything in each scene and trying to utilise
      and combine all inventory items just to proceed.'
