Not to mention a lot of endings and different ending variations that gives this a high replay value. It was enjoyable and addiction to the end.\n\nAdmittedly I was a bit taken back by the artwork, but it grew on me and I find it quite nice. \n\nOverall a nice game!\n","timestamp_created":1577432978,"timestamp_updated":1577432978,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpaKVo+8Cdp6w5wE="}
