There are so many options and I started to see less and less ways of figuring out the right one. It got tedious, which was compounded by the rough QoL of the sliding. Experimenting takes forever because there's SO MUCH sliding to do. You also can't drag to slide and worse, you can't undo moves. \n\nThere are six islands. I finished the first three normally, but I just used a guide for piece placement on the entire last half of the game. That way I just had to do the sliding part, which I actually liked.","timestamp_created":1592711757,"timestamp_updated":1592711757,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zJfB6vICe+ugjwI="}
