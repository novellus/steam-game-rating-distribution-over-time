A bit. If you want to get all the endings this will make that experience less painfully long.\n\nHyperdimension Neptunia Re;birth 2 is a solid game that I enjoy quite a lot, though I don't feel comfortable suggesting the purchase of this DLC because of what it really is.","timestamp_created":1587039613,"timestamp_updated":1587039613,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54703831672668457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hNa7wfECd4acgQI="}
