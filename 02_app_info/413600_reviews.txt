Not much of interest, as this movie tediously shows.\nThe ideas are nudged your way but never fleshed out. You never get the satisfaction of getting any more insight. It's just concentraited weirdness that hints on something being fundamentally amiss with out naive understanding of the fabric of reality, but never goes to explain how eldritch horrors relate to it.\nThe protagonist just... doesn't care enough. One would think that with a life so seemingly empty, she'd jump at the first opportunity to sate curiosity and embark on an adventure, but she never does. Unless her hand is forced by immediate causes in her environment, stuff doesn't really bother her to stay awake at night or... do much of anything.\nI guess many such anticlimactic stories \"happen\" to unsuspecting denizens of fiction; it's just that content creators don't usually \"report\" back to us on these.\nI barely got my money's worth out of getting this... I bought it for $0.56 :|.\nOn a positive note - I enjoyed the toast scene. It had no real impact on the story, but there was something satisfying about watching (and listening to!) the protagonist handle toast in a very brighly lit, immaculate kitchen.\nIf you've ever shouted \"No, don't go there!\", \"No, just ignore that!\", \"No, turn around and just leave!\" at overly inquisitive horror characters, this is the movie for you.","timestamp_created":1471535698,"timestamp_updated":1471535698,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhZqXz9YCf7ysXw=="}
