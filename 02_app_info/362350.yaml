      puny heroes. </h2>The best-selling indie card game has arrived to Steam! Boss
      Monster is a dungeon-building card game that challenges players to become the
      ultimate villains: video game bosses. <br><br><strong>Thousands of players</strong>
      around the world have enjoyed the paper version of the game, but now Brotherwise

      world!<h2 class="bb_tag">What is Boss Monster?</h2>If you''ve ever wanted to
      stomp on an upstart plumber or send your goblins and ghosts out to haunt some
      heroes, then Boss Monster is the game for you. Sporting retro-inspired pixel
      art, and paying homage to classic video games and geeky pop culture, Boss Monster
      immerses you in the role of the video game boss as you use Room Cards to build
      a dungeon which must entice worthy heroes, then slay them.<h2 class="bb_tag">What
      is the Digital Version Like?</h2> Digital Boss Monster is a straight conversion
      of the tabletop game. You''ll be playing with virtual cards, but everything
      about the game has been designed to be as authentic as possible. <br><br>Of
      course, the app auto-calculates damage and treasure values, letting you take
      advantage of rapid readout treasure counts in your and your opponents'' dungeons.<h2
      class="bb_tag">What are some of the features in Digital Boss Monster?</h2> <ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Play against up to three AI opponents in solo play. <br></li><li>Challenge
      other human opponents online. <br></li><li>Play with ALL of the bosses, rooms,
      and spells available in the base game ...including rare out-of-print cards!
      <br></li><li>Explore new &quot;digitally-enhanced&quot; cards: four rooms, three
      new Bosses, and a new spell that all take advantage of the digital platform,
      allowing stats and treasure values to change as you play (coming in future expansions).
