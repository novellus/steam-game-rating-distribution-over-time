People became sicker and sicker as agro chemicals poisoned their water supplies while fisheries suffered as the lakes, rivers, and oceans were poisoned.

Protests got bigger and bigger and spilled over into suburban areas as well and degenerated into city-wide riots and looting.<br><br>Peak violence happened when the Jodon faction launched a limited nuclear strike against the Tydroid corporation’s main production city, Berlin, in order to satisfy public outcry that was flamed by a disinformation campaign from the Yonic corporation, Tydroid’s largest competitor.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1445600\/extras\/nuke.jpg?t=1604164243\" \/><br><br>Rather than continue the violence on Earth, the various factions and megacorps launched strikes against each other’s satellites in order to disrupt communications and push their own narratives.<br><br>The situation had become desperate, and in 2247 the 12 factions formed a discussion group called “The Houses” to bring an end to the worldwide violence.
