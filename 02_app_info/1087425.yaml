    review: "This season 2 pass is very good. There are many jutsu that people want\
      \ in this Season Pass. In Season Pass 2, there is also a new Title that makes\
      \ the Title in Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker increasingly diverse. My advice\
      \ may be to multiply more characters, Jutsu, weapons, titles, and costumes.\
      \ So that in this game more and more players with characters are made from their\
      \ creativity. I also hope that there will be characters who don't exist in this\
      \ game to become VR Masters. Hopefully there will be Konohamaru Sarutobi, Mirai\
      \ Sarutobi, or Asuma Sarutobi to become VR Masters so they can get the \"Sarutobi\
      \ Clan\" Title. And also I hope that there will be Kaguya Otsutsuki, Hagoromo\
      \ Otsutsuki, Hamura Otsutsuki, Indra Otsutsuki, Asura Osutsuki, Toneri Otsutsuki\
      \ so that I can use Jutsu from the Otsutsuki Clan and can get the \"Otsutsuki\
      \ Clan\" title. \n\n\nI will wait for DLC Season Pass 3. I hope there will be\
      \ Shisui Uchiha in Season Pass 3, we need more jutsu from the Uchiha Clan in\
      \ \"Attack Type\" for our character. And also please add missions in VR Missions,\
      \ so that players can enjoy playing \"single player\" mode"
