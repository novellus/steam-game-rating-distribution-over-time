You might find this very fun. \nLater you'll unlock passive abilities which let you spend resources, which are gained from linking gems, to affect the board. (Clear lines, etc.) But a lot of the cards can also perform this function.\n\nThe dev also seems like a really nice person and is still working on the game and has made good changes over the period I've played the game.\n\nSome may be thinking \"10 bucks? That's a bit much for a match 3 game.\" but the card game and RPG stuff in it make it worth 10 bucks easily, I think.","timestamp_created":1606693554,"timestamp_updated":1606693554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9cCZi/YCfq/EtQI="}
