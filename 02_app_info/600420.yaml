    review: "This game has something that modern games seem to lack, and it isn't\
      \ just the nostalgia speaking when I manage to pull 12 hours of gameplay out\
      \ of the game.\n\nIt's whacky and at the same time it also feels realistic in\
      \ an archetypical way. It is simple to play and opens up at a good gradual pace,\
      \ introducing new complexities only as you master the previous features presented\
      \ to you. \n\nI like the aesthetic design, and the way that the characters are\
      \ portrayed, since it stimulates an archetypical expectation while also reinforcing\
      \ the fact that it is a video game where you're meant to have fun, meaning that\
      \ doesn't take itself too seriously.\n\nWhat it is kind of lacking is replayability,\
      \ after completing all the missions and having \"won\" in freeplay mode, there\
      \ isn't really anymore to explore, except from completing the game on the hardest\
      \ difficulty, which I'm not the type of person that cares about.  For a $6 game,\
      \ I wouldn't expect any replay ability either, and for $6 dollars I don't expect\
      \ the replayability to be there, like I would with a $200 title, e.g. Europa\
      \ Universalis IV with DLCs.\n\nTechnical stuff:\n\n- I played it on Windows\
      \ 10 without any issues, at my native resolution. However, the game automatically\
      \ down-scales, but I did not find that disturbing to my experience, and the\
      \ game probably looks best at it's intended resolution.\n\n- Scrolling around\
      \ the map by using the mouse at the screen edges is very fast, had to click\
      \ on the mini-map or use the arrow-keys.\n\n- The steam overlay doesn't work\
      \ in the game at all."
