    review: "This PUZZLE game is all about automatic trading. It is fun watching ships\
      \ sail into port and leave hopefully doing what you wanted. If not rewrite the\
      \ instructions and try again!\nPeriodically you have to hone the trade routes\
      \ if your money is vanishing. Sometimes the prices change, making another port\
      \ a better one to sell at or buy from. \n\nI like to have only one or two fast\
      \ ships to free trade/explore the options/smuggle, while the rest zip about\
      \ by themselves, hopefully making hay while the sun shines.\n\nIt is easy to\
      \ group ships into a convoy so that you can escort a vulnerable capacious slow\
      \ transport.\n\nTurn based combat takes some getting used to but can be fun.\
      \ (It works better than Endless Legends). As you buy more ships then the attacks\
      \ seem to lessen and there is a higher probability that your automatic ships\
      \ in the vicinity will be able to join in the fight! This improves the odds\
      \ considerably for that one lone ship.\n\nIt is amazing when you are caught\
      \ short, with no options and only two of your ships sink all six of theirs.\
      \ YES!\nI like that it isn't all a forgone conclusion. Maybe you can get away\
      \ or bribe them (you coward ACTUALLY AN ACHIEVEMENT) OR fight and get sunk.\
      \ Upgrading your Captain and the ship will help too.\n\nSmuggling is laborious\
      \ because of the interface and cannot be done on auto but it is fun and lucrative.\
      \ If the odds are less than 100% you can win or lose big. How much of a gambler\
      \ are you? \n\nWhen trading: if you only check the headline price before you\
      \ set sail then you can be disappointed when you arrive and attempt the trade\
      \ and they don't want most or even any of your goods. I don't remember ANY of\
      \ the other games giving you a warning before letting you continue with a poor\
      \ sale - a nice touch! Size of the port is important for trading quantities\
      \ (and smuggling too).\n\nBuy shares or fail at the game. I tend not to invest\
      \ enough and being too cautious hinders me later in the game. Others sagely\
      \ advise borrowing early to make investments but when I tried that I failed.\
      \ I didn't realise that I should have continued until the oh so 'bitter end'\
      \ (an appropriate nautical expression relating to the anchor chain) to gain\
      \ the achievement instead of restarting the game.\n\nGetting your own mining\
      \ camp/facility adds another twist to the already established world economy\
      \ - a new cheap FREE super producer. Many of the trade routes will urgently\
      \ need fine tuning now!\n\nIt is a strange game where your role seems to be\
      \ to make money by trading however you usually have to set up some permanent\
      \ loss leader routes to kick start a port's economy. Next set up a warehouse\
      \ to snaffle those lucrative goods to splice into your trade routes or free\
      \ trade with.  \n\nThere is a lot to this game. It doesn't feel like the other\
      \ sea trading games. In Port Royale 2 for instance, I played for hundreds of\
      \ hours, ALL manually trading. I was able to do all of the missions to get all\
      \ of the player owned new cities manually. It just wouldn't be possible with\
      \ this game. You have to study what is happening to succeed. Look at the industry\
      \ tab. If something is pink then you will need to deliver the missing resources\
      \ to get rid of that problem and free the log jam in the production.\n\nMost\
      \ cites can be stimulated (at a price) to produce most goods. This makes it\
      \ a huge puzzle. \nIt is best to help the cities of your 'own' nation and ports\
      \ that you have shares in their economy.\n\nPlays fine on Win 10 with a 1060\
      \ card.\n\nI nearly forgot that there is a bug which sometimes makes it difficult\
      \ to control the speed of the game. You may not want it to be permanently zipping\
      \ along at full steam ahead. Even if all is well and it is plain sailing: the\
      \ spacebar will pause and unpause the game. A godsend.\n\nYou probably shouldn't\
      \ write a review late at night while drinking wine but Hey Ho - its Xmas."
