The story has been lackluster in this series for a while but here it's especially shallow. The point-and-click puzzles make no sense at all, involving collecting arbitrary items for various magical locks and spells. Just click everything with everything until it works. Deduction won't help you.","timestamp_created":1597446014,"timestamp_updated":1597446014,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww/jM9/MCePu/mwI="}
