    review: 'This has proven to be an excellent enhancement to the overall FSX experience.  While
      it is the case that FSX provides a manually navigable map that is perfectly
      usable, the Moving Map add-on provides a whole new level of detail, providing
      a larger size map, but also more readily navigable and with key data regarding
      airports and navigation components much more accessible.  I particularly like
      the interface, which is no-nonsense and arguably beautiful due to its simplicity.  Also,
      the maps themselves, particularly when displaying regional or national views
      are beautiful in themselves and a joy to view.


      From my experience, it is the case that FSX needs to be running in windowed
      mode, rather than full-screen, for the Moving Map to be fully accessible.  However,
      with a relatively modern PC on a dual screen arrangement, this is absolutely
      possible with, in my view, no significant cost to the overall FSX flying experience.  The
      Moving Map appears to be part of a larger suite of cross-platform flight simulator
      products available on a stand-alone basis from the website of the add-on developer.  While
      that suite is actually very good value, the Moving Map component available on
      a stand-alone format on Steam is even better value, particularly for someone
      like me who is more of an amateur simulation pilot, currently confining myself
      to pan-European cross country flights in light aircraft using Victor Airways
      and VOR navigation.  However, even as I make the step in due course to jets,
      Moving Map will likely remain fit for purpose.'
