    review: 'Little reminder: The screenplay is a SCRIPT. This means it''s written
      in script format, not novelised and certainly not ''a movie'' as a friend of
      mine assumed haha.

      That aside, I am more than happy to purchase this to say thanks to the Brotherhood
      for the fun I got from the game.

      Nice to have the backgrounds, but I have to confess, I was hoping for a little
      more... That said, it''s all just extra stuff for the sake of getting SOMETHING
      for giving a bit of money to the devs for the game. Generally, I think it''s
      fair'
