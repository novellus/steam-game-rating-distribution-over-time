      KINGDOMS XIV.<br><br>[Situation]<br>Shu had established the rule of Liu Chan,
      and Wu barely maintains the scale of their Force. But both don't have thier
      best officers. On the other hand, Wei is in the process of falling apart. The
      first one able to ready sufficient Force would likely be the victor.<br><br>[Scenario
      background]<br>A Shu without Zhuge Liang. A Wu with their government in continued
      turmoil. There was no longer any Force capable of opposing Wei. However, the
      guardian of the young emperor, Cao Shuang, had also seized power, leaving Wei
      in a mess as well. Feeling a sense of danger, Sima Yi claims sickness and retires
      to his home, waiting patiently for his chance. And now perhaps, another time
      of change was fast approaching.
