    review: 'This game was hyped like crazy by a gaming blog I followed a few months
      back. I thought I''d give it a shot, but it turns out it''s a simple, pretty
      boring take on a pseudo-snake game, where you simply use WASD to mow strands
      in a line. If you turn the difficulty up enough, a dog will impede your progress
      only because you run him over and splatter blood everywhere, hindering your
      vision to see where to mow next.


      It''s not fun, the formula is boring and in just 10 minutes I encountered all
      the enemies through the harder difficulties and felt unchallenged and unsatisfied.
      I''m overall pretty angry at how hyped this game got, there''s just nothing
      to it. This is something I''d expect to see included in a crappy Bundle Stars
      $1 bundle, not $10 retail.'
