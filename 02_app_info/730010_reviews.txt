Unfortunately, this game is absolutely riddled with bugs and it's not worth playing. This game is extremely inconsistent with its shuriken physics, but the main issue is the  hand tracking is always broken. Move to a level, and suddenly all shuriken are flying backwards and you can't fix it. There's a reason it's so cheap, and that's because the developer knows how awful it is and hopes people won't refund a one dollar game. It's not worth the 75 cents I paid for it. DO NOT BUY!","timestamp_created":1509757673,"timestamp_updated":1509757673,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.598784208297729492","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1509817925,"developer_response":"I'm sorry to hear that you had a negative experience with this game. My intention was to provide a short but fun experience for players to enjoy. This game is here for the enjoyment of the players, and if you feel that it was not worth the price, then I encourage you to refund the purchase. I want to thank you for leaving your feedback and for giving this game a chance."}],"cursor":"AoJ44rukwt8CeqWnigE="}
