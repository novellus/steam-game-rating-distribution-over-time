    review: "A very much needed skin. Union Pacific was the railroad that helped create\
      \ the GP20, as EMD was very hesitant to implement turbocharging. UP's experiments\
      \ helped prove to a very reluctant EMD the benefits of turbocharging, and thus\
      \ the 2000hp turbocharged GP20 was born. \nReppo did a great job on this one."
