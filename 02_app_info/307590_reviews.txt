Control is tight with some interesting traps (I like how the big clamping trap is one of the easiest). One thing I disliked is that the combination of traps is kind of random every re-try and some are much harder (E.g. Bee + yellow ball) which makes it feels kind of \"luck based\". Also I've finished the game without getting any coins. Aren't we supposed to unlock items in the store?","timestamp_created":1608350557,"timestamp_updated":1608350648,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7OjKvPYCdfqruwI="}
