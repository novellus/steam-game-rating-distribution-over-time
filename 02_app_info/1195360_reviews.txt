As great as demos go and I get that they're only placeholders that may-may not be in the final game, I want to point out the latter however is a far cry (will get into this later on)!! So, all aboard?    \n\n\n[h1]\"Last Boarding Call\"[/h1]\n\n[u]The Gist:[/u]\nSaki and her college friends are about to graduate soon. They have a wilderness excursion to ponder over the end of their school lives and future relations. That is until a quarrel ensues, suspicion thrown followed by the appearance of a train well out of nowhere. Now, where will this take them? \n\n[spoiler] ! Excuse me, no stowaways!![/spoiler]\n\n[h1][+] PROS;[/h1]\n\n[b](a) Destination: Nowhere[/b]\n2D side-scroller that doesn't take much to learn; you move, gather key items and unlock things. Which quickly allows you focus on the good stuff. This comes in the form of puzzles having both creepy Japanese folklore and childlike charm involving dolls, colored drawings among other things. This is where the in-game notebook comes in handy but also grab a pen-paper or whip out that smartphone because they could test whether you're smarter than a 5th grader. It's only at the halfway point that you can run with CTRL, to signal a change in determination. \n\n[b](b) Off The Rails[/b] \nThe plot is extremely pulled off! It touches on university anxieties and soul-searching *snorts* which ngl really stuck... Definitely for lovers in mind and to appreciate, but it evokes a sense of compassion nonetheless. The hardships of love and what could keep them apart; circumstances sometimes outside the couple's control. What's also invigorating is the duality in the storylines because you may think the past is done and over with but here it's very much still kicking. Of course, the characters also standout! Most notably Saki whose empathy is strong but is only human in that she doubts herself. She along with the train inhabitants (some never named) definitely carried the drama to its conclusion! \n\n[b](c) Appreciate That View[/b]\nI have been drawn to more pixel arts recently, this is no different~ They get the job done and looks delightfully pleasing. You'll spend a lot of time in the train so opening up its areas gradually and seeing a different side to it entirely would make up for more than a passing interest. There are also what I call 'breathing moments' which are CGs but shows their conviction and body language. Though fewer in number, I live for these!! The complete piano composition is to die for~~\n\n[b](d) P-pump The Brakes![/b]\nTruthfully, the horror isn't always very obvious (until I've had my way bwahaha). Yeah, I also wanted that \"horror\" genre to be removed but then I got to thinking. It's never expositioned, but the events that occurred from the beginning were [spoiler]orchestrated by restless beings[/spoiler]. I know it sounds obvious but that's because it's made out to be \"coincidence\". What's even more chilling is that connection the [spoiler]spirit world[/spoiler]with our physical environment. \n\nThe train is an object of tragic history yet its negative emotions of heartache, misunderstanding stay on affecting others, worst being similar-minded individuals. Some puzzles bear meanings that go beyond the surface level- the reflections segment require more understanding of the actual Japanese folklore masks to truly appreciate them. Similarly for saving progress, why a phone? Makes you wonder~\n\nNow to interpret the \"one-way trip\" metaphor! Firstly, growing up and the responsibilities along with it. The characters expressing their disdain and fret about what's next, but some look forward to it (or are they?). Number two (yuck) is the relation to death. [spoiler]How some lives are meant to be taken away or you never know when it will happen.[/spoiler] Last but not least, time being irreversible. Ultimately linear that it moves forward but it can still be warped by emotions and feelings.\n\n\n[h1][-] CONS;[/h1]\n\n[b](i) Status: Delayed[/b] \nAll this train-wreck of gut wrenches is offset by the pacing. I mentioned Saki can only run from chapter 5 onward where she decides \"you know what, I have legs\". So the first two hours alone could've been 50 min had she not decide to take her sweet time, (it is a luxury cruise, after all). Her exact reasoning is she knows what's up and can't afford to be careful anymore. But yeah I know padding when I see it. Which is why-\n\n[b](ii) Dark Passenger[/b]\nThere's a black hole in game design and objectives. Picture you're in the first few chapters, can only walk jauntily to get a key item here and then magically another appears all the way on the other side. It can be pretty frustrating, because this occurs many, many times! The logic goes \"I wasn't looking for this\" or \"this should reveal new objects\" but mhmm... \n\nSome oversights with characters can be way off. Kanae reacts to the terrible sights witnessed thus far adding to her personality. But other partners paired up don't really, not as much. Or how Yuuta's claustrophic but then goes with you in cramped restrooms. Minor thing is the first venture of the luxury ride; decorative doors (no description whatsoever) and you're expected to just walk to the end of both carriages. Next thing ya know- they can be interacted with. It's eating away at me because this is the only instance it haPPpPpe-\n\n[b](iii) Just Shake It Off[/b]\nThe underwhelming scares owes much to the demo which portray a wholly different experience. Because that one was more intense in pace and atmosphere.. Even bringing a scripted chase much earlier ahead of chapters. \n\nI get demos are not accurate representations but that was a low blow. The end product turns out to be stuck in gear one for way longer than it needs to. Deaths also are heavily scripted with QTE sequences... The big bad beastie could have been omitted altogether. \n\n[b](iv) What Did Choo Expect? [/b]\nParting thoughts? First, the train setting which is dope af but it also means you'd be confined primarily to its interiors and you'd see much of what it has to offer by chapter 8. But hey, it's 10 bucks sooo~ \n\nMay I also say while the story started off excellently, I'm hurt by the abrupt ending [spoiler] it's like \"suspicions confirmed, okay bye!\"[/spoiler]but that's probably because we've been conditioned to want and expect wholesome ones. It actually makes more sense some things just don't have resolution, at least not in our eyes.\n\n\n[h1]\"Journey's Part of The Destination.\"[/h1]\n\nIn short, Re:Turn was a commendable 2D sidescroller with much emphasis on interesting themed-puzzles and one-track attention to a well-crafted story. Romanticizing the notion of love transcending all barriers and dimensions, perhaps much too literally that overtakes the horror elements at times. Furthermore, I was captivated by the overall pixel art and dynamic CG stills, giving a lasting impression that much like the train- also brought the atmosphere to life. \n\nAs with all tube rides, the scheduling isn't always as promised and no less true here. The game leaves you walking for well over two hours before deciding okay, wiggle yer toes! Problematized further by the need to travel back-forth for fetch quests. Which is why the game design here is largely at fault and dragged the whole impact. Beyond some initial unsettling, cliched scares in the beginning the gears shifts into romantic mystery for the remainder of the touchingly nostalgic 4 to 5 hour journey. Now THAT'S a fitting price for a train ticket!\n\n[h1]8/10[/h1]\n\n[b]Would pay for this trip again![/b]","timestamp_created":1602981749,"timestamp_updated":1608332944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.670603573322296143","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqKSHvPYCfdPDqAI="}
