    review: 'pros


      + hand drawn, cartoony and colourful background graphics and characters

      + diverse cast of wacky characters

      + there are a few catchy musical pieces well sung by the characters

      + great soundtrack

      + easy puzzles (if you don''t want to challenge)

      + two playable characters

      + decent voice overs


      cons


      - game short and episodic. it s concluded with an cliffhanger

      - there are no steam achievements and cards

      - story childish and i think it appeals to more children


      This game combines old-style musical features with a classic puzzle adventure
      game. If you like this kind of thing, you will probably love this game too.
