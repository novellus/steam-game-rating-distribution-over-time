Dane bias\n\n+The name applies historicaly names after naval tradition. But the KDM flag is incorrect, the Navy used/uses a swirl tail version.\n\n+Ships may repair faster than in your average IRONCLAD game, this is also the first time I have seen vessels fighting fires succesfully.\n\n+The games are often on sale and cheap when they are.\n\n-Sinse I happen to run out of ammo a lot... you would expect the crew would be smart enough to bring more pr gun... can't sink enemies without shells.\n\n-There simply aren't enough shell onboard your average gunboat to destory medium warships. The game may easily feature ship sections or other features which makes it impossible to destory one ship just with pure stern chasing.\n\n-The AI is stupid... the only real danger are ships with pivot guns, everything else you can outflank and peper. This is common in all IRONCLAD and IRONCLAD II games.\n\n-Once you've played your first battle, there really isn't more to the game... sure you can sail around endlessly till you can afford Monitor ships but that's it.\n\n-The game handles poorly, loading a saved game might crash it, getting a note from Steam will \"darken\" the screen. a darkened screen will freeze/crash the game if you check other open taps. \n\n-Window mode doesn't work correctly.\n\n-The game is full of technological hiccups.\n*Enemy ships are able to accelerate and deaccelerate as they please\n*Damage seems to work at random (could be armour)\n*Clouds from impacts appear randomely in the air rather than on the ships.\n*Although cannonballs were/are prone to bounce on water. The game seems to give a 2nd opinon to a lot of shots and let you hit, even if the splash was far away from an enemy ship.","timestamp_created":1567535853,"timestamp_updated":1569370570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0c/xsu0CevfP0QE="}
