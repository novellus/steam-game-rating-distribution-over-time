What you see is pretty much what you get and I really appreciate that. The difficulty does ramp up slowly but never gets too wild, and the game is refreshingly free of any burdensome and unnecessary systems.\n\nIf like me you're looking for more quaint little games to enjoy in bite sized chunks I very much recommend Ponkle. I've been clearing 10 stages at a time every other evening or so and I'll soon have cleared level 100.","timestamp_created":1589343915,"timestamp_updated":1589344016,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6KKShvICd4iyhwI="}
