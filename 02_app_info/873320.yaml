    developer_response: 'Thank you for your review, even if it came after 5 (0.1 hours
      according to Steam) minutes of play. The game is actually quite a bit different
      in 4 ways from Monopoly.


      - You have a random job with a title and differing pay scales that have you
      have to deal with during the game that you can alter with your decisions. It
      isn''t always just $200 when you pass GO.

      - The board is randomly generated every game, AND every turn around on the non-street
      spaces.

      - The Fortune Point system allows you to create your own strategy with cashing
      them in for benefits.

      - The Big Event cards have little life episodes in them to add character and
      depth beyond just a ''upgrade streets + toll'' mechanic.


      These are all things that significantly change the way the game is played from
      bare-bones Monopoly, for certain.'

    review: You get what you pay for. It's less than 5 dollars, and it honestly shouldn't
      cost even that much. It is nothing but a glitchy ripoff of Monopoly. It didn't
      even bother improving or significantly altering the concept from Monopoly.
