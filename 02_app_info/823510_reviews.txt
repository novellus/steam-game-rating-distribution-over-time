And I was all set my hip to certain criterias when you shopping for a game I like to look for three things English windows and full controller support. But then again I got controller companion so that solves all that problem and I'm glad I got this game. Because I like it it's a Target game we can shoot the gun and also got the one for the bow and arrow so I'm going to put them through their faces.I'm going to do a video about this game cuz it's awesome I take more people need to see it cuz if I have a problem when I came up I want to see a particular game I go right on YouTube and look it up and if I like it I'll buy it so that's my rule that I use for playing Steam games thank you very much and God bless and if you see any games like this.
