    about_the_game: "Flow Weaver is a &quot;multidimensional&quot; VR escape room\
      \ game. The player explores and experiments with their environment, moving between\
      \ different magical dimensions to solve intuitive puzzles towards the goal of\
      \ escape.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe player is a Flow Weaver, a powerful wizard-traveler\
      \ familiar with the dimensions of magic. Trapped and shackled in a closed cell\
      \ with only a few objects around, the player needs to use their powers to learn\
      \ about the Flows of this strange new world -- and learn about their captors.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThe primary gameplay centers around transitioning between\
      \ your cell and seven different dimensions (or &quot;Flows&quot;) as you discover\
      \ them, learning how each Flow affects the world in different ways. The player\
      \ uses those differences to solve puzzles and challenges, learn new skills or\
      \ spells, and uncover new objects and new puzzles. Eventually, they bring all\
      \ their skills and all the dimensions together to ultimately escape captivity.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nFlow Weaver is made with the generous support of the Canada\
      \ Media Fund, Ontario Creates and the Games Institute."
