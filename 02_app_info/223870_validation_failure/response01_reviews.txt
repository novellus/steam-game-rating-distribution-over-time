It makes playing Ys 1 worthwhile by completing the  entire story that is being told.  Ys II Chronicles is more polished and a lot longer than Ys I. Gameplay is spectacular, especially compared to the original version and the TurboGrafx CD version.  No grinding is necessary.  No impossible Bat boss.  Just a really good old style RPG game.  You even have the best of both worlds, fire magic (shooting fireballs) AND bump system are two ways of attacking not long after the beginning of the game.\n\nHighly recommended.  The only downside to this game is that it does not have Voice acting.  I first played Ys ! & II on the Turbografx CD in the early 90s and I miss the immersive feeling of voice, rather than having to read text.  Other than that, it's a fun game. Lots of easter eggs, too!","timestamp_created":1609912570,"timestamp_updated":1609912570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiYqR6/YCeM/1wAI="}
