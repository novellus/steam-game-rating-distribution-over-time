I'm not even sure.\n[*]Unintuitively, the system of exclamation points is NOT telling you what level of monsters you might encounter.\n[*]Enemies have infinite stamina, you don't.\n[*]It's an unenjoyable struggle to make money in the early game: shopkeepers absolutely gouge you on prices as a baseline (sell prices < 1/3, buy prices almost double).\n[*]Early game is far, far too dependent on constantly chugging potions to barely survive at a point where you are already struggling to make any money.\n[*]Baseline stamina regen is drastically too low in the early game, especially with any build not focused on STR. You will constantly need to chug stamina potions you can't really afford to chug.\n[*]In the early game, rain makes ranged attacks almost useless - it reduces your chance to hit with ranged attacks by an unbearably massive 50%! It's outrageous. Compare to D&D where rain typically reduced your d20 by 2- significant without rendering ranged attacks almost impossible against near-your-level hostiles.\n[*]If you are out of combat, but in a dungeon, it takes like 10 in-game hours to recover stamina (which you need to do anything). There has to be a way to rest and recover stamina out of combat, inside a dungeon...This design oversight also negatively contributes to the problem of having to constantly chug potions (you can't really afford to buy) in the early game.\n[*]There isn't much content yet, but be fair: it's still very early.\n[/list]","timestamp_created":1609278232,"timestamp_updated":1609715461,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477707028388977051","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4uJWh5fYCePbJvgI="}
