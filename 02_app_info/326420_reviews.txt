Be aware of that before you buy it, as it likely will never be finished at this rate. The game itself is okay - very short (~20 minutes to complete episode 1), consisting mainly of you walking around the room(s) that you're in and interacting with several objects until you trigger the end of that scene. During these interactions, you're subjected to some pretty cringy commentary by your character that tries to be funny but fails at it.\n\nDespite it's flaws though, I actually wouldn't mind finishing it if the dev would continue work on the game. But six years, to me, says that it's been abandoned. And for that, I have to give it a negative review.","timestamp_created":1597605486,"timestamp_updated":1597605486,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw26Ot/PMCfNTxmwI="}
