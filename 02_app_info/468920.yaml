    review: "Pros:\nGreat graphics\nVery wide variety of species without any dlc\n\
      regularly updated from my pov \ngood amount of dlc for people who want more\
      \ out of it\na great variety of big fish\ncheap \nunderwater camera\nnot developed\
      \ for a money grab like all of Electronic Arts' games\ndevelopers very active\
      \ and very skilled\none of the most open world games I've ever seen\nno pay\
      \ to win things, like memberships (I'm eyeing Thehunter classic before 2019)\n\
      free lodge\nthe fish gills don't look gross! \nlittle to no bugs\n\ncons:\n\
      you can complete the game quite quickly\nno missions/story line\nkind of difficult\
      \ to catch certain fish like marlins and the Greenland shark\nno rare fish,\
      \ like albinos or piebalds or melanistics \n\n\nOverall rating: 9/10\n\ni would\
      \ certainly love to see more maps and more fish even after UFS 2, but overall,\
      \ it's a great game if someone is locked in quarantine and unable to fish. I\
      \ find myself not playing much of it right now due to me being unable to buy\
      \ the DLC thanks to parents.\n\n___________\nSECTION 2\n\nRemarks 1:0\nso far\
      \ I have not come across any bugs, which is surprising. Computers are always\
      \ full of errors and by the 2 hour mark of new games i encountered one or two.\
      \ This makes me add another point. 8/10-9/10.\n\nRemarks 1:1 \nI have a hope\
      \ that after the sequel they continue support of the prequel. If not, I may\
      \ refund this for the new one.\n\n_______________________\nSECTION 3\n\nThank\
      \ you developers for this awesome game. I hope you take my critique above into\
      \ consideration though there isn't a lot.   Thank you again!"
