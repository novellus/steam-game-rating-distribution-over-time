      I would definitely recommend this game for anyone interested in the cold war.
      I haven''t played the game ''Twilight Struggle'' myself, but I hear it is quite
      like that game and I reckon if you like that game chances are good you''ll like
      Terminal Conflict too.


      I think game captures the essence of the cold war quite well - USSR vs USA,
      proxy wars and managing the home front while you''re trying to achieve your
      goals. Intelligence is a big part of the game, especially with the Eyes Only
      DLC. War is abstracted, but still challenging.


      You go through ten timelines, from 1946 to 1991. In these timelines, you and
      your opponent in turn pick a focus that decides the main area of the world the
      action takes place, even though you can still be active in any other theater
      at the same time. There are 5 domestic needs you will have to manage throughout
      the game: finance, people, elites, army and government, as mismanaging these
      can cut your game short early on. The mentioned focuses also affect these needs.
      Next to all this, there are policies which will grant you victory points required
      to achieve a major victory, but also can affect the domestic needs.


      Victory is achieved by getting 100 victory points more than your opponent, winning
      the space race of by simply surviving until the end of 1991.


      The interaction from the developers is very good. Be sure to check out their
      Discord to find a multiplayer challenge, and give feedback! Every Thursday they
      organize ''Terminal Thursday'' and between 18:00 and 22:00 CET you can challenge
      the developers.


      Not everything is perfect. Multiplayer is awesome I think, but once you get
      the mechanics under control you will find the AI to be a bit lackluster. Although
      this has also improved quite a bit, it is still some way off from the same challenge
      as a human player. This is always a difficult aspect in any game though, and
      doesn''t stop me from practicing my skills against ''Mirvin'' as the AI is called.
      The game truly shines in multiplayer though!


      In my opinion the in-game tutorial could still be improved. Although the developers
      have recently released an update to this system. I still would prefer to have
      a linear tutorial which goes through all the aspects of the game. The current
      tutorial system tries to ''unlock'' the aspects one by one, but it doesn''t
      work if you ask me.. new players don''t know where to click yet, so don''t know
      what to unlock. I have made a YT vid myself which is already outdated a bit
      since I learned a lot since then, and also some systems have changed. I still
      have plans to update that video though, so hopefully that can help new players!'
