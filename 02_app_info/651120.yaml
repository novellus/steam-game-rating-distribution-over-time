    review: "Really love this game, the developer has obviously put a lot of time\
      \ into the environment and has a great imagination, set in some kind of Stalinist\
      \ dystopia/Mad Max style world that would make a great movie. \nI really wish\
      \ they would develop it more with interaction with the towns but that might\
      \ be something for a sequel?"
