I got it on sale for 69 cents (Lol) and unlike some games I've purchased at that price, this one was legit worth it. It was a bit challenging because of the timing for jumps which if far better then when the game is hard due to poorly implemented mechanics. Fun little game for a quick upload 10/10 would buy again... Just at the less then 1 dollar price. \n\nIf ya'll want to see a little game play then: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vE09NExhA5o&t=2s\n\nEnjoy like I did and thanks for chilling with Icy!","timestamp_created":1607304862,"timestamp_updated":1607304862,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk7u1nfYCdefwtwI="}
