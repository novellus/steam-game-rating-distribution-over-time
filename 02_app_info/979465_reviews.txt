Two tile sets,  a few monsters, and a few characters. No battler and no faceset. Why? Isn't the point of rpg maker dlc to not have to make your own stuff. Now you may be saying \"It for an adventure game, not a game where you would battle,\" but then why would you have monsters! I would love this product if you just removed the monsters and lowered the price a bit. Now, I may sound stingy, but I also payed $14 dollars for me to use 80% of what this dlc offers. So unless you plan on making your own graphics, don't buy this.","timestamp_created":1592611661,"timestamp_updated":1592611661,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zKzD5/ICfOKEjwI="}
