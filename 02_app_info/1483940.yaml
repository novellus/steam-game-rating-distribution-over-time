    review: '[h1]A Fun, Moving Collection[/h1]


      [i]Slide Stories: Bonds & Memories[/i] is a collection of eight slider puzzles
      that tell a story and reflect on memories. There are seven standard puzzles
      and an eighth bonus puzzle that you can find (which was a pretty cool feature).
      The puzzles are available in different sizes: 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, and 9x9.


      I really enjoy the hand-drawn images and the story they tell. The pictures are
      animated rather than still. Though I like the idea of animation (and really
      enjoyed it in the first collection of slide puzzles, [i]Slide Stories: Neko''s
      Journey[/i]) I did find the animation to be a bit too much: it felt like each
      image was persistently [i]shaking[/i] and I often found myself feeling rather
      nauseated. That was really unfortunate. I would suggest, in this case, to have
      an option to freeze the animation. Maybe in future collections revert back to
      the fewer animations from the other collection.


      The music is really relaxing. It''s a soft and soothing melody, and perfectly
      complements the story being told. I wouldn''t mind a few more tracks (it''s
      one single tune that repeats and is used for all puzzles as well as the main
      screen). It is nice as it is, but variety is good, too.


      Some of the great features that are included in the [i]Slide Stories[/i] series
      are the options to number your puzzle pieces and looking at the completed picture.
      Numbering the pieces is really handy on the high piece counts where it''s hard
      to distinguish differences between similar looking pieces: the numbers set you
      straight as to the order they need to be placed in. The option to look at the
      completed image is handy if you want a simple reference to look at as you work
      to complete the image.


      Overall, I think it''s a fun game. If you like slider puzzles, I think you will
      enjoy this set. The images are lovely and the story is very moving. It''s well
      done (despite my slight dislike of the over-animation). I recommend this puzzle
      set, and look forward to seeing more in the future!'
