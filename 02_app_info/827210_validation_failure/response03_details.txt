With barely any plants or animals left, ninety-seven percent of the population survives on synthetic nutrient pellets. What little real food that remains is controlled as prizes in the highest-rated game show on Earth, Death Carnival, where contestants battle for their lives against hordes of relentless monsters and machines.<br><br>Survival rates for Death Carnival are notoriously low, but there is no shortage of volunteers willing to risk their lives for just one taste of real flavor. And whether these contestants should prevail or be crushed, whether they feast or splatter, it is to the cheers of millions who watch from around the globe. <br><br>For in addition to food, participation in the games grants instant celebrity status. Contestants are adored by the masses and approached by mega corporations in search of the most skilled candidates for sponsorship.
