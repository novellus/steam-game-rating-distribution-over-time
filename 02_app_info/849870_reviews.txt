Everybody will experiance things differently. Aslo no game is protected from critizum weather it's early access or full game. Now onto the review.\n\nVirtual Pirate VR is a Shooting & Slice Action Position Tracking (Move / Evasion) battle game. The title and the description are two different things. First off virtual pirate means you can play as a pirate, get to experiance a taste of being a pirate to where the descrption is saying you just stand around defending yourself agenst a certain number of enemies. \n\nThe graphics are cartoon-ish style at best. I mean what do you expect from a $14.99 game that is on sale for $10.47.\n\nThe music was so loud, louder then my own voive and there is no option to turn it down or even turn it off.\n\nThe sword slicing sound was okay more or less typical average sound.\n\nThe sword was litually useless when blocking rarley works and the slicing only works after a reset swing. Can't do quick counter hits or tiny slices.\n\nThe flint lock pistol sound didn't sound at all what it should. Play this game and listen very carfully then go to this link I provide to check a real sound https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjeYe7w7zxs.\n\nThe flint lock pistol was also way to big, it was more of a blunder blast gun but those required two hands to shoot. Also pirates didn't have laser pointers on their guns. Another thing is the pistol/blunder required a reaload after evry shot. In here you can litually keep firing and get nothing but headshots making the sword usless.\n\nThe enemies were bumb and boring since all you have are 2 regualr enemies and 1 boss enemy. The two regualr are other pirates and skelotons in which there are veriaty. Some throw things and othere are buff but in the end it's the same enemy that is reused. The boss is a kraken which isn't much of a boss when the game tells you where it's weak points are located.\n\nThe modes are actually not fun since it's the same modes. Singleplayer has arcade & stage. Aracde is to see how long you can survive for, collecting points for a leaderboard. I got 67,400 in total and 1st on the leaderboad. Stage is the exact same mode but you pick the location and diffculty but it just copies aracde. If you play arcade first and you can simply unlock all the stages with out playing stage. So the singleplayer is just a wave survival.\n\nOnline is funny because I couldn't find anyone in fact the game told me how many were online which was 1 and that was me. The has been out for 2 days but really a new game & no one is playing a virtual pirate wave game, gee I wounder why.\n\nLook I know it's early access game and it's not perfect or even the full game but there is something called beta testing. Allow some gamers to play the game before release to get reactions and feedback to make sure the game is fine it's currect state. There gamers who love early access gmaes because they can watch it grow into something wounderful but they can aslo watch it sink as well. \n\nSo the game for me gets a 1/10 score.\n\nThats the Pony review for Virtual Pirate VR","timestamp_created":1526192155,"timestamp_updated":1526192155,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.610635995864868164","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4l4WJrOMCfrahoAE="}
