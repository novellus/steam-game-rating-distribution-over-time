    review: 'When I first reviewed Dangerous Men in 2015, I was met with some backlash.
      I''m a fan of cheesy b-movies and I love the unknown. I like to find things
      that no one else has heard of and bring it to their attention. At the time,
      I said I liked it and it''s not for everyone.


      Fast forward to 2020, and guys... well, yeah. The film is awful, and considering
      its history, I expected it to be. A long story short, an Iranian filmmaker named
      John Rad (I assume that''s not his real name and I''m too lazy to check, I''m
      sure you really don''t care) had moved to the United States and began filming
      Dangerous Men from the late 70''s to the early 90''s, then it was officially
      released in the mid-2000''s. This is not the only example of a film being shoved
      off until getting an official release years later, but I just found it fascinating
      that of all the films that had to be delayed, it was this one. And for what?
      A campy mess that even a high school student with an iPhone could beat?


      This film has everything: Bad acting, out-of-place music, disorienting editing,
      you name it! I can''t even call it comparable to The Room, because that film,
      while it was bad, was very entertaining, despite the director''s intentions
      of trying to make it more serious. This film isn''t remotely entertaining, which,
      in my mind, makes this a bad film. After all, it''s a form of entertainment,
      which means it has to be... well, ENTERTAINING!


      What the hell was I smoking when I wrote that review back in 2015?'
