Minutes rather than hours. But trust me when I say this was more than enough to ask for a refund. I wasn't expect a world beater, but this ?!\n\n- You can't go full screen, so you have to create a game within a small window.\n- When importing your own sprites, you can't specify your own folders, eg. a folder on desktop. \n- Couldn't see a way to import own sounds. \n- The menu system is very basic and because you can't expand to full screen, is really cramped. \n- Clicked to import a sprite from one of the built in demos and it crashed to desktop !\n\nI'm sure there's workarounds, eg. put your sprites in the folders it does recognise, but it all felt like software written in about 1987. \nToo expensive for what there is, and needs some serious updates and fixes for me to come back for another look.","timestamp_created":1593270104,"timestamp_updated":1593270104,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/I2T+/ICd4nekAI="}
