    short_description: It's a lazy day at Souta's house when Nakajima abruptly reveals
      that his mother guilted him into agreeing to a marriage interview. He's thirty
      and still single, and Souta's stuck in the same boat. Rinko on the other hand
      is already married, but not exactly a perfect homemaker.
