    about_the_game: "The picture postcard scenery of the Austrian Alps dominate the\
      \ stunning new Semmeringbahn: M\xFCrzzuschlag to Gloggnitz route for Train Simulator.<br><br>Built\
      \ by more than 20,000 worked between 1848 and 1854, the 41km (25 mile) Semmeringbahn\
      \ (Semmering Railway) was the first standard gauge mountain railway ever constructed\
      \ and is considered the first \u2018true\u2019 mountain railway, due to its\
      \ immense change in altitude and challenging terrain it traverses throughout\
      \ the route.<br><br>Connecting the Austrian towns of M\xFCrzzuschlag and Gloggnitz\
      \ in the east of the country, the Semmeringbahn features some of the most stunning\
      \ railway scenery seen anywhere in the world \u2013 two-storey high viaducts,\
      \ more than 100 stone bridges, 16 tunnels and 11 iron bridges are prominent\
      \ throughout the route. The line itself sees a 457m altitude difference in its\
      \ 41km in length, and 60% of the track is on a 2-2.5% (around 1:40) gradient,\
      \ with as much as 16% featuring very tight radius curves at only 190m.<br><br>From\
      \ Gloggnitz in the east, the line passes through a number of small hamlets high\
      \ in the mountainous Alps to Payerbach-Reichenau, where local passenger services\
      \ from Vienna terminate. It is here that one of the Alps\u2019 major ski resorts\
      \ is located, as well as a heritage railway running in the mountains. Heading\
      \ southwards, the line crosses the stunning Schwarza Viaduct before K\xFCb and\
      \ Klamm-Schottwein, where the landscape is most famous for the expansive S6\
      \ motorway viaduct.<br><br>Between Klamm-Schottwein and Breitenstein, trains\
      \ pass through probably the most famous part of the route, The Viaduct \u2013\
      \ a spectacular open-sided tunnel that provides a photographer\u2019s dream\
      \ setting. From Semmering (the highest point on the route), the line heads downhill\
      \ towards M\xFCrzzuschlag, where large freight yards and a locomotive maintenance\
      \ and servicing yard dominate.<br><br>At the time of opening, the incredible\
      \ grades and tight curves resulted in the need for new locomotives that could\
      \ more easily handle the task. Thus, a competition was held to find traction\
      \ that was able to traverse the grades and curves while maintaining a minimum\
      \ speed of 11.5km/h (7mph).<br><br>Eventually, the railway settled for the Engerth\
      \ locomotive, a unique articulated tender locomotive that had a top speed of\
      \ 19km/h (11mph) up the steepest gradients thanks to the weight of the fuel\
      \ and water being spread across all the axles, providing more traction.<br><br>The\
      \ increased accessibility to the mountains thanks to the railway saw a number\
      \ of purpose-built Alpine resorts, with parts of the railway becoming known\
      \ for their summer orientated architecture such as hotels and villas. It also\
      \ lead to the construction of residential areas, creating a new form of landscape\
      \ not usually seen on mountainous terrain. <br><br>Today, the line is owned\
      \ and operated by the Austrian Federal Railways some 160 years after its construction\
      \ and plays a key role in connecting Vienna and Graz as part of the \xD6BB Southern\
      \ Railway. It was also listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1998.<br><br>However,\
      \ despite the fantastic scenery, towering bridges, challenging grades and rich\
      \ history, a new 27.3km (16 mile) tunnel is being constructed under the mountains\
      \ to bypass the Semmeringbahn, and is expected to open in 2024.<br><br>Included\
      \ with this primarily freight route is a Class 1116 in \xD6BB Livery, Habbins\
