    review: "The game plays like a 2D P&C, but in a 3D world, so you can stick to\
      \ the given path, but also wander off to explore a side-quest or two, or maybe\
      \ find one of the alternative endings. Exploration is rewarded, which, together\
      \ with several bonuses, adds to the replayability factor \u2014 as does the\
      \ main mechanic. In short, you talk to people, solve puzzles, explore, and write.\n\
      \nFor more precise interactions, verb input is required. Trackless improves\
      \ the historically often tedious word search by allowing for a larger range\
      \ of words for each interaction and rewarding the player for originality or\
      \ precision, so a player, who wants to move on, can do so with the most plain\
      \ of word, while others can take their time to get more bonus points. These\
      \ points are by no means important for progress (with one exception), but allow\
      \ you to spice things up a little. Some of the upgrades you can get will be\
      \ more helpful than others. Not much is told about them, and you might even\
      \ miss them being upgrades (as did I during my first playthrough), so you will\
      \ have to explore and experiment.\n\nThe phone you carry has a few important\
      \ features that you better keep an eye on and also functions as a radar, which\
      \ is a nice, immersive way of showing you which objects are important and which\
      \ are not. The music goes very well with the over-all mystical vibe. \n\nFor\
      \ me, as a non-native angloglot, I found the game motivated me to try and extend\
      \ my vocabulary, which is always welcome.\n\nYou can finish the game pretty\
      \ quickly if that is your only aim, but with some proper reflection and exploration\
      \ you'll find that you can spend more than just a few hours with it. I've gotten\
      \ all endings, explored a lot, played the game twice from start to finish, and\
      \ still feel that my 11 hours already spent aren't enough: there's still more\
      \ to discover. The game encourages you to take it slow, which fits me perfectly,\
      \ since I am quite the opposite of a speedrunner.\n\nFull review:\nhttps://maskinkultur.com/2020/05/13/trackless/"
