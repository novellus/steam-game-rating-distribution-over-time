    review: '20XX is a Mega Man X inspired Roguelite. It''s fairly polished, has a
      unique and in my opinion nice art style, and has plenty of modifiers to spice
      things up.

      I think the main problems with the game are the fact that you will see all 8
      bosses in a single run (which is pretty Mega Man X-like, but maybe not great
      for a roguelite) and that there are only 4 ''tilesets'' to explore, and each
      boss will always be associated with one tileset. You will probably learn quickly
      how to deal with each boss and tileset - the differences will be in your toolset.

      Still, that reduced replay value doesn''t hurt it significantly, in my opinion
      - as it''s a roguelite you will have to explore the game a few times to see
      all the available upgrades, but if you''re skilled enough you won''t need them.
