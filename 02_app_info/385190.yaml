    review: 'A Brilliant RPG maker game BUT!


      Extremly buggy, with Frame rate lag that simply makes the game unplayable.


      If you could save in the field and load the game it would be something you could
      tolerate but since you need to find save points and the bug can happen just
      about anywhere and randomly it kills the game..... which is very sad, it is
      well written, with an awesome combat system reminding me of the Xenogears from
      PSone and a mana system similar to Suikoden, which is in short a brilliant combo.....
      it is sad to see a well written story getting killed by bugs... so sad... so
      sad.


      If you are perhaps one of the people that can suffer through the frame rate
      lag or someone that knows how to edit or use speed up hacks you might be able
      to work around the bugs, and then you might actually enjoy the title.


      Why the developers simply didnt make it possible to save/load where ever to
      work around the frame rate bug is beyond me. oh well, regardless do not buy
      it unless you can work around the problem, if you can then you can do far worse
      than this game.'
