The substantial message conveyed in the book I think is beyond the developer's religious beliefs but more on the importance of one's choices that adds up in time and makes the person. It is not your typical game on steam and I think the price is very affordable. You can say you paid for something worth reading and your money won't go to waste as it inspires something well within you.","timestamp_created":1603482333,"timestamp_updated":1603484815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46ZHJq/UCdbTWqQI="}
