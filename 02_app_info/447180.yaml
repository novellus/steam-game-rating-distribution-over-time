    review: 'I was already prepared due to the weird title, but this game is exactly
      what it appears to be: a dating game where the female protagonist''s ("MC")
      pets become human, all for the purpose of [strike]screwing her[/strike] becoming
      her lover. Ignoring the disturbing fact that these pets fell in love with MC
      as pets, this game has some pretty weak storylines, including: a Curse (TM)
      without boundaries and logic, the dreaded "love test" where x condition will
      happen once you "fall in love" (how is that detectable??), pets turning into
      humans by eating some sort of berry, pets falling in love with their human,
      and a crappy ex-boyfriend who should have been dumped in the first place.


      The Good:

      - Features a MC who is--oh, the horror!--not experiencing love for the first
      time, but has been cast aside by her current boyfriend, who is also a love interest.
      I like the idea of an otome game that explores a second love and the idea of
      finding love after a heartbreak. Actually, the game starts with MC''s a** getting
      dumped. However, she is still very much the "lady doth protest too much" type,
      unfortunately.

      - Roughly half of the LIs were decent, if you squint and ignore the fact that
      they used to be MC''s pets....... Ramin (the cockatoo) is super sweet and mature
      but still has a good banter and dynamic with the MC; Assam  (the pot-bellied
      pig) is also kind and considerate, though his route takes a dark turn that many
      players may not appreciate; and Lufna (the Russian blue cat) is sarcastic, lazy,
      and sometimes brutally honest, but also very attuned to the MC''s thoughts.
      ...But proceed to The Oogly and reference the paragraphed phrases here for why
      this game was too problematic for a positive recommendation.

      - Sachi, MC''s female friend. Honestly, it is so rare to find a positive named
      female influence in otome games that even though Sachi isn''t a very developed
      and fleshed-out character, I took to her immediately since the only other female
      presences are usually Bitchy Rivals, of which there is also one in this game.
      -_-


      The Oogly:

      - Pets are supposed to be like children to their owners, are they not? Maybe
      in some instances, they can be like siblings, if you were "raised" simultaneously
      with them by your parents (as it indicates Ramin was). Either way, they are
      not supposed to be objects of lust, even after they become attractive men. I
      don''t know WHERE this concept was conceived or how it got the green light to
      proceed forward. It''s just a bit disturbing and I was never able to shake off
      that sense of impending horror, despite how sweet some of the LIs were. While
      I was able to stomach the pets-into-humans story in [i]Dandelion[/i] since MC
      had only raised them for three months, it was a little more disturbing here
      as MC constantly talks about how many years she''s been raising these pets--one
      of which she''s had since she was a child.

      - MC is sexually experienced but still comes off as protesting a LOT even when
      she is in the mood. I understand this is due to cultural expectations, modesty
      and embarrassment, but it''s ideas like these that contribute to rape culture:
      "You have to protest to sexual advances even if they''re appreciated, otherwise
      you''ll be a slut!" "Try and try again if at first you don''t succeed with your
      romantic overtures!" "Ignore what her mouth is saying in favor of what her [i]body[/i]
      is saying!" GRRR.

      - Two of the routes were trash routes, imo. One, I think most folks would agree;
      the other may be more up in the air. (Also some people may not like one of the
      routes I liked due to a dark twist that occurs mid-route.)

      - Some of the plots are really, REALLY weak. Like it''s not even a suspension
      of disbelief, but doing away with logic altogether. The very idea of animals
      becoming humans is WEIRD and IMPOSSIBLE in the first place, so you have to establish
      some sort of semi-logical reason for why this can occur. Another game with pet
      LIs uses a magician who grants wishes to get past this loophole, and indeed
      that is also a very weak way of explaining how it happens, but at least it''s
      SOMETHING. Magic usually explains everything away anyways, right?

      - The stories are pretty short and instalove abounds. MC goes from crying her
      heart out after getting dumped in the Prologue to falling in love with one of
      her pets within the first two or three chapters, which is basically two or three
      days. I get that this isn''t a sweeping epic, but at least give it a little
      more time??

      - This is a typical otome game in the sense that players raise affection by
      selecting dialogue among two or more options. Like the other D3 games I''ve
      played so far, there are no bad endings, but if your affection isn''t high enough,
      you''ll get the generic happy ending, rather than the Super Happy (or Miracle,
      in this game) ending. Some options don''t do anything, while others will have
      an option that raises affection. Some of these choices do not make any sense,
      as what I picked up on is that you can raise sufficient affection for Miracle
      Ending by [b]always choosing the option that benefits the entire group[/b] where
      available. This doesn''t always make sense as sometimes that option launches
      dialogue that shows the particular LI is upset. Took me forever to get Reito''s
      best ending due to this weird and illogical structure.


      If the pet concept isn''t icky enough for you, then I''d dissuade you because
      the content isn''t sufficient for a full-fledged game. I read every scenario
      in under five hours and while I did like a couple of the LIs, the stories weren''t
      good enough to return to for a second read. Maybe if it''s deeply discounted
      or if you do like sugary stories without much substance.'
