Obviously its still in early access so it has a ways to go before it is fully fleshed out, but I think it currently serves the purpose of being a great, peaceful sandbox aquarium creator. It took me a minute to figure out how to use the plumbing function and the add-ons that come with it, but once I took the time to read the tabs on the help page it turned out to be very simple. That said, I think some work could be done on the controls to make them more intuitive, and providing a basic tutorial would be beneficial.\n\nAs of now, the fish and hardscape selections are fairly bare-bones (particularly with saltwater, but freshwater too), but it appears as though the game is being updated regularly and I am excited to see what is added in the future. I would love to see snails, shrimp, and just a selection of cleanup crew included in general, as well as a greater variety of diseases, types of algae, and general types of unique aquarium issues like pest-snail population booms, incompatible fish not getting along, etc. Regardless, I'm excited to see where the game goes from here!","timestamp_created":1610132278,"timestamp_updated":1610132278,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwr5nX8fYCcvLNwQI="}
