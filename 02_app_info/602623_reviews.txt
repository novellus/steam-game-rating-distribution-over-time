I got the Sabre due to not having been into flight sims in years and this campaign to go with it, lots of fun, well put together, sensible missions. Bought something simple. So glad I did. Also turned on random hardware failures, wish I hadn’t. I completed my mission but had to land without a landing gear and speed brakes on. Turn that feature off if your just getting into the game, unless you’re experienced in your piloting skills.","timestamp_created":1609700049,"timestamp_updated":1609700049,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hrDm5PYCdp+UwAI="}
