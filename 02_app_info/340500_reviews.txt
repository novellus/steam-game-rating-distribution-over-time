I mean I got totally lost.\nNo compass. No map of any sort. \nEach area looks the same.... while snow covered. \nSpent the next half hour going from one screen to another not knowing if i was getting anywhere, I even somehow managed to get back to the Outpost, but guess what, they wont let me back in!\nSo back to the snow covered maze.\nAnother half hour spent wandering around aimlessly, loading up previous saves as my team was constantly getting annihilated.\nRage quit. \nMy gaming time is more important to me than being wasted on this monstrosity.","timestamp_created":1605818088,"timestamp_updated":1605818088,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpO+N8fUCc5qurwI="}
