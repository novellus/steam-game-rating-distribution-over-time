    review: "\n Good thing > Scenery graphic is quite decent\n\n Not so good thing\
      \ > Even though scenery graphic is generally decent, many parts of it has blurred\
      \ distortion,\n damaging it's overall-good apperance.\n Also it's graphic is\
      \ feels very static. I'm much prefer less-decent but much alive graphic over\
      \ much-decent but less alive one,\n and I suspect many people who want this\
      \ style of game might have a similar taste. I suggest one of reason to this\
      \ is it's\n poor present of elevation. Many parts of map giving very flat image,\
      \ which is not good.\n\n Bad thing > Some actual character sprite(By saying\
      \ some, I mean one out of three featured in demo) show off bad sign.\n One supposed\
      \ to have a spider-maiden apperance, but instead it has a skeleton riding on\
      \ skeletal spider.\n This is very strange thing and highly out of place, I suspect\
      \ it's not exclusively designed asset for this game but\n just kinda-appropriate\
      \ image brought by dev from elsewhere. It's quite silly compare to it's granduer\
      \ scenery.\n\n Many of dialogue from NPC is awkward and feels like dragging\
      \ off unneccesarily.\n Also they really need to get proof reading. I know this\
      \ because I'm bad english user myself.\n\n And finally, I think that transformation\
      \ of protagonist is just bad presentation.\n From apperance to it's mouse using\
      \ control.\n\n Maybe this 'appearance' part is just my personal taste,\n But\
      \ celestial being in full armored figure is just not that looks good I think.\n\
      \n\n - - -\n\n Although I'm not content with it's demo, still it's very tiny\
      \ piece of main game obviously\n\n so maybe I'm wrong in some regard. Atleast\
      \ I'll check out again whence full game come out."
