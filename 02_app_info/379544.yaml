    review: 'Maybe the basic plane will be fine, but after much searching, reading
      the manual, posting on forums, and eventually contacting Virtavia directly,  I
      now have the information that there is NO ADDITIONAL FUEL TANK OPTION TO EXTEND
      THE RANGE.  This is the reason that I purchased this plane version from Steam,
      as I had already purchased the basic plane version from Virtavia.


      The promotional information for this plane needs to be revised by Steam.  Apparently
      it has been in place for four years.  The perception that some have that the
      versions with pods under the wings are fuel tanks is also mistaken; they are
      baggage pods.


      Again, it might be a great and interesting plane (I will still explore it, and
      hope to be able to recommend it later in other ways)  but the basic motivation
      that I had for purchasing from Steam was the extended range claim.  No such
      luck.


      I hope to help others avoid this confusion and disappointment and wasteful expense
      in the future.  Best regards, CEC'
