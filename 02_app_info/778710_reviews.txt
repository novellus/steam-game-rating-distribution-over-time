You have to use an Xbox controller to navigate. I couldn't figure out even how to do basic things. Game needs lots of polish.\n\nI was able to mess around and move things around. Change shape sizes and even add some items. But when it came to playing my song and animating objects to them. Well, all I could do was play my song. I couldn't even figure out if there was a template to use. The store videos look cool and I'd love to be able to do something even remotely close to that. I just couldn't figure out where to start.\n\nSorry, but it's way too clunky / complicated to use in its current form. You definitely need a tutorial or a more intuitive interface. I know the app is only $5 and I shouldn't expect much. But it was useless to me. And nothing made me want to even try to figure it out since I was getting nowhere fast.","timestamp_created":1520836681,"timestamp_updated":1520836681,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529914557933807373","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ40sO7jOICeIm+mwE="}
