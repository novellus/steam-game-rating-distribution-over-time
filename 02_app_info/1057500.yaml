    review: "I literally tried every player out there...from owning VR now since 2015-2016\
      \ ...This is the one player I go to for everything. There are tons of settings\
      \ and the interface is simply to use and navigate thru. Your not going to get\
      \ these crazy realistic backgrounds and themes to choose from..... and if your\
      \ looking for a player with all kinds of useless options that you would never\
      \ use in the first place...Then this isn't going to be your player.. But if\
      \ that is your thing. you'll find tons of those out there ...I noticed that\
      \  the more they cost ....the worst the player itself seems to be ....  they\
      \ usually compensate that issue with users freedom and control with all kinds\
      \ of features and settings \n  ......I actually just read a review where this\
      \ deuce bag was bashing a decent player...saying:  This player is garbage!!!!!\
      \ DO NOT WASTE THE TIME......I just found a player that kills the competition\
      \ with having the most user options that I have ever seen  .... I don't anything\
      \ about most of these options or what they do yet....but I seen a setting that\
      \ will allow you to actually let you fold your virtual display in half....That's\
      \ crazy!!. You tell me a player out there right now that offers that feature\
      \ .......ain't none that I know. \n   My Man was defenitly correct about one\
      \ thing though....\"AIN'T NONE OUT THERE I KNOW AS WELL\" to even offer such\
      \ a brilliant and genius feature as that must be. My mind can't even comprehend\
      \ or understand how a feature like that can be used to make my  viewing experience\
      \ that much better. I guess its my loss and  i miss out on things like this,...and\
      \ I know I am and will never be a smart guy, and that is ok for me... but if\
      \ your like me and your #1 feature is just to find one that has the best picture\
      \ Quality and just works and plays any file. Then hands down...this is best\
      \ in my opinion  and the one player I come back to anytime I want to watch \
      \ or check out a 3D movie, regular movie, whether it be in 4k, 8k or no K it\
      \ plays them all and never has given me a single problem or even hiccup on me\
      \ while watching anything thru my Headset. The sound itself is just as equally\
      \ as impressive as this players image quality is as well. Def... my player of\
      \ choice.\n\n[url=store.steampowered.com]https://steamcommunity.com/id/killurself2day/[/url"
