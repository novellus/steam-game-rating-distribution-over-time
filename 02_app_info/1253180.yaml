    review: "Don't Recommend \nRefunded. -- Maybe worth <= .49 cents. \n\nThe trailer\
      \ pretty much shows you the entire game. It's that short and simple.  What you\
      \ don't see in the trailer is the specific order you click things to reveal\
      \ seeing the hidden numbers. After you get them it unlocks the capsule releasing\
      \ the zombie inside which shows a little \"dance\" scene and concludes the game.\n\
      \nAs Dohi64 said in his review, go for one of the free flash versions out there.\
      \ \n"
