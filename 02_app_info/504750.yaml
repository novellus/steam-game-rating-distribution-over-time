    review: "I got this game on sale and it cost literally a couple of bucks. If you\
      \ have ever played stratego it is this in space. Fans of it will like it those\
      \ who do not like it will not like this game. Anyway, for those who have no\
      \ clue what stratego is...\n\ndoomstar is a bit like chess but all the pieces\
      \ have different strength. Both you and your opponents pieces are hidden until\
      \ combat starts at which point you can see who has one. There are also a few\
      \ other things like minefields which can kill everything except minesweeper\
      \ ships and light fighters. Some sort of nuke that annihalates anything it hits\
      \ but cant go near blackholes (so guess where the enemy big ships always end\
      \ up hiding) . Black holes can be used to increase your movement as you slingshot\
      \ around them and so control of them can be key. or you can run up the flanks\
      \ and try and take the king (or the command ship) with some fighters winning\
      \ the game easily. \n\nThen the game comes down to placing your pieces strategically\
      \ and bluffing too. Stroll up the middle acting like you are the shit and bluff\
      \ you are using a doomstar, as the enemy fleets fall back, attack the non moving\
      \ pieces. hurrah you had a minesweeper and mines cant move so job done! Or do\
      \ you call the opponents bluff? Do you risk your anti matter bomb, could be\
      \ a doom star...could be a unit of light fighters and that would be an absolute\
      \ waste.\n\nFans of chess should enjoy it. Fans of bluff games like poker may\
      \ also enjoy it. I got it on sale and have enjoyed it. Also online can be playable\
      \ when your opponent isnt online. Asynchronous play is available. Lots of people\
      \ complaining about the single player campaign. Single player is essentially\
      \ a tutorial. Only buy this if you plan on playing online. I have been enjoying\
      \ it so far and just started my first couple of online games."
