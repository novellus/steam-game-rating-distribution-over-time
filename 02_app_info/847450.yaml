    review: 'Solenars Edge Heroes is the arena mode from Solenars Edge Rebirth stretched
      out into a full game, which makes it a bit more interesting because you start
      from scratch and thus the low-level arena fights are actually appropriate, but
      the stretching out with over 60 characters mostly lets you assemble a team of
      the hardest-hitting characters and kill everything in one round, making it somehow
      even more boring than the arena mode was in the base game.


      The earlier complaints I had about Solenars Edge mostly apply, but even harder
      - ten characters instead of eight, and basic attacks that hit 16 or more times,
      rendering most skills useless, except now almost everyone in your party will
      have that level of attack, still a bunch of minigames that are entirely pointless...
      well, the giant, poorly-drawn maps are less of an issue, as most of this game
      happens on a single map.


      On the bright side, at least there wasn''t any boring grinding-down of permanently-stunned
      foes, since you can basically one-turn everything in Heroes. Still, I wouldn''t
      recommend it to anyone - there''s no story at all, and everything goes down
      much the same way to dozens of attacks from each of your characters. Just play
      the original Solenars Edge Rebirth, or better yet, avoid the entire thing.'
