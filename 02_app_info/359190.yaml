    review: Using Steam's own terminology I would rate this "Postive". But just that.
      Not bad for a very limited dev team and fair for a sale price. But there's not
      a lot going on here and both my son and i found some of the puzzles tedious.
      I'd try something. Nope. Then literally every other thing possible. Then go
      look at a walk through video and - oh it was that first thing, but more of it.
      But beyond that, I like low poly games by small teams. It shows that a game
      is possible to make using more artistic flair than capital. I feel good supporting
      efforts like this.
