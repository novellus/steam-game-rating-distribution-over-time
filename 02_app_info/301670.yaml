    review: "[h1]Dear Steam...[/h1]\n[i]Salammbo: Battle for Carthage[/i] looks like\
      \ a great game. With dark and alien architecture, a strange world that is barely\
      \ introduced before you are dropped down into it, and a compelling frame of\
      \ a story. \n\nHowever, Steam is selling a product that is outright broken on\
      \ modern systems. Menus where your cursor is invisible, meaning saving, loading\
      \ and then exiting the menu you opened is a test of patience, a horribly flickering\
      \ quest log, and crashes to desktop from launch. Salammbo: Battle for Carthage\
      \ is a game I bought ages ago and had finally been hoping to get stuck into.\
      \ Unfortunately for me, I left it too late, meaning I can't get a refund. \n\
      \nI have myself tinkered to get other games running before on Steam. Many older\
      \ games simply come with no compatibility options, and you are forced to tinker\
      \ with stuff just to get it playable. Older games on Steam seem to have Bethesda's\
      \ ethos - that is, the consumer will fix all the problems for us. Except we're\
      \ expected to pay money for this stuff. If we paid for a disc that was scratched\
      \ and broken, we'd be frustrated and annoyed with whoever supplied us a disc\
      \ that clearly wasn't working. Really inexcusable. \nSadly I couldn't even find\
      \ this available for purchase on GOG. If you are keen on buying this game, buy\
      \ it with the knowledge you'll have to do some fixing of your own to get it\
      \ working on a system that's remotely modern."
