Who doesn't want to go sulking around in a dark spooky mansion filled with stuff that's going to eat you. That said, the execution and the implementation/UI/UX experience is easily one of the worst I've played in a while. No weapons, just random clicking. \"Shaking the mouse\" to kill something? Really? I wanted this game to be so much more. It looked good from the screen shots. I gave up after 20 minutes. I wish I hadn't bought the combo with the expansion slot.","timestamp_created":1543586789,"timestamp_updated":1543586789,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46Ka8sucCdM6LtAE="}
