    review: '4/10 gave me a headache, some animations are rough or unfinished, the
      campaign dialogue is extremely rudimentary to the point where the writing is
      just insulting. I don''t give bad reviews quickly but this has some pretty serious
      issues and after 7 levels of the campaign I''m not wasting any more time on
      it.

      Some redeeming qualities are the lore, creature design of myth units, the music
      is good and artwork but they fail to make a long time fan of the series be patient
      enough to sit out the glaring issues.
