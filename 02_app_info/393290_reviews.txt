I have the PC version, but unable to play it due to compatibility issues and would have to setup a virtual PC on Windows 98/XP. I thought that they may have re-released the PC version on Steam but to my disappointment, it was the PSX version. The graphics are horrible and there is a lot of frame drops while playing. The PC version play a lot smoother than this and looked a lot better. Why this got put on here with a PSX emulator is beyond me. I wanted the PC version of this game to digitally own. Glad it was only Â£3.99 otherwise, paying more would of just been even more upsetting.","timestamp_created":1599343261,"timestamp_updated":1599343261,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41K6SsPQCc7mFoAI="}
