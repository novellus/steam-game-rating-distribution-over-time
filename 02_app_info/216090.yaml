    review: "Very fun, addictive, pleasant, charming and delightful Tetris-inspired\
      \ tower defense game with great presentation and gameplay. The concept is brilliant\
      \ and works really well, they executed it very well. Very unique take on tower\
      \ defense.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game, found it very difficult\
      \ to stop playing and it was even challenging in places. I had to do a lot of\
      \ thinking (thus strategy) and trial and error like a good tower defense game\
      \ requires.\n\nDefinitely recommended for children and families too. \n"
