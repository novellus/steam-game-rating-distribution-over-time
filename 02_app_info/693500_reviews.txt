The problem is, whenever you make a shot you are flung out with the cannon ball.  This is very unsettling.  I could only play for a very short while before becoming dizzy.  I strongly suggest making that feature optional.  Maybe have a little screeen in the launch area that you can view to shot from or have a playback.","timestamp_created":1509902904,"timestamp_updated":1509916335,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uduBx98Cd8a+igE="}
