It is on the grindy side of things, but it is the kind of grind that is fun and enjoyable because you keep getting stronger relatively quickly. So it is quite satisfying to beat the living heck out of a boss you previously had a lot of problems to deal with. Easily worth the price, so if you like any kind of support role RPG, give it a try!","timestamp_created":1609691319,"timestamp_updated":1609691319,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501845002174377441","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4rYnF5PYCdoGPwAI="}
