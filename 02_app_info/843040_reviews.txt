I've played for 6.1 hours as of this writing.  The first 15 minutes was spent checking out the game without watching the dev's tutorials.  After 15 minutes, I realized that I'll have to watch the tutorials.  The last 5.75 hours were spent following the youtube videos and building along.\n\nThis game is deep, there's a lot to learn.  It's kind of like if Dwarf Fortress and FortressCraft Evolved or Factorio had a baby.  It's very tactical.  You will pause a lot while you set excavation, building and logistics up.  The battles so far are also tactical, in that you'll have to figure out placement as much as firepower to get the advantage, the AI doesn't mess around.  \nThere are hoppers (storage units), factories (depositories), etc and also waves of enemies.  You'll set up power generation and routing.  It's very well documented in the game, every component has a 'wiki' type help page.  So far, there is a lot of manual queueing of the different precursors to the larger machines, but I'm sure there are ways to automate more of the industry.\n\nThe price seemed a bit high for me, but I watched some of videos and thought that I'd like it, and I do.  I did find myself coming back to my tutorial world and enjoying the game.  The controls take a few moments to get used to, but if you've played DF then you won't have an issue.\n\nIt's the wild west though - EDIT: The forums have picked up as more people have bought the game.   There are video tutorials from the dev.  So now I'm on my own to figure out all the wild possibilities.  If you're thinking about purchasing this game, check the videos, try it out and there's always refund.  I am glad I made the purchase and will continue to figure things out and experiement.","timestamp_created":1529928528,"timestamp_updated":1584312632,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538819849491119385","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrIiZ8PACcdOUpAE="}
