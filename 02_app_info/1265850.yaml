    review: For someone like me who isn't the fastest as typing, this game is actually
      a super fun way to practice my typing speed. I was struggling a bit my first
      few minutes of playing, and someone was nice enough to help me get to level
      5 and teach me some of the different game mechanics. I think having a group
      of friends playing this game like a chat based DND would be the best way to
      play it. If you are looking for a cheap but fun group game, this would definitely
      be a good one.
