    about_the_game: "Steve Chong is a failure. Every time he screws up he writes it\
      \ down on a note card and pins it up on his wall. It\u2019s not long before\
      \ his failures run floor to ceiling. The final card is placed when he gets fired\
      \ by his own cousin and ruins his best and last chance with his dream girl from\
      \ work by turning down her offer to cheer him up with a wild weekend out at\
      \ a remote lake house. As he covers the last bare patch on his entire wall of\
      \ failure, he realizes that his life is over and it is time to die. <br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nBut first, he calls up his three estranged friends and invites them\
      \ out to his family\u2019s lake house for one final weekend of relaxation and\
      \ intoxication. John is wrestling with the idea that he\u2019ll have to shave\
      \ off his infamous beard in order to get a job, Tom is busy juggling all the\
      \ women in his life, and Chris is struggling to get over the girl that Tom stole\
      \ away from him long ago. Despite their differences, the four friends head out\
      \ to the lake-house and go on a drinking rampage. Deep into the night, the guys\
      \ mistakenly stumble across Steve's dark secrets and scramble to keep him alive\
      \ through the drunken chaos of the weekend without revealing that they know\
      \ about his death wish. When the girls that Steve turned down earlier show up,\
      \ chaos breaks loose and no one can predict exactly what Steve has planned."
