    review: 'FIRST REVIEW ON STEAM.. FIRST VIDEO REVIEW BELOW:

      (..I only wish I could say that this game was worth my time playing and reviewing
      it)


      NO.  Don''t Do it!  This game, while good enough looking in the trailer is nothing
      but an utter super buggy mess and virtually unplayable.  It feels and looks
      like yet another developer who''s muddled around in the Unity engine enough
      to slap together some assets purchased on the Unity store but who knows nothing
      about actually making the game "work" as intended.


      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5nIVBZWVFk&feature=youtu.be


      The only thing that works in this game is the movie cut scenes.  When you are
      able to take control of the player, you walk through trees, and deer attack
      you on sight which is ridiculous.  So you mindless hit your M1 button to take
      out the deer only to see your character suddenly fall through the ground to
      a "You Died" screen.


      Terrible.  Not recommended.  This game was fortunate to get a 7% (out of 100)
      score from me.'
