      \ 4 hours not the 12 hours i have written in my profile\nIf the game was not\
      \ about the puzzels then this would be an awesome story to follow \nThe puzzels\
      \ range from easy to terrible\nterrible design , almost no instructions , the\
      \ \"assembly\" stage or whatever its called is useless since its grayed out\
      \ and you can barely understand which part belongs where\nthe only way to view\
      \ the specs of the puzzle again is by clicking on the ESC button and they don't\
      \ appear with the color scheme \nthe color scheme also barely helps you solve\
      \ the puzzels but at least its a clue\nif it wasn't for the story i would have\
      \ deleted the game by now\nthe story is nice , the characters are entertaining\
      \ , the fact you get a choice on what to do and how to do it is nice\nIf you\
      \ want to play puzzels , don't buy this game\nif you find a cheat that lets\
      \ you finish the puzzle levels and move on to the story , then by all means\
      \ play it\n(note that this is my 3rd edit , at first i liked the game but the\
      \ more i play the more i see the bad design the puzzles have , i am sure its\
      \ not on purpose but its just not thought out properly)\n\nWell i finally had\
      \ enough , the game is designed for you to fail the more you go through the\
      \ story the less likely you are to finish a ship ( i finished over 20 of them\
      \ , it was not fun)\nim removing the game , i really hoped it would get better"
