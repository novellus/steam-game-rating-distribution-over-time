    review: "I grew up playing this game, and my goodness, did it leave a mark. If\
      \ you're a parent, please get this game for your children. I've just spent money\
      \ on the entire H.E. Set here on steam, I loved it so much. I am over 21+ now,\
      \ and still think about this at least once or twice a year. It's a very educational\
      \ series, and I implore you to get the others or entire bundle. \n\nThis specific\
      \ game is the second game in the set, Kindergarten being the first. I remembered\
      \ the theme song, the colors, the games, and oh my, the stars. I spent hours\
      \ on this, learning more and educating myself on a lot of things school wasn't\
      \ effectively teaching me. It kept me wanting to learn, and not even realize\
      \ I was learning. I would've played all day if my parents let me. Also, good\
      \ time to note, get this game even if you're not a parent. Get it if you're\
      \ an adult or teenager on your own, because the cute quirky graphics and games\
      \ will make you want to get all the stars you can, and I guarantee you won't\
      \ forget it easily. Yes, it looks a little old, and is absolutley made for first\
      \ grade children, but like I've gushed about, its a very good game. 10,000,000/10.\
      \ And hey, H.E., yall should send me a shirt or something if you ever see this\
      \ so I can gush about it more and wear it on tiktok or something haha. Get ALL\
      \ the 20+ year olds playing your games."
