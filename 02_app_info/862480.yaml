    review: "This game touts itself as the \u201Cdumbest puzzle game on the block!\
      \ Son!\u201D And it\u2019s a very accurate description. It\u2019s all in good\
      \ fun, though, as it\u2019s a fun, slapstick comedy that doesn\u2019t take itself\
      \ seriously, at all.\n\nThe focus is squarely on the puzzles with the story\u2019\
      s main purpose being to string a bunch of ridiculous events together to keep\
      \ the player moving from puzzle to puzzle. The puzzles themselves range from\
      \ fun to frustrating, especially the last couple.\n\nThe artwork is reminiscent\
      \ of the Paper Mario cut-out style and works quite well. It\u2019s colorful,\
      \ playful, and enjoyable to view. It\u2019s a bit of a contrast to the overall\
      \ tone to some of the game\u2019s content, which can get quite crude. This also\
      \ carries over to the game\u2019s humor, which starts of okay but gets pretty\
      \ vulgar. It\u2019s pretty juvenile, but the game advertises that upfront, so\
      \ it\u2019s not a surprise.\n\nOverall, a fun puzzle game with colorful art\
      \ and decent music. I enjoyed my time with it and hope to see more from the\
      \ devs."
