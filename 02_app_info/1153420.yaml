    review: 'I like the set a lot. I appreciate the hand drawn feel.


      I love the characters. Personally, I''m not a big fan of the Chibi style, and
      these are the complete opposite. My problem is that I can''t find any other
      character sets that match up to these. Sadly, I may have to suck it up and get
      creative with the included templates.


      It''s a bit pricey, but so is everything else for RPG Maker :)'
