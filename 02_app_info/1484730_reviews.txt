Have an option get rid of the dancing between rounds, we never used it and it just slowed down the game. \n2. Have the answers on the device the players on using as well as the main screen to get around some latency issues.\n3. Since the game is using Text to Speech options for the voicing, some options to change to different voices would be nice. \n4. Adding in a few different topic selector 'games', moving the cursor around is fine but it would be good to have some variation.","timestamp_created":1610058495,"timestamp_updated":1610058495,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wd697/YCfa2ywQI="}
