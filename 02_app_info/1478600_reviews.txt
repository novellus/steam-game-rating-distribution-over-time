Well it`s worth the price! I enjoyed the mix of styles for finding objects and solving puzzles. I enjoyed the multiple HOS as they were straight forward, not too difficult, and I received several needed objects as opposed to the typical one item. I like the storyline, it made me use my brain without being overtaxed or too frustrated and I learned some facts especially about 16th century France. The visual and sound quality were absolutely beautiful. The music was soothing and didn't become annoying as the hour went on. The HO scene were nicely drawn (no Garbage piles with senseless items) and most of these scenes were played differently than other games I have played and the novelty was a real treat. Minipuzzles were a little bit easier than I like it which means I could do all of them without much frustration and never skipped. But for beginners, there is a very good help option throughout the game that always gives you hints. I can honestly say that I did not find any wrong thing with this game and I can recommend this game!","timestamp_created":1608147965,"timestamp_updated":1608147965,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xNLFtvYCfcnjugI="}
