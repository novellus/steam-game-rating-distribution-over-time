    review: I would not recommend this game because you will get the story at first
      but then you will find yourself repeating same paths (just like I was) Not only
      that but $10 for a game where you repeat same stuff? Hell no. I got it on sale
      for $3, still not worth it. It's honestly more of a free game. I will be getting
      a refund so I could buy better games rather than a game where you just repeat
      the same stuff over and over again. I played this game for 47 minutes/close
      to an hour and I STILL found myself repeating same stuff. STILL. There is also
      no actual nudity nor sexual content in the game. So basically, the description
      was lying. Don't buy this game. Especially for 10 nor 3 dollars.
