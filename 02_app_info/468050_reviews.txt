Unfortunately, the writing standard dropped off around the half way mark when the Trial section started. Here the attempts at humor started becoming forced, it went for 'quirky' and fell flat. There should have been less jokes from that point onwards to make you realize how high the stakes were but instead there were more. It didn't contrast well with the previous sections which despite having some humor still kept things serious.\n\nConsidering its often on sale for a quid its not a bad way to spend an hour, I'd still say its worth playing through.","timestamp_created":1607206081,"timestamp_updated":1607206081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ntK8mvYCeILOtwI="}
