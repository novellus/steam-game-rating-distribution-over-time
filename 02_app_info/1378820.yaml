    about_the_game: "When you wake up in Hell one morning, you have two options: stay\
      \ where you are or attempt the impossible \u2014 finding a way out.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nExplore this comical and sometimes scary take on the afterlife. Dodge\
      \ boulders in Sisyphus Valley, run from a swarm of mysterious phantoms, and\
      \ defend yourself from the army of monsters who seem to be crawling straight\
      \ out of your nightmares. Get acquainted with the many people \u2014 \u201C\
      'people\u201D' in the loosest definition of the word \u2014 who inhabit this\
      \ hellscape world. Some will be friends, some will be foes, but it\u2019s not\
      \ always clear which is which! You'll have to make your own choices as you navigate\
      \ your way through the afterlife, so you better determine fast who you can trust\
      \ and who is out to get you."
