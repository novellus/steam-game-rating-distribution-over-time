I love the detail in the game-specific race tracks, among those Crosscode, Duck Game, and Guacamelee, which is what I've barely seen in other Mario Kart 'clones.'\n\nI'm going to be fair though and list some things I didn't like that much (but might still be changed since it's in Early Access):\n- Some of the harder tracks are SUPER hard \n- I didn't like the 'VR Trax' at all, compared to the other tracks \n- Could use more 'popular' Indie characters, such as the Shovel Knight, Celeste, Yooka-Laylee (although the roster is pretty good already) \n\n\n","timestamp_created":1609595669,"timestamp_updated":1609595669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4oJnY4fYCedXdvwI="}
