    review: 'I love the gameplay, that in itself gives it a thumbs up for me.

      Although there are other glaring issues. Mainly the animation.

      The animation is very stiff and a lot of the poses look awkward and strange,
      although this is one of the more glaring issues it is also very fixable with
      a visual rework of some kind.

      The way the menu works is kind of annoying and difficult to use, it''d probably
      be better to have a regular menu so people can navigate it much easier.

      The music isn''t really an issue, although it''d be nice to have different tones
      of music as some of the encounters feel like they could really use the more
      serious tone, even if it''s just by map.

      Character designs. While some of them are perfectly fine, like Percival and
      Edge, some designs seem really boring and uninspired like #1 and the wind fists
      guy.

      And the ai is a bit dumb, but I can''t really fault for that since coding is
      hard.


      The good thing is that all of these issues are fixable, and the actual gameplay
      is really fun. I enjoy the dialogue between the characters and the variety of
      ways the dash can be used. I reccomend for gameplay and in hopes that the aspects
      above are improved upon in the future.'
