You sit there and kill everything. Took me 35 minutes to finish the whole game, including a bathroom brake and replaying the first of three chapters multiple times to figure out if there is recoil and which weapon is the best.\n\nToday you can implement this very basic wave shooter in Unity and some asset store packages quite easily. There are free VR games on steam that do it better than this.","timestamp_created":1607120955,"timestamp_updated":1607120955,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45/T3l/YCcsKttwI="}
