      /><br>You are a blacksmith in the world of the sword, magic and war, in which
      any blacksmith who knows how to make even the simplest swords is in demand.
      You start off as a poor unskilled blacksmith, but in time you will gain experience
      and improve to achieve wealth, fame and power, and change this world!<br><br><strong><i>Fantasy
      Blacksmith</i></strong> is a magically realistic blacksmith simulator in which
      you have to create and sell weapons. Also, your smith will gain more experience
      and become stronger and more accurate with each created sword. You can also
      improve your equipment in the smithy, buy a better forge, better grindstone,
      improve your hammer and etc. We want to create an exciting and interesting simulator
      in which any player can make his dream sword. We are developing the game and
      creating 3D models from scratch. From the finished content, we take the textures
      and effects, and then we rework most of them.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/959520/extras/tenbilvar.png?t=1600962720"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">&quot;You are a smith and you create swords!&quot;</h2><br>
      The creation of the sword begins with the drawing. The sword consists of 8 parts:
      Blade (5 parts), Cross-guard, Handle, Top. You choose the material from which
      the sword will be made. It can be iron, bronze, titan, tungsten, mithril, silver,
      gold, etc. Using the large number of options offered and your imagination, you
      can create a huge number of unique swords. We believe that there may be more
      than 10 billion different swords that you can create.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/959520/extras/drawing_v2.gif?t=1600962720"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">&quot;Using a hammer, beat your ingot into a blade&quot;</h2><br>
      According to your drawing, you will be hammering the red-hot metal to give it
      the shape of a blade.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/959520/extras/forging2.png?t=1600962720"

      make Damascus steel&quot;</h2><br> You will have the opportunity to practice
      alchemy. Using different chemical mixtures of the correct recipe, you can create
      a damask pattern on your sword. Depending on the proportion of the mix of the
      chemical elements, and on the heating and holding the mixture, the result will
      depend.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/959520/extras/alc.png?t=1600962720"

      class="bb_tag">&quot;Feel yourself a witch&quot;</h2><br> One of the most interesting
      parts of the gameplay is making a magic potion. This is a very exciting and
      dangerous process. Having done everything correctly you will get a new sword

      or even destroy it.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/959520/extras/boiler.png?t=1600962720"

    review: "Let me start off by saying that i have many hours on this game. i have\
      \ 6.6 on steam as of writing this, and i'm ashamed to say that most of my time\
      \ was spent on a pirated copy. I do enjoy the game, and now that i have a (somewhat\
      \ stable) monthly income, i bought the game to support the developer.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
      Things you should know:\n1. Read the guide book on the table whenever you get\
      \ confused. and if the guidebook doesn't have what you're looking for, there\
      \ will be a note on the wall near the confusing crafting stations.\n2. THIS\
      \ ONE IS IMPORTANT: at your front door, there is a do not disturb sign. if you\
      \ are like me, you will want to have this down at all times, as the knocking\
      \ of people wanting your attention can be infuriating when you are busy. you\
      \ get better deals by actually answering the door, but that's your choice. \n\
      3. selling your swords adds skillpoints. with 15 skillpoints you get a level.\
      \ add at least your first two levels into mining. thank me later.\n4. tempering\
      \ the sword is finicky, it's not your fault. it is also optional, and improves\
      \ the selling price. if you get it wrong, there's no punishment.\n5. also important:\
      \ press T to check what the item you're holding is. sometimes you might not\
      \ know for sure.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
      Pros: \n1. the game is quite enjoyable once you get into it.\n2. the guide book\
      \ on the table is a great addition.\n3. the swords, despite the strange graphics,\
      \ aren't bad to look at, and the general basics of crafting are solid and satisfying.\n\
      4. the mining is quite fun once you upgrade your mining speed.\n5. the sheer\
      \ amount of variety in materials, parts, and crafting techniques is quite nice.\n\
      6. the feeling of satisfaction when you make a beautiful sword is always enjoyable.\n\
      7. you can make some extremely derpy swords, given some creativity.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
      Cons:\n1. if you don't enjoy repetitive gameplay, this isn't for you.\n2. if\
      \ you want to get anywhere, you have to upgrade mining speed first and foremost.\n\
      3. the physics aren't great, leading to some oddities when moving things around.\n\
      4. the mining sounds are grating, and some relics are much too common. (looking\
      \ at you, ancient amphora.)\n5. some mechanics can be quite confusing, especially\
      \ the damascus plating.\n6. THE MUSIC. turn it off.\n7. the randomly-generated\
      \ anime characters when you get requests. they have a habit of changing into\
      \ a different character when you greet them a second time.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
      Conclusion:\n\nAll in all, if you enjoy a nice, relaxing timewaster with a bit\
      \ of routine, this is for you. i personally love this game, so i recommend it.\n\
      \nTL;DR: good game, a bit wonky. 8/10"
