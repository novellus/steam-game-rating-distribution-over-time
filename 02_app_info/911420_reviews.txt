The developer vanished.\n\nThis is a simple game with an interesting concept.\nIf you played RTS games, you know how you conquer the map step by step: you send a group of units to clear the area and make an outpost then you use that outpost to support conquering the next place and make the next outpost.\nThis game reduces this mechanic to two people which you control in 3rd person mode.\nThey have to build outposts to support the next phase of the journey, to reach the south pole through randomly generated maps which you discover gradually. The enemy is the cold, weather and an occasional polar bear which you can deactivate from the settings. \n((At south pole there are no bears so that is just a trick to add some challenge in the game.))\nThe developer focused on creating a good immersion.\nEdit: As the developer mentioned, by deactivating the competitor (the Norwegian expedition) the game can be played in an even more relaxed way, without time limit.\nEdit2: I found and reported a bug too. Probably will be fixed fast. Meantime I recommend players to close completely the game when they die and start a new one\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/911420/discussions/0/1868371178633118450/#c1868371570999718030","timestamp_created":1584811432,"timestamp_updated":1598680167,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.444444417953491211","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1584843396,"developer_response":"You can turn off the Norwegian expedition in the settings, thereby removing the time element in the game, leaving you free to take your time.\n\nSimilarly, you can turn the beer off in the settings should you choose"}],"cursor":"AoJ4pe6wnPQCf6Dp+QE="}
