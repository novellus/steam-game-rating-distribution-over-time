I have no clue what to do. I moved my crew around by right clicking and then clicked the cannonball to shoot, and that's pretty much it.  I never actually won a combat because it felt like it was going to take a half hour of simply clicking one button. So I surrendered. Then on the world map I had no idea what to do but a few seconds later I was in another combat and lost my cannon. So I lose?\n\nThen in another battle both my crew died, but I was able to surrender and sail around again until I got into combat and could do nothing.\n\nRefunded.\n\nWas hoping for a game similar to the naval combat in Pillars of Eternity 2. This is not that.","timestamp_created":1600626748,"timestamp_updated":1600627224,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547945201396942139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3KW01vQCc/mEowI="}
