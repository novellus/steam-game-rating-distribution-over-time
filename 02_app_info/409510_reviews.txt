By a few I mean ONE THING IS OFF:\n\n-The loading Screen.\n\nSo I started up my game thinking what I was gonna build... maybe a cool farm house or an epic mine!...\n\nSEVEN F*CKING HOURS LATER\n\nI'm still waiting... Like EVERYONE ELSE HAS SAID ABOUT THE GAME.\n\nI might still be trying to play this game... of I've given up because theres no F*cking point trying because all you see is the loading screen for hours, If the creator(s) of Genesis are/is reading this... PLEASE For the sake of all of us... FIX THE DAMN LOADING SPEED\n\nIf you get this game because of me then I hope you like Loading Simulators because THIS SURE DAMN IS ONE OF THEM.\n\n11 Months Later...\n\nSo I created a New account to see if the loading time effected that account and... WTF DO YA KNOW?! The game starts up.\n\nI'm done. Just.
