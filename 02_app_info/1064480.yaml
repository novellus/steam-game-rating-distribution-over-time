    review: 'Well I have played only about 30 minutes of the game, I say for a first
      time developer and publisher, AS Games did a great job. Considering the price
      it is well worth it. Like most games I feel that its not super different from
      any other but it is fun to play. Though i get frustrated already at the beginning.
      The con for this game is that i find that you side scroll faster than going
      forward which i used to my advantage later in the game. Overall, for the price
      of the game and what you get out of that I do recommend this game.
