    review: "For $1 [b] Hollow Throne [/b] is a decent roguelite, assuming that you\
      \ have realistic expectations. Unfortunately, this game is all about high scores\
      \ and the leaderboard is broken, otherwise this review would be marginally positive.\
      \ The game can be beaten in about 30 minutes, but it could take you a few hours\
      \ of practice to do so. There are a several interesting artifacts that can customize\
      \ your gameplay experience, that could add a lot of replay value if the leaderboard\
      \ was working. Some people have a very hard time in the beginning, it's actually\
      \ not that bad as long as you upgrading your health on the first level-up; if\
      \ you really suck just get the burger item and it will give you massive HP.\
      \ The environment has 4 stages that show up in any order, but they are not randomly\
      \ generated.\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ good variety of artifacts\n+ it is fun\
      \ to level up and grind stats\n+ 2 playable characters\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\
      \n- some glitches\n- broken leaderboard\n- no infinite mode\n- poor soundtrack\n\
      \n[b] Overall Thoughts 5/10 [/b]\n\nThis developer is obviously not very experienced\
      \ , but I think that Hollow Throne had some potential. It could really use an\
      \ infinite mode and more achievements for extra replay value. I would only recommend\
      \ it for die-hard fans of the genre, be prepared to deal with some technical\
      \ problems. \n\n[code]If the game shows some improvements, I will consider removing\
      \ this review. Please contact me if you have updated your game and want a revision.\
