Playing through levels slow and carefully is sufficient to finish the game, but using \"slingshots\" and moving quickly across planets is very satisfying once you have a hold on movement.\n- The game is very short, with it being possible to fully complete in probably an hour if you are very fast. (This is a positive for me as I tend to like compact games that can be replayed)\n- The co-op is pretty fun, and sort of reminds me of Portal 2 in a way.\n\nNeutrals:\n- Some of the enemies such as the slimes in the water planets and laser turrets are very annoying and inconsistent. They aren't impossible to get past however.\n\nNegatives:\n- This game would heavily benefit from some type of jetpack or something to do to save yourself once you leave a planet's atmosphere. Throughout my time playing this game, my most common death was misjudging a jump and immediately flying off into space with no way to recover. Just adding some way to reorient yourself and make it to safety would make the game much more fun. Having a stricter time before death would be fine this way as well.\n- A minority of the levels are affected by RNG, mainly in worlds 3 and 4 that can be frustrating.\n\nOverall: It's a short fun platformer that is harder to get good at then it looks.","timestamp_created":1563702852,"timestamp_updated":1607543504,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwyOfDpPYCdJflzgE="}
