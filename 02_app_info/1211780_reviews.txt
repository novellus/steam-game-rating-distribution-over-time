I have a 1050 TI and my card can handle a lot of games except for this one.\n2) You DONT HAVE ANY SETTINGS OPTIONS! WTF. I PRESS ESC AND THERE ARE ONLY RESUME GAME OPTION AND EXIT. NO OPTION OF SCALING, OR GRAPHICS OR EVEN SOUND.\n3) RANDOMLY GET STUCK IN BLACK SCREEN WHEN OPENING VENTS, WHICH FORCES YOU TO EXIT THE GAME. THERE ARE BETTER PUZZLE GAMES THAN THIS ONE.","timestamp_created":1580236843,"timestamp_updated":1580236843,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/5Td9u8Cf9re7gE="}
