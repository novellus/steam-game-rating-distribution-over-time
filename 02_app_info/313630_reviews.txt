Frustrating in places, but if you like exploring puzzle games you'll love it. \n\nWord of warning for VR players though, it can cause alot of motion sickness, and doesn't have proper loading screens so level transitions are brutal. The end game cutscenes are also...buggy...in vr.","timestamp_created":1609787754,"timestamp_updated":1609787754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4fi05/YCdsG9wAI="}
