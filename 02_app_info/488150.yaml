    review: "[b]VR EXERCISE RATING:[/b] HIGH\n[b]GAMEPLAY RATING:[/b] FAIR\n\nI quite\
      \ like this game, it's barebones indeed but what it offers is high intensity\
      \ action sort of like a tron version of Holopoint. You'll get sweaty and your\
      \ throwing arm will tire so it's a great title to burn a few calories while\
      \ being distracted. There's skill required so it feels rewarding getting addional\
      \ points for accuracy and completing waves. The visuals are good enough and\
      \ the physics feel realistic.\n\nHowever the title remains in EA without an\
      \ update since July 2016, so consider this game abandoned by the developer so\
      \ I'm giving a thumbs down as warning. What you're getting should be considered\
      \ the complete game. With that said I'd still consider the gameplay worth \xA3\
      3.99 in it's current state, but loathed to recommend since the developer has\
      \ effectively put two fingers up at us.\n\n[h1]30 minutes exercising in VR[/h1]\
