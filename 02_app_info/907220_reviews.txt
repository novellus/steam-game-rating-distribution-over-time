The game is beautiful and original in it's look.\n\nThat being said, you are prompted after about 20 minutes of gameplay that the full game will be available on Steam. I think they uploaded the demo as the actual game so I have to thumbs down until that gets fixed. It sucks because it's actually a lot of fun to play.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PTY1MPXZtM","timestamp_created":1538585159,"timestamp_updated":1538585159,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.75816643238067627","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41cy0neYCfZr6qwE="}
