    review: 'I got 20 levels in and couldn''t stand it any more. It''s horrible.


      * no (or broken) controller support, store page falsely claims full controller
      support

      * same music keeps playing over and over again, starting at the beginning of
      the loop every time you beat a level

      * extremely repetitive

      * cloud jumping is absurdly clunky

      * tries to be a puzzle platformer but you can easily brute force your way through
      puzzles without even doing what was obviously intended

      * no polish to speak of

      * has a ''new game'' and ''continue'' option but both of them start a new game

      * I paid $10 for this


      You can get much better games for $10.  In fact, go look at the main landing
      page and ctrl+f for "under $10". There, there''s a list.'
