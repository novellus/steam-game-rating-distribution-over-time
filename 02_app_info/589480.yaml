    review: "Let me explain in this way. What am I guessing is that when the creators\
      \ were making this game, they thought to themselves: \"Let's make something\
      \ cool!\" And as a result, they did made something cool. That is all, It's only\
      \ cool and nothing else.\n\nThis game doesn't have any kind of direction for\
      \ its motive. Things happens in this game, but I don't have any kind of reason\
      \ to care for it. The game just moves by itself, without thinking about me.\
      \ It's not trying to take my interest; All it does is moving the mystery.\n\n\
      As a player you keep asking to yourself: \"Why should I care about this or that?\"\
      \nThe characters for an example. They purely exist for giving you the information\
      \ you need, so the main character plays it cool and talks smoothly with them.\
      \ Alright, but why should I care about the main character's objection?\nThe\
      \ game doesn't even give you a clear explanation on what she wishes for. In\
      \ certain stories that is fine, but you gotta put some kind of thing for the\
      \ reader to care about. Especially at the beginning.\nThe way this visual novel\
      \ starts... Just plainly direct. When the opening started I couldn't believe\
      \ it, What I had just read did not felt like a prologue at all; It was just\
      \ a boring casual scene and nothing more.\n\nThe side characters has their own\
      \ problems that connects with the mystery. \nThey will get in your way and that\
      \ fact will make them unlikable. Every single trait of theirs is connected with\
      \ the mystery that I had no reason to care about, so bye bye the possibility\
      \ of me caring about the characters.\n\nWhat do you think was the biggest mistake\
      \ that the game made? \nNo music. I do not care even a bit if it has some in\
      \ it... It rarely plays anything. Like, that is probably one of the worst choices\
      \ that you could possibly make in a mystery visual novel where you needed to\
      \ have the reader's attention. You could give the characters some cool ost and\
      \ from the music we would 'feel' the character. Maybe that would make it way\
      \ easier to read the dialouge(I was sleepy while playing the game.) \n\nThat\
      \ said, I was not expecting this game to work on my laptop; considering its\
      \ high quality look and effects. It is definitely one of the most beautiful\
      \ looking EVN ever made. It looks cool, very cool. \n\nYes, just cool-looking.\
      \ That is all there's to it."
