    review: "[h1][u]Story[/u][/h1]\nThere's a tiny bit of story about the main character\
      \ traveling to a dungeon in search of riches. \n\n[h1][u]Gameplay[/u][/h1]\n\
      The main gameplay is based around being a platformer with specific timing of\
      \ jumps, controlling the strength of each jump, and understanding how to reach\
      \ the end of each stage. As you progress further into the game the stages will\
      \ become more elaborate and tricky.\n\n[h1][u]Difficulty[/u][/h1]\nThe difficulty\
      \ of the game falls upon timing jumps, learning the maps, when to move, and\
      \ controlling the strength of your jumps. Basic things for a platformer.\n\n\
      The first two sections, grass and water, are simplistic enough for anyone to\
      \ get through. Fire will start to push people who don't normally do platformers\
      \ a little harder. Gold is where it gets difficult for those who don't play\
      \ platformers and annoying, for some, for those who do. The final stage which\
      \ unlocks after getting all gems was just annoying from the screen shaking and\
      \ scrolling screen which kills the character if it scrolls over you. That was\
      \ one of my most hated things from old games back in the day (scrolling screen).\
      \ In the character's world what kills them? The screen on your monitor/tv?\n\
      \nThe two extra chapters are Sand and Ice. Sand is relatively simple enough\
      \ though some of the stages are annoying. Ice was just terrible in a few stages.\
      \ One of them as about jumping over spikes by the very tip of the platform to\
      \ make jumps. Anything less and it would kill your character. On the same stage\
      \ you had to rely on an ice block for each section of it. Multiple times it\
      \ became heavy like a big block and wouldn't slide like ice should which forced\
      \ deaths. A pretty bad bug to be honest especially for a time run attempt.\n\
      \nSince the game has unlimited lives you have endless attempts. I'd say the\
      \ difficulty doesn't really show until you go for the \"Complete the X Dungeon\
      \ with X or less deaths\". Otherwise everyone should be able to finish all dungeons\
      \ if you're playing just to beat everything.\n\n[h1][u]Graphics[/u][/h1]\nThe\
      \ graphics are great and really do remind me of SNES titles. Probably one of\
      \ my favorite things about this game is the graphics and colors hands down.\n\
      \n[h1][u]Sound/Music[/u][/h1]\nBoth the sounds and music match the game's theme\
      \ and are enjoyable to hear.\n\n[h1][u]Performance[/u][/h1]\nNever had any issues\
      \ with the game myself and I'd wager it would run just fine on about any type\
      \ of computer so long as they are not ancient bricks.\n\n[h1][u]Summary[/u][/h1]\n\
      The game is very reminiscent of older platformers in not just the gameplay but\
      \ the overall design. It's a smooth experience in controls but very unforgiving\
      \ in how you need to land jumps which is understandable in a platformer. The\
      \ game ramps up in difficulty as is expected but certain stages relied more\
      \ on annoying gimmicks over actual challenge. A great game in general but won't\
      \ be for everyone especially if they don't love platformers. This is one of\
      \ the games I would give a neutral rating to if I could but Steam's rating system\
      \ won't let me. As it personally wasn't that enjoyable in the later sections\
      \ I'm going to have to give it a negative review instead.\n\nI should state\
      \ that playing with a controller will make the experience far easier and enjoyable\
      \ compared to using a keyboard like I did all the way up to Gold.\n\nIf you\
      \ enjoy platformers I'd say pick it up and see for yourself if you will love\
      \ it or not.\n\n\n[h1][u]Notice[/u][/h1]\nThis review, as with all my reviews,\
      \ are my own personal thoughts and opinions on the game it is for. Whether I\
      \ like it or dislike it / recommend it or not recommend it: it does not make\
      \ it any more valid than someone else's view on the title. I also will not review\
      \ a game based on a score system as those review designs are flawed. Mainly\
      \ because a perfect score reflects perfection and no game is perfect.\n\nIf\
      \ I happen to like/recommend a game it doesn't mean I'm blind to any potential\
      \ flaws it may have nor does it mean I'm going to defend the company/devs who\
      \ made it. If I happen to dislike/not recommend a game it doesn't mean I hate\
      \ the devs or the players who like the game. My reviews are solely about the\
      \ game in question not the devs who made it or the players who like/dislike\
      \ it. Not every game is going to appeal towards each person of which applies\
      \ to me as well and in no way is there anything wrong someone liking/not liking\
      \ a game.\n\nIf the game I'm reviewing is a online game, be it PvP or PvE, please\
      \ use [url=https://steamcharts.com/]Steam Charts[/url] to see how populated\
      \ the game is. You don't want to waste money on a title with no players in it.\
      \ Just be sure to also take into account games that have crossplay like Microsoft\
      \ titles. They generally have smaller player bases on PC but if it has crossplay\
      \ you generally don't need to worry about small PC player bases.\n\nMy reviews\
      \ might be changed down the line if something gets altered in the game that\
      \ would warrant an update to said reviews. I may update my reviews as well if\
      \ I feel they can be done better."
