    review: "It\u2019s not bad, but it\u2019s for preschoolers. I can imagine this\
      \ will only appeal to said children and people who played it in their childhood.\
      \ I wouldn\u2019t recommend it otherwise. It offers nowhere near enough for\
      \ it to be worth \xA315.\n\nAt least it runs great on modern hardware for an\
      \ old game. Although it\u2019s locked at 800x600, and the cars\u2019 eye whites\
      \ are darker than they should be."
