Would be awesome if you could somehow save and playback what you have created and just experience it again and hone it in so the visualisation is perfect for the song of your choice. Wishing aside if you enjoy mind bending visuals set in a dome shaped club with an amazing backdrop of the cosmos where you can control a vast array of lighting effects to the music or you can  just kick back and let it auto to the beat  this is head and shoulders above other music visualisers ive tried in VR and well worth picking up","timestamp_created":1515188934,"timestamp_updated":1515247342,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm/Lx5eACduaSlQE="}
