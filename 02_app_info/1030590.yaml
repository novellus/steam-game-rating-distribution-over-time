    review: 'Quite literally the better deal through Steam. For the same $20 through
      the in-game store, all you get is the 2500 Mercury Points. Through THIS starter
      pack, you get the same MPs, XP boosters (Important btw), 25,000 gold, AND 4
      weapons you can build for free for the most popular Raiders.


      If you''re thinking of putting any cash into this game, buy this pack. It''s
      literally better than the in-game shop''s version.


      - For those who don''t know -


      - Mercury Points is MAINLY for cosmetic stuff. This is F2P, You should know
      how this works by now.


      - Gold is used for purchasing Raiders, buying weapons/upgrades and changing
      your guild emblem, etc,.


      - XP boosts help a ton cause you can only recruit a Raider or reach upgrade
      milestones once you''re at a certain level in-game. XP boosts speed this up
      greatly. You''re still gonna grind it baby, but why grind longer than you have
      to?


      - FOUR straight-up weapon blueprints! These are almost as valuable as cash since
      it means you don''t need to grind for weapon parts, nor do you have to pay gold
      or even deal with build time. Just upgrade as you see fit, hit build, and it''s
      yours. A blessing!


      Note: This game is always in a state of change and updates. Sometimes MASSIVE
      updates that change how weapons are built, or how talents are acquired. As of
      writing this "review", all of the above is true to the best of my current knowledge
      lol


      Peace out! Mika is life BTW!
