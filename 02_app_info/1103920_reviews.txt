The most obvious issues are bugs (which tend to reset your progress in different areas from time to time - I recently bought the banana upgrade, but now it wants me to buy it again), and lack of progress balance. The idea is interesting, but it's the implementation that needs work. If it is updated at some point in the future, where all the glaring bugs are fixed, I may pick it up again, and recommend it. However, I cannot do that now.","timestamp_created":1597885556,"timestamp_updated":1597885556,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0tTZhPQCdvHEnAI="}
