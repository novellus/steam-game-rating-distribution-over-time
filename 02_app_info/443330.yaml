    detailed_description: "<h1>Fixed the bug in which the save data was in the same\
      \ folder as Tokyo School Life's save data.</h1><p>To restore your save data\
      \ for Malus Code, please follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Go to \r\nC:\\Users\\\
      (PC name)\\Documents\\M2\\ \r\nand backup the folder named \u201CTSL\u201D,\
      \ and also the \u201CMC\u201D folder if it exists. \r\n\r\n2. Make a duplicate\
      \ copy of the previous save data folder:\r\nC:\\Users\\(PC name)\\Documents\\\
      M2\\TSL\r\n\r\n3. Rename the copied folder to\r\nC:\\Users\\(PC name)\\Documents\\\
      M2\\MC\r\n(If the MC folder already exists, please delete the existing folder\
      \ before renaming.)\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Start up Malus Code and continue playing as\
      \ usual.\r\n\r\nIf you have previous save data from our other game, Tokyo School\
      \ Life, the TSL save data may still be displayed in Malus Code. You can remove\
      \ those saves by overwriting them, or just deleting them after following the\
      \ above steps. The same applies to if Malus Code save data is displayed in Tokyo\
      \ School Life.\r\n\r\nThanks for you playing, and we\u2019re very sorry for\
      \ the inconvenience caused by this bug.</p><br><h1>Patch Notes\uFF1A\u3000Malus\
      \ Code Ver 1.02</h1><p>We enclosed a complete save file for Tokyo School Life\
      \ in Malus Code Ver 1.02.\r\n\r\nThis is a save file for Tokyo School Life that\
      \ unlocks all of the content in the Extra menu, meant for those who lost their\
      \ data due to the bug in Malus Code Ver 1.00.\r\n\r\n\u30FB Do not use this\
      \ save data for Malus Code.\r\n\r\n\u30FB You will overwrite TSL's save data\
      \ file (data_000_0000.bin), so please back it up in a safe location first.\r\
      \n\r\n1. Go to\r\nC:\\Users\\(PCname)\\Documents\\M2\\TSL\\savedata\r\n\r\n\
      2. Rename the existing data as follows:\r\n\r\nRename\r\ndata_000_0000.bin\r\
      \nto\r\ndata_000_1111.bin\r\n\r\n3. Locate the following file in the directory\
      \ you installed Malus Code in (default path shown below):\r\n\r\nC:\\Program\
      \ Files\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Malus Code\\windata\\tsl_complete_savedata\\\
      fdata_000_0000.bin\r\n\r\nCopy fdata_000_0000.bin to the following folder:\r\
      \n\r\nC:\\Users\\(PCname)\\Documents\\M2\\TSL\\savedata\r\n\r\nThen rename it\
      \ to\r\n\r\ndata_000_0000.bin\r\n\r\n4. Done!\r\n\r\nNote: This will only effect\
      \ the content in the Extra menu (music jukebox, gallery), so your save slot\
      \ usage will remain the same as before.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>- Malus\
