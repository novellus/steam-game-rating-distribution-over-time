It‘s just that some of the DLC are less crappy than others. \nSince i don’t want write an individual review for every DLC, this covers all of them. \n\nLet’s start with the less crappy ones:\n„Crew expendable“ and „Sole survivor“. There is really not much too say about those two, apart from that they are directly inspired from scenes from the first alien movie and that they are extremely short. We are talking about half an hour maximum for each of them. They are playable, but simply too short to waste more than maybe a buck or two on them.\n\nThe rest of the DLC are map packs for survivor mode. „Corporate lockdown“, „Trauma“ and „the trigger“ each consist of 3 small, short maps, while „Lost Contact“ and „Safe haven“ are just one big map, that is at least twice the size of the others, has 10 objectives and takes considerably longer to beat.\n\nThe problem that pretty much ruins the all the dlc is the fact, that you can‘t lower the difficulty (except for crew expendable and sole survivor, which can be played on any of the difficulty modes). As far as i can tell, the maps are set on nightmare difficulty, which is never fun in this game. 95% of the time the alien is right at your heels and even if you manage to hide, it just sticks around for way to long, just waiting until you leave your hiding spot. It makes completing the required tasks a very frustrating and unfair ordeal. In safe haven and lost contact you can safe inbetween the missions at least but in the other 3 dlc, there is no safe function. If you die, you go all the way back. The maps of the other three can either be played in a row (you carry all your weapons and resources over to the next map, but if you die, you always need to restart from the first map) or individually (less frustrating when you die, but you always start the next map only with basic loadout). I strongly recommend playing the second way, because if you die on the third map and have to restart from map one, there is hardly anything more rage-inducing.\n\ni completed the main game in about 18 hours, and it took me another 17 hours just to complete the dlc. It's not because the dlc is so long, it's because it's so f****** unfair and unbalanced. If you are good you can finish the 3-map dlc within 15 to 20 minutes each, but if you are not a super-patient alien isolation pro-player you WILL DIE A LOT which really ramps up the time necessary to complete even the shortest of maps. \nThe safe haven and lost contact missions would roughly take an hour each to complete, but since i died so often it took me 3 to 3 1/2 hours for each of them to complete. Like i mentioned earlier, those two have a safe function, but the progress is only safed as long as you are playing. If you leave the game, all your progress is erased and you have to start over again, so you have to finish them in one sitting, (and i think not that many people have 3 spare hours that often).\n\nNevertheless IF you  HAVE TO buy dlc for alien isolation, I'd suggest taking either Safe Haven or Lost Contact, since they have the most value for their price and sometimes even come close to being slightly fun. Otherwise I'd say, just play the campaign of the base game again, which is way better designed and much less frustrating than this.\n\n( ) 0/8 Simply one of the worst games ever made. Don't waste any money on this.\n( ) 1/8 Bad. Seriously flawed with barely any redeeming qualities. Worth a couple of Cents at best, if at all.\n(X) 2/8 Sub-par. Only for hardcore-fans of respective genre / series. Don't pay more than 5 bucks.\n( ) 3/8 Meh-diocre. It‘s okay. Don't pay more than 10 bucks.\n( ) 4/8 Decent, but not for everybody. Don't pay more than 15 bucks.\n( ) 5/8 Good game, Must-play for genre- / series-fans. Worth 20 to 25 bucks max, if you are not a fan.\n( ) 6/8 Great game, universal recommendation. 30 bucks would be a steal for this.\n( ) 7/8 Outstanding game, a milestone of it‘s respective genre. Definitely worth its full prize.\n( ) 8/8 Simply one of the best games ever made. Get this, the prize doesn't matter.","timestamp_created":1582225053,"timestamp_updated":1605798227,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.789931893348693848","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w43C8PUCcvPD8wE="}
