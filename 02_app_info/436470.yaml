    about_the_game: 'The Gamma Brothers spend their days working on a huge space station
      near Jupiter.  No one works harder than the Gamma Brothers. What could they
      possibly be working on? Something very important, no doubt.<br><br>The Gamma
      Brothers also understand the importance of not working.  Every day at quitting
      time they hop into their commuter vehicles for the long, difficult journey back
      to earth.  Every day on their way home, they are attacked by ships and creatures
      of unknown origin. Every day, to and from work, they must survive many vicious
      and clever alien attacks! <br><br>It is up to YOU to guide the Gamma Brothers
      home.  Prepare yourself for the ultimate space commute battle!  After all, it
      is dinner time on earth, and the Gamma Brothers'' families will not be pleased
      if you don''t get Buzz and Zap home safely.<br><br>Gamma Bros is totally FREE.

    review: 'If Pixeljam made Gamma Bros. 2 I''d buy the ever-loving shit out of that
      game.


      Gamma Bros. is the best twin-stick space shooter to ever be invented and I love
      every second of playing it. I just wish it were longer.'
