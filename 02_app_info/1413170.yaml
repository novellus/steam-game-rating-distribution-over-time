    review: This is a nice procedural FPS! The particles are very good. The core feedback
      loop is stronger than I expected. Enemy attacks have a good bit of diversity
      that make them play well in different matchups against the player. This is a
      good foundation by the dev and I'm excited to see what they will do next!
