My monitor's refresh rate is over 60 and the game MUST run at 60fps.\n\nBesides that the idea of a racing game switching context is exciting and the transitions are good in Grid Gunner. The handling isn't bad but it's very slippery so it feels like drifting everywhere. I wish they took it further and incorporated even more game types. Where's the FPS switch!?\n\nIt's very difficult to get into the game though since it's not a traditional race. It's only about finishing so one slip up and slide off the edge and it's game over. You have to restart. That's too much when the game is rough. You can hit a jump, land on a wall, and then have to restart. It's terrible and frustrating. A more traditional race (time trial) would have been a lot better. I also don't understand why the game makes you collect time if you can fall to your death anyway.\n\nVisit my youtube channel for something else: https://www.youtube.com/user/peppage?sub_confirmation=1","timestamp_created":1549221991,"timestamp_updated":1551794075,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4186Ip+kCcbb3uQE="}
