      and cinematics soundtrack of the Strategic Mind Franchise in both MP3 and WAVE
      formats. <strong>All revenue gathered in 2020 from its sales will be spent on
      creating more tracks that will be added in this very soundtrack without additional
      fees. Become a supporter who helps us expand the soundtrack!</strong><br>We
      have trouble investing a lot into the expansion of the soundtrack, so if you
      like our job so far, please consider supporting our effort by buying this soundtrack
      - all net earnings (after tax and Steam share) will be invested into more tracks.
      We will post reports in September, December, and January informing you on the
      amount of money gathered and on how we use it. (We expect one 3-minute-long
      gameplay track to cost us around 200-250 USD). So, for example, if we get 1000$,
      we can add 4-5 new tracks. You can also consider buying more then one copy if
      you want to further support our effort. <br><strong>Base content</strong> (what
      you get at the moment):<br>11 gameplay tracks and 18 cinematic tracks. (see
      full list below)<br><br><strong>Future content:</strong><br>New tracks will
      be added at the time of Strategic Mind: Spectre of Communism release, in Q4
      2020. There will be both Starni Games supported and community-supported tracks.
      The number of community-supported tracks will depend on the sales of this soundtrack
      over the course of 2020 (all proceedings from sales will go towards new tracks).
      We plan to make polls about some of the possible new additions. Some of the
      tracks will also be added to Strategic Mind: Blitzkrieg and future games of
      the series. <br><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1341170/Strategic_Mind_Spectre_of_Communism/"

      This soundtrack does not include many of the Strategic Mind: The Pacific tracks
      (it has only 4 gameplay tracks from The Pacific by Rustam Shafigullin), as we
      do not own the rights for the rest of the tracks, we had a license for 1 commercial
      product use only. However, starting with Strategic Mind: Blitzkrieg we started
      using compositions written and performed by Daraba Studio exclusively for our
      games, so all Blitzkrieg and future tracks will be added to this soundtrack.<br><a
