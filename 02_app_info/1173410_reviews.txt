At the start of the game you talk to Sally who talks about who she is and her role. At some point she talks about looking around the farm and then the game crashes. I then rebooted the game up and began researching some achievements for the game to see if this game is truly an achievement game. The first achievement I found was click on Sally's Milkers in the main menu and as I thought. After clicking on her, the game crashed again. I tested out several other things such as save before the intro scene ends, uninstall and reinstall, verify file, and quiting the game early to see if that might help. Final verdict. Dont buy this game, if your doing it for the content of achievements, you wont get any here, if your doing it for the content of lewd. Look to PHub to find that. Not worth the $5 for a game you cant play.","timestamp_created":1609801551,"timestamp_updated":1609801551,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ycnp5/YCdODEwAI="}
