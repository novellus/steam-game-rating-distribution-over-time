    review: 'A great game about leading a troubled nation through a difficult time
      period.

      Gameplay wise it''s basically a choose your own adventure story where decision
      have a significant impact on the fate of your administration, your country and
      the international political situation as a whole.

      Lots of options that all seem equally valid and many hard choices keep it interesting
      throughout.'
