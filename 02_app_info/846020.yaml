      notes: "- The theme \"Death\" is present throughout all the game story and environments.\r\
        \n- The game features succubi which expose cleavage.\r\n- At some point in\
        \ the game, there is some under-toning of sexual references."

    review: 'This was a fun game. I really enjoyed it. Even though the battles were
      difficult, they made me think about how to win and that to me is great to see
      in a game. I don''t like just grinding to win and this game shows that even
      if you have good equipment, that you still need to plan before each battle.
      The story is really cool and the gameplay does something different and I loved
      it. The visuals and the music are great. My only real problem with the game
      isn''t even something that I can really complain about considering that the
      game was made in a month. It is that that the game had some really bad slowdown.


      I highly recommend this game.'
