    review: 'Surprisingly fun tower defence game! Would recommend picking it up for
      a couple of quid.


      Works great on Linux.


      Things to know:

      - You can place towers on the sea blocks

      - There is a hard limit on the number of towers so it requires some thought

      - Planes are hard, as you cannot reroute them like ships'
