To be honest, it's only the 2nd VR game that I've played thru (The Room VR being the first.)  There were several \"Jump Scares.\"  It was definitely fun to let the story unfold.  Not too complicated of a game.  There were several parts (scenes) that were enjoyable to see.","timestamp_created":1608940253,"timestamp_updated":1608940253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49P2TzvYCdfuavQI="}
