Simple to play with a one-button control scheme, but challenging to master.\n\nI cleared the game my first time in about 23 minutes, and with Gravity Ship in 12. The game clearly wants me to optmize and refine my play to become a true speedrunner, but as fun as it is I found it surprisingly stressful!\n\nThere aren't many music tracks in this game, but the ones that are there fit the mood wonderfully and is exciting in the right places. I had a good time! And I kinda wish this game had been in arcades back when I was little. It would make a lovely quarter-muncher!\n\nThis game is suitable for all ages and all skill levels and for the price tag is a nice way to spend a weekend.","timestamp_created":1581219120,"timestamp_updated":1581219120,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuKCAlPACd+2I8QE="}
