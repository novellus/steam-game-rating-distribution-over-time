    review: "Overall this game was fun and cute, but had some glaring flaws that I\
      \ hope are fixed in a future version/final version, but from the developer notes\
      \ I don't think they will be. \n\nPros:\n- Unique/novel mechanics interacting\
      \ with the environment (picking up pots and hitting enemies with them, picking\
      \ turnips, other environment interactables)\n- Very cute art style\n- Good level\
      \ of polish on the UI/environment\n- Fun mechanics with positioning + mutation\
      \ power ups\n\nCons:\n- The biggest con is the run length. The first run took\
      \ me over an hour, just because there was so much content. It became really\
      \ tedious.\n- Difficulty. I maybe had to use the rest site once? But I probably\
      \ would have lived without it. Most of the combats were not very challenging,\
      \ especially if you are experienced in the genre at all."
