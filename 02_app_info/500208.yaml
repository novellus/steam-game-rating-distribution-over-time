    review: I bought this DLC today and my oh my this plane can do aerobatics which
      is surprising for a large turboprop plane like this. I was talking to a friend
      who flies Shorts Tucanos and he said that us brits should have had these instead
      of the Tucano. Ive seen a Pilatus 9A in real life and they are awesome. Very
      highly reccommend this to anyone who loves turboprop or POWERRRRRR!
