    review: 'An excellent cross between a visual novel and a picross game. The puzzles
      were not overly difficult but were always relevant to the story. Lots of humor
      in the storytelling. The ending was not at all what I expected  and I really
      liked where it went.  The game only saves at the end of each location which
      can sometimes be frustrating if you need to quit but don''t want to lose progress.
      The characters were generally silly but the end had a bit of seriousness to
      it that made for a very enjoyable effect overall. I can''t really call it a
      dating sim but it would be fun to romance all the characters again.

      If you enjoy humor, romance, picross puzzles, and a good story then absolutely
      buy this game.'
