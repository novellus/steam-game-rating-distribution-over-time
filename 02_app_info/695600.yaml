    about_the_game: This Grand Life is a personal finance simulator where you create
      a character, manage their money and help them achieve their life goals. Cruise
      your way through life with a silver spoon, or struggle endlessly to find employment
      as a convicted felon. You cannot control your past, but you can change your
      future. What choices will you make?<br><br>Inspired by Sierra's 1990 game <i>Jones
      In The Fast Lane</i>, your life is divided into weeks. You try to accomplish
      as much as you can each week while economic conditions and special events create
      interesting choices to think about. Do I go to work this week, or take part
      in the Hot Dog Eating competition at the park? Should I spend time looking for
      a better job, or stick with my current job until economic conditions improve?<h2

      [i]This Grand Life[/i] is the ultimate game in the niche of casual management
      games where the player works to earn money, satisfy needs, and ultimately towards
      living a, well.. Grand life!  Games can take place in either New York, Amsterdam,
      Berlin, or Sydney with the first game only being focused on earning money. Once
      the first game is successfully completed, players can start new games in which
      categories of [i]lifetime happiness[/i], [i]education[/i], and [i]collections[/i]
      can also be designated as criteria for successfully completing games. [i]This
      Grand Life[/i] also has a "zombie mode" in which players have to find time to
      make it to the hospital and undergo treatment (while playing an ever-increasing
      fee) in order to keep the game going.


      [h1]Graphics and Sound[/h1]


      The graphics are a simple 2D map of the city that the player has chosen for
      their home, but the only thing that really stands out about the graphics, are
      the creepy-looking characters.

      Sounds are all basic bells and whistles that add nothing to the game, nor does
      the music help with setting in the mood despite what the store page claims,
      but ol'' Il Pallino advises players to turn off the music and sound and play
      [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHhOUYdg2S8]How To Be A Millionaire[/url]
      by [i]ABC[/i].


      [h1]Positives[/h1]


      Ol'' Il Pallino has the vice of providing objective information in reviews,
      so rather than just write "everything not related to the graphics and sound"
      for [i]positives[/i], the first great feature is that [i]This Grand Life[/i]
      has tangible differences between each of the cities, each with their own unique
      problem, but with many different advantages.  Financial sector jobs in New York
      are better paying, factory jobs in Berlin are also better paying, Amsterdam
      has coffee to consume, and Sydney has select days where the player can [i]throw
      shrimp on the barbie[/i].


      Although the game ultimately encourages players to make their money by starting
      their own businesses, not only are there a lot of businesses, but there''s also
      a lot of different occupations with several top-paying occupations good enough
      to maintain the highest standard of living.  Every map has both a technical
      school and university where players can study a huge variety of subjects that
      lead to either the top-paying jobs or are used as a gateway towards self-employment.
      Libraries also have hobby courses that can be applied for to satisfy either
      lifetime happiness and educational goals.


      Apart from completing collections of various knick-knacks, participating in
      special events, and acquiring more knowledge in one''s life, [i]This Grand Life[/i]
      also has lifetime happiness that can also be worked towards in the form of finding
      lovers, getting married, having children, and raising those children correctly.  If
      players find themselves in a bind for trying to raise a child on a lower income
      while married, the spouse can be freed-up to work by enrolling children in daycare.


      [i]This Grand Life[/i] also allows for the player to adjust [i]advanced settings[/i]
      to help make the game experience more unique. If the player thinks the default
      [i]central bank vigilance[/i] makes for too calm of market conditions, the setting
      can be adjusted to make the market more volatile.  If the player is confident
      of their playing keep their health up," the player can totally slash the healthcare
      budget for the sake of reducing taxes.

      [i]This Grand Life[/i] also allows for five different types of upbringings to
      determine difficulty, so that the n00bz can get lots of points to apply towards
      positive traits and/or starting education, while the 1337z can be forced to
      start the game with numerous (user-defined) negative traits the player can hope
      to manage.


      [h1]Negatives[/h1]


      The sliders to set goals for  [i]money[/i], [i]lifetime happiness[/i], and [i]collections[/i]
      have too low of a maximum setting when compared to the slider for [i]knowledge[/i].  The
      player can satisfy the maximum need for [i]money[/i] before they can afford
      to buy their first upper-class housing. The player can also satisfy the maximum
      need for [i]collections[/i] with missing items in their collection.  (A player
      in Berlin merely needs to purchase a garage and high-end car.)  The player will
      also have no problem satisfying the maximum requirement for lifetime happiness.  However,
      if the player sets the [i]knowledge[/i] slider to the maximum, the player is
      going to need to earn numerous degrees, complete all of the hobby courses at
      the library, and earn numerous certificates from the technical school and government
      for the sake of acquiring knowledge.


      [h1]Conclusion[/h1]


      There is no better "personal tycoon" (for lack of a better term) on the market.  If
      the player wants a casual turn-based game to play while they''re having an instant
      message conversation with a beloved friend either to pass the time or use for
      conversation material, [i]This Grand Life[/i] is that game!  Let it be known
      that [i]This Grand Life[/i] is to management games what the [i]Space Pilgrim
      Saga[/i] is to story rich games:  Indie [strike]gold[/strike] platinum!
