In fact, it plays as it it was still in testing.\n\nThe game has lots of input lag, movement controls are not precise, The custom part creation is a colossal pain in the ass to use due to the game denying any form of precise movement, up/down movement both for moving the camera and for moving parts can be rather tricky when making blueprints, it is near impossible to find a database on this game, and the game makes a separate Repository (blueprints) for each game mode for some bizarre reason. That wouldn't be too bad if the dev made any effort to explain that you can copy blueprints between the Repositories (but it doesn't and you find you find out by yourself)\n\nAs that said, this has the potential to be a great game, but as it is now, it's mostly a headache.\n\nThe game also makes it look like you have more control over your tanks than any other RTS (having a unit capable of flight land, having a walker type tank retract it's legs, having all selected tanks look for a repair pad to resupply at, etc. and yet it lacks something as simple as the ability to control whether your tanks give chase or not or even making units smart enough to stay away from water when the game is smart enough to know they won't flaot when you construct  them. This is especially notorious during Campaign 4 in which amphibious tanks will attack your tanks then retreat to the lank to sink them)\n\nLast but not least, this game is a prime example of the computer is a cheating bastard. In most campaign missions, no matter how long you camp the enemy Factory, even if they have no harvesters, they never run out of Pellets. You can't have both a cheating AI and a smart AI, it's one or the other. When AI are given cheats, it is to compensate  for lack of intelligence.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game I would say is that you claim \"units obey the laws of physics\" and yet terrain is not destructible in any way shape or form which means a massive walker which would trample over trees is completely blocked by them.","timestamp_created":1609670738,"timestamp_updated":1609690823,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lZfD5PYCe/WDwAI="}
