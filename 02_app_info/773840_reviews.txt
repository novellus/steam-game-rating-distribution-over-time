Even in single player, it is basically just you against the clock, something which I wasn't expecting. It would appear that each section is just teaching you how to master certain aspects of the track you're on, then the last challenge is the entire course. It's not to say that I don't enjoy this, but I'd appreciate other AI opponents.\n\nThe graphics seem really great, but there's not a lot of content right now. There are only two locations, which equates to eight tracks, and three playable vehicle with different skins. I have opened two vehicles, but am not sure how to unlock the third, perhaps it's with getting better times on the tracks. \n\nThe racing physics seem a bit difficult. Sometimes it seems that it's a bit difficult to get it to go into a slide, but when you do get it to slide, it's sometimes hard to get it to straighten back out. I'm not sure if this is because it's trying to be extra realistic, but it'd be nice if there was just a slight bit more grip and if it were easier to get it to go into and out of a slide. This is just my personal preference, and others may like it the way it is.\n\nIn its current state, it's hard to say if it's worth buying at this time, but I do believe it will get there as more updates come out. I feel it is a fun game, but it's probably best to try the demo, and understand that if you purchase the game that not everything will be available yet.","timestamp_created":1609111117,"timestamp_updated":1609111117,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4zOOf0/YCd6r1vQI="}
