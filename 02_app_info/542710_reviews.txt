Graphical elements are uninspired. Gameplay is sluggish, disrupted by unnecessary animations and imprecise detection of clicks and drags.\n\nAs I've read on numerous Steam reviews, I wish Valve would give the option to give products a \"Neutral\" rating.\nSince this isn't possible, I always prefer to leave a positive rating. But know full well that this game is weak, only worth it 'cause it's almost free.","timestamp_created":1575447665,"timestamp_updated":1575447665,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lvP/5+4Ccpnr4QE="}
