    review: 'If you are into abstract strategy games, Bao is a pretty cool game, it
      is also quite complex though.

      It does take a while to truly understand the game (after playing about 2 hours
      I did understand most of the game, however that is probably not enough time
      to become good at it). You have to really concentrate, kinda like with chess.

      The tutorial is good for learning the basics of the game, and I guess you have
      to just play against the ai to really practice.

      The music is nice but I only use it when I start because I still have to concentrate
      on understanding the game.

      All in all, would recommend.
