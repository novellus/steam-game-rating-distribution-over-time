So much ocd mining, gathering , building , planning , learning. It's nice to have a game not so focused on the end game or xp grind.  It's 3d which is definitely a benefit for me, the graphics are beautiful. It is third person, which i've learned to deal with it's not too obtrusive with the character in the way. The method of dealing with the interface is very different than most. equipping things, etc. The learning curve can be real as I discovered different things, how to expand. Where to find resources, that I couldn't find before. I hear a big update is upcoming, if what i've seen in the discord via the devs is any sign it's going to be amazing:) Definitely worth checking out, Hop in the discord, come chat. Come play:) \nsome fun tips: can't find wood? .. run around the pod looking things appear to be more there. Also careful while running through the woods they are littered on the ground.  A good relaxing easy going game. I love it, one of a handful of games i've purchased on steam, out of the 6000+ games i've sorted through on \"discovery queue\" .. but i'm particular I suppose.\nIt's got some bugs, but easily reportable in the discord directly to the devs, but hey.. it is early access:) Quite impressive for small dev but active and interactive team.","timestamp_created":1603260891,"timestamp_updated":1603260891,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ49/fypPUCcYaYqQI="}
