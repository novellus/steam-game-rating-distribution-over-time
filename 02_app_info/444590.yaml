    short_description: Discover the secrets of the estate, as you look for answers
      among the violent inhabitants. A strange and repelling madness took hold of
      the servants roaming the halls, and they will attack on sight, for their madness
      is one rooted in a deeper understanding of cosmic insignificance.

    review: "This was a pretty good game. I didn't expect anything, I just really\
      \ liked the pixel graphic design as it reminded me a little of Count Lucanor\u2026\
      \ I didn't even know what kind of game it's going to be exactly, but I loved\
      \ it!\n\nIt starts simply. You are pulled from your grave to stop the Fog from\
      \ spreading. To achieve that you have to defeat the one who beckoned it. The\
      \ path won't be as simple though. You need to navigate a large mansion and its\
      \ grounds filled with twisted servants to find Beckoners Knights, who hold the\
      \ keys to him. Among the enemies you can meet NPCs who will shed a bit of a\
      \ light on the situation and events that lead to the spreading of the Fog. But\
      \ beware as every step brings you closer towards insanity and you can see the\
      \ world twisting. Can you fulfill your quest and overcome these horrors?\n\n\
      The pixel graphic is perfect. Twisted (this word really suits this game), bloody,\
      \ gory\u2026 the deeper you go down the rabbit hole, the nastier it gets. Pretty.\
      \ <3 Soundtrack is setting a great feeling to the spreading insanity. Story\
      \ is very interesting, to fully comprehend it you have to search every crook\
      \ to find more and more of the lore (there are a lot of things to click at).\
      \ The game is full of Lovecraftian symbols, hints and it creates a pretty creepy\
      \ atmosphere! Although there is not a lot of space for some deep character development\
      \ I find them nicely written, they are interesting, enjoyable and likeable (even\
      \ hate-able - good thing)! Luckily it has sequels so here I hope for some new\
      \ information on my favorite ones. ;)\n\nControls are\u2026 well strange and\
      \ it took me some time to grow accustomed to them, but after that it was fine.\
      \ Fight is challenging, very much. Just getting through the tutorial level cost\
      \ me more than 5 deaths. But even though you will often die, it's not frustrating\u2026\
      \ well, for me at least. I haven't rage quit as with some other similar games\
      \ (if we consider the fact that some are describing it as \"Souls-like\" then\
      \ it's a miracle as I have quit the Dark Souls after, eh, 6 hours). In total\
      \ there are four different endings, you also have New game+ which gets the difficult\
      \ level in crazy highs and it's a little slap on your face as you get better\
      \ and really strong and then you start anew and again you die in a tutorial.\
      \ XD There are also two challenge levels after you beat the game, insanely hard.\
      \ I have done it after getting the four endings and playing through it two more\
      \ times.\n\nI have enjoyed Skautfold very much and can't wait to start the next\
      \ game! There is only one thing I didn't like and although I maybe understand\
      \ why it wasn't available (as it has a continuous purpose), I still think it\
      \ should have been an option. The inability to do so made me rather disappointed.\
      \ If you like pixel graphics, horror settings and novels from H.P.Lovecraft,\
      \ I can only recommend it to you!"
