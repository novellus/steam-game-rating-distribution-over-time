    about_the_game: "Heroine Kayo is the daughter of a food and tea house who is living\
      \ with her father in Edo. One day, a Tokugawa samurai came with an order of\
      \ life and death, that is, disguising as the princess and joining in the false\
      \ bridal procession. The samurai said that Kayo and the princess are two peas\
      \ in a pod. Thinking that the food and tea house would be hard to run if she\
      \ refuses, Kayo set her mind to accept this assignment and started her trip\
      \ in T\u014Dkaid\u014D. In this visual novel, you will play the role of Kayo\
      \ to interact with the samurais. You can control the storyline with different\
      \ selections and unlock 24 endings of 6 main characters.<br>Ken ga Kimi has\
      \ been critically acclaimed since it was first released in 2013, and now you\
