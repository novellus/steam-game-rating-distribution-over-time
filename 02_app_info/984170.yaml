    review: "Despite the strong resemblance to a HOG in both visuals and gameplay\
      \ and being tagged as such on the Steam store page, [i]The Seven Chambers[/i]\
      \ is only a puzzle adventure, completely devoid of hidden object scenes. It\
      \ plays exactly like a HOG in the sense that it\u2019s first person, and your\
      \ character goes from one location to another, gathers various items in the\
      \ inventory that are used later in order to unlock puzzles and mini-games.\n\
      \nBased on the exquisite presentation, at first sight [i]The Seven Chambers[/i]\
      \ seems to be a high budget game. The visuals are impressive and I could easily\
      \ call it \u201Cthe most beautiful HOG I\u2019ve ever played\u201D (except it\u2019\
      s not a HOG, but you get the idea...) and in terms of cutscenes and character\
      \ design, it surpassed all my expectations. Each location is more wonderful\
      \ than the previous one, and all the characters are nicely drawn, especially\
      \ the eye-candy Hamish, ([spoiler]your lover from a previous life[/spoiler])\
      \ who looks like he just stepped out of a fashion catalogue. Your adventure\
      \ will lead you through a forest glade beside a lake, a fiery underground realm,\
      \ a magical grove, a castle with gardens full of roses, an Egyptian-themed room\
      \ and many others - each of them displayed in HD; this game breathes beauty\
      \ through every pixel. But sadly that\u2019s how far their budget went, since\
      \ the other aspects of the game remained undeveloped and somewhat unfinished.\n\
      \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1993070813\n\nFirst\
      \ of all, the story is a bit of a train wreck; it doesn\u2019t naturally flow,\
      \ it feels extremely fragmented. You play as Elasaid, a girl who fell into a\
      \ coma and needs to traverse her sub-conscious, relive her past life as a Highland\
      \ Warrior and follow an esoteric path to reach the \u201CSeventh Chamber\u201D\
      \ which will somehow make her wake up from her coma. The historical setting\
      \ of the 18th century makes it a game heavily influenced by astronomy and alchemy\
      \ and while normally I greatly enjoy these topics, I disliked how they were\
      \ used in the game. A plethora of concepts related to these themes are included\
      \ in the story as object names, places, characters etc. but there is nothing\
      \ to bind them together. What you get as a result is a mix of concepts: alchemical\
      \ and astrological symbolism, constellations, planets, sacred artefacts or historical\
      \ items blended with Greek, Roman and Egyptian mythology. It feels that the\
      \ game tries to accomplish something but it can\u2019t decide what. Maybe my\
      \ opinion is also biased by the fact that the diary (that usually describes\
      \ in a few words the story up to that point and your objectives) has been completely\
      \ abolished and replaced with a lore book (beautifully drawn if I must say)\
      \ containing a brief explanation of some of the symbols, but nothing much to\
      \ help you solve the puzzles whatsoever.\n\nSymbolism aside, the game also doesn\u2019\
      t manage to develop the characters well enough and their side stories are almost\
      \ non-existent or left unsolved, unexplored. What\u2019s the point of having\
      \ such beautifully crafted characters if you\u2019re not given a way to connect\
      \ with them or get to know their background stories? Ultimately, at the end\
      \ of the game, they feel like precious dolls in a shop\u2019s showcase, untouchable.\n\
      \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1993070649\n\nIn terms\
      \ of difficulty, there are a few puzzles that offer some challenge but most\
      \ of them have an average difficulty and are often encountered in HOGs. The\
      \ real difficulty comes from the fact that you don\u2019t have a map (not even\
      \ on \u201CNovice\u201D), no way to fast travel and no indications on the available\
      \ actions, which will make you run back and forth through all the locations\
      \ in order to find out what you have to do next. Things are made even worse\
      \ by the fact that locations aren\u2019t split into separate groups (per chapter\
      \ for example, with items acquired and used only among those 4-5 locations)\
      \ and you can end up having to go back from the end towards the beginning of\
      \ the game. If that wasn\u2019t enough of an annoyance, you get to hoard a huge\
      \ lot of items in your inventory (2-3 pages is quite common for this game),\
      \ which means that you will have a lot of unsolved puzzles that you have to\
      \ keep track of in your mind. \u201COk, I got this round object; for which of\
      \ the 5 puzzles that require a round object is this one and where were they\
      \ again?\u201D is something you might end up saying quite often\u2026 Without\
      \ using a hint / guide, the gameplay becomes extremely frustrating especially\
      \ if you can\u2019t play [i]The Seven Chambers[/i] in one sitting (I had to\
      \ take a 20h break and when I came back to the game I had already forgotten\
      \ where I had to use any of my 16+ items that I had collected by then.\n\nAchievement\
      \ hunters will be disappointed to find out that despite in-game achievements\
      \ existing, the Steam ones haven\u2019t been implemented so far. A [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/984170/discussions/0/1741101364302758397/#c2944710017721197398]reply\
      \ about this topic[/url] has been promised for months, but never came, and I\
      \ think we can safely assume that these will never happen.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1991911923\n\
      \nBugs? I encountered twice the same issue: most of the interface froze after\
      \ finishing a puzzle; once I was lucky that the menu button still worked, but\
      \ the second time the game didn\u2019t respond at all, not even to an Alt-F4.\n\
      \nPuzzles well explained? In general yes, but not all. Even if you\u2019re a\
      \ veteran HOG player, you will still find 2-3 puzzles that have unclear indications.\n\
      \nPrice? A bit better compared to the the exorbitant way of Artifex Mundi pricing\
      \ their latest games, but still quite high for the 3h of gameplay that you get\
      \ from it. On the other hand, the art and the delightful soundtrack could be\
      \ well worth spending a bit more money than what you would otherwise spend on\
      \ an average HOG.\n\n[quote]More reviews on the [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/11354094]Lilly's\
