I REALLY wanted to like this game.\nUnfortunately it has extreme frame rate issues on my setup (1-5 fps usually). \nIf this game was optimized it would be a great tool for music production.\nI dont have any issues with any other games, VR or otherwise.\nHopefully this game will get a patch to make it usable. Until then stay away.\n\nMy PC:\nHTC Vive (Gen 1)\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-5820K CPU @ 3.30GHz\n16 GBytes DDR4 1066.5 MHz\nNvidia 1080 TI\nIndex Controllers\n\nUpdate: 6/28/2020\nI still have not given up on this game, even though it seems the devs have.\nI did more troubleshooting. The game works decently well so long as you do not touch the touch pad, or joystick. As soon as you give any input to a touch pad or joystick the frame rate drops and you have to quit and relaunch the game to fix it. Sadly this bug does not seem like its going to be fixed as the devs look to have abandoned this project.\n\nThere is still some issues here, as this game desperately needs a tutorial due to its complexity.\nI'll update again when I have a chance to actually use this product instead of just troubleshooting it.","timestamp_created":1578874604,"timestamp_updated":1593400392,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwlI+E//ICft3S6wE="}
