    review: 'A humble but entertaining game... It worths the price.

      Pros:

      No microtransactions.

      3 free expansions.

      Cons:

      The last announced expansion is delaying a year to be released.

      I completed every achievement but Steam didn''t add it to my "perfect" games.'
