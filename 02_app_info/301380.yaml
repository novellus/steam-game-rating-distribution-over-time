    review: 'Oh this Game is great, Storyline, Artstyle, Music.

      Everything fits very well, I give it a 9/10.

      Could have been a bit longer to be perfect but that''s just my opinion

      still an excellent game.


      So for the details, before I hop onto them.


      One or two sentences that someone like to know something about me or read this
      on my profile.


      I got interested in Visual Novels(VN) because of an image board(4C), namely
      because of Katawa Shoujo

      (10/10 perfect Game, never would have touched VN''s otherwise, enough advertising)

      I can clearly hear the stereotypes echo through my head, whatever, storybased
      Games have their appeal, too.

      This was clearly fascinating, after some browsing, I found VN''s on Steam and
      decided to give it a try.


      Just to inform anyone, your character is Janet, the girl.

      I was mistaken first and thought the game played around a guy again, which tricked
      me a bit into buying it,

      paired with the good reviews.


      But to cut it short, that did not make me regret my purchase.

      I got hooked to the story nearly instantly,

      The characters have depth, they develop, they change.

      It is like a good puzzle, the backgrounds fit quite good together, not too good
      nor too bad.

      With a frame of circumstances that change, to a certain point where it get''s
      resolved in one way or another.

      It''s just compelling to know how your decisions play out in the end, hoping
      right into it,

      reaching one end of the 12 endings, reaching the climax, always with the elements
      of the unknown.

      It makes you question yourself, this is a talent many games lack:

      To think about what happend,

      what is similar to you, is there a lesson, can you apply that to yourself, what
      can you learn from it?.

      Can you feel it: the story, the characters, the game?


      The minigame for choices, sometimes a little offputting, sometimes it makes
      you think twice about the choice you make.

      It''s not usual for VN''s but I think it is a neet feauture for the overall
      scifi/magic type of novel.


      But I didn''t get tired of it, the atmosphere, the overall product is something
      that makes really sense in itself,

      I''d call it finished, it is complete in a story sense and everything gets wrapped
      up pretty good.


      I can fully recommend this masterpiece.


      PS: The perspective of a girl is very interesting, too.'
