The location of the pages are non-random. Chosing one of the 2 wrong pages gets you the bad ending and choosing the right page gets you the good ending. There's no in-game clue as to which page is correct, it's mostly just using common sense.\n\nBesides pages, you also pick up health kits, water, and pills. Health kits restore your health, water restores your stamina, and it's unclear what pills do.\n\nThere are two enemy types; wolves and the maniac. They don't seek you out, they're just positioned around the map and they attack you when you get too close to them. You run away from both of them, and they should lose track of you before you run out of stamina. The maniac walks around the village area and doesn't really do anything special besides chase you if you get too close.\n\nThe outdoor map is actually pretty small; most of it is closed off with invisible walls at the edges. I've only found 4 points of interest; the cabin, the camp ground, the farm, and the village. The farm and the village are right next to each other and are the main points of interest on the map. The rest of the map is pretty much empty with nothing going on.\n\nFinishing the game doesn't take very long; it can be done in about half an hour if you're just wandering around or several minutes if you know what to do.\n\nGames like Witch Hunt or Putrefaction or even something like Ghostship Aftermath or even Rake or From Dust show that a single self-taught programmer can actually make a decent game out of store-bought assets on their bedroom computer. Outside is not a game like that. It's not even at the level of something like a VIS-games product. Hell even things like Walden and the Werewolf, Share, Night Catcher, or even fucking Evil Park, which were all terrible, are still more of a game than Outside.\n\nThe word \"asset flip\" gets thrown around a lot, often inaccurately. However, Outside really is barely more than an asset flip. It's pre-purchased models dumped into a pre-purchased map, with the bare minimum of gameplay to quality as an original product. \n\nDefinitely not a recommend, even at only $1.","timestamp_created":1589156762,"timestamp_updated":1589156762,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmfrHgPICf8T5hgI="}
