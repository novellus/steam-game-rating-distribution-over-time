    review: 'I updated my review after the dev helped me get past an obstacle:


      I like MCI Escapes. I''m surprised it doesn''t have more of a following. It''s
      definitely an overlooked gem providing a different kind of play experience.
      I love coming across something new. I''ve been playing video games since the
      early 1970''s, so am always delighted when a game takes me to new places. The
      story telling is cheesy, but it has a creative way of getting you introduced
      to the game, and the overall design is new. It has good music and nice graphics.


      It has its flaws, though. It''s a bit rough around the edges and has a few annoying
      bugs, but none that are game breaking. The worse is pausing and un-pausing the
      game can reset your character back to the beginning of a level. That''s only
      a real problem when level exploration is important for advancing the story.
      As mentioned, I think the story telling, especially at the start, is a little
      lame. But that''s OK; MCI Escapes isn''t about the story, so much.


      Is it worth the price? Yes, I think very much so. The game play may not be lengthy,
      but it''s enjoyable in its current state. I like what I''ve seen so far, and
      hope it grows.'
