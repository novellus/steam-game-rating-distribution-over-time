    reviews: "\u201CThe presentation here is quite nice. It has some fine artwork\
      \ against attractive backdrops; as Alice would say \u201Cwhat is the use of\
      \ a book without pictures?\u201D Some occasional light animation livens things\
      \ up. The musical tracks, while public domain, have been thoughtfully selected,\
      \ and mesh rather well with the scenes they accompany.  The narration, and various\
      \ voices for the memorable characters, succeed for the most part (they can be\
      \ turned off if desired). All of these elements add together in bringing a further\
      \ element of life to the fantasy.  Occasionally choices will pop up. The selections\
      \ seem to amount to little more than potentially skipping small portions of\
      \ the story, but they do add an element of interaction to a  style of release\
      \ not known for such. I feel this is a very good title for fans of the original\
      \ tale, fans of visual novels in general, and families.\u201D<br><a href=\"\

      What I found was a great way to bring books to people in a whole new platform.\
      \ It was exactly what you would expect, a book given graphics to tell the story.\
      \ Controls were simple! It is not a game. I think visual novels sometimes get\
      \ a bad rap because of incorrect expectations. You aren\u2019t playing at all.\
      \ You are being presented a story. Keeping that in mind, I really enjoyed the\
      \ experience. Real life backgrounds and colorful characters were something new.\
      \ I could see this being perfect for young bookworms who have disabilities.\
      \ But don\u2019t take my word for it, check it out.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.abilitypowered.com/alice-in-wonderland-wii-u-accessibility-first-look/\"\

    review: "(English_Fran\xE7ais review)\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/37930390-Mia-Curations/]My\
      \ Curations[/url]\n\nENGLISH:\nAnother visual novel adaptation of Alice in Wonderland.\
      \ \nCompare it to \"Book Series - Alice in Wonderland\".\n\nBRG'S Alice in Wonderland\
      \ has an easier to read font, images closer to the story (non manga and no characters\
      \ are sexualized and humanized/feminized for animals, like the white rabbit),\
      \ and more enjoyable music.  \n\nBRG'S AiW also has full dubbing (narration\
      \ and characters). \n\nBRG'S AiW was designed with Visual Novel Maker. \n\n\
      Unfortunately, as with \"Book Series - Alice in Wonderland\", made with Tyranobuilder,\
      \ there are engine issues in the game. I've had several crashes and the images\
      \ glitching when I wanted to skip some text. Still, the visual story is playable.\
      \ \n\nBRG'S AiW is available in French, like Book Series - AiW, but it's a partial\
      \ translation, because the characters keep the English names. The game interface\
      \ is not translated either.\n\nTo conclude, despite the glitches I had, I recommend\
      \ BRG'S AiW as the best visual story of Alice's Tale available on Steam. Easy\
      \ to achieve 100%. Go for it!\n\nFRAN\xC7AIS:\n Une autre adaptation d\u2019\
      Alice aux pays des merveilles en histoire visuelle. \nComparons-la \xE0 \xAB\
      \ Book Series - Alice in Wonderland \xBB.\n\nBRG'S Alice in Wonderland \xE0\
      \ une police d\u2019\xE9criture plus facile \xE0 lire, des images se rapprochant\
      \ plus du conte (non manga et aucun personnage n\u2019est sexualis\xE9 et humanis\xE9\
      /f\xE9minis\xE9 pour les animaux, comme le lapin blanc), et de la musique plus\
      \ agr\xE9able.  \n\nBRG\u2019S AiW a aussi un doublage int\xE9gral (narration\
      \ et personnages). \n\nBRG\u2019S AiW a \xE9t\xE9 con\xE7u avec Visual Novel\
      \ Maker. \n\nMalheureusement, comme avec \xAB Book Series - Alice in Wonderland\
      \ \xBB, fait avec Tyranobuilder, il y a des issues de moteur du jeu. J\u2019\
      ai eu plusieurs plantages et les images qui glitchaient en voulant sauter du\
      \ texte. Malgr\xE9 tout, l'histoire visuelle est jouable. \n\nBRG\u2019S AiW\
      \ est disponible en fran\xE7ais, comme Book Series - AiW, mais c\u2019est une\
      \ traduction partielle, car les personnages gardent les noms anglais. L'interface\
      \ du jeu n'est pas traduite non plus.\n\nPour conclure, malgr\xE9 les p\xE9\
      pins que j\u2019ai eu, je recommande BRG'S AiW comme \xE9tant la meilleure histoire\
      \ visuelle du conte d'Alice disponible sur Steam. Succ\xE8s faciles \xE0 obtenir.\
