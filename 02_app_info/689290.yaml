    review: 'i bought this game twice, first time asked for a refund due to no snap
      turn, said i would buy it back if it was fixed and it was so im back.


      theres a bunch of bugs nothing game breaking, but the developer seems to be
      working on it all again and support it. its a fun little grind to get all of
      the parts and build your perfect little buggy. as long as you have good enough
      parts you could finish ever race first try not hard. for $1 you really can not
      go wrong with this neat little game. i havent been able to play multi player
      yet  so i cant comment on it.'
