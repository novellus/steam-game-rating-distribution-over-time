    review: 'This isn''t a texture map so don''t expect graphics to change with this
      purchase.


      However, if you fly in a place that is familiar to you, this add-on better maps
      the terrain. A few back country airports I am familiar with which had incorrect
      topographic terrain in game. After loading this, I flew to a few of those airports
      and found it was an improvement over the terrain mapping from the basic game.


      I bought at half price and purchased both West Coast and Mountain as I do a
      lot of VFR flights to back country airports so it was worth the value. But if
      you are going to be at FL altitudes, the only benefit you''d probably see is
      the descent or climb when in proximity of an airport.


      The only negative aspect is I get a small but noticeable snapping like effect,
      moving from less detail to more detail, when viewing at a distance and when
      looking out the side windows. Makes if feel like the FPS are getting affected.
      I have a VR computer with GFX 1070 so that effect wasn''t expected. Will play
      with settings to see if I can improve as I run Active Sky and it was a pretty
      complex day for weather.'
