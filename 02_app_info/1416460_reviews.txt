Small length horror game, it would take you about an hour and a half to finish, but if you're going for the freakin Candie achievement gonna take you much more time (and still to this day i'm out of luck to find the last goddamn candie lol)! \nIs very tricky cause it's dark and you have to look everywhere with the flashlight. \nThe puzzles in the game are not to difficult if you're pay attention. The map is not too big. You can see it every time you feel you lost the trail, but soon you'll memorize it. Everytime you feel the witch is near..you'll need to close the flashlight, stay still and always crouching. You'll see her patroling the forest in spiderwalk stance everytime you're outside. \nGet the treats and find about the missing kids! \nA nice one if you want to spend some relaxing hour :)\n\nP.S At last i found the last damned candie :P","timestamp_created":1608831222,"timestamp_updated":1608988852,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522277951240539551","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8q/Nz/YCe53qvAI="}
