    review: "A good addition to the base game. Since most of the game oriented towards\
      \ late game/experienced players and zubmarine routes, buying this DLC makes\
      \ sense. DLC adds some new places, stories, enemies, a new ambition and some\
      \ new mechanics like current, sonar, mines, loots and abysses. Even though there\
      \ are 11 new ports, it doesn\u2019t have more content than the base game of\
      \ course. Although most of the new content are interesting, they are awfully\
      \ short and independent from each other, or they have only one small connection.\
      \ Moreover, most of the problems in base game consist; tedious gameplay, slow\
      \ progression, no consequence or reward. Still, if you liked Sunless Sea, you\
      \ will probably like this DLC too."
