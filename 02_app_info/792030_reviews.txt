While there is nothing extraordinary about this game, for those with a few minutes to spare, it is a game that will bring a small smile to your face as you help the hapless protagonist through his awkward life. This is a game where even through all the mishaps and stumbles, you never really \"lose.\" Rather, this is more of a snapshot of someone's life rather than a game, having no conditions of \"win\" nor \"lose.\" Whatever you do, it will all work out in the end. I need not to elaborate too much more beyond this, as a visual novel like this is more appropriate for self-experience than for an unknown reviewer like to tell you anything. Play this, for you will enjoy it.","timestamp_created":1588571808,"timestamp_updated":1588571808,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkMSQ7/ECft+4hQI="}
