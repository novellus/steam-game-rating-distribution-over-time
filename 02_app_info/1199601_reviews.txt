They are the same images as what are used in-game for puzzles, though I suspect a much higher quality. I can't be sure without extracting the files from the game itself, but by [i]purchasing them[/i] you support the artists and creators, which is great. In my opinion, 1920x1080 is the bear-minimum, and I would like to have seen higher-resolution images. Many users have big-big screens, and they will prefer bigger images to go with them. There are no obvious watermarks, which is a big win for me. If you enjoyed the in-game art, I highly recommend this DLC.","timestamp_created":1578794721,"timestamp_updated":1578794721,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47vPfy+8Cc8q36wE="}
