    review: "Ich muss sagen, die Strecke ist SEHR realistisch (abgesehen vom Rollmaterial).\
      \ Die strecke ist ebenfalls sehr sch\xF6n und idillisch. 30 Euro sind nat\xFC\
      rlich nicht wenig, weshalb sich die Strecke auch eher im Sale lohn (wie alle\
      \ anderen Strecken auch).\nDie Inselbahn hat von mir eine klare Kaufempfehlung\
      \ :D"
