    review: I originally played this game back when WildTangent was forced onto every
      Windows computer. After learning that this game still exists, I decided to purchase
      it and experience a nostalgic trip. I'm honestly surprised that I enjoyed this
      game even a little when I was younger. There is no game at all. You get on,
      feed your fish, sell a few, make them have babies, then get off for almost the
      whole day (even on 2x speed). Then you get on again and feed, sell, and f**k.
      Next morning- feed, sell, f**k. That's all there is to it.
