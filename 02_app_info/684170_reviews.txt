You can take as many moves as you like to make a pattern, with the goal of making the least moves possible. Clearly not many people are on the score board to date as I was able to get in the top 10 first try for most levels. Not a game to really challenge you, just quietly slide pieces around until you get the pattern. If you like the old sliding puzzle games this should be fun enough!\n\nI got this on special - you would definitely not want to pay full price for this game, but for a couple of dollars is certainly worth it.","timestamp_created":1609358574,"timestamp_updated":1609491263,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44fXJ3vYCdN3wvgI="}
