It has lots of levels, spacey music, and I think the simplicity and cleanness of it all sells to me. It gets pretty hard after the first several levels, and you might end up playing the same level many times with only slight variations in your placement in an attempt to get it right, all the waves appear programmed and not randomized, and I like that too.[spoiler]Try the demo! Wait, it's free now. Hell yeah.[/spoiler] https://youtu.be/UzVjUCSkcZM","timestamp_created":1598545788,"timestamp_updated":1598545788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.0831330046057701111","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxp+wmPQCdveSngI="}
