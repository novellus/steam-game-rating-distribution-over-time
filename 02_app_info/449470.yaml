    review: "This is an old school dungeon crawler and is somewhat reminiscent of\
      \ the old \"Temple of  Apshai\".\nThere is no WASD movement. Click where you\
      \ want to go and your man will walk there. \nBattles auto engage when your character\
      \ and the MOB meet. \nThile this game is somewhat limited as to what you can\
      \ actually do, it does scratch that nostalgic itch.\n\nGraphics are 16 bit-ish\
      \ soundtrack is MIDI-ish. The in game music tends to get on ones nerves after\
      \ a while ( I turned it off)I didn't find any bugs and the game works smooth.\
      \ If you're looking for a simple time killer that reminds you of the good old\
      \ days, this isn't bad.  If you're looking for more... Not going to find it\
      \ here.\n\nOverall rating 5/10 based on repetitive simplicity but I would recommend\
      \ to that that want to re-live their childhood."
