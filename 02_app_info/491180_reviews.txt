Game Over.\n\nLighting seems unfinished. Without power the house still seemed to be illuminated rather well, to the point that I saw no visible difference between unilt vs using the lighter (just more shadows and an orange tint, no difference in visibility). Atmosphere seemed overall lacking.","timestamp_created":1603825535,"timestamp_updated":1603825729,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43s/dtfUCdPu/qgI="}
