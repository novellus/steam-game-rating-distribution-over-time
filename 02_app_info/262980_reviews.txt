I can not overstate this fact. Give this trash a wide berth. \n\nAfter me playing it once it doesn't even run anymore. Which is a good thing. I am GLAD it no longer runs! This is easily one of the worst games on Steam at the moment of writing this review.\n\nThe audio:\nThere is a loud, constant, static hissing noise which which plays for the entire duration of the game. It is much than anything in the game. You can barely hear other \"sound effects\", but those are also nothing but crackling, distorted static screeches that barely audible. I doubt they would have made much of a difference in the audio fidelity though. The game has no volume settings. I had to turn my system volume all the way down to 10% to make it bearable. To sum it up, the audio is about as pleasant as a root canal without anaesthetics while also getting your eardrums punctured.\n\nThe graphics:\nThey are... not awful. But I would not describe them as good either. The 3D-effect is okay but it is wasted on  the uninspired, unimaginative level design. The ships are just rubbish. They look more like shiny dog turds with some lights on than futuristic spacecraft. They made better-looking SHMUPs in 90's.\n\nThe Gameplay:\nThe controls are touchy and finicky. Also the default controls are set up in an idiotic way. Z=up, F=up, S=Down... what? At least you can remap them. But it doesn't really matter. There is almost no feeling of control. You have one type of ship with 2 firing/flight modes, which are pointless. The enemies come at you in predictable waves and have fixed flight patterns. They also shoot at you from outside of the screen before they appear.\n\nStability/game engine:\nNone. The game stopped working after I played it once. Now when I try to start it up it blanks the primary screen and then flickers and flashes my secondary monitor like a jigsaw puzzle, flashing and flickering for a few minutes and then closing and restarting the game executable as soon as it manages to load the title screen on the primary monitor. Basically to get tnough play-time for this review I had to sit there watching my monitors flicker for several minutes, and listen to intermittent static noise.\n\nAs I looked at my task manager I could not help but have giggle at the irony of the \"A Super Schmup (32-bit)\" entry flickering in and out of my task list. \n\nYes. Schmup. Not a SHMUP. Try looking up \"Schmup\" on Urban Dictionary (nsfw). It's priceless. But also a fitting description for this game.","timestamp_created":1592584296,"timestamp_updated":1592584296,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5Pra5vICfvD8jgI="}
