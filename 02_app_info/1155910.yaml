    review: 'Interesting take on the action-dice game genre, though quite lacking
      in polish and variety.


      Has potential, but I am not sure I can recommend the current price (close, but
      not quite there).


      It lacks some basic quality of life features (like being able to disable the
      extremely repetitive music... I had to use the sound mixer in windows to stop
      myself going crazy), but mostly it just needs a bit more polish (in the UX area),
      and a bit more variety.


      My top recommendations:


      - Let users turn of music.

      - Add better descriptions for towers (they might exist, but I could not find
      them).

      - Add some UI flair like having roll numbers show above towers, colour coded
      by hit or miss.

      - It was really confusing that the dark blue colour is an indicator of the range
      extensions, particularly because they show on towers that have no range upgrades.
      At first I thought maybe it was splash damage or something.

      - Needs more than 4 tower types (I only played for an hour, so did not see all
      levels, but the second level did not unlock any new towers and I suspect there
      aren''t others based on UI)... or perhaps a skill tree or something mix things
      up as you progress.'
