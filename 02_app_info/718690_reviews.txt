It was just love from the first note. The SteamWorld Dig 2 is also available on [url=https://imageform.bandcamp.com/releases]Bandcamp[/url] in MP-3/FLAC/Wave/...\n\nThe tracks I like the least: [b]Bad to Worse[/b] & [b]Oh Dorothy (Extended Main Theme)[/b] - Those two tracks. I can`t even listen to them even once anylonger before I fast forward them when i hear through the Soundtrack or turn the music off in the Game till they pass. While [b]Dorothy's Theme (SWD2 Main Theme)[/b] was just fine the Extended Main Theme is just plain and simple over the top and I can only guess that in the end another Track was for the Credits needed and it should be done in a day or less and the result is what we have listen to.\n\nOverall I don´t regret buying the Soundtrack on Steam also it would have been nice if we would get instead the Tracks in an lossless format like FLAC instead of Wave.\n\nStill the SteamWorld Dig 2 Soundtrack is as smooth and as enjoyable as I had hoped it would turn out to be and therefore I can give it a very strong...\n\n[b]Thumbs Up[/b]\n\nThat´s it. Thanks for reading and have a great time ;-)\n","timestamp_created":1508017546,"timestamp_updated":1508017546,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.790000677108764648","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsbS2jt8CdbamiAE="}
