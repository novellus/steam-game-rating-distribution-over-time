    review: This character is overall an OK charcter. To me, his passives don't offer
      much (other than being a troll and sending an overpowered spirit to your friend)
      and the biggest nail in the coffin is the fact that he can only use the runesword
      as a weapon. These single charcters that don't come with any expansions are
      worth 1 dollar and im happy with that seeing as there not TO great and I wouldn't
      want to pay any more.
