      feel of racing. Feel the thrill as you race past your opponent, slam their car
      into a water trap, and beat them by a bumper to the finish line. Avoid obstacles,
      knock opponents, launch weapons, take shortcuts, engage turbo mode, and hit
      jumps with perfect timing to outrace your opponent every time!<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><br><strong>Three

      \ in 1994, to Apogee but I did play this game to its absolute limits in the\
      \ shareware version I had at the time.\n\nNow I get to relive the nostalgia\
      \ with every character unlocked at pennies on the dollar.\n\nWacky wheels is\
      \ a mario kart clone in every single way you want to define it, but in 1994\
      \ I did not have an SNES. Instead I had Wacky Wheels, and good god was it fun,\n\
      \nAs a PC game the graphics and \"3d\" world rendering were done better. Arguably\
      \ firing live hedgehogs at your fellow racers is more fun than turtle shells.\
      \ Undoubtedly I will pick the shark as my main racer every single time hands\
      \ down.\n\nI am writing this review because I loved this game as a child, and\
      \ continue to love it as an adult.\nI hope that even one of you out there finds\
      \ this game and can manage to see it through the eyes of a kid in 1994, exploring\
      \ gaming on a DOS Packard Bell machine with the option to upgrade and boot to\
      \ the mostly useless Win 95, and will understand the wonder and potential  I\
      \ saw in computer gaming at that time. If I can be a shark, driving a go kart\
      \ in 3d, firing live hedgehogs at other racers, on this computer... what must\
      \ the future hold. What untold potential will I witness in my life?\n\nThis\
      \ is where it all began for me.\n\n"
