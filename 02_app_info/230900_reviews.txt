I mean they are more or less ranged units and are made of paper BUT they are a cooler alternative to some of the other ranged units that are made of paper.\n\nBut keep in mind if you want to use these units you WILL have to go to your profile and equip them to your units pool.  I'm guess this was supposed to be expansive with more units as DLC to add and take away but... well you get vampire and snake ladies.\n\nGood for discount... and well those who don't mind spending 2 bucks either.","timestamp_created":1565555171,"timestamp_updated":1565555171,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ464OXwewCdPOW0AE="}
