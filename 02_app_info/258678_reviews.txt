It's also liable to be a good introduction to steam power, a field I'd avoided almost entirely until now, partly out of fear, and partly out of not having had the money. Now that I (more or less) own the vast majority of all other stock which interests me (aside from a handful of British routes), I think I could bear to have a couple steam routes and stock to spare. So, I picked both this and the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway up from the March Madness sale. \n\nI'm utterly blown away. This train is...let me explain. I come from flight sims. They're sort of primarily what I do, more or less. My primary occupation. Within them, I like to fly a VAST assortment of aircraft, but I got my start flying warbirds, mostly those from the Second World War. Whereas a contemporary or even Cold War aircraft will not tell you what's happening but will rather indicate it, a warbird will tell you by *feel.* For example, if you get hit in an A-10C, you'll have a row of lights telling you, more or less, what's wrong. Sure, you'll have to adapt your handling of the airframe (provided it's still airworthy) to the consequences of either poor luck or poor decision making, but you've some informational foundation on WHY you're experiencing what you're experiencing. In a warbird...you don't get that. You get raked with a crop of gunfire. Your engine seizes. You've a few seconds to maybe a minute to figure out a series of extremely mechanical controls. You restart it. You get it to work, but...it *sounds* wrong, it *feels* wrong. And just like that, by being one with the machine you're flying rather than it being an interface you interact with, you're able to feel your way through and forward. \n\nThe Bulleid Q1 is just like that. It's exactly like that, in fact. It's a sensory experience, of slowly, deliberately incrementing a series of reasoned parameters based on an assortment of guidelines in order to achieve an end result. For the most part, the percentages on the HUD are meaningless. You've to listen, to feel, to experience the engine to get what you're after. It'll try to kill you, initially. All good machines worthy our respect do - and when you tame it, you'll know. She'll basically tell you. And I know that, to probably a fair few people reading this, that sounds insanely pretentious and probably a wee on the mystical horseshit side. But seriously, try it. If not in this, then in a warbird in IL-2. \n\nI will say this: One and a half hours in, and this is a several-day job to master, with a few weeks tacked on for us who are steam-challenged. So be ready for that. She's detailed, she's noisy, she's loud, and she's temperamental. The manual is sizeable. But...be ready for a great deal of autodidactic learning. \n\n9/10, worth the dosh. Bloody good job, lads.","timestamp_created":1583805228,"timestamp_updated":1583805228,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvryJ4fACcqOT9wE="}
