      I''ll consider adding a leaderboard and mouse/controller sensitivity setting
      option to improve control for I only tested this game on my own mouse and Xbox
      Controller.'

    review: 'Really like the concept (which is why I bought this), HATE how it controls.
      The controls are way too loose and slippery for my liking tbh. Also I feel having
      camera controls would really help with navigating around.


      This also feels like playing it has no purpose. Maybe an online leaderboard
      or something? Idk.


      Can''t really recommend this right now tbh. Probably gonna refund.'
