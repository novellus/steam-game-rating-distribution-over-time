Similarly characterless maps. Pointless gimmicky voxel art design. Depressing tuneless ambient music and/or depressing generic \"heavy\" rock, depending on the area.\n\n[b]**The shooting's decent but any potential is smudged by the drab setting and the painfully amorphous enemies.**[/b]\n \nSo, you have your map, which you traverse gaily and while double jumping merrily on your way, you set off switches, grab spawn triggering objectives, funnel enemies into choke points and roller bomb the poo out of them. This is doctor jekyll.\nThen, you have the power node fights. You need to complete these to unlock the next area. These ... are Mr Hyde. They section you off (you can leave but it resets the fight) on a small part of the map while things run at you, shoot at you, look meanly at you etc. etc. (Sound familiar? Yea, I bet it does) until through furious dodging and skilful aim, you emerge the victor .. or .. maybe you just find a ledge where they can't reach you and roller bomb the poo out of anything that can't fly. Regardless, you might fare 10 x better with a particular weapon due to a certain enemy type but you won't know that the first time and you'll probably die, which will reset the whole map, which you will need to traverse (gaily) again to get your loot back .. and you better not die this time or you will lose it all. Now, you don't want this because you're going to need that loot (and probably more - hello grind) to make the weapon, to kill the thing, that put you in this loop ... tralalalala. It's not actually as grindy as it sounds but it is as boring as it sounds.\nThis kind of cycle might be alright if you felt there was any pay off coming or if it was entertaining .. but there isn't and it's not .. and unfortunately the rpg elements mainly boil down to keeping your gear levelled up. You can add health or speed or resistances and some other \"stuff\" but it doesn't quite spice things up enough.\n\nThe dev does patch it a lot and it has seen improvements but I'd say, if it piques your interest, get it before the promised price hike and preferably with a discount. It does scratch a shootery itch (as you can see from my play time) but with hindsight I can't recommend it. Your time could be being killed in a much more engaging manner, for a similar price.\n\n[u][b]Updated;[/b][/u] 11/20:\nThe above review still stands. However, a recent patch seemingly has laid to rest the excruciating frame drops that have ruined the game since day one. This means that you can now move around and aim at pace with confidence - y'know like you should have been able to, for the last year. This does somewhat counter some of the boring and generic aspects mentioned above but not enough to change to a recommend yet.
