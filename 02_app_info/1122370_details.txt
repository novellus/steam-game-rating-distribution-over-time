As with its predecessors, it was designed to work as a standalone adventure. Whether by accident or by design, the FRQ series managed to cover Ed Greenwood's three strongest Realms settings, based on his classic house campaigns. FRQ1: &quot;Haunted Halls of Evening Star&quot; (1992) was set in Cormyr; FRQ2: &quot;Hordes of Dragonspear&quot; (1992) was set on the Sword Coast; and (as requested) FRQ3: &quot;Doom of Daggerdale&quot; was set in the Dalelands.<br><br>Somewhat confusingly, though, TSR had already started another series of standalone Realms adventures by the time &quot;Doom of Daggerdale&quot; was published; that was the &quot;FRM&quot; series of Forgotten Realms &quot;Missions&quot; modules.

It was also the last standalone adventure for the Realms for some years, since afterward TSR began concentrating once more on &quot;event&quot; trilogies.

It isn't exactly an introductory adventure, but it is set in a well-described home base (Daggerdale), and it does include a half-dozen ideas for additional adventures at the end of the module. Particularly in conjunction with FRS1: The Dalelands(1993), it could easily form the basis of a new campaign.<br><br><strong>It's All about the NPCs.<\/strong> Greenwood has always put the focus in the Realms on characters, and that also tends to be the case in Realms adventures by other hands, such as FRQ3. Here, the PCs will get to meet Randal Morn, the deposed leader of Daggerdale, on page 8 (once more: as requested!). Beyond that, many of the problems in the adventure are caused by a variety of NPCs - among them Eragyn the Dark, Colderan the Mage-Lord, and Constable Tren Noemfor.<br><br>Despite this focus on NPCs, the PCs are still clearly the main movers and shakers of this adventure.<br><br><strong>Adventuring Tropes.<\/strong> &quot;Doom of Daggerdale&quot; is clearly an adventure of the 90s.

This was somewhat rarer in the 90s, but Baur decided to include them because that's what hefound fun in low-level adventures.
