It is not.   A large number of us, based on the forum cannot launch the game.   It crashes immediately after the UE4 logo at start OR launches, but without any menu to start the game.     Unfortunately,  I can't get a refund because I waited too long for a response on the support forum and it was no longer eligible for a refund.  I am still waiting for a response weeks later, as are others.\n\nApparently it works well with occulus.  But simply does not work on WMR,  and by the developers post responses to others in the past, it sounds like they didn't have a WMR headset to test it,  so they should never, ever have indicated it was WMR compatible.\n\nSo if you have an occulus, it might be worth trying.   If not,  you are out of luck, and the developer doesn't appear keen on fixing the problems for WMR users.\n\nSo I have to give it a big old thumbs down.   I was scammed.   Would never have bought it if they were honest about WMR support.\n\nThis is sad.    I was very much looking forward to playing this.","timestamp_created":1609523980,"timestamp_updated":1609523980,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7tzG3/YCc++7vwI="}
