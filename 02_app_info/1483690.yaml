      notes: 'As players complete mission objectives, they use swords, axes, and spears
        to kill enemy warriors in melee-style combat. Blood-splatter effects occur
        frequently as enemies are killed; some areas depict large bloodstains and
        impaled heads on spikes. Players can also perform finishing attacks (e.g.,
        decapitation, impalements) that are sometimes highlighted by close-up camera
        angles. Cutscenes depict additional acts of violence: bound warriors decapitated
        by swords; characters executed with weapon strikes to the head'

    review: In my opinion, this is the best Battle Pass For Honor has has as of yet,
      with genuinely cool content contained, but still not enough to recommend it.
      You get a blacksmith signature with anvil and all, Mechanical Bird mask outfit
      in blue and orange, weapons based around gears and bronze (bronze being a really
      under-used material in weapon skins), and the usual battle outfit ornament embossing
      combo. I'll say it like I've said in the past ones though, if you don't have
      a lot of spare income, don't get this. You won't get much of anything that's
      genuinely impactful on it's own other than the mask outfit that you might use
      on one or two characters.
