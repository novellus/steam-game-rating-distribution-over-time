It has a good concept and switches from a top-down shooter to a platformer game with the \"signature\" pixel graphics from Orangepixel. But I had a few issues when playing that prevent me from giving a thumb up:\n- Quest marker disappearing on the map - That leaves you roaming the map having to do another side quest to hope triggering the active quest. Not sure if I missed something there or if it was an actual bug...\n- The lack of hints or possibly a tutorial. I ended my gaming session on what I think is a radioactive room without actually knowing what I could do to prevent radiation to affect me (I would believe there is some sort of suit that I can get somewhere - I did skip my first or second encounter pointing me to a radioactive building and not to go inside)\n- The control could be improved. It felt hard to move from a room with platforms moving around. The car control is a disaster with an Xbox controller to a point it is easier to walk than trying to figure out why the car is not steering.\n- The overall mechanic to force you to sleep, find food and find a shelter every day is not really working forcing you to travel the map constantly to find a shelter. Maybe the span of a day could be longer to actually let the player explore more.\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1585304825,"timestamp_updated":1585304825,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52025604248046875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yv3hjfECcoG9+wE="}
