      \ unleashing your vehicle\u2019s full potential. Learn the extent of your creations\u2019\
      \ capabilities and face increasing challenges. Figure out your enemies\u2019\
      \ battle plan and spot the weaknesses of their vessels. Fight alongside allies\
      \ or solo.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Features</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"\
      ><li>Advanced destruction simulation, vehicles can be cut in half.<br></li><li>Projectiles\
      \ with their own ballistics, penetration, and ricochet mechanics.<br></li><li>Simulation\
      \ of aerodynamics, buoyancy, fires, and flooding.<br></li><li>Vehicles constructed\
      \ from many different materials, paintable armors with various levels of thickness.<br></li><li>Vehicles\
      \ with various ranges of visibility and detection radii.<br></li><li>Creative\
      \ mode where you can build any vehicle you want.<br></li><li>Integrated Steam\
      \ workshop to share your creativity.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Destruction</strong></h2>The\
      \ most important part of any ship is its core block, there can be only one of\
      \ this type and its destruction will annihilate the whole vehicle. Every block\
      \ must have a connection to the core. Each element has its own hit points, level\
      \ of fire resistance, ability to resist impact and explosion. Some of them can\
      \ also be flooded or lose their lift power. Every destroyed element has an impact\
      \ on a vessel's combat capabilities - strategic block placement can improve\
      \ your vehicle\u2019s survivability and efficiency.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Weapons</strong></h2>Each\
      \ weapon is a separate object with its own logic and physics systems. Before\
      \ shooting, a weapon checks if it doesn\u2019t don't hit or collide with its\
      \ own vehicle. Weapons types include many variants of artillery, missile launchers,\
      \ machine guns, flamethrowers, torpedo launchers, bombs, depth charges, and\
      \ crazy close combat weapons. One of the unique weapons is a harpoon that can\
      \ grab and pull enemies or pull its own vehicle to the ground.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      ><strong>Physics</strong></h2>The shape and size of the vehicles' hull affects\
      \ their air and water drag. Vessels with an angled, aerodynamic hull are faster\
      \ than those that look like a brick. Some blocks generate buoyancy or lift,\
      \ center of which should be balanced with the center of mass. Water has realistic\
      \ wave simulation, there is also wind that can be used by sails.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\"><strong>Mechanics</strong></h2>The game has realistic gun ballistics\
      \ and armor penetration mechanics; angled surfaces offer better protection from\
      \ projectiles and can cause them to ricochet. Most blocks can be made using\
      \ different materials that have different weights and other properties. Enemy\
      \ vehicles can behave differently, depending on what weapons they have installed\
      \ and what their goals are."
