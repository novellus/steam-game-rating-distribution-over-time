It originally retailed for $24.99 USD and I myself paid $6 bucks during a Steam sale. This is a VR supported dungeon crawler with multiplayer coop. Unfortunately, it's a rather simplistic dungeon crawler with limited content. You do have full locomotion with snap turning. \n\nSo you can level up and face higher difficulty enemies. But during each run you'll be going down the same corridors. The gameplay really doesn't change at all. It's a matter of kiting enemies stronger than you and slowly bringing down their health in the higher difficulties. You can choose 1 of 4 different wands with different types of spells from fire, ice, shock?/ arcane? and a mixture of all of them I think. I can't really tell since the graphics aren't all that good.\n\nThere are 3 boss fights. The boss fights are interesting ... the first time around. The cool thing is that you can easily restart where you left off if you die. However, the game is just too monotonous after the novelty wears off ... after about 30 minutes of playtime. There are just much better dungeon crawlers in VR like Karnage Chronicles, VR Dungeon Knight, or Trickster VR. It's hard to believe this game ever charged $24.99 USD when it feels like an alpha still with little content. I would have rated this game negatively, even at the $6 USD sale price.\n\n[b]Rate 6/10. However, it's free. You can play with your buddies online with or without VR. Worth the download if you don't have a better option I guess. This game doesn't even make my top 100 list of FREE Steam VR games. Should it be there?[/b]\n\n[i]P.S.
