    review: 'Old North has a number of good songs in it. The soundtrack, however,
      only has a few. Several key themes are absent, including some from prologues
      and cutscenes, the overworld theme, and [i]even the song from the title screen[/i].


      I will [b][i]gladly[/i][/b] change the review to positive if they ever add in
      all of the missing tracks, some of which I''m sure many people wanted to acquire
      when they had purchased the OST. I simply cannot recommend it in this incomplete
      state, especially given that it used to cost $15.'
