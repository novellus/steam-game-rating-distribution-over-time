      notes: Be forewarned; Gloom is a card game which features no visible violence
        or nudity. However the core mechanic of the game is to make your characters
        as miserable as possible. This means that a large number of cards will feature
        text describing terrible scenes or events that characters will/have experienced
        that may be upsetting to some.
