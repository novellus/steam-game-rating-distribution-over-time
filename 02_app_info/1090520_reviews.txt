To find your way through the anomalies you have to use a sonar, which gives you one particular sound for \"wall ahead\" and one for \"no wall\" within (approximation) 3 meters. Sounds like a good idea, but it sucks! You easyly lose orientation, especially when the monster is close behind you... and then you die. That also sucks because there is no way to save, only checkpoints, probably to make the game longer. Bugs - of course. The setting is a joke too. Textures and objects are so unbelievable repetitive, it actually makes this \"horror game\" kinda \"funny\". Absolutely ridiculous!\n\nAll in all, this is NOT A GAME, just a demo of an idea with minimal effort which should be for free!\nTo expect people to pay 6 dollars for this demo is absolutely ridiculous!\n\nSTAY AWAY!!!","timestamp_created":1576798033,"timestamp_updated":1576801928,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtICukO8Cf4225QE="}
