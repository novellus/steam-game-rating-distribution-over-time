    short_description: Western Germany, March 1964... The last Great War rages on.
      Madness at the front lines. Men butchering each other. War-torn Europe stands
      ripped apart by a front line that runs straight through the heart of Germany
      where American and Western European troops battle against enemy forces.

    review: 'WW1 never ended and turned into a nightmare straight out of 1984 where
      war is continued purely for profit.

      Unfortunately the game doesn''t do much with it''s unique setting other than
      use it for set dressing and bizarro weaponary.


      The gameplay is your standard FPS affair, the enemies are a bit brain dead but
      they make up with sheer numbers and explosive spam. Combine this with unfair
      enemy placement behind doors and corners, a 5-6 hour game extends to 10 hours
      for no bloody reason. The last couple of levels introduce really terrible level
      design and obtuse puzzles and weird scripted events where enemies will not die
      unless you shoot them from a specific place in the map etc., it becomes tedious.


      I can only recommend this game for it''s unique setting and it''s different
      design ideas from early 2000''s. Maybe if it''s played on the Easy setting it
      becomes more bearable. One other thing to note is that the game received a PS2
      port which was ported back into PC, it''s sort of a remaster but not really
      because they are a little different here and there but from what I understand
      the obtuse level design was cut down, however the ability to quick save was
      removed, which is a big deal IMO, Iron Storm can be so cruel at times so quick
      save is the only reason I was able to finish it. If you want to check out the
      remaster, it''s called World War Zero on Steam. Also the screenshots on the
      store page of Iron Storm are from this remaster version and og Iron Storm has
      much cruder graphics.'
