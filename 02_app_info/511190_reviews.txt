It's not terribly difficult, but it's the controls that provide the very small level of challenge that it has. \nWhat really drew me to the game was the appearance of it. I really appreciate the cute/spooky juxtaposition that it has, and it reminds me of some of my favorite games from my childhood.\nThe issue with this game is that it's extremely easy to beat, considering that you can just grab the infinite ammo mushrooms, and then when that runs out, you can just grab another one. Then when that runs out, the first one will have respawned. So it's just an easy win. \n\nBut, as an achievement hunter, this was a fun and easy little 100% to add to my showcase.\n\nBecause that's really where this game shines. It's cheap, and it will give you a good hour or so of fun gameplay, and it does technically have replay value, although I don't plan to play it again any time soon.\n\nNormally I wouldn't leave a review for a game unless I felt compelled to say something about it, which I did not for Graveyard Shift. So the only reason I'm posting one is because when I was in the middle of playing a round of Graveyard Shift, my dad called me and told me that I had to go dig a grave for my sister's cat. It was an unfortunate loss, but I thought it was an interesting coincidence.\n\nAnyway, give it a shot, it's a fun, beautiful, and cheap time-killer.","timestamp_created":1600813045,"timestamp_updated":1603422072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzOXZqfUCefq4owI="}
