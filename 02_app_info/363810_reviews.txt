This demo seems to revolve heavily around the odd relligion of discordianism. Each member of the world that you encounter has their own perspective, and their soundbytes help fill in the story. The setting is very strange, and very intriguing, it pulls you in, In terms of mechanics there are various puzzles through the demo, mostly involving logic puzzles, or overcoming something. The last stage of the game featured a logic puzzle that seems to be missing information and therefore required a bit of guessing - but its very possible I missed something playing though. I would highly recommend this demo, and I think its really great of the developers to have the demo not share any content from the main game. \npotential players should note that these screenshots don't match this game, but the full game.","timestamp_created":1488182833,"timestamp_updated":1488183090,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtfunv9oCfcOhcw=="}
