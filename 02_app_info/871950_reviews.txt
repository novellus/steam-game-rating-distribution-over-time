I recommend this game if you enjoy cute looking games that come with scary plot twists and difficult levels!","timestamp_created":1609731680,"timestamp_updated":1609731680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8ITf5fYCf4akwAI="}
