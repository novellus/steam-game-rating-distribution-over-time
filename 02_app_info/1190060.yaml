    legal_notice: Deathbound is an indie game and lacks much of what a studio would
      achieve. I understand this setback.

    review: "Curti bastante o jogo e s\xF3 pelo fato dele ser todo criado por uma\
      \ equipe bem pequena me deixa bem atordoado com os gr\xE1ficos que mesmo n\xE3\
      o sendo uma masterpiece pixelada combina bastante com o jogo e pela forma que\
      \ ele \xE9 r\xE1pido, mesmo finalizando ele em umas 3 4 horas eu achei ele bem\
      \ desafiador ainda mais no come\xE7o com a disgra\xE7a daqueles goblins com\
      \ os healers mas depois de um tempo \xE9 f\xE1cil masterizar as mec\xE2nicas.S\xF3\
      \ achei curta a campanha e deixa meio rala a historia mas como \xE9 so o epilogo\
      \ acho que tem um longo caminho pra escrever na hist\xF3ria. Achei o jogo muito\
      \ foda"
