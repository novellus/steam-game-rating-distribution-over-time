It took about 8 hours for me to beat all of the competitions and my biggest complaint is that probably an hour of that was caring for horses or grinding stats to get to the next competition. The graphics and controls are pretty bad too but that's pretty normal for horse games.  I personally found the dressage most enjoyable because there aren't many games with dressage in them and it was a pretty well rounded system that got more difficult as you progressed. The show jumping was also good, it was enjoyable and I really liked the courses at the higher levels. XC was very easy because basically all you need to do is keep kicking, so it got a little boring. Overall I liked the game!","timestamp_created":1609107635,"timestamp_updated":1609107635,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s7+S0/YCeK3zvQI="}
