The objective is simple, get from point A to point B. The difficulty gets more challenging as you advance, just like any other game. The answers aren't always clear and have a lot of trial and error. Graphics are simple, nothing to fancy. The soundtrack isn't made by John Williams, but it sets the environment for you.\n\nMake sure you select a mouse sensitivity. It's simple, press ESC button in game and type in a number.\n\n7/10 would Johnny Guitar again.","timestamp_created":1517420119,"timestamp_updated":1536876379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.320644915103912354","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t4++6uUCc4jSlwE="}
