    review: "This could have been really good.  Our heroine takes a boat to a family\
      \ owned island to meet up with some old bad blood relatives and get the skinny\
      \ on a possible will reading.  You get to the house and find it ransacked and\
      \ are soon attacked by a maniac and find yourself on the run from hooded cultists.\
      \  \n\nThe story in Ritual on Weylyn Island is certainly in theory a high-point\
      \ and has the makings of a snubnosed horror experience but it drops the ball\
      \ more than a wide receiver who decided to play the Super Bowl after taking\
      \ a fistful of morphine.  It's more of the same; short playtime, read this/read\
      \ that, get lost in environments that are pretty drab and run around like you\
      \ need to hit the nearest Weylyn Island outhouse or else.  \n\nMost of your\
      \ time will be spent jogging down linear wooded paths trying to find the next\
      \ checkpoint or significant landmark from which you can progress.  Going anyway\
      \ but the right way will have a hooded cultist in your face bumping up against\
      \ you like some kind of irritated cat that wants you to get off the couch. \
      \ Their appearance and what they say is kind of tense at first until you realize\
      \ that as long as you run the other way they have about zero chance of catching\
      \ you.  They act like ushers telling you to get back in your seat...or to stop\
      \ being so damn curious and go the right friggen direction before they really\
      \ get upset!  It wouldn't be so bad if there was at least some hiding mechanics\
      \ or interesting environments to traverse but there absolutely is not.\n\nYou're\
      \ going to have a tough time being challenged much or really fear dying in this\
      \ game.  Hell, even the collectibles are all laid out like road signs that are\
      \ more or less telling you to go the right way you damn fool.  The grainy graphics\
      \ actually gives off a certain charm (well, one that you can imagine if the\
      \ locations weren't so dull) and the sound design (complete with voice-acting,\
      \ a very cool touch) gets the job done but this is the most safe horror game\
      \ with threats ever.  \n\nThere are some tenser moments when a house you're\
      \ trying to hole up in gets busted into to by these Grim Reapers in training\
      \ as well as my favorite segment which requires you wheeling yourself in a cart\
      \ across a zip line as the S.O.B. squad tries to stop it from happening.  These\
      \ moments hint at what Weylyn COULD have been if it had more budget and time\
      \ behind it but sadly it didn't...  I died once and was actually mad at myself\
      \ for it because I just simply didn't understand what I was doing in that house\
      \ \"defense\" segment.\n\nOn top of everything else you can complete the game\
      \ in under an hour and a half without a walkthrough.  The ending is actually\
      \ fairly well-done for such a low budget entry but it needed way more build-up\
      \ to truly have an effect.  This isn't the worst horror game I've played.  Oh\
      \ no, no, no, I've played some real trash and Weylyn is fortunately cheap even\
      \ without a sale but it would definitely be on my lower tier, \"you've played\
      \ most everything else in the genre\" list without even a second thought coming\
      \ to mind.  I don't regret anything in my life yet if someone asked me if I'd\
      \ have rather sat and stared at a wall in the time it took me to complete The\
      \ Ritual on Weylyn Island...well, I might have hesitated to give my answer."
