It is comical fun.\n\nOdd how cats are either sleeping ... or sleeping ...  or running around bonkers.  \nBut that's how cats think, probably would sleep less and explore more if they were outside cats.\n\nI bought Catlateral Damage on sale, and I enjoyed it.  Thanks for the good music too ! :-)","timestamp_created":1470823373,"timestamp_updated":1489493889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485843658447265625","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/qGw5toCf4nRXg=="}
