The dictionary shut down several time during my ~10 minute play time and the experience was mediocre at best. The best part of the game is the ability to see and have the translation of objects. It makes it so much easier in my mind to understand these items in the language I'm learning. \n\nHowever, this game does not deserve the pricetag. I bought the game at about $5 and even still it's almost not worth it. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME WITHOUT UPDATES AND/OR A PRICE REDUCTION","timestamp_created":1586192906,"timestamp_updated":1586192906,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8d6dqPECe57X/gE="}
