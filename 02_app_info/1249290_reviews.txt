I am very fond of action platformers, especially 8 bit ones(gun star heroes, megaman,etc) and this one is great. \nI enjoy the smooth gameplay, responsive controls and the simple UI.\nThe soundtrack is great as well.\nIf you want something like hyperlight drifter meets megaman, this is it.","timestamp_created":1586308013,"timestamp_updated":1586308013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.463056683540344238","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vOvUq/ECd4CF/wE="}
