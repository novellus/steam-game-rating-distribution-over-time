It feels like trapped in \"Tron Legacy\". The graphics are simple, mostly no textures. But the atmosphere of this light build universe and the very good, spacey soundtrack made a lot of fun.\n\nThe 3d puzzles are challanging, but not too complex. I hope there will be a Game 2.0 as mentioned in the credits.","timestamp_created":1597420710,"timestamp_updated":1597420710,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh7Xs9vMCe6q3mwI="}
