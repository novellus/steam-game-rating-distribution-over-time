    about_the_game: 'The eccentric architect Baron Wittard has built something really
      special: a city inside a building. This monumental pleasure dome, called ''The
      Utopia'', features 1000 apartments, a shopping mall, and hundreds of offices
      and leisure facilities. All under one roof. Its grand opening was supposed to
      have been two years ago. That event never happened. A chain of mysterious events
      has now left the Utopia abandoned and silent. People have gone missing. Electromagnetic
      disturbances are increasing. These happenings all point to Wittard''s desolate
      Utopia. Armed with only a camera and a torch, you must journey there alone to
      explore its winding corridors, its secret passageways,  and its gloomy halls.
      Local townspeople say Wittard kept a terrible secret. They speak fearfully of
      someone or something malevolent lurking at his city.  They say it is waiting
      and growing in power. They say time is running out...<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br>&gt;
      Explore Wittard Utopia and uncover its chilling secrets<br>&gt; Non-linear gameplay
      and a spine-tingling mystery to solve<br>&gt; Experience urban decay in high
      resolution graphics<br>&gt; Eerie and mysterious soundtrack with full musical
