    review: 'A fabulous add-on. At last we have some heavy, noisy, realistically weathered
      wagons that feel like they''ve got some mass. The sounds are fantasic, loud
      and noisy with track joint sounds that alter significantly with speed and give
      a real clatter and clank over points. I can spend all day on one of the external
      vews listening to a train of these thundering through the countryside.


      I see from Google that they crop up in different countries, so I think it would
      be realistic to use them on most northern continental European routes.'
