All heroes are unique with their own characteristics, abilities, and dialogue. Should you recruit Rufus, the mighty macaque guardian that excels in traditional martial arts known to his people? Or Maryu, the heart-warming but savage old lady that can curse your opponents?<br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1401560\/extras\/Grow_Your_Guild_Optimized.gif?t=1606848189\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STRATEGY IS KEY<\/h2>Always check what enemies your active party is going to face in the upcoming quests.

At the beginning of each battle, it is important to consider the enemies, their abilities, and their formation, when positioning your heroes.
