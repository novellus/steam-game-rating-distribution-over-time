    review: I don't normally even bother with soundtracks, but this was such a jamming
      time for me, that I bought it. If at any point the soundtrack speaks to you
      or you find yourself liking more than 5 tunes or not completely miserable for
      it, I suggest you just buy it. I never do this... and I ended up doing so! Go
      figure. This soundtrack was amazing!
