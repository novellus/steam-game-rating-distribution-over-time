I had one enemy left on the map and the tesla tower was the first tower in line. So the enemy was teleported away all the time. Had to sell the building.\n\nYou will find fast a general shema to beat each level. This is not really bad but somehow the challenge is missing.\nStill good story (not really open end like others write). I see forward to see the next part.","timestamp_created":1609797933,"timestamp_updated":1609798522,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyYLe5/YCfonDwAI="}
