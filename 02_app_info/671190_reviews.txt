Was a little overwhelming at first but I don't use anything else and understand all the features. Aesprite is more popular but it was very basic and I didn't like the pixel art in the UI itself and eventually you'll want something less basic. just skip the others and buy this. If you're looking to get into to pixel art for whatever reason get PRO Motion NG.","timestamp_created":1607330559,"timestamp_updated":1607330559,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wb6XnvYCdpT3twI="}
