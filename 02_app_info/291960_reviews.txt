If you look at this game and don't see familiar features, then you must play it.\n\nIF simply being different on many levels isn't enough, THEN know the game features grindy leveling, lengthy dungeon crawling, item management, more artistic pictures than good graphics, full party creation, multiclassing, RNG combat features, in depth weapon/armor enhancements, and combat is basic but uncommon.\n\nTo save time, it essentially has style.  And different.  How often do we find something actually different?  What is cheap to me may not be cheap to you.  But to me at $10 it is must play.","timestamp_created":1609423597,"timestamp_updated":1609504730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuaX93vYCeomOvwI="}
