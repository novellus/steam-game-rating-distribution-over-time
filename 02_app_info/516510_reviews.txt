I found that the tutorial was a bit bad, and that, it didnt explain itself well enough, i had to get a player to help me learn how to craft items overall it's a good game, and i recommend it to anyone who likes 2D rpg","timestamp_created":1487332069,"timestamp_updated":1487332069,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521549820899963379","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ46Mn5pdoCe+yvcg=="}
