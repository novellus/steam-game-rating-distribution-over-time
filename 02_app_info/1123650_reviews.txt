The busses get resetted when making sharp turns like trying to get on stop 6 of the central bus station (the Lcapacity has this bug more often because of the extra seat row at the end of the first part of the bus.. The axels at the back of the bus is swapped (making axel 3 the one that turns and axel 4 the one thats stuck)(the same bug goes for the setra s418). This makes the capacity harder to drive then the lcapacity. \n-If you want a extra challange get the vanilla man cng because that one is even harder than the capacity's.\n-The citaro O530 is the only one of the pack where the callange isnt trying to not get auto reseted.\n-The ciatro O530 is the only non-bugged bus","timestamp_created":1604514028,"timestamp_updated":1604514028,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnqOfyvUCeqWmrAI="}
