      \ think that you will probably die out of boredom, an over enthusiastic spy\

      \ and you end up in one of the prison cells of the emperor, alone, not knowing\
      \ where your wife is. Many times you wished she would disappear, but you got\
      \ attached to her and somehow you are missing her. You decide that the last\
      \ thing you will do is NOT rot away in this terrible place, where you are forced\
      \ to fight other prisoners to the death in the gladiator arena.<br>You brew\
      \ up a plan. A daring plan\u2026 You may not survive it, but staying here locked\

      \ Warrior / Hunter / Mage / Priest</li></ul>Then you will start your journey\
      \ in a linear quest line where your neighbor Crenk will learn you the basics\
      \ of the game. After that you can walk around freely in a large discoverable\
      \ open world. Level up, train skills, slay bosses, complete quests, and obtain\
      \ items that will help you to dismantle the empire of the wicked with its evil\
