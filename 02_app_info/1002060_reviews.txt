It heavily reminds me of EtG and Ubermosh. I think if you like one of those games you will like this one.

I am pretty sure you will like it.\n\nHere is the full review + interview of the game: https://youtu.be/RifYi5E8MBM","timestamp_created":1566288603,"timestamp_updated":1566288603,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491006791591644287","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1566504936,"developer_response":"thank you so much Carl! check his youtube channel, Its awesome!"}],"cursor":"AoJ49+yE1+wCeN3a0AE="}
