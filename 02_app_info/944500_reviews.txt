That said, the core gameplay is tight and with some time most of the problems will be fixed and most missing features will be implemented. Also, the dev seems pretty engaged with the community and is very active, at least on discord, while posting constant updates about the development timeline. Overall, at it's current state it's a very 'rough' game with a good core that only shows signs of improving.","timestamp_created":1556559091,"timestamp_updated":1556559091,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ409qJteoCdYGcwAE="}
