Developers obviously lost interest. It's a buggy mess that is totally unplayable at this stage, controls are whacky and nothing seems to work right. Don't buy it.\n\nI thought something great would come of this... it's a shame. Oh well, Battlezone Redux and Battlezone: Combat Commander are on Steam so we have them now. Shame we can't get our money back now.","timestamp_created":1589792508,"timestamp_updated":1605932437,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ44InC9PUCetjIiAI="}
