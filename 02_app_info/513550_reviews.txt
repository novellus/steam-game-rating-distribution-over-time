Although it's easier said than done because the difficulty increases with every level.\nThe game is quite minimalistic both in its visual and sonic (there is only one background music track) aspects. But I think that minimalism is a very appropriate style in this case (as it is with LIMBO, e.g.).\nDefinitely recommended to the people who love puzzle games. And specially puzzle games with stealth.","timestamp_created":1604686679,"timestamp_updated":1604686679,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vfGxz/UCdsbdrAI="}
