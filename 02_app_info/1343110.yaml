      we all enjoy and love to play together. We have clear picture what this game
      is about and technical limitation of current VR technology, but we will try
      to get maximum out of it and polish every aspect as much as possible. We love
      to be interactive with our community involving them from the early stage of
      product creation that we strongly believe will only benefit our game and its
      audience together. Hence you have unique chance to participate in game development,
      vote for which features to include or how to tune them. For example  should
      we have simulation grade melee or more arcade  approach?  Which kind of weapons
      would you like to be implemented together with well-known, exotic  ones or some
      other. We will provide frequent builds and iterate each aspect as closely as

    review: Cant wait to see this progress more! Knuckles work awesome and the physics
      are deff there.Feels better then  many VR sword and bow games.This demo is worth
      the 10 bucks.Just make sure you have a large play area. 10/10
