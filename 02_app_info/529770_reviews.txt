The puzzles are challenging, but not annoyingly hard. The story is decent, and you're not bombarded with it. There is more gameplay than cutscenes, which I always love. The only part of this game that I don't like is that it was over way too quick.","timestamp_created":1487768995,"timestamp_updated":1487768995,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y6j8stoCctrocg=="}
