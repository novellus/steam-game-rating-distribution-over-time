It is a large airport, with 10,000 ft and 5,000 ft runways, a large terminal, and plenty of other buildings and aircraft. The DLC includes a substantial mini-region covering the city of Palm Springs, the surrounding mountains and desert, and a number of smaller towns. Unfortunately it ends short of Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport (KTRM), which would have made a brilliant second airport for training hops. \n\nAs I have come to expect from Orbx, the airport, city and scenery are immaculate, and also include numerous animations and points of interest, such as the moving cable cars on the mountain cable-way. It is similar in size and complexity to Orbx Innsbruck, although much of the scenery is rocky mountain and desert which, although well depicted, is less beautiful (to me at least) than the Alps surrounding LOWI. However, it does have the advantage of being in the middle of Aerofly's default SW USA scenery area, so there is good en-route scenery for cross-country flights in all directions. And at half the price of Innsbruck, it's excellent value. \n\nPerformance is excellent, with 30+ fps with graphics quality set to High on my low-end Nvidia MX-150_0 graphics card. \n\nPalm Springs would make an excellent airport for someone who is learning to fly any size aircraft, and looking to do so in more detailed scenery than the FS2 default airports. It has plenty of unobstructed flying area over the desert, wide and long runways, and is beautifully illuminated for night flying. There are a couple of VORs in the mini-region, although Palm Springs is not ILS equipped.","timestamp_created":1592037101,"timestamp_updated":1592038119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45bq31vICfeDfjQI="}
