Getting shots off that chain a bunch of explosions together is super satisfying. If I could suggest something it'd be to have an option in the Quarters to view the models up close. They look pretty cool and it's a shame you can only look at them from far away.\n\nI also think this would make for a fun mobile game.","timestamp_created":1607635014,"timestamp_updated":1607879818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsd/GrvYCcLjvuAI="}
