I wanted to love this game so much. I enjoy the Viking version but High Noon & Shinobi have me stumped. I do not at all understand what the other pieces are doing, can do or will do. I understand some pieces are supposed to be rooks, bishops & queen. I have no idea WHO they are. The little indecipherable video tutorial is useless. I cannot see a difference in any of the pieces in the \"help\" video. I do not know WHY pieces shoot, how they shoot or when they can shoot. So it is impossible to know if I am making a correct move or not. Why does the gun go off when I am 3x3 squares away diagonally but NOT when I am 1 square away horizontally. I'd think shooting the bad guy in the face would be an option. Guns do work at point blank range. As there are no instructions I cannot recommend this game. In fact I find the lack of any instruction at all as to the goal or mechanics that I can honestly say I think this game is absolutely terrible & no one should waste even a single dollar on it. If you can be bothered to put up a bad video attempt at a tutorial then you can also have a simple text screen explaining the goal of the game is to avoid capture, shoot enemies or capture the flag. As for what happens with the guns I really do not understand. They just happen, these cowboys did not take gun safety class & shoot from the hip at random. They frankly all deserve to die in a Mexican Standoff.","timestamp_created":1609362944,"timestamp_updated":1609362944,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwgLbg2vYCc6jzvgI="}
