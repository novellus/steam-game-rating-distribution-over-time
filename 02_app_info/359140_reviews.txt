This is a fun game! By far the greatest things are the soundtrack and gameplay! Graphics are nice and do the job. But seriously, soundtrack is so good that I will listen to it outside the game as a metal album itself. Perfect for this game! So cool and varied with so much melodies and riffs to memorize!!!!\n\nThe gameplay here is simple just WASD and left click button. That's it. This makes the game work so well. I played this intense game to simply have a blast and no thinking time and it delivered in an excelent way. There are a lot of levels and it took me 12 hours to finished one full playthrought in \"Extreme\" difficulty, the second hardest one. Maybe I could finish it in less time but it got really hard on the final part of act 3 and I had to go back and forth between acts to gain enough experience and improve my stats.\n\nOverall, despite somes levels being a little bit unfair or having lot of difficulty jumps, this is an awesome game.  You want an indie pure action gameplay with blood, explosions, killing and all of this with the most amazing metal ost? Then look no further than this. Great game to get out the stress and have so much fun not thinking to much what and how you're playing.\n\nSolid solid fun 8/10! Give this action brutal carnage metal glory a solid try! You will not regret it!","timestamp_created":1600760700,"timestamp_updated":1600760700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxrux2vQCd/uoowI="}
