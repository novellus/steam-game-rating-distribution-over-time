Life is Beautiful!<\/strong> while I was going through one of the roughest periods of my life and perhaps I’m still here precisely because of this game. I never aim to bring you down, I just want to tell you a story about something that may affect everyone. That nearly happened to me, and may you never be that close to the edge. I don’t really hope to save someone or to make any global impact, but I do hope that you will simply enjoy my game and maybe learn something for you.<br><br>Suicide is one of the most common causes of death worldwide. If you or someone you know is depressed and\/or suffers from suicidal thoughts, the best thing to do is to seek professional help. In such a situation, even the closest people (who do not have the proper training\/preparation may - and often will - only make things worse). There are signals that can let you know that your friend or relative is in a crisis and needs help. I hope that maybe <strong>Wait! Life is Beautiful!<\/strong> will remind you to be attentive to your loved ones. Even if they seem doing perfectly fine, they may be going through rough times.<\/i><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ABOUT THIS GAME<\/h2><br>The process of playing Wait! Life is Beautiful! is similar to watching a film that stimulates a nerve, especially when the viewer finds themselves immersed in the protagonist's anxious state of mind. At the center of the plot is a young guy, an ordinary clerk, he is not at all a hero, and certainly not a magician. <br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/680830\/extras\/s1.gif?t=1601624899\" \/><br><br>Watching him, we are instilled with his emotions such as tiredness from the monotony of life and depressing thoughts about the meaninglessness of life.

This can be difficult because the main character tends to cover up his fear with black humor and an ironic attitude to what is happening. This is his defensive reaction. Against the background of stress from the stories he heard and his regrets about the departed, the main character begins to see dark psychedelic dreams that give rise to a feeling of approaching madness.<br><br><i>However, do not forget: all events and characters in the game are fictional.

Just remember that you can't save everyone.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>THE RIGHT TO DIE<\/strong><\/h2>While hoping to save as many lives as possible, Will encounters an unexpected opposing force: a group of “freedom of choice” activists led by a spiritual guru are actively campaigning for a person’s right to commit suicide.
