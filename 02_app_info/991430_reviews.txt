BUT ... I'm definitely charmed and enriched. And grateful that this game was made. :-)\n\nThe game is an interesting essay on what might happen if someone else is the hero. I liked the experience. Exploring that other perspective. I liked it a lot. I like also how there's many philosophically/psychologically interesting thoughts voiced by different characters weaved in throughout the game.\n\nOne playthrough is rather short. It took me ~4 hours. Clearly, the focus is not on telling a long, complex story, but a short, magical one with different choices that lead to different endings. There are 10 endings, so I guess you'd have to multiply the playing time by a few times, minus time for things like puzzles, which I think you'd just do again the same way each replay? Although the puzzles are well done, so if you let some time pass between playthroughs, they'd have replay value.\n\nThere's only one town, one forest and three dungeons. The story rushes through its story beats quickly - once you figure out what to do next. The lore feels real and mysterious, but not very extensive. I like it as far as it goes. I would like to see more of the world and the characters.\n\nSome things that could be improved:\n- If you overstep your bounds, people tell you off (after all, you are not a chosen one ;-)). I think their ways of doing so could be a little more varied. A few more could be sprinkled in between who react e.g. with humour, or confusion, based on their personalities. Someone could escort you to the door politely but insistingly, or someone could just stare at you meaningfully, or ... etc.\n\n- People tell you off for entering their houses without notice (finally a game that gets that a little more realistic =) ) but there is no way to actually knock on their door or ring a doorbell. Maybe it could be added.\n\n- There could be more things to do in the town area? Especially ... I'd suggest making earning the money for the cloak a little more fun and less repetitive. Maybe the tasks you have to do to earn money could evolve, e.g., at first it's just, please gather wood, then after a while the person says they would also like for you to collect mushrooms for them, and then next something else ... or the guy could say, please take down my laundry, and maybe later you could help him do his dishes or something ...\n\nGenerally, a charming, thoughtful game that could be expanded upon. Unique and refreshing in its approach, it's worth a playthrough (or several).","timestamp_created":1605272229,"timestamp_updated":1605313505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47oSJ4vUCfPONrgI="}
