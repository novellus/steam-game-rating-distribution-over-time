    about_the_game: "In the near future, mankind faces the greatest threat to its\
      \ posterity ever in recorded history: an invading Nazi horde, reborn in the\
      \ depths of space! An armada of Fourth Reich ships, built in secret at a hidden\
      \ base on the moon, descends upon the Earth to rain terror and destruction.<br>But\
      \ this is not done without resistance. A cadre of crack space pilots have stepped\
      \ forth to defend Mother Earth from becoming the new Fatherland of this twisted\
      \ regime. A lone pilot, entering the hangar to see three state-of-the-art, prototypes\
      \ ships awaiting him, knows he is the only one who can save Planet Earth. It\
      \ is up to him and his brothers in arms to ensure that humanity stays free of\
      \ the yolk of Nazism for good and all...<br><br>Set during the main conflict\

      \ an advanced new starfighter, to test his or her might, flight and dogfighting\
      \ skills against the forthcoming Blitzkrieg-on-high. The main objectives are\
      \ to defend Earth and its space installations from enemy attacks, blast as many\
      \ Nazi ships into oblivion as humanly possible, collect and skillfully manage\
      \ necessary resources, and make it alive to the final confrontation\u2026 where\
      \ the ultimate secret weapon of the Fourth Reich awaits those foolishly brave\
