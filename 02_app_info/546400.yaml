    review: 'It is unplayable, unenjoyable, and unworthy of my time.


      Your control options are limited to either the mouse or the arrow keys.

      The arrow keys are probably the most dsyfunctional buttons in this game as they
      make you move diagonally and not the simple up, down, left, right. So the next
      best option is the mouse, which you can use to click and drag the character
      across the levels.


      However, due to the extremely poor level design, your character''s head disappears
      through walls or dies when touching them. Since everything is seen from a bird''s
      eye view on an angle it doesn''t make it any easier to navigate the level without
      hitting something. Even if you are not close to a spiked object, the fact that
      your characters body hovered over the object because the levels were poorly
      layered, you die. The portals look like tears in the space time continuum, white
      ovals with black void in the middle.


      Speaking of levels, when Level 1 is complete you instantly jump to Level 11?!
      What?

      When I completed Level 12 and began Level 13 I exited the game and then restarted
      it again.

      I had to redo Level 12 to get Level 13 to unlock again.


      When I unlocked the second section of the game (because I somehow collected
      all 50 gems from the locked levels?!) the first level was easy enough to complete,
      once I managed to figure out that to continue to the next level I had to slide
      towards the bottom corner of the portal to leave. The games poor design is consistent
      with the second half, just now with new invisible walls that get you stuck and
      killed. WHAT FUN!


      Wouldn''t even call it a game, just a huge mistake.'
