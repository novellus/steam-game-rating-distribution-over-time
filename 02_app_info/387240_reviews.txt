All Productions stopped. „\n„What about Gaea Prime?“\n„The Laser Batteries are working perfekt.“\n„Okay, get me the RAZOR Wing. BLUE Weapon Mode and i want the TRAPID Drone! Fast. We need the Factorys! Our Enemy is not sleeping.“\n„Yes, Sir. When are you planning to take on the Boss of GLACUS PRIME?“\n„Not so soon. Our Wings must be upgraded to stand a Chance. Until then i do some Side Missions after i did the Orbit Patrol. We need more Ressources, or we will lost the War.“\n„RAZOR Wing ready. Good Luck!“\n„Thanks.  Time to test the new Missiles.“\n\nOh yes, a typical Gamesituation, dear Reader.\nWelcome to STEEL RAIN.\n\nFrom the first View it looks like a simple Shooter, but it surely isn`t.\nIt is an amazing Genre Mix. We have Shooting, Economy, Strategy and even RPG Elements. \n\nSo what awaits you?\nShort Story, Earth is lost and the Human Race goes against an overpowering Extraterrestrial  Race. The Plan is to defeat them by conquering Planet after  Planet.\n\nYou have the control of special Fighting Wings. These Wings can be upgraded with special Types of Missiles and also Drones. It feels a little bit like the Satellite from the R-TYPE Ship has ist own Game now, because the Wings looks more like Drones then a Spaceship. Each Wing has 3 Battle Modes, from Range to Melee Attack. They also have different Weapon Types, shown in different Colours. Each Type has its own Strengh and Weakness. Find them out.\nGoing into Battle, your Wing goes old school KATAKIS like Sidescrolling. If it moves, shoot it! There are many different Enemy Types waiting for you and after destroying they, left Coins and Power Ups behind. \n\nMain Target is to conquer the Enemys Planets. Each Planet has 3 Zones. The third Zone is always an Endboss. Defeat them and you can colonize the Planet.\nThat brings you to the Economics Part of the Game.\nBuild Factorys to get upgrades and more. You need them all to rise your Wing and also get new Wings. Have an eye on your Planets, because if they go under attack, all factorys will stop working. Repell the Attack and do also Orbit Patrols. \nYou are also able to get Normal and Elite Skills for each Weapon Type. Believe me, they really make the differenz when you are in Battle.\n\nAnother  Skill Tree is waiting for you, that brings you Benefits for every Section. The more Research Labors you build, the faster they are unlocked.  That goes also for the Trading Part.\nWhile you are going for better Wings to conquer the Planets you can do some different Sidemissions.  You see, there is much to do.\n\nOh, i forgot. The Difficulty Setting is really good done. You can go from Easy to Hardcore Level and each Level has also 10 more Difficultys. Perfectly to test the might of your growing Wings.\nThat all in fast flowing Graphics and guided by a great Soundtrack.\n\nSTEEL RAIN was a Suprise for me. The first Time i saw it, i liked the Cover and i bought it, because i like shooter, yes it looks like a shooter. I really fastly changed my mind. \nThe exceeding thing is, the Principle of the Battles are all the same. Flying sidescrolling left to right, mostly with the same Graphics. But they never ever get boring. They got me from the Legendary „Heroes of Might and Magic“ Addicting part. Just one more Battle. Only one more. And that with the Missions and the Economics part and not to forget the Skill and Research Part is a really addicting combination. There is also a EXPEDITIONS DLC that brings you more Content. Also wonderfull done.\nIf that is not enough, you can design your own Levels, STEEL RAIN has a very nice Level Editor. Have fun.\n\nI´m playing with Mouse and the Wing reacts absolutly perfect, no matter how fast or how slow i move. Well done.\n\nThe Developer was able to find a perfect Balance to this Game.  For me that is amazing.\nThank you very much for over 20 Hours fun and there are more to come. Because just one more Battle, just one. Also thanks for the Amazing Soundtrack, i bought instant, it has a steady Place in my Player.  \n\nSo dear Reader, if you like to experience an interesting and addicting but exceeding Genre Mix in the Shooter Genre, with an amazing Gameplay and fast flowing  Graphicstyle and a fair price then this is for you.\nEnjoy!\n\nThank you for Reading.","timestamp_created":1598903732,"timestamp_updated":1598904908,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.625020086765289307","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjpeKo/QCf5uBnwI="}
