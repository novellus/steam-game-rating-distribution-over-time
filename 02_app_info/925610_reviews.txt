The AI is non existent, jump over them and suckerpunch them in the back, all controls are with the keyboard, except the punch button was with the mouse. I only stuck around for the achievements, once I got the necessary kills/death/timeout and diamonds, I just hopped every enemy and eschewed interaction with most barrels for a quick speedrun past the 20 levels.","timestamp_created":1596841355,"timestamp_updated":1596841355,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ476zK5fMCctaImgI="}
