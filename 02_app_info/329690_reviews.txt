Sometimes the levels are a little bit too hard, but not in cause of the gameplay, it's because of the controlling. It doesn't feel so right, especially in the first level (the first level is a long level, most of the time platforming). The story is interesting and overall it's a good game for an evening. You can skip levels or choose the level you want to play after starting the first level, so that's a nice option if you have problems with something.\n\nHm. I'm not sure if I should like it or not. But because of the artstyle, the atmosphere and the story I would recommend it. And the gameplay is okay.","timestamp_created":1606852341,"timestamp_updated":1606852341,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40J33j/YCf7vKtgI="}
