It's when you go to the areas not shown in the demo, & especially outside the castle, that the game's stability takes a nosedive. I found myself swimming in the air on more than one occasion in the gardens. I also noticed my snail count kept increasing & decreasing on it's own, while the bush travelling behaviour is erratic & inconstant with the rest of the game. Frankly, it goes on, but I'd rather not.\n\nSadly, I can't recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1601275520,"timestamp_updated":1601275520,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558258652687072754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwKzd6fQCcK3KpAI="}
