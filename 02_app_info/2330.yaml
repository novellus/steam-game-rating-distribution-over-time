    review: "This is a mission pack for Quake II, which is an old id Software story\
      \ driven FPS.   As with all mission packs, this is less plotwise and more just\
      \ a semi-random collection of various FPS maps that you can slog through. \n\
      \nQuake II was a great game, but it's far too dated and superseded by Quake\
      \ II RTS.  This mission pack is less enjoyable than the original Quake II campaign,\
      \ but has all the drawbacks.   Finally, it doesn't launch properly, with an\
      \ Error 53 because the developers didn't bother testing the game on Steam before\
      \ launching it.  They know about the problem, but refuse to fix it. \n\nWhile\
      \ you can jump through a lot of contorted hoops to maybe get the game to launch,\
      \ it's unacceptable for the developer to keep selling a product they know is\
      \ broken, with no attempt or intention to fix it.  Thumbs down."
