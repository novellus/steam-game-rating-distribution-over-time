    review: 'I enjoyed playing the game.  However, due to its bugs, I just can''t
      recommend the game.  The bugs don''t make the game unplayable, but present themselves
      enough to where immersion is broken quite often.  Some a critical - like a save
      game getting corrupted.  Some are minor - like user interface not working under
      specific circumstances.  Others are immersion breaking - like warp gates not
      observing the restrictions you place on them (in your own captured sectors).


      I idea behind the game is awesome, but the game isn''t finished.  The developer
      had to cease production on the game due complications with the provider of the
      coding platform...forced abandonment - at least, this is what people on the
      discussion board are saying.  So, the bugs aren''t going to fixed.  So, sadly
      - I have to give it thumbs down.'
