      /><br><br>Deathmatch Soccer is a multiplayer only twin-stick-shooter soccer
      mashup. It takes place in a world where crowds have grown weary of traditional
      soccer, a game that has become too soft. During a match, the crowd will throw
      weapons onto the pitch to keep things lively. The winner is the team who has
      scored the most goals... If they can survive until the final whistle.<br><br>Deathmatch
      Soccer is fast paced soccer mixed with brutal combat. Gun your opponent down
      as they are going for the winning goal. Tactically take out opponents to deny
      them of options. Do whatever it takes to win!

    short_description: Deathmatch Soccer is fast paced soccer mixed with brutal bloody
      combat. During a match, the crowd will throw weapons onto the pitch to spice
      things up. The winner is the team who has scored the most goals... If they can
      survive until the final whistle.
