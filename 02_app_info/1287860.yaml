      /><br>Explore the dying world of Ulm in The Harrowed, a new story-driven RPG
      from Salmon Raws, LLC. In a land torn asunder by magic, six adventurers find
      themselves embroiled in the endless dance of order and chaos. <br><br>The backwater
      village of Elkshire is beset by dark forces from all sides. 300 years after
      the cataclysmic Harrowing ravaged Ulm, rumors of witch's magic, vengeful spirits,
      and man-eating Worgen haunt this quaint logging town. Six outsiders find the
      survival of this community thrust upon their shoulders. It is up to you to guide
      these heroes as they strive to overcome the arcane horrors lurking in every
      shadow.<h2 class="bb_tag">Characters</h2>The party is led by Orena, a young
      nun of the Grand Church of the Allmother. Raised among other orphans by the
      Church, she has been tasked by the Clerics to hunt a renegade mage accused of
      murder. She is escorted by Sergeant Clive Beckett, a gruff career military man
      unable to escape past deeds, and Hargon Buckfield, the snarky footsoldier.<br><img

    review: 'The Harrowed is a fairly well put together game in the old school RPG
      genre. The most succinct way of describing the experience is "short and sweet".
      I completed essentially everything I wanted to in approximately 5 hours, which
      is about the same for everyone else, but at the price point I would say that
      it is well worth it. The absolute strongest point in the game''s favor is the
      world building and lore. I''m always on the lookout for new IP, and this game
      is refreshing in how they tackle traditional fantasy tropes.


      8/10, would definitely recommend.'
