      \ to defeat the horde of NPCs trying to destroy the base. Players will have\
      \ to strike a balance between upgrading their base structures, weapons and skills\
      \ while holding and pushing back the invaders. After turning back the enemy\
      \ hordes, players will have to face their ultimate commander : an Ancient of\
