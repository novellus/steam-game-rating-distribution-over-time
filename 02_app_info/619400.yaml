    review: "This game LACKS saves aka has no file saving system, so keep in mind\
      \ if you exit out of the game. Guess what, there's no option to load the last\
      \ level you were on! This can be very stressful and not fun at all, there's\
      \ not even checkpoints in the game either. So beware that if you die in the\
      \ level, you'll have to redo the entire whole level AGAIN until you complete\
      \ it. Also, the physics and the controls in this game is very terrible meaning\
      \ that it will take a while in learning on how to control your character through\
      \ out the game meanwhile tearing off your hair during the process. I highly\
      \ recommend avoid on buying this game, unless you have money that you have to\
