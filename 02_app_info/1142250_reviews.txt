Not to mention that plot point never actually going anywhere in his route. There's a lot of time that goes by without having any Po events, which is kind of weird on his \"route\". Also, I'm not sure why \none of the days in Po's Novel mode route is almost completely dedicated to Tsitsi, I think Nil shopping for the crossdressing supplies makes a lot more sense, because it features more of Po and actually provides some backstory for him as well. The overarching plot outside of the routes is kind of like AWSW, but I adored AWSW, so i'm down with it. I am of course sad that there's no more Po content after finishing his route, because he is hands-down my favorite character, but the date scene was nice. \n\nSorry I responded to this like it was a piece of fanfiction, but it needed to be done.","timestamp_created":1609901038,"timestamp_updated":1609992454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9+fB7fYCfdXxwAI="}
