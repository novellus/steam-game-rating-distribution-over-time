    about_the_game: "<strong>Off-Road Drive</strong>, the off-road racing simulation\
      \ for PC, is the first game ever to deliver a true-to-life, off-road, extreme\

      \ Trial, Thai Trophy and many other events through the worst driving conditions\
      \ with a variety of natural obstacles like swamps, rocks, snow and sand. <br>\t\
      \t\t\t\t\tNo other game features this variety of off-road sport vehicles including\
      \ tuned stock SUVs and trucks, as well as several classes of prototypes specifically\
      \ built for off-road driving. The vehicles can be equipped with an assortment\
      \ of special cross-country equipment and accessories including winches, low\
      \ gear, differential gear locking, clinometer, altimeter, tire air pressure\
      \ control, sand tracks, etc.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\tThere has never been such an innovative\

      \ will create a rut and will stick to the car and tires affecting its handling.\
      \ Stones will fly from underneath the wheels and damage other trucks. The game\
      \ will feature various surfaces that will not only affect tire friction but\
      \ have complex reactions based on car weight, speed, wheel torque, tire condition,\
