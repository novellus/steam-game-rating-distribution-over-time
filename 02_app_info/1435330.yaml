    review: 'I wanted to wait to post a review until I had completely beaten the game-
      (All of the achievements, that is. Though there is one side-quest I haven''t
      finished yet). Overall, I really enjoyed the game! I liked the stylized cartoony
      visuals and the fun Halloween aesthetic! The different Hallowmon were unique
      looking, and interesting. The open-world is large enough to make it interesting
      to explore, and the side-quests were also fun. The story being told is intriguing
      as well, and I of course won''t spoil anything in this review. The extra things
      you can get by collecting candy is nice too, such as unique trails, and a really
      cool retro-effect. I''ve had a ton of fun with this game, and I believe that
      I will continue to enjoy it! I also cannot wait to see what Stratton Studios
      creates next!


      There is only one complaint I really have about the game, and it isn''t too
      bad. While there are many unique Hallowmon to get in the game, by the end of
      it I found myself primarily sticking to the first one you get, Turtairy. Turtairy
      became strong enough to essentially one-hit any threat I came across, excluding
      Hallowmon types that it is in-effective against, though Turtairy could still
      beat them with ease. Because of this I never entirely felt the need to switch
      Hallowmon. Evenstill, this was only really an issue in the late-game, and doesn''t
      effect the main story much at all.'
