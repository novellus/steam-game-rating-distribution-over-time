The current state of the English translation is so bad I cannot recommend this game. There could be a decent story and it seems to follow a lot of JRPG tropes, but there is no way to really tell at the moment. The stock assests combined with CGI stills looks odd, but it seems like there is at least some effort here. If the translation improves I could see this game being worth buying on sale. I mostly view this as a showcase of the engine features and it does a good job in that regard. Stay far away if you are looking for anything else.\n\n12/31/17 Edit: I tried playing this again due to the updated English translation. The game will no longer lauch and is currenlty unplayable. Buyer beware.\n\n03/31/18 Edit: What sorcery is this?!?! The game is working again and the English translation is a little better. I will try to get further this time and see how it goes.","timestamp_created":1509436482,"timestamp_updated":1522504344,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.640187382698059082","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnJSVvuICeaH4iQE="}
