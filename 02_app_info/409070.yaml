    review: "Every single fiber of my being wants to say that I love this and that\
      \ you should buy it. It's like a mix between Ninja Gaiden and Vice: Project\
      \ Doom on the NES. Tight game play, good music, and a solid understanding of\
      \ what made classic 8-bit games fun. \n\nAnd then the final level came around\
      \ and killed everything.\n\nI can't beat it. I threw in the towel after an hour.\
      \ Why? Nine consecutive screens with only three lives. This should be doable\
      \ except the worst flaws of this game shine through here. 1. You can only use\
      \ the analog stick on your game pad and not the D-pad. That sucks for a 2-D\
      \ platformer. Combine this with rampant input eating. Thought you were going\
      \ to jump? Nope. Thought you were going to hitch to that wall? Nope. The platforming\
      \ at the end became impossible for me because of the input eating due to using\
      \ the analog stick. It sucks and it ruined an otherwise awesome game for me.\
      \ I love the other games Sinclair Strange as put out, but man, I really hope\
      \ this is patched to using D-Pad controls."
