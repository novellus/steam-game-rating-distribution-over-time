      \ is a <strong>Visual Novel</strong> which offers a variable multiple-choice\
      \ decision system. This means that both the number of decision points and the\
      \ number of choices or options that you will find in those decision points may\
      \ vary according to your previous decisions during the game.<br><br><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong><br><br>The\
      \ world where the Omega Pattern story happens is seemingly normal, similar to\
      \ the one we live in. However, genetics and fate mean that a few individuals\
      \ are born with a kind of <strong>Pattern</strong> or special brain signal which\

      \ the shadows, an organization known as <strong>Bioagora</strong> controls the\
      \ world according to its own interests thanks to the power and influences that\
      \ they get, in part, from their Agents. These Agents are people who own the\
      \ Pattern and have been coerced, bought, forced and even captured against their\
      \ will to be brainwashed and indoctrinated, so they can faithfully serve the\
      \ Bioagora.<br><br><strong>Shaiel\e</strong> (21 years old), a man who possesses\

      \ difficult to escape from a power which is increasing exponentially. Seeking\
      \ for allies has become a unavoidable, and it seems that the only alternative\
      \ available are the <strong>Celtas</strong>; a small and poorly organized group\
      \ with unorthodox methods, whose plan to face the Agents and restoring an order\
      \ different to the Bioagora\u2019s seems near impossible.<br><br>As the rest\
      \ of the population stay impassive in a gray world, Shaiel will have Shaiel\
