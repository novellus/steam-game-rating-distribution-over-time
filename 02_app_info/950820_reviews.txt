She's an ok hang, kinda fun.\n\nTalking with Boldir is a joy. She's got a vibe I just love. It's hard to describe... She seems to know a lot about Paradox Space and she's very friendly. The protagonist is finally able to relax for once and spend time with someone they aren't trying to impress.","timestamp_created":1583715635,"timestamp_updated":1583715635,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ489mz3vACfZL69gE="}
