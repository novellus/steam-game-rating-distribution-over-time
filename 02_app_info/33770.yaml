    review: "Drakensange: River of Time is still an awesome game, though I have to\
      \ admit that I, being an old P&P-TDE-player, love almost every TDE -except Book\
      \ of Heroes which is an imposition on every buyer and every TDE-fan.\n\nUnfortunately\
      \ steam sells the game \u201CRiver of Time\u201D in a state, it can be played\
      \ on Windows 10. This is rather brazen towards the buyers of the game. \nThe\
      \ buyers have to make the game playable on Windows 10 on their own.\n\nStarting\
      \ the game with the parameters  \n\u201C-windowed -w *width of your screen resolution*\
      \ -h *height of your screen resolution*\n\nOr\n\n\u201C-novideo\u201D\n\ndoes\
      \ the trick.\n\nThere is also a program for issues like this:\nhttps://github.com/Codeusa/Borderless-Gaming/releases/\n\
      \nI haven\u2019t tried it out. I just tested starting with \u201C-windowed -w\
      \ *width of your screen resolution* -h *height of your screen resolution*\n\n\
      And it worked finely, hence there was no need for me trying the other options.\n\
      Still it would be easy for a big company like steam to include the parameters\
      \ in the launch-options. Unfortunately they haven\u2019t done it and are selling\
      \ game in a unplayable state.\n"
