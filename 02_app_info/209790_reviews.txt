Let's do that now.\n\nSplice is a minimalist puzzle game, unique in its mechanics and its presentation. You need to re-assemble and evolve microbiological organisms using very few mechanics, and also very few moves. Every level specifies the number of moves you can make - although the moves are only for assembly / disassembly, the evolution moves (split, extend, delete) are free. You can reach \"angelic\" solutions on several levels, which means you complete the level with less than the budgeted moves.\nIt's really easy to evaluate Splice - the visuals are sparse but immersive 3d, the music is superb, and the challenges are tough - especially if you're looking to complete the angelic solutions. This is a gem from the early period of the indie revolution - if you like brain exercise, you don't want to miss it.\n","timestamp_created":1608714580,"timestamp_updated":1608714580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgo63x/YCf/qyvAI="}
