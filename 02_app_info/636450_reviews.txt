Loved the game on every release and re-released, and loved this iteration no less. The song tracks are good and for a rail shooter, it's spot on. The new Area X is... alright. You're actually given free reign of movement with a forward and back button. The \"boss\" is a little underwhelming but unoffensive. Something about it feels more like Child of Eden, the game's spiritual successor on the PS3 / Xbox 360, than another Area 5 (Rez's last stage) or something.\n\nOverall recommend. If you like Rez, you'll like this. If you don't like Rez, Area X won't change your mind.\n7/10","timestamp_created":1609821436,"timestamp_updated":1609821436,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhre16PYCfvvMwAI="}
