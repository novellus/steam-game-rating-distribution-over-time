    about_the_game: To strengthen its position in the Pacific Ocean; the United States
      needs to control at least one of the tropical islands such as the Spanish Mariana
      Islands, or the Samoan archipelago. Events in Cuba and internal problems did
      not allow Spain to strengthen its colony in Oceania. The Great powers were not
      interested in supporting the interests of Spain in the Pacific and did not interfere
      in the conflict. None of the contestants wanted a big war. Therefore, only the
      quick clash of colonial squadrons in tropical waters will decide who will rule
      the Mariana Islands after 1887.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Steam-ship period

    review: 'So this is the biggest discount (80%) on one of these franchise games,
      so I had to try it.


      I tried it.  It is not my kind of game.  I didn''t feel like I had much control
      over my small fleet, and it just was a long 45 minutes watching the battle unfold.  I
      won, but I don''t feel so accomplished.


      3/10 at an 80% discount, and I would not buy one of these again I am afraid.  YMMV
      if you are a seriously hard core naval warfare person and want to see two fleets
      line up.  I worry they will all play about the same, just with slightly different
      ships on each side.'
