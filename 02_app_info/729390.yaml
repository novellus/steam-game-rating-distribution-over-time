    about_the_game: "Debris Infinity is an action packed game that puts your reflexes\
      \ to the limit, allowing you to manipulate time itself to make impossible maneuvers,\
      \ using an advance scoring system to rank your performance!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      ><strong>Game Modes</strong></h2>Take control and face one of the 3 challenging\
      \ game modes available:<br><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Normal Mode:</strong>\
      \ Get the maximum score against increasingly harder enemy attacks that will\
      \ improve their strategy depending on how well you are playing.<br> \t</li><li><strong>Time\
      \ Attack:</strong> You have 3 minutes to achieve the highest score ever. Your\
      \ ship will have infinite shields but each enemy impact decreases your score...\
      \ you can end up with a negative score if you are not careful!<br> \t</li><li><strong>Power\
      \ Wave:</strong> Enemies will attack in waves and you are on a time limit! Each\
      \ cleared wave awards you with a time extension so play smart to minimize time\
      \ wasted, avoiding collisions, of course.</li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Scoring\
      \ System</strong></h2>There is an advanced scoring system that rewards precision\
      \ and reflexes:<br><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Combos:</strong>\
      \ Destroying enemies constantly without letting the Combo Meter to be depleted\
      \ will increase the current combo and the score value of each enemy.<br> \t\
      </li><li><strong>Streak:</strong> Defeat enemies without receiving damage will\
      \ increase the score multiplier. Being impacted reduces it.<br> \t</li><li><strong>Reflex:</strong>\
      \ Get a score bonus by having good reflexes and destroying enemies as soon as\
      \ they appear. The longer they stay active, the smaller the bonus.<br> \t</li><li><strong>Chains:</strong>\
      \ Destroy enemies of the same color in groups of 4 to create a chain. Chaining\
      \ rewards you with a bit of energy for slowing down time or launching a powerful\
      \ hyperbomb. Make lots of chains and you will get a temporal bonus weapon or\
      \ more shield.</li></ul><br><strong>KEEP THIS IN MIND: Be elusive. Be intense.\
      \ Be constant.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Multiplayer modes</strong></h2>Find\
      \ a friend, bring a gamepad and enjoy the multiplayer modes. You just need one\
      \ gamepad and player 2 can use the keyboard and mouse! Although when the competition\
      \ heats up 2 gamepads is the way to go!<br><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Coop:</strong>\
      \ Are you both in tune with each other? Then bring it on! One player will be\
      \ the pilot, managing movment and manipulating time. The other will be the gunner,\
      \ controlling weapons and the ever-precious hyperbombs. But remember, both bombs\
      \ and slowdown use the same energy reserve... Face all of the singleplayer challenge\
      \ from a different perspective, working as a team!<br> \t</li><li><strong>Versus:</strong>\
      \ Two ships on screen, thousands of enemies approaching. Who will get the higher\
      \ score? Use your ability and mind-games to pull ahead! Lure enemies into your\
      \ oponent's path! Or break his huge combo with a well-timed hyperbomb! And this\
      \ is important: If the current winner dies, the loser just might survive long\
      \ enough to surpass his record and win, so every point counts!</li></ul><h2\

    review: I just love this game, I'll give any twin stick shooter a go but this
      one's my favourite from the last few years. addictive score chasing and a leaderboard
      which is approachable makes this a winner for me. Highly recommended.
