    about_the_game: "V16 engines are the largest capacity engine configuration available\
      \ in Automation, with a capacity range of 1.1L - 21.7L. While it is not giving\
      \ players any direct advantage, it offers a nuanced alternative to V12 engines\
      \ for very-high-end cars.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBack before Steam Early Access\
      \ was a thing, we did sell an early version of Automation via our own website.\
      \ From 2012 to 2014, potential buyers had the choice between base version ($25),\
      \ and a premium version ($35) of the game for players who wanted to support\
      \ development a little extra. The latter promised the inclusion of exclusive\
      \ V16 engines as soon as they are done. Now, after almost a year of V16 exclusivity\
      \ for those early premium version buyers, we offer the upgrade to anyone who\
      \ missed out back then and still wants to support us today."
