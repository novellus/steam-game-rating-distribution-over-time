I even thought that this game is broken because no key on keyboard choose options in menu. Than I've relized that's left mouse button!  Strange decition, I didn't recall it from any other game. You can't rebind keys and game has no support controller so it's just add to the problem... Oh btw if you click right mouse button you've just see your cursor he he \"nice\" coding. Main character has no diagonal animations, so it's look very ankward then you're going this direction. You're just collect stuff and there is no indication which key or item you had.","timestamp_created":1537555388,"timestamp_updated":1607124481,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vq6FmPYCc7SPqwE="}
