Can be good for children but for adults it will probably be over fast. You judge for yourself if the price is worth it. It has only about 4 monster types and you play in a labyrinth with limited attack powers. \n\nStill, I appreciate a game about math education making it's way to Steam and I hope the developer can make something more complex in the future.\nRecommendation for future development: instead of the labyrinth we could have winning streaks and if you are good, the calculations can become harder, otherwise they can become easier, after the 2 digits mark.
