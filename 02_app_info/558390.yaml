    review: "I can't argue that the clothes and paint jobs in this pack aren't nice.\
      \ Honestly though, I don't think they are worth such a price even during a sale.\
      \ Most items you can buy or find in the base game are also very good. All oft\
      \ them allow you to customise your character in a way you want and still look\
      \ dope. \n\n[b]I woudln't recommend buying this DLC or any other similar pack.[/b]"
