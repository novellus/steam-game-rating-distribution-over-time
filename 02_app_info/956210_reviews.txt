It is still not clear how to earn the stars and if you can get them again if you replay (grind) the same missions. Good for denfence grid veterans searching for hard game.\n\n\n\n28.04.2020  \nI am writing this from a working notebook.... I am to 85 % sure that THIS game damaged my \n650 â‚¬ preselected/delidded/liquid metal modded CPU, with a delivery waiting time of a month....even if I would rebuy it instantly (in corona times the delivery situation is much worse). Do not play it on multicore CPUs, it overloads them like a burnin test..\nI wish I would have never installed it.\n\nSmall update: after all was lost, I manually disabled the cooling a did a real \"burn in\" for 24 h with  real  CPU overload.  It finally repaired the weak solder point somwhere in the PC. It runs again without problems.","timestamp_created":1587330876,"timestamp_updated":1604156835,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.424073785543441772","comment_count":11,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y9jMv/UCe/mHggI="}
