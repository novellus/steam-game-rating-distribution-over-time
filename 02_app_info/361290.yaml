    review: "This is the first DLC I bought so I can\u2019t really compare it to anything.\
      \ Take this review with a grain of salt.\n\nThis map is really high quality,\
      \ it\u2019s clear that the devs spent a lot of time making Chicago as realistic\
      \ as they can. It is really cool to see the landmarks in Chicago that I have\
      \ been to. Now, one downside to this map is that since it is Chicago you would\
      \ want a lot of traffic and people, but this will slow down the FPS. Then add\
      \ the buildings, and the FPS goes down more. I have been able to get 20-40 frames\
      \ per second while in downtown. 20 FPS mainly only happens when it needs to\
      \ load tiles. Anyways, pretty much the map is very high quality. Just be aware\
      \ that the optimization isn\u2019t very good.\n\nThis map comes with 2 routes,\
      \ 130 and 127. I haven\u2019t played Chicago too much so I really haven\u2019\
      t experienced all the routes to its fullest. I do think 2 routes are good enough\
      \ as they are both long routes which I like. \n\nThe Chicago Citybus may have\
      \ to be one of my favorite buses, the bus is great. \n\nOverall, 9/10"
