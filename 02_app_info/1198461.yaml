    about_the_game: "Development of the Fw-190 D-9 started in 1942 as a high-altitude\
      \ interceptor to counter the Allied air threat on the Western front. The \u2018\
      Dora\u2019 as it was known, included many cutting-edge technologies of the time.\
      \ Its elongated nose housed the high-altitude liquid cooled Jumo 213\u0410-1\
      \ engine equipped with MW-50 water-methanol injection system that enabled it\
      \ to develop power up to 2100 HP. The armament consisted of two 13mm MG131 machine\
      \ guns in the nose and two 20mm MG 151/20 cannons in the wing root. It started\
      \ to appear above the front lines during Autumn 1944 and although it got a cold\
      \ initial reception from the German pilots, it later earned their trust and\
      \ is considered to be the best German piston-powered fighter of the late war\
      \ period. The Dora would often be used to protect Me-262 jets during their vulnerable\

    short_description: It started to appear above the front lines during Autumn 1944
      and although it got a cold initial reception from the German pilots, it later
      earned their trust and is considered to be the best German piston-powered fighter
      of the late war period.

    review: The Dora-9 is one of my favorite WW2 fighters so it's awesome to finally
      see it flyable in a game. This edition is nicely modeled and detailed. Probably
      my favorite to fly in combat. Superior vertical maneuverability and speed, and
      powerful and accurate armament.
