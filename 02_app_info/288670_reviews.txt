The majority of the puzzles were hard and I had to cheat for one of them. The hidden object games are challenging and this is actually worth a couple of bucks. Some of the games were actually weird for a hidden object game, like bejewelled and clicking on objects. It was definitely unique.\nTook me just over 4hrs.","timestamp_created":1609408389,"timestamp_updated":1609408389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+OON3PYCeZ6HvwI="}
