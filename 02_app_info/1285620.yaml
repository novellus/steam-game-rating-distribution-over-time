    review: "Normally i would write here a long review about the game aspects but\
      \ this game is such bad that i wouldn't even know what i should describe.\n\
      \ Here a video\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2303107379\n\
      \nThis game is one of the worst platformers i ever played.\n9$ for a game with\
      \ bought assets which you get for about 5$.\nThe game has:\n- 1 enemy\n- 1 tile\
      \ set\n- 1 char\nthat was all.\nAnd even with this little content it has still\
      \ bad controls, bad colliders and even mising animations. Also levels have nor\
      \ eal end. At a specific level position without any information or viewable\
      \ goal the level ends and you get directly spawned to to next level. \nLook\
      \ the video to see how bad it is."
