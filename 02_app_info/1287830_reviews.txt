The way to get it is painfully long, I mean it my shoulders got tired getting to it, because there is no rest point and if you click twice on grab the same support you fall and have to start all over again. Too bad because the outfit the girl has in the snow is the best to me, but also the hardest.\n\nAnother thing that would be fine would be a theater mode, once you unlock the dances there is no way to watch them again without having to go through all the level again, I think that could be fix with a patch to add it.\n\nThis game feels like a very good beta of a longer more compleate game. But there is not much to it, but again it se quite cheep so you get a good run for your money.","timestamp_created":1606933663,"timestamp_updated":1606933663,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40bmtkvYCfcXotgI="}
