I did not play any tower defense before so can't say how good it is in this sub-genre but in general it is fun and I am getting that \"let's try one more level\" itch.\n\nGraphics in VR - it is actually nicer than what the screenshots might suggest. Simple but neat. I had no problems playing, it was fluid, responsive, no bugs or crashes encountered. Good game to dive in for some quick fun but also for longer session trying several levels in a row.","timestamp_created":1595072199,"timestamp_updated":1595072279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ne7tsPMCcI2HlgI="}
