      back, or the sun that is never going to rise... All of them!<h2 class="bb_tag">THE
      DROWNER''S ABILITY</h2><strong>Sink</strong>: The Drowner traps the Gamblers
      in a sink instead of hitting them. Gamblers have to free themselves or get rescued
      in 120 seconds, or will be seriously wounded when the sink drowns them. Captured
      Gamblers may attempt to flee from the sink with probabilities of 50%/40%/30%.<br><br><strong>Venom</strong>:
      The Drowner may teleport a distance to the front and leave a pond there (Up
      to 4 in total). The first Gambler stepping on the pond is cursed to be seen
      as a pair of red shoes and be sensed by the Devil for 10 seconds. Cursed Gambler
      will transfer the curse to a cardholder when they touch it, and the next Gambler
      touching the same cardholder carries on the curse.<h2 class="bb_tag">THE DROWNER''S
      CHEATS</h2><strong>Isolation</strong>: Cursed Gambler will need 5 seconds extra
      time/10 seconds extra time/be unable to be rescued from the Sink by peer Gamblers.
      Cleansed people don''t need anyone by their side.<br><br><strong>Deterioration</strong>:
      Gamblers staying within 10 meters of the cursed Gambler or cardholder for 10
      seconds expose their aura to the Drowner for 5/10/15 seconds.<h2 class="bb_tag">THE
      DROWNER''S EXCLUSIVE TRUMP</h2><strong>Gloat</strong>: Whenever a Gambler is
      cursed, the radius of the sink is expanded by 5% (20% max).'
