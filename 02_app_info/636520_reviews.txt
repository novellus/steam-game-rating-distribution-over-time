It's very walking simulator with eerie noise. There just isn't anything to it beyond that.\n\nThis is a $1 horror game. Try not to pay more than that or you'll be disappointed. Think of it as the B-movie horror bin of gaming.\n\nI bought it on a cheap sale, if I'd paid full price for this I may have been more inclined to make this a thumbs down.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]","timestamp_created":1517147565,"timestamp_updated":1609454123,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.432225733995437622","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/5683fYCe6CwlwE="}
