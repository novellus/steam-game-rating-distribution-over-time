From the graphics etc. I figured I give it a shot but I got bored pretty quickly. plus the camera is super sensitive some of the enemies are tougher than they look. \n\nthey just need to work on it a lot more before they sell it. If they add more to it a story line for each character or achievements and more levels a tutorial etc then I can see this being a lot better. but at the state it is now. not worth the time or money.","timestamp_created":1558191790,"timestamp_updated":1558191790,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.622189700603485107","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw+/rd5eoCdNG1wQE="}
