    about_the_game: 'Experience the town hub plus two dungeon levels of Ampersat,
      a shooty, slashy, RPG-y game mixing old-school/retro and modern sensibilities.
      A blend of influences from Gauntlet and Smash TV to Zelda and a dash of Angband,
      this is a handcrafted adventure with much appeal to fans of Roguelites. A labor
      of love from a solo developer, the full game of Ampersat distills some favorite
      childhood gaming experiences into a fresh, fun hybrid that sees you killing
      a lot of monsters, finding a lot of loot, freeing captured letters (um, what?)
      and growing from a world-weary warrior mage into a powerful smashing/blasting
      machine!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1430700/extras/ampersat_action.gif?t=1601943188"
      /><br><br>In the demo, head North or East to the two available levels. You can
      also explore the village and do everything you can in the full game except unlock
      the Well (which hides randomized levels for quick blasts or grinding).<br><br><img

      Some are not complete and expect a few issues!***</strong>'
