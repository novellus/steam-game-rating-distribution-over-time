At 35yrs old, Qud changed my  perception of what it takes to create an immersive experience. I've since gone on and tried many more. And while they all have their own quirks and flair...they aren't Qud. It took me a while to realize  exactly what it was that brings me back because  I assure you I'm not good. \n\nIt's the ambiance, The soundscape in this game in unmatched.  \n\nYou ever eat too many mushrooms and then lay curled up in a ball on your couch for 3hrs? Bouncing back and forth between \"this is terribly uncomfortable\" and being one with the universe. Despite the ups and downs you tell yourself it was worth it. That is how I feel about this soundtrack. It doesn't exist to make you comfortable.. It's only goal is to transport you somewhere else.\n\nThanks. You killed it.\n\n","timestamp_created":1609317756,"timestamp_updated":1609317756,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxoW02fYCeNjbvgI="}
