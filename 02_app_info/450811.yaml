    review: Fun guy. Keep in mind he is supposed to fail Tzeentch curse chance. His
      special ability is that he only causes radius effects when he does so. This
      means he can't go ooa from his own casting. He's a bomb to throw into your enemies.
      Some of his spells are just insane. Even without his spells he is a good melee
      character.
