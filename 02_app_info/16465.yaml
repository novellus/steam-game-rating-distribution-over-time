    review: "[h1]The war has begun, just as I dreamed it would. Just as I foresaw.\
      \ The time has come to awaken! To be... reborn[/h1]\n\nI usually do not cover\
      \ a separate review for DLCs and expansions but I made an exception with F.E.A.R\
      \ Reborn because I loved it! It\u2019s a very fun dlc. It\u2019s only an hour\
      \ long (you could finish it in less than 45 minutes if you\u2019re very good!)\
      \ and despite the short length I\u2019m not disappointed. I\u2019ve enjoyed\
      \ it more than the base game and it\u2019s rare to have such great fun with\
      \ expansion. Reborn has a bigger focus on action and the pacing is very fast\
      \ yet doesn\u2019t feel rushed. If you\u2019re expecting this to be Perseus\
      \ Mandate and Extraction Point like experience then you\u2019re going to be\
      \ terribly disappointed with short length and heavy focus on action.\n\nYou\
      \ play as a replicant soldier this time around. Things go even wilder and supernatural\
      \ in the background with an apocalyptic and destructive chaos. The story is\
      \ very straightforward and very silly. It doesn\u2019t mean the story is bad\
      \ in any shape or form because it\u2019s story surprisingly works effectively\
      \ well. Minos spoilers ahead!! They brought back Paxton Fettel from the first\
      \ game and yes, he is alive, reasons unknown? You\u2019re controlled by him\
      \ and your mission is simple. Set Fettel free\u2026. that\u2019s it! Reborn\
      \ delivers a tense final battle and a true climax that will have you pining\
      \ for a sequel, which is in pleasant contrast to F.E.A.R. 2's final WTF?? moment,\
      \ which probably left me more confused and disappointed. With Reborn It seemed\
      \ like they were trying to set a foundation for Fear 3. \n\nAlthough the developers\
      \ resorted to reused assets from the main game, I expected them to just recycle\
      \ the same environments and locations and the good news is that they didn\u2019\
      t!!  It\u2019s not very perfect though. I\u2019m not a hundred percent sure\
      \ about this but enemy A.I seemed to be slightly toned down and acted a lot\
      \ dumber. Graphics also looked worse especially in cutscenes and background.\
      \ There aren\u2019t any new enemy types so you\u2019ll still be fighting the\
      \ same Armacham\u2019s soldiers, feral creatures, ghosts, mini bosses and assassins.\
      \ Reborn lacks the tense creepy atmosphere from the Project Origins. It also\
      \ doesn't provide any real creep-outs or scary scenes. \n\nIn spite of some\
      \ minor setbacks, I got more than what I expected. The dlc retains the same\
      \ gameplay from F.E.A.R 2 with minor touches here and there. The short story\
      \ provides a more gratifying bridge to the sequel and I think that\u2019s cool!\
      \ \n\n[h1]My Rating: 8/10[/h1]"
