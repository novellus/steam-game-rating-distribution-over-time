    review: 'I got Splice out recently for a replay (because after 5 years I don''t
      recall any of the solutions :D ), and realized I haven''t given it a recommendation.
      Let''s do that now.


      Splice is a minimalist puzzle game, unique in its mechanics and its presentation.
      You need to re-assemble and evolve microbiological organisms using very few
      mechanics, and also very few moves. Every level specifies the number of moves
      you can make - although the moves are only for assembly / disassembly, the evolution
      moves (split, extend, delete) are free. You can reach "angelic" solutions on
      several levels, which means you complete the level with less than the budgeted
      moves.

      It''s really easy to evaluate Splice - the visuals are sparse but immersive
      3d, the music is superb, and the challenges are tough - especially if you''re
      looking to complete the angelic solutions. This is a gem from the early period
      of the indie revolution - if you like brain exercise, you don''t want to miss
      it.
