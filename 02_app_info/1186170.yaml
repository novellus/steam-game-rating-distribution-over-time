    about_the_game: 'Myriad TD is a tower defense strategy game. You build towers
      on a map of hexagons that will attack and defeat oncoming waves of enemies.
      Towers can be upgrade and some have varied upgrade paths. The goal is clear
      as many waves as possible.<h2 class="bb_tag">7 Unique Towers</h2>Choose from
      a variety of unique towers that target enemies in different ways. Want to flood
      your enemies with damage, Storm tower is what you want. Need an extra edge against
      the Starfish Boss wave, then the Missile tower has your back. Mix and match
      placement to find your ideal build configuration.<h2 class="bb_tag">Varied Upgrade
      Paths</h2>Some towers have upgrade paths you can take to increase their efficiency
      in battle!<h2 class="bb_tag">Build a Maze</h2>Each level allows you to weave
      an intricate maze to force enemies in the direction you want to, giving you
      more time to take them out.<h2 class="bb_tag">Strategic Level Tiles</h2>Each
      level map can contain any number of level tiles that add strategy to the game
      play. Try to avoid hazardous tiles like the lightning bolt tile that speeds
      up enemies, or maze all the enemies into the minus tile that will deal damage
      to the enemies for you.<h2 class="bb_tag">Unlimited Waves</h2>Each level has
      an unlimited number of enemies. How far can you get?<h2 class="bb_tag">4 Unique
      Enemies</h2>There are 4 types of enemies; Skull: Which is the basic Unit. Speedy:
      Which has slightly reduced health but increased movement. Carapace: Has increased
      health but when it hits half health you break it''s shell and it tries to speed
      away. Starfish: This wave is just one Boss enemy with very high health.'
