So you would end up paying $15 ($5+$10) or $20 to cover the NX cost.","timestamp_created":1421884428,"timestamp_updated":1421884428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.718297898769378662","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7tG6h8sCcO7mNQ=="}
