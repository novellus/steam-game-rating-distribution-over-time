      /><br>Hello everyone!<br><br>This is Verinius, the creator of Lawmage Academy.
      I have been working alone on this project back in 2018 using RPG Maker MV. After
      releasing the demo in Itch, it was received positively by the community and
      was featured by several indie game streamers at Twitch. This is my first game
      and to know that people genuinely enjoyed what I have created makes me happy.<br><br>I
      have no background in making games so I had to learn the necessary skills by
      watching Youtube tutorials. Currently, I am working full time as a lawyer and
      work on the game in my free time. Fortunately, I was able to save up some money
      to commission some illustrations and music for this demo. This is a learning
      process for me so I am grateful for your patience and support. <br><br>I hope
      you enjoy the demo!<br><br>- Verinius
