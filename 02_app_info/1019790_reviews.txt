You have the good guys: Bigfoot, Enki, Nessie and Jeff. The Evil guys are Clíodhna, General Chad, Grandpa Krampus and Kukulkan. Each group are determined to defeat the other side to fulfill their task, and emerge victorious with their own personal ending.\n\nThe game is quite simple to play, as it only requires a directional input, and 2 buttons.  One button is to jump, the other is to attack.  You battle each foe until their health bar is depleted, and you advance, or lose, and give it another go until all your lives are lost.  The battles consist of 4 characters, which will be determined by which character you choose. Should you chose the Supernatural Super Squad, you'll face against Kukulkan Forces, and vice-versa.\n\nSOUND:\n\nThe game has a very energetic music composition, that will be a nice tune to add to the battle, but often will be drowned by the fighters attack voices and one-liners.  Still, the music is not much to pay mind to when battling, but it doesn't keep the momentum of excitement while brawling.  The ending theme is well done, so that's a good reward to enjoy when ya beat the Single Player mode. 6/10\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\nThe game uses Unity to produce the background and design of the game.  I for one, am not a guy persuaded by graphics, as long as they define to be what they are meant to be, which it does just that.  The stages are quite large and spacious, showing their unique qualities that a venue would provide.  The Forest stage, has trees and rocks, the Snow stage has falling snow and mountains.  It's all there.\nThe characters are what shows more unique design in the aspect, and they all have their design style.  Nessie is by far the least design detailed character, while Clíodhna and Kukulkan shows the best in anatomy build. Everyone else have their own cartoony -style design which makes the roster have its diversity.  8/10\n\nCONTROLS:\n\nVery simple to play, and very frustrating to get to do what you want it to do some of the times.  I tend to mash my inputs fairly quick, which the game would acknowledge it half the time.  The best way to get the commands to work, is to press each combination once, and with some pause in between.  As I described before, it only uses directional inputs and 2 buttons.  The battles can get quite repetitive with very few directional attack input, which limits the game spectrum of possible attack patterns.  I do hope it could be improved down the road but as I said, very simple to play at least.  4/10\n\nREPLAYABILITY:\n\nYou start off with Bigfoot and Clíodhna, and unlock their teams as you play the Single Player mode.  Once you defeat the group, you'll be rewarded with a new character.  Play the new character, lather, rinse and repeat, until all of them are unlocked.  Once they are unlocked, you can pit them in Arena Mode, where you can battle 2 to 4 players, either Local Multiplayer or against the CPU.  The game can get hectic VS 2 more opponents, compared to the Single Player mode, and that's where most of the time invested in replaying the game will be at.  Hope that will settle for some mayhem if ya wanna beat someone with mythical creatures!  8/10\n\nVERDICT:\n\nAll in all, this seems to be a fun game to play and enjoy with friends, and good game to start off.  I am pleased to have taken the time to enjoy the game and give it my honest, not biased-driven opinion of it.\n\nIf you wanna sit and try out a new, upcoming game with Bigfoot, Aliens and Nessie duking it out? Look no further!\n\nIf you're looking for a game that tickles the fancy Smash style fighting game? This is not for you. (But maybe with enough efforts and dedication to get this game some support, it could become a worthwhile Smash-like game!)\n\nI would gladly recommend this quirky fun game with others, to spread the elusivity of mythical creatures brawling it out!","timestamp_created":1559912877,"timestamp_updated":1559912894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw47mDmesCd6r2wgE="}
