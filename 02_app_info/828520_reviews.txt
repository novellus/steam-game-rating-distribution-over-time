Normally I'm late to the party and don't think what I have to say will be noticed, but this game deserves more attention.\n\nI grew up playing games in arcades, and I would have thrown a lot of quarters at Metis One.\n\nIt's a new, true old-school classic.\n\nDon't expect to just blow through everything.  Need good reactions, but that's not going to get you through everything.\nYou're going to have to get down the patterns and timing and really learn where to be before you need to be there.\n\nThat takes playing, failing, memorizing, and playing again.  Thankfully, it doesn't take another quarter every few lives.\n\nAlso has some cool throwback options in the menus.  Personally I love the old Super C style soundtest.\n\n- Graphics are fun and the color scheme is rad.\n- Soundtrack and audio belong in an arcade.  They fit the game perfectly.\n- Level design is cool.  Progressing to a new point is always interesting.\n\nWould definitely recommend for any other arcade veterans or for anyone that wants to experience what those games were like.\n\nJust remember, you're going to die a lot, but it's always fair...you'll know why you died and how to beat that part next time if you pay attention.  (Haven't encountered any gameplay glitches.)","timestamp_created":1536022384,"timestamp_updated":1536022557,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lIaF0eUCdbj9qQE="}
