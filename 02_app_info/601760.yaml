    review: 'i kind of hate to thumbs-down this simply because there are very few
      choices for music visualizers on the rift right now, and its definitely cheap
      enough to lower the bar on expectations, but... still. even at $2 i cant recommend
      it right now.  this is definitely as barebones as software comes, and usability
      is pretty terrible:


      1) the requirement to mash buttons on my keyboard is a terrible idea. to the
      dev: you seriously have to get at the very very least FULL controller support
      in here, and ideally, support for motion control.  there are so few controls
      for this that there is no excuse for it. yes, sure, i could map keyboard/mouse
      controls to my gamepad or the touch controllers, but i shouldnt have to... and
      frankly it isnt worth the effort because of:


      2) as near as i can tell i can only play one song at a time, then have to go
      back to hunting for the L key on my keyboard to load another track. seriously?
      one track at a time? no. just... no.


      aside from the usability issues, the visualizer itself is not great. there are
      very few scenes available, with no settings for them at all, no ability to set
      it to auto-cycle scenes, and the scenes are fairly underwhelming.


      this could go from a thumbs down to a thumbs up with a few changes:


      1) as stated earlier, support at the bare minimum gamepads, and ideally the
      touch controllers. eliminate reliance on the kb/mouse entirely.


      2) add visualization for other sound sources, so i can set up a playlist in
      play music or spotify or whatever else and use the visualizer... or at a minimum,
      playlist support


      3) improve the existing scenes, add options (colors, color cycling, intensity,
      scene cycling, etc), and add more scenes


      4) add some UI elements, that fade in and out depending on whether or not theyre
      in use... or add a UI ''palette'' to your wrist for use with motion controls...
      or SOMEthing...'
