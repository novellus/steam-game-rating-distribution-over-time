    review: "This could be a decent game if it weren't for a few inexcusable, game\
      \ breaking issues. \nFirst, the flashlight shuts off every few seconds for no\
      \ reason and plunges you into darkness. So you have to turn the flashlight back\
      \ on every few seconds (literally) throughout the entire game. \nSecondly, while\
      \ the save feature works, it forces you to sit through the opening scene every\
      \ single time you load, AND you lose your flashlight when it loads. So the save\
      \ function is useless since you absolutely cannot see or make progress without\
      \ the flashlight, which means you have to restart the entire game from the beginning\
      \ each time you die so you can get the flashlight."
