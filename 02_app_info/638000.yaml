    review: 'I love the variation - you have ski lifts, tow bars, bikes, skis, motorbikes,
      and snowmobiles - each present their own challenge, and switching between them
      keeps things fresh. The difficulty curve is good, and most levels allow for
      some degree of creativity or abuse; very few levels feel locked in to one specific
      solution. The primary focus is building the "bridges" and occasionally there
      are silly or challenging maps. Bridge Constructor is still my favorite, but
      I like it a hack of a lot more than PolyBridge (which I dislike for many reasons.)


      There are a few things I think could have been better. The structures seem a
      little weak compared to other bridge builders, often I found myself mystified
      by a stress point and brute forcing slightly tweaked supports. The physics can
      be a little chaotic sometimes - change a piece and suddenly a completely disconnected
      structure fails. The money cap (aka point over which you won''t get a trophy)
      is a bit tight so as to limit creative or novel solutions possible.'
