    review: "Great game. I remember playing this a long time ago... I think it was\
      \ back in the mid 90s, with Windows 95 or so. Quite addictive. Spent hours playing\
      \ it. I was quite happy and surprised to see this on Steam. No longer neeed\
      \ to use my old original disks, which I had to run through Wine. Instead game\
      \ works natively on Linux! \n\nThere will be many more hours waiting for me\
      \ to play this!"
