The story, mechanics, art, enemies, challenge.\nThe problem is there is no save feature. As I unlocked more and the runs started to get longer, I just kinda lost interest in having to devote a larger block of time for a single run. A lot of rogue like games have some sort of autosave and autodelete system to still keep the challenge, but still let you take a break.","timestamp_created":1608224013,"timestamp_updated":1608224013,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rN/nuPYCceP9ugI="}
