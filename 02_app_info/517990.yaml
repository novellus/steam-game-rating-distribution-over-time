    about_the_game: "City VR is an immersive virtual reality experience that allows\
      \ you to discover new perspectives from which to look upon the world we live\
      \ in. Every street and address matches its real-world equivalent - but City\
      \ VR is more than just a 3D map. It enables you to travel through the streets\
      \ like a giant, observe architecture from up on high, zoom in to the ground\
      \ or zoom out to the air, change lighting and weather, and take snapshots of\
      \ the most unique city views that you can discover.<br><br>Empower yourself\
      \ with a headset and free your spirit of directing the discoveries in City VR.<br>\
      \ <br>Featuring Cities:<br>[Available Now]<br>- San Francisco, USA: Stand atop\
      \ the Transamerica Pyramid. Walk to the Coit Tower like a giant. Sit inside\
      \ the AT&amp;T park. Watch the sunset behind the Golden Gate Bridge, then teleport\
      \ across the city and use time-lapse to make it rise again over the Bay Bridge<br><br>[Upcoming\
      \ in separate DLCs] <br>- Chicago, USA: Observe the city skyline reflection\
      \ on Cloud Gate in the Millennium Park. Take a 1,450-foot leap from Lake Michigan\
      \ to the SkyDeck at Willis Tower.<br>- New York City, USA: Stand at the top\
      \ of the Empire State Building. Look down on Times Square and take a walk at\
      \ the Fifth Avenue. <br> <br>Supporting VR Headsets:<br>Currently on HTC Vive\
      \ only. <br>Oculus will be supported soon.<br><br>City VR is inspired by Skywand,\
      \ an immersive motion control system for aerial filming. As Amber Garage\u2019\
      s first artwork that, Skywand allows anyone, including cinematographers and\
      \ those with zero drone experience, to create precise aerial filming plans in\
      \ an intuitive 3D virtual interface, then have actual drone flights executed\
      \ accordingly. Skywand eliminates technical barriers to achieve professional\
      \ drone cinematography by automating the flight process and arming visionary\
      \ filmmakers with a powerful and intelligent partner."

    review: "Discussing about the price is understandable. And, Ok many possibilities\
      \ appear for next step (someone already asked for them above somewhere) and\
      \ we would like to already have them available. But i still liked to \"visit\"\
      \ the city like this. Its is just funny and impressive. Discovering the wolrd\
      \ for virtual is great. We won't have time to visit all for real ! I imagine\
      \ the next step : google streets with VR , everywhere ! \nBut concerning this\
      \ city VR san francisco : i only have a part of the map. No golden gate like\
      \ on some pictures. Do u guys have the whole city ?\nsteph\n(sorry for my english)"
