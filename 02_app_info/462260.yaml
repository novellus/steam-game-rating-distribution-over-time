    about_the_game: The Space Marines are the greatest of humanity's warriors, fierce
      soldiers that have been subjected to intense training, genetic modification,
      and psycho-conditioning. Their fleets are experts at close-ranged battles, sporting
      well-armoured ships and specialize in aggressive boarding techniques. In addition,
      they have access to two unique faction traits which makes them immune to insubordination
      mechanics and gives them the ability to prioritize their attacks on different
      subsystems when boarding.<br><br>The Space Marines DLC includes 5 different
      Space Marine chapters.<h2 class="bb_tag">Dark Angels</h2>Due to their dark past,
      Dark Angels have a Chapter culture revolving around secrecy and repentance.
      Their Chapter Master, Azrael, spares no expense to protect mankind, keep the
      truth hidden and, when possible, hunt the Fallen, former Battle Brothers who
      betrayed the Emperor.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/462260/extras/BFG_SpaceMarines_DarkAngels_610x176.png?t=1473669355"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Blood Angels</h2>The Blood Angels are a Chapter known for
      their impressive bloodlust, and an occasionnal deadly rage, but also for their
      keen aesthetic skills and their exceptionnal longevity, even for Space Marines.
      Their Chapter Master, Dante, is more than a millennia-old, and leads his Chapter
      wisely and with exceptional efficiency.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/462260/extras/BFG_SpaceMarines_BloodAngels_610x176.png?t=1473669355"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Ultramarines</h2>The Ultramarines pride themselves on their
      strict adherence to the Codex Astartes, and view themselves as an example for
      all Space Marines Chapters. To the Ultramarines, the Codex is more than a set
      of rules, it represents discipline and respect for order. They are among the
      best warriors of the Imperium.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/462260/extras/BFG_SpaceMarines_Ultramarines_610x176.png?t=1473669355"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Imperial Fists</h2>The Imperial Fists are recognized to
      be among the most loyal Chapters to the Emperor and have been instrumental in
      holding the Imperium together during the bleakest of times, with renowned stubborn
      resilience. They are Siege Warfare specialists, a title exemplified with their
      role in leading the defence of Earth, which gave them the title of &quot;Defenders
      of Terra&quot;.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/462260/extras/BFG_SpaceMarines_ImperialFist_610x176.png?t=1473669355"

      executioners and instrument of punishment since the Great Crusade era. They
      are notorious throughout the rest of the Imperium for their ferocity and their
      defiance of authority, including the dictates of the Codex Astartes. They are
      generally considered as the greatest and most loyal warriors of all the Space
      Marine Chapters.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/462260/extras/BFG_SpaceMarines_SpaceWolves_610x176.png?t=1473669355"
