      /><br><br><strong>Heroes of the Multiverse</strong> is an action game that doubles
      the thrill and fun of MOBA with Battle Royale. Explore the dangerous realm of
      Leviathan with your friends, ride dragons and soar the sky, dive into the unfathomable
      waters, or even shapeshift into a strange tree. Do everything you must, for
      only those who survive to the end can be finally redeemed.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1061670/extras/2.jpg?t=1582870852"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Infinite Possibilities</h2>Fight against multiple opponents
      in unpredictable battles, with surviving as the only purpose. The battle space
      has been expanded to an unprecedented extent. Use ambush, class perks, special
      abilities or even the environment to create an advantage. The game map is full
      of elements that may affect your situation assessment or interfere with your
      established strategy, such as special terrains and the ability to climb trees
      and dive into waters.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1061670/extras/3.jpg?t=1582870852"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Distinctive Characters</h2>Heroes with different class
      perks and abilities each have their own strategies. In addition, by killing
      other players or unique monsters you can acquire their tactical abilities. While
      in the preparatory phase, you can arbitrarily create builds. Whether to extremize
      a certain attribute or go for a balanced distribution, the choice is yours.<br><br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Tactical Views</h2>All combat abilities are designed around
      a top-down perspective to create a multi-layered and ever-changing battlefield.
      Camera view is an important tactical dimension that can be utilized through
      a large number of subjective behaviors such as class perks, special abilities
      and environmental interactions. Feeling restricted by the rules? Break them.<br><br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Believable Physics</h2>What happens to a player or monster's
      model at the moment of being finished is handed over to the ragdoll physics.
      It may fall off the cliff, hit a stone pile and bounce back, or may be directly
      slapped against the wall of a building in life-like animations with accurate
      physics simulation, all of which produce a solid and fluid combat experience.<br><br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Changing Environments</h2>The day and night cycle and changes
      of weather will affect the combat environment. For example, rains will make
      the ground slippery and disrupt the movement of heroes, a sandstorm will blur
      the vision, and a thunderstorm will drive the monsters more violent and irritable.
      Factors can affect the judgment of the battle environment. Many environmental
      factors can affect your judgment of the combat environment.
