    review: 'Only just started playing, but loving it so far. Mostly because it''s
      a lot of fun, but a little bit because of the nods to Skystrike ;) (a game I
      wrote many many years ago on the ST). If I were writing Skystrike again nowadays,
      I''d be pinching lots of stuff from Rogue Aces as it''s an absolute belter :)


      Rogue Aces is a properly difficult game, but you learn a lot in the early part
      of the game from your mistakes and immediately dive straight back in for another
      bash at it.'
