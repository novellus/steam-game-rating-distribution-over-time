Unfortunately the similarities are only superficial. This game has very little variety in gameplay, and there's no progression or anything that makes the game feel like more than a monotonous waste of time. What made Zuma fun was the varied level designs and the puzzle aspects, this has none of that, it's just a simplistic arcade game.","timestamp_created":1569190594,"timestamp_updated":1569190594,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3YjDre0CeJHc0gE="}
