    review: "I just completed a three-year degree in Drama, and I have to say, this\
      \ certainly isn't \"bad\". In fact, it's quite solid and competent - even a\
      \ tiny bit clever at times in its use of props and scenery - and I sincerely\
      \ hope it got a good mark if it was a final-year university production.\n\n\
      \   Interpret that statement as you will.\n\n   Suffice it to say, if you're\
      \ someone who already finds live theatre a bit on the \"cringy\" side, this\
      \ won't be the video to change your mind about such things. The word \"video\"\
      \ perhaps being this product's biggest downfall: I'm sure I would've enjoyed\
      \ it more in person. As it is, the \"filmmaking\" skills on evidence here won't\
      \ exactly knock Stanley Kubrick out of anyone's All-Time Top Ten Filmmakers\
      \ list, and it really does look like the kind of show where you had to \"be\
      \ there\" (and preferably know and love at least one person in the cast or crew).\
      \ Ah well.\n\n   Damn and blast it. I'm going to give this a mediocre score,\
      \ yet still give it a \"Recommend\", aren't I? I promised myself - among other\
      \ people - that I'd try to stop doing that. Honestly, I just don't have the\
      \ heart to diss this product with a thumb-down, and it IS on the cheap-ish side,\
      \ price-wise. It furthermore ties in with a video game also available here on\
      \ Steam, which, er...I'm in no rush to play right now, but maybe someone will\
      \ become sufficiently enamoured with either product to check the other one out.\n\
      \n   So who am I recommending this to? Someone. Someone out there will appreciate\
      \ it, no doubt. That person just wasn't me, unfortunately. Maybe I just don't\
      \ have enough \"irony\" in my blood to appreciate this kind of humour any more.\
      \ I blame Family Guy. It really was the last straw that broke this particular\
      \ camel's back.\n\n   Verdict: 5.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel\
      \ free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\n\
