      \ Just Trains\u2019 stylish London Underground S7+1 Stock!<br><br>Towards the\
      \ end of the 2000s, various types of sub-surface units were still in service\
      \ on the London Underground, with some examples dating as far back as the 1960s.\
      \ They were outdated in most regards, with their varying designs leading to\
      \ inconsistent services and expensive maintenance. <br><br>It was decided to\
      \ order a new fleet of trains that, across 2 variants, would replace every train\
      \ on the sub-surface network, this new train was called the S Stock and an order\
      \ of 191 was placed. The two variants would be the S7 and S8, the former being\
      \ for the Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City and District Lines, featuring 7-cars\
      \ and fully longitudinal seating, and the latter for the Metropolitan Line,\
      \ which would be 8-cars in length and have a revised interior with some transverse\
      \ seating.<br><br>While seating capacity saw a downgrade, the new S Stock was\
      \ able to take a much higher number of standing passengers, aided in particular\
      \ by a revolutionary open-plan design that saw the end of narrow gangways between\
      \ coaches. This, plus greater performance and future ability for automatic operation\
      \ meant the S Stock was set to transform sub-surface travel.<br><br>The S7+1\
      \ variant entered service on the \u201CMet\u201D during a period when S8 units\
      \ were receiving engineering modifications, some S7s were fitted with an additional\
      \ coach in order to retain capacity on the Met, and now you can experience this\
