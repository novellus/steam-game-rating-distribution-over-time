    review: "This RPG was first published in 1990...  So how is it that 30 years later\
      \ it is still available on Steam platform?  Because it is a classic, and a good\
      \ one at that.  Looking from now, graphics are not great, the interface is somewhat\
      \ relatively \"basic\", sound effects are more than dated, but there is depth\
      \ underneath, and an interesting story that asks you to believe, or not, certain\
      \ elements of the fragmented information you will receive while exploring the\
      \ dungeon.  And believing or not these elements have a direct impact on the\
      \ end story and how you will interact with some key NPCs you will meet in the\
      \ dungeon.  \n\nIt was actually quite unbelievable for me to be able to find\
      \ this oldie on Steam...  And because I actually had not been able to finish\
      \ the game in the 1990s, well, I had to try it again.  The story was as intriguing\
      \ as I remembered (as you only receive bits of information from time to time)\
      \ , you have puzzles to solve, and of course combat to be subjected to (lots\
      \ of combat, and it can be grindy at times).  Don't miss the clues or you may\
      \ end up having the impression of being in a dead end (which means think and\
      \ search for the clues!) until you discover how to get to the other areas of\
      \ the dungeon.  \n\nIf you don't mind the age of this game, the dated graphics\
      \ and sounds, and you also don't mind some detective work and quite a handful\
      \ of combat with an intriguing story, you'll like the game value that this oldie\
      \ brings you.  You can expect some 300 hours of gameplay if you take the time\
      \ to thoroughly explore this dungeon and its story.  For the price, specially\
      \ when it is for sale, it is a bargain!  And if you liked it well enough, the\
      \ story continues in two other subsequent games (Wizardry 7 and 8)."
