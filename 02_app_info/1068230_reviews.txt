I really wanted to like it. But I have to be honest, it is pretty boring even for a four-year old. Basically you have 365 versions of the same puzzle with different \"seasonal\" graphics.\n\nPros:\nCute and relaxing, until you get bored.\nGood concept, it could have been a decent Zen Relaxation game with a little more work.\n\nCons:\nLimited UI, you can't even rotate the camera.\nNothing to interact with outside of the game tiles.. no animals to discover or cute animations to make it interesting.\nVery limited variety.","timestamp_created":1594021518,"timestamp_updated":1594021518,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwq8PFkfMCe9ubkwI="}
