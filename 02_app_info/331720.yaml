    review: 'This is basically an extension of Survivor Squad with the ability to
      customize missions (gauntlets) to test yourself.


      I sort of, kind of enjoyed the original, but this really just feels like a lot
      of extra work on top of what was only a mediocre game to begin with and at a
      higher price tag.


      I don''t hate the game, I''ve got the free time to waste on it, but it''s really
      hard to recommend to anyone else, especially due to the lack of quality control
      and numerous bugs.


      If you are getting this super cheap or included with a bundle you might find
      some fun with it, but I would not go out of my way to buy this or at full price.


      I honestly wish they would have taken the time spent making this and instead
      invested into making Survivor Squad better, instead they ended up with two "OK"
      games instead of one good game, and this being the weaker (and yet more expensive)
      of the two.
