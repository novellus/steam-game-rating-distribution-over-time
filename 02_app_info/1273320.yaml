    review: 'Hit boxes are absolutely trash, it becomes extremely frustrating to play
      very quickly after the ump-teenth time you get ''sucked'' into an enemy because
      you got just a hair too close. Ad in the fact that when you are caught, you
      are returned to the last safe platform you touched (rather than just dropped),
      and a single close encounter with an enemy can undo all your progress. If you
      lose all your lives, you also need to return to the very beginning of the game''s
      map.


      Jump height is also always the same, which makes this platformer very difficult
      to complete, especially in one room where ''the floor is lava'', the platforms
      are moving, you having flying enemies with the worst hit boxes in the game,
      and the last safe platform you touch is at the very beginning of the room. Its
      damn-near impossible to complete, and not because the mechanics are challenging,
      they''re just awkward and frustrating.


      The dev can keep my money, but I hope the continue to refine the game.'
