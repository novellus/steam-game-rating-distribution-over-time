    about_the_game: "\u201CHunters of the Dead\u201D is a survival/roguelike tower\
      \ defense game with some micro management elements. You have to rescue your\
      \ fellow Hunters and with their help locate and destroy Dracula. Dracula has\
      \ raised an army of undead and has taken the whole city. You must defend your\
      \ base while in the meantime you have to explore the buildings around and salvage\
      \ what you can. However, better stay close to your base because as you get further\
      \ and further you will be finding harder and more frequent battles.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nYou can send your hunters to get healed in the hospitals or trained\
      \ in the graveyards, but you won\u2019t be able to use them in the battle. That\
      \ means that you will have fewer units to defend your base in case a battle\
      \ occurs! So you should manage your Hunters with caution. In case your base\
      \ gets destroyed, you shouldn\u2019t be discouraged. You will be able to use\
      \ what resources you have acquired to make upgrades and restart stronger.<br\
