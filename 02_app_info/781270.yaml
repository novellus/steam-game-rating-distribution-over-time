    review: "I played the demo version from a PC Gamer disc back in 95. Back then\
      \ this game was jaw dropping to look at compared to a lot of other games. I\
      \ remember feeling like it was the pinnacle of graphics technology and there\
      \ wasn't much else to go at that point. (I was a kid cut me some slack :) )\n\
      For me this is just a wonderful trip down nostalgia lane. But this will not\
      \ be for everyone.\nIf you like on rails shooters and retro games, then give\
      \ it shot. The campy cheese-ball story line and cut scenes just adds to its\
      \ charm. \nThe level variation is nice, being that you only see a city in the\
      \ screen shots. But there are levels that take place inside a computer, space,\
      \ and even on a giant spaceship itself.\nHeck when I found out this gem got\
      \ re-released I managed to get it on sale for less than $3. For that price I\
      \ don't see how you can complain.\nThis game is not easy, but I did find myself\
      \ getting better and farther with each play through. \nIf you are struggling\
      \ there are ways to make it easier. You can lower cpu cycles in dosbox to the\
      \ point where it doesn't register you are taking damage. There are also cheat\
      \ codes.\nThe only thing I don't like is the muffled \"fire\" being yelled every\
      \ time an enemy is in your crosshairs. But that's just a nitpick."
