    developer_response: "Challenge accepted. \n\nPS, Chickens and rabbits are meant\
      \ to be killed with a bow or magic spells with range, which is why you can't\
      \ corner them.  They aren't meant to be cornered and beaten with melee.  Anyways,\
      \ thanks for trying my game and sharing your thoughts but most of what you spoke\
      \ about is either intended for reasons you did not yet reach, or has been fixed\
      \ already.  Also keep in mind that the game in it's current state is also given\
      \ for free to anyone who wants to try it without supporting the game.  I mean,\
      \ you can literally hop in discord and download the same exact game (currently)\
      \ for nothing, so everyone should be fully aware of the exact state of the game\
      \ before buying, which is the only reason I am offering the ability to support\
      \ development by purchasing on Steam.  While you may already be aware of this,\
      \ I wanted to mention it for anyone who may read this review and not realize\
      \ that fact. \n\n That being said I understand your frustrations and also appreciate\
      \ your feedback as I will no doubt work on the things that bother players the\
      \ most because I take player feedback very seriously. \n\nStop back in 7-8 months\
      \ and I have a feeling you will enjoy the game quite a lot more. Until then,\
      \ take care and happy gaming. \n\nCrow"

    review: "I haven't had much time to play, but from what i've seen of improvement\
      \ since I wrote my first review, I don't think it is fair to leave it negative.\
      \ Things has improved a lot and I'm impressed one dev has managed this. \nI\
      \ haven't played enough lately to make a decent review, but I'll keep what I\
      \ wrote ten months ago. Then you can all buy thye game, play a bit less than\
      \ two hours and compare your experience with my experience ten months ago. Then\
      \ you can decide for yourself if you think the dev is working hard on his game\
      \ and if you want to support him. I think he does and I think you should.\n\n\
      Ok, I'm aware that the dev has made a lot of warnings about not to buy the game,\
      \  unless it is only for the purpose of supporting the game because it is early\
      \ access. Fair enough. And that was why I bought the game. But, I also bought\
      \ it, because he says he has worked on the game for two years and he estimates\
      \ one year or less, will be enough to finish the game. He also says, that this\
      \ part of the game is almost finished, and he will soon start working on more\
      \ content.\nThis part of the game is not almost finished! It is very barebones.\
      \ It still needs a lot of work! Hitboxes are all over the place, if  in some\
      \ cases exsisting at all? Crabs! I'm looking at you! If you try to kill a chicken\
      \ (these are FAST chickens) you can't. Because if you try to corner it against\
      \ the lake, it will just jump into the lake and disappear. Same goes for rabbits.\
      \ If you try to corner them up against a tree or a rock, they run  right through\
      \ the tree or the rock. There are a lot of these things. no need to go into\
      \ them, because it is early access and is to be expected.\nWhere I'm going with\
      \ this, is that I don't think that most ea indie abandonware is from scammy\
      \ devs. I think they are from devs, who's dream of making a great game, has\
      \ made them bite more than they can chew. I'm afraid this is the case here.\
      \ I'm not saying this game will not be finished, I hope it will, but in a year\
      \ or less? No way! 2 years? I doubt it. 3 years? Perhaps.\nIt is one man making\
      \ an open world game. Not a hack them down game, but a game with all the complexities\
      \ of a survival game. And if this is all he has to show after 2 years in developement,\
      \ how can he believe that he will be able to finish it in a year or less?\n\
      The game looks ok for very early pre alpha. So if you have the faith and the\
      \ patience, please support the game.\nI'll be back in 7-8 months, and if the\
      \ dev proves me wrong, and the game is almost finished by then, i'll most humbly\
      \ bow my head in respect and change my review to positive."
