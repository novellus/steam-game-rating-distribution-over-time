The game's fast, with good controls, fun powerups, pretty and varied maps, and good gamemodes and AI opponents. Definitely worth checking out for the price, if you like 2d space shooters mixed with arena shooters.","timestamp_created":1606371225,"timestamp_updated":1606371225,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42vXLgfYCfsndsQI="}
