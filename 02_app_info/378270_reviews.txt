Some later enemies require some specific actions to beat, and I feel they could have been telegraphed slightly better, rather than just requiring some trial and error.\n\n* Sparse story. The opening text/diary has some typos, and you only get more text at the end. Clearly something is going on, and while some visual/atmospheric information comes in, a tiny bit more writing (like between levels) would have been good.\n\nBut it has some stuff going for it:\n\n* The price. I got it on sale for 75 cents.\n\n* The weapon variety. I counted 6 guns (and a melee weapon), 5 of them with a secondary fire, and most of those secondary fires being somewhat relevant.\n\n* The enemy variety. It starts off a bit boring, but gradually expands to more and more interesting enemies (each vulnerable to different guns, I believe).\n\n* The atmosphere. While in has some flaws, the gradual change of scenery, and the sense of discovery as you progress, is pretty cool. I think this could have been enhanced by that little bit of writing I suggested earlier.\n\n(I beat the game on the 2nd hardest difficult in just under 2 hours, and haven't tried Survival mode yet. I found the last boss a bit too hard, but not too bad.)","timestamp_created":1609327554,"timestamp_updated":1609327554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3bXZ2fYCct3fvgI="}
