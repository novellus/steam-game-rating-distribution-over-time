I've seen the changes and been there through the ups and downs. The game was great, though it is and was a grind. There's just something about flying a battleship-cruiser like spaceship into battle! It is still in development since launching on steam, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here. I love the music and sounds of the game.","timestamp_created":1550978037,"timestamp_updated":1550978037,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40NbfjukCeIPYuwE="}
