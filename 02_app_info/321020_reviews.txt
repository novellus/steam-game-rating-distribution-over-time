Even though the program freezes a lot on my device (i7 processor, 4gb GTX, 8gb ram), the quality of content amazes me; it is extremely versatile and easy to use. Just like the other software, you can generate many other parts through parameters, making modeling very easy. An extremely useful feature on the SolidFace is the real-time collaborative cloud CAD.  However, I am unsure if it runs VBA macros in C# like SolidWorks. The full version costing only 499 and the student version for 199, I'd say it's a great deal.","timestamp_created":1486926461,"timestamp_updated":1486926461,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hKfumdoCfIn+cQ=="}
