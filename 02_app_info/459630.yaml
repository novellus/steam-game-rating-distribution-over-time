      in the game are in the following languages:<br><strong>Spanish, Russian, German,

      can do what they can do best: parachute down and get the job done!<br><br><strong>Entirely
      new Gameplay Technique using Nvidia PhysX</strong><br>R.C. Bot Inc. presents
      an entirely new gameplay technique that mirrors real life motion. All gameplay
      input is used to control Nvidia PhysX interactions such as forces, impulses
      and joint motors, things that exist in real life, and the entire game is animation
      and scripting free. This way of handling gameplay makes sure no game session
      is like the one before and that the player can feel like playing with real machines
      because of the realistic interaction with the environment. To make sure gameplay
      is fun, many helper systems are in the game, which are also all physics based,
      for example gyroscopic stabilized flying, automatic carrier and catapult loading.
      New camera perspectives can be created everywhere with your Drone.<br><br><strong>Fight,
      collect or catch your targets while swinging, flying, driving and shooting around.
      </strong><br>The game features 32 islands around 8 landscape themes from high
      canopy forests to African Redlands to the Space Training Facilities. Every tree,
      every branch, every rock, everything will react to your physics based R.C. machines
      like in real life. <br><br><strong>Think ahead! </strong><br>Your recovery bot
      comes with a physics-based damage system. Do not fall from high altitude! Life
      does not get easier with one leg gone. Watch shadows and day and night: your
      bot is powered by latest ultrafast solar technology and he likes to drain his
      battery with his thrusters, cannon and toys. Upgrade your bot and unlock new
      islands with the reward money you earn from the Iridium Targets. Modify your
      bot with different shapes and materials by calling the customization department
      to influence his physics behavior. Remember, you can control all limbs of your
      bot on their own. Think 3D! Your Bot will also go to Space where up can be down.<br><br><strong>Bonus

      us</strong><br>We are a small team with rendering, simulation and GTA modding
      background trying to create a new gameplay concept by doing a 100% physics based
      game that is fully unscripted and animation free. Because all of us work in
      technology day jobs that are somehow related to gaming, and because we have
      played and modded so many games since our childhood, we wanted to put something
      new on the map of videogames with the PhysX driven gameplay technique. We hope
      you enjoy it!'

    short_description: R.C. Bot Inc. presents an entirely new gameplay technique that
      mirrors real life motion. All gameplay input is used to control Nvidia PhysX
      interactions such as forces, impulses and joint motors, things that exist in
      real life, and the entire game is animation and scripting free.
