    review: 'I got a lot of hours in this but it''s mostly passively watching the
      story on a 2D screen.

      I think if you''re determined to get your money''s worth out of this you will.  The
      story is pretty interesting with full Japanee voice acting and subtitles nice
      music and occasional interactive battle parts.


      Then there''s the boss fight mode with 4 bosses each with I think 4 different
      difficulties and it''s actualy pretty decent challenge to beat the whole game
      which I still haven''t done yet.

      Typical turn based combat strategy where the cards are all basically different
      spells.  You can choose which character to play as.  You can also customize
      your parties oufits.


      It''s a slow game.  Feels very early VR.  Like they were just testing the waters.  Strategy
      isn''t great.  There''s better strategy in similar mobile card games.  Not really
      recommended unless you''re really bored and want to squeeze as much as you can
      out of a pretty polished looking game.'
