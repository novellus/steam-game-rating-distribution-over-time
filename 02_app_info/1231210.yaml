    about_the_game: "Midair: Community Edition is a fast-paced jetpack shooter set\
      \ in a breathtaking new sci-fi universe. Use movement and physics to your advantage,\
      \ outwit your enemy from every angle, you'll never look at a shooter the same\
      \ way again.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TRUE FREEDOM</h2>Movement in Midair is an art.\
      \ It's a flow. It's a learned, practiced skill that when you know it\u2026 you\
      \ just feel it. Using your jetpack and frictionless boots, launch high-speed\
      \ airborne assaults, expertly dodge enemy fire, and soar from hilltop to hilltop.\
      \ Free yourself from the ground or become a quick frag for your opponent. The\
      \ jetpack draws from your armor\u2019s energy pool, so strategically manage\
      \ your use of the jetpack and weapons to ensure your battle advantage. Depending\
      \ on the situation, adjust your jetpack from pushing you upward to giving more\
      \ maneuvering power. Veteran players know how to manage their jets and energy\
      \ by instinct.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TEAMWORK IS CRITICAL</h2>A team without coordination\
      \ is like a shooter without jetpacks. In Midair it's critical that you coordinate\
      \ your assaults for maximum effect. Take down their flag defenses one by one\
      \ to expose their flag for a quick grab. But remember, you'll need to keep your\
      \ flag home too. Enemies who have spent hours studying the terrain and perfecting\
      \ their movement will race in, grab your flag, and get out -- and FAST. With\
      \ the right team and friends you can depend on, this will be a breeze.<br><br><br>Get\
      \ ready for a new experience in a shooter with a lot to offer. Suit up. Jets\
      \ on. Fly free. We'll see you in Midair: Community Edition."
