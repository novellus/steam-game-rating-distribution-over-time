      \ /><br><br>Rogue Legacy is back! But now it's got a 2 in front of it!<br><br>Rogue\
      \ Legacy 2 is a genealogical rogue-LITE. That means it has all the trappings\
      \ of a typical rogue-like (randomized runs, changing characters, and more),\
      \ but with persistent upgrades, and persistent dead heirs.  In this game, your\
      \ legacy defines you.  Spend your parents\u2019 inheritance and grow the family\
      \ manor to give your children a better fighting chance.  Each child is unique,\
      \ with their own traits and abilities.  Your daughter could be an archer.  She\
      \ could also be a Vegan.  Rogue Legacy 2 also lets you play how you want to.\
      \  Go hard and fast, and you can dive deeper into the depths of a randomly-generated\
      \ world.  Or take it slow and steady, and build your character up until you\u2019\
      re ready for greater challenges.  <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1253920/extras/rl1_header.png?t=1603821378\"\

      \ with every life, so no two runs are the same.<br></li><li>Rogue-LITE. This\
      \ is not your average roguelike because even in death, not all is lost.  Instead,\
      \ you can build your manor, improve your legacy through an in-depth skill tree,\
      \ and make each child stronger than the last. The game can be beaten at level\
      \ 1, but that doesn't mean it has to.<br></li><li>Every heir is unique. Some\
      \ might have Synethesia, where sounds can be perceived as colours, others might\
      \ be contrary pacifists, and some could just be a little chubby. <br></li><li>Equip\
      \ your heroes with powerful weaponry and armor. Or gain new abilities like flight,\

      \ 2.5D stylings, with 3D characters against hand-drawn backdrops.  The art uses\

      \ the familiar RL look and feel.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Unique Weapons</h2>On top\

      \ with biome generation to make each area in RL2 feel completely new.  Each\

      \ not basic lock-in-key abilities, but powers that fundamentally change how\

    short_description: Rogue Legacy 2 is what you'd get if you mashed Rogue Legacy
      and a sequel together. Every time you die, your children will succeed you, and
      each child is unique. Your daughter might be a Colourblind Archer, and your
      son could be a Pacifistic Chef. Either way, one of them is getting conscripted.

    review: Just can't recommend it. I loved the first one. This one is honestly just
      kinda trash. Too much to go into. Just play the first one. It's finished, probably
      cheaper and definitely better.
