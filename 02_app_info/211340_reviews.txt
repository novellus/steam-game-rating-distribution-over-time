It deals well with choice and consequence, and does an excellent at times presenting consequences for different types of choices.\n\nHorse Hall has both less visual and mechanical polish than several of the developer's other titles like fairly well-known Long Live the Queen, but I really think this is pinnacle of their skill from what I've played in their library of products thus far. My greatest critique is that I really wish there was more -- I don't think the VN understays its welcome, I simply enjoyed it that much.","timestamp_created":1609288926,"timestamp_updated":1609288926,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws4jG2PYCc7zPvgI="}
