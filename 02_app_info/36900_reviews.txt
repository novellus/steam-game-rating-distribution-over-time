Instead of a complex and intricate upgrade and management system, you just increase numbers and none of the upgrades really change how the game plays and instead of taking part in an organic conflict you just kind of cruise around, rarely if ever seeing a friendly.\n\nControls are terrible and the combat almost always feel random. The graphics are okay for the time but were nothing special.\n\nAll in all it's a game that were below mediocre at release and horrible when looked at through the lens of time.","timestamp_created":1581942771,"timestamp_updated":1581942771,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40+HIqfACfaXv8gE="}
