To that I say, how can the loading screen flash wildly, if there is no loading screen?\n\nMy last point is, how can an English Teacher, or rather, a self proclaimed English Teacher, judge such a work of art, when it clearly states in the wall of text in the beginning of the game that you require vast knowledge of interstellar travel and the solar system to be able to play the game correctly. \n\nThe game is not broken, English Teacher Plays, but it is you, who are broken.\n\n","timestamp_created":1609109492,"timestamp_updated":1609109492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548872172832489014","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwksqZ0/YCe7X0vQI="}
