The desmemberment mechanic is something that I wish more games had, most objects in the game can be cut cleanly in pieces including enemies, pillars, fire extinguishers (that explode), etc. The game soundtrack is also awesome.\n\nThe Bad: \n- The game is very short, and there's an abuse of FMV's, animated transitions, radio calls and quicktime events in the game. The first playtrought they're not so annoying if you are enjoying the story, but if you are on subsequent playtroughts they can get really irritating. At the end of the final mission, or when completing Sam and Wolf side-stories you will be forced to watch 15 minutes of ending credits and an unskippable FMV, every time you beat them.\n\n-Fights are constrained with force-field walls that take a while to go away after you defeat all area enemies, so sometimes you just stand there awkwardly, waiting for a wall to dissapear. This, in combination with my previous point really spoils the good combat and action the game offers.\n\nThe Ugly:\n- It's a PS3/Xbox 360 port with some issues and dated design elements... The game runs at 24hz for some users, some workarounds exists that try to fix this but it should be a native fix in the game.\n\n- The parry mechanic, outside of easy mode auto-parry, can be a real pain to get right because it's unclear where the game wants you to point your analog stick or the timing.\n\n- The camera can behave erratically or lock itself to high ground enemies while ignoring the ones just behind your back, for dire consequences.\n\n- Some enemies will magically block and stagger you, even if they are dismembered and crawling on the floor.\n\n- Some VR missions are extremely easy to fail and restarting shows long introduction sequences that are unskippable.\n\n- The game color composition really shows it's a product out of a 2013 console game.\n\n- Boxes and other props can go haywire and float in zero gravity randomly. Other props like fences or glass panels are hard to walk trought after cutting them.\n\n- The stun-recovery mechanic is bound to violently mashing the analog sticks back-and-forth, which will inevitably destroy your controllers. Terrible input choice.\n\n- Some enemies, like the UG Gorillas (Mastiffs) or UG Bulls (Geckos) are completely overpowered in higher difficulties and will aggresively spam stunning moves, making them more annoying then some bosses.\n\n- While most of the dub is good quality, some voice lines could see improvement, particularly many of Raiden's ones, or one of the death soundbits where a teammembers -quietly- screams \"Raiden? RAIDEEEEEN\" as if trying to not wake up the baby on the next room.","timestamp_created":1609713245,"timestamp_updated":1609832111,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526627242565155029","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uZPe6PYCe+6bwAI="}
