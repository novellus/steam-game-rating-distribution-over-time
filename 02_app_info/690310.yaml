    review: "I love this game; I really do, but am worried for how long I will so\
      \ admire it, as it\u2019s severely lacking in content. \n\nThe game design and\
      \ especially the physics of the actual archery are superb. It\u2019s certainly\
      \ the best archery dynamics I\u2019ve experienced, and I\u2019ve played a few.\
      \ The content includes a lobby where you can introduce yourself to the actual\
      \ process of firing an arrow \u2013 which you obviously only need to do the\
      \ once, then a shooting range where you can hone your skills to a fine art,\
      \ then there\u2019s the actual siege part of the game \u2013 the game proper.\
      \ You are on the (beautifully rendered) battlements and you have to defeat the\
      \ advancing enemy and their siege engines (catapults and battering rams) - with\
      \ arrows.\n\nIt takes three or four minutes to do that, and that\u2019s it!\
      \ You can go for another siege, but they are identical. Obviously the hook is\
      \ to better your score, or other users\u2019 scores on the leader board, or\
      \ if you choose to play multiplayer, play directly against a partner to outdo\
      \ each other (I haven\u2019t played a multiplayer game). \n\nIts good and great\
      \ fun, and I can imagine it becoming addictive up to a point, but it\u2019s\
      \ the 3 or 4 minute thing over and over. More levels or greater variety would\
      \ add much to the game, but as it is it is enormous fun and it\u2019s hardly\
      \ expensive.\n\nWorks perfectly with the Valve Index and controllers - although\
      \ in the heat of battle one can occasionally grab the option scroll in mistake\
      \ for an arrow, which is frustrating and time wasting as it lingers in your\
      \ way for several seconds, but it\u2019s a minor issue.\n\nRecommended, but\
      \ be aware of the limited gameplay.\n"
