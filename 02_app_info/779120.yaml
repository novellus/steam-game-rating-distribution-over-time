    review: 'Not bad for a cheap relaxation experience.


      You get about 6 options like relaxation, meditation, energy music etc and about
      6 videos to look at (mostly beach and stream settings)


      The two things to mention is that is every 360 degree video its cloudy and looks
      like its going to rain, so not sure if they are taken all on the same day.


      The second thing is selecting options is a bit tricky (htc vive) and you may
      have to select them several times to stick.


      Overall it does the job and going to recommend'
