      /><br>Axizon Labs: Zombies is a 2D Sci-Fi themed Platform Zombie Shooter Game
      based on the story of the sudden ZMB Virus outbreak which affected 30% of the
      population around the world. <br><br>In 2019, various experiments were performed
      in Axizon Secret Laboratories and the leakage of a dangerous Virus Sample, called
      &quot;ZMB Virus&quot; from the lab, caused panic among the people all around
      the globe. People got infected by &quot;ZMB virus&quot; as soon as they came
      in contact with each other and turned into mindless zombies. During the pandemic,
      the UR Task Force came to know from the various sources that an Antidote of
      &quot;ZMB Virus&quot; had already been prepared secretly in the same lab and
      the leakage of such a dangerous virus was intentional. Steve, one of the members
      of the UR Task Force, had been commanded by Kris, The Commander General, to
      visit Axizon Secret Labs in order to collect the Antidote, to eliminate the
      Zombies, and Turrets, and to shut down the Zombie Creation Facility. One of
      the members of UR Task Force along with many other people have gone missing
      mysteriously. Steve and Kris set out on a journey to cease the Zombie Creation
      Facility at any cost. However, there are thousands of zombies waiting to feast
      on them. <br><br>Will you be able to restore peace in the world? It is in your
      hands now. It is an Action Time! Kill as many zombies as you can and collect
      ZMB Antidote at all costs to save the world and its people.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1280310/extras/alz_gif_1.gif?t=1589265287"
