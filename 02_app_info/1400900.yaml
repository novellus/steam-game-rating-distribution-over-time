    review: Caves Rd makes beautiful VR experiences. This one may be my favorite of
      them all. The shoreline is gorgeous and expansive, with lots of room to explore.
      It certainly isn't photorealistic and it can be rough around the edges at times.
      But the serene golden hour lighting, the sounds of lapping waves and rustling
      leaves, and the relaxing music were enough to immerse me in the experience.
      From the comfort of my home, this gets me remarkably close to Castle Rock Beach.
      I highly recommend this DLC along with the rest of the VR bundle from Cave Rd.
