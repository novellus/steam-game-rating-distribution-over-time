I find myself incapable of passing the first radiogram as I keep going back to the main menu after losing pace with it. Even on the slowest speed I still have difficulty, and am disappointed it can't be slowed down further.\nI am glad I can now practice individual letters, but radiograms are currently beyond me.\n\nOverall I'd say it's 6/10 as a learning resource, with four deducted for the frustration a newcomer goes through after failing a radiogram for want of a slower speed.","timestamp_created":1596922374,"timestamp_updated":1596922374,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw97T/5/MCfcGimgI="}
