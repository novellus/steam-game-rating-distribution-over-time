    review: "I love this game but the digital version definitely needs improvement.\
      \ \n\n- The game is has glitches. If you care about your win loss record and\
      \ ranking, just hope you do not get kicked out because it will give you a 0\
      \ score and a defeat. \n\n- In order to play with others online and add AI (when\
      \ you can only find one human for instance) they make it difficult. You have\
      \ to add a friend through steam first instead of simply adding seats for humans\
      \ and AI. \n\n- Chat window does not open or make a sound when people comment.\
      \ You have to open it and pay attention or you will not even notice. Voice chat\
      \ would also be a great implementation."
