No tutorial and nothing really explained. \n\nThe objective of each level is to be to gather enough resource to enable you to escape via a rocket along with your rewards which can then be used in research upgrades. You must achieve this before you lose too many lives, indicated by the rocket on the lower right filling up as a result of lives lost - the choice is up to you when you leave (within certain predesignated time-frames) but get greedy and you run the risk of losing all your booty\n\nI gradually have started to work things out and the more I see, the more I like. You have towers that miss a good percentage of the time, so correct positioning is very important in your mazing.\n\nI am looking forward to future game refinements and developments.","timestamp_created":1609133235,"timestamp_updated":1609219909,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ42OS+1vYCffL/vQI="}
