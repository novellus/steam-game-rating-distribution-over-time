    review: As with other COG titles this is a choose your own adventure multi-choice
      text only video game, a sort of hybrid book/ video game. This game has loose
      ties to the war of the roses, GOT, and Arhturian chivarly tales. Overall while
      I found the story enjoyable I wished there were more oportunites to branch off
      from the main narritive. Perhaps romance was possible, but if so, I did not
      find it in this game. The story and ending were a bit forced. I decided towards
      the end that I would side with a certain faction, and despite my desire to join
      this faction, I was forced to fight against them and lose everything and have
      a bad ending. So there's that. However, if you can forgive the plot being a
      bit forced and there being a bit less choices that really matter than some COG
      games, it was overall a good tale with a strong romantic chivarlrous knight
      errant tone and style that I found very charming. So, in short, if you like
      choose your own adventure style adventures, are okay with your video game being
      text only, and want a bit of knightly questing, this is a good game for you.
