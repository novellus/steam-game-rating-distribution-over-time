    review: 'The "Ghostbusters" like ghost transparency effect is missing on the (horribly
      outdated ?) screenshots : Watch the game trailer instead.


      If your VR space is too small for you to dodge in, if you''re more old and smart
      then you''re young and fast, if you want something casual non-gamers can also
      enjoy playing (not too intense, no jumpscares, fun and safe for children to
      play...), while still getting a challenge unlocking the trophies for yourself...
      Then this wave shooter kind of fits when and where the other wave shooters don''t.


      So basically NOT recommended for a teenage gamer with super fast reflexes and
      a big VR space to move around in, but instead recommended for everyone else
      : If you''re too old, too young, too casual or simply don''t have enough VR
      space to enjoy the other ones.'
