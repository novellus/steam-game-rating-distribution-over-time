    review: The concept is good, but better play something else in the same category,
      the game crashed at least 5 times, it seems 1 crash was intended (with a blue
      screen, part of the gameplay I think), but very anoying it take you directly
      to the desktop and you need to start again. There is a few of negatives, the
      obvios bugs, boring, simple graphics, it can't change the keybinding (yes I'm
      using other layout) just move boxes and shoot.. Is not completely bad, yet I
      don't want to wast more time on the review, read the other reviews.
