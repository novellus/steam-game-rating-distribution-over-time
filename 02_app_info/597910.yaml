      \ we knew what it had to offer and why it was so important in our world. We\
      \ noticed students just couldn't get a picture of what atoms really mean in\
      \ our world. Some said chemistry is boring because they just didn't know what\
      \ the point of all these complex formulas were. Others said it was all just\
      \ too complicated to even bother learning. We believe chemistry is one of the\
      \ most important aspects of our lives. So here we are, bringing education to\
      \ the next level.  Quantum Engine is made in collaboration with a couple of\
      \ chemistry teachers and professors in Belgium and we got a lot of tips from\
      \ the chemistry community on the internet.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Having a problem\
