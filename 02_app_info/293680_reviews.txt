It does some new things with the Cinderella story, but not enough to be interesting. Gorgeous art, can't emphasize that enough.\n\nLong Version:\nI made a lot of choices. I don't fully understand what effect they had. I ended up marrying the prince I'd literally talked to for less than 5 minutes. And ruled the kingdom with an icy cold fist(via epilogue slides.) There was very little romance, honestly. It was mostly about the relationships Cinders had with her sisters and Stepmother. I think I'd rather the sister, Sophia, have married the prince. and I think I would have preferred to marry the Guardsman. But as a romantic visual novel, it's pretty light on the romance. Not even a kiss.  And I found it a bit... racially uncomfortable that the only black character in the game was painted up like an African witch doctor. Like...why. All that said, the art was gorgeous. probably my favorite yet. And the collectibles showing up in the Menu Screen reminded me of Cinderella Phenomenon, it's a nice touch.","timestamp_created":1608952253,"timestamp_updated":1608952253,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pOHBzvYCdL2gvQI="}
