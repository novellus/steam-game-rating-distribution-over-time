The mechanics are annoying and hyper simplistic. The controls are lacking. Everything added to the game beyond the first level detracts from game play rather than changing things up in an interesting way. All of the weapons function exactly the same but to different obstacles. Obstacles aren't interesting, just a nuisance. Switching weapons to clear them with the slow clunky controls and sitting with the weapon on the target for a few seconds makes them more annoying. Bombs are annoying, too many of them drop and they get in your way. If I could ignore them they would be fine but I need to clear them to draw through the tile. And that is infuriating. The tutorial is absolutely worthless and does not explain anything about the game. Something along the lines of hold a button to draw a line is missing. The limited solutions is bogus, I have seen at least one stage where you could leave empty tiles and still win, but they don't count because... \n\nNice art style though.","timestamp_created":1594888761,"timestamp_updated":1594888761,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46uWxq/MCePXOlQI="}
