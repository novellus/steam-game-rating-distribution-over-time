Can't think of another games it is like. 3d side scroller? jumping puzzle? A lot of fun. Can lack a bit of variety depth. Used the same upgrade and special ability for pretty much the entire play through. Also has challenge missions etc.\n\nBut a ton of fun for as little or long as you want to play. Good for a 10 minute jaunt or a hour long forgot what the time is marathon.","timestamp_created":1574818220,"timestamp_updated":1574818220,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51503455638885498","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/uCe1e4Ce8aw3QE="}
