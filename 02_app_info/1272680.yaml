    review: "[b]Dec 24 EDIT[/b]: I've decided to change my review to negative. The\
      \ English patch was finally delivered and it is machine translated crap, completely\
      \ unlike other versions of this game. What a slap in the face. I still like\
      \ this game, but I cannot possibly recommend supporting this release.\n\noriginal\
      \ review:\n\n[h1]about the price:[/h1]\nIt is insane. A port of a year-old super\
      \ niche indie game should absolutely not cost this much.\nWorth 20 bucks if\
      \ you're a fan of the series, maybe? Hopefully this gets a permanent price cut\
      \ along with some good discounts, otherwise it's a REALLY tough sell.\n\n[h1]about\
      \ the port:[/h1]\nObvious Switch port - the on-screen button prompts will not\
      \ adjust if you use a Playstation or Xbox controller.\n720p windowed or fullscreen\
      \ only, rebindable controls, no issues with performance on my end, much faster\
      \ loading times than other versions.\n\n[h1]missing content:[/h1]\nthe English\
      \ language Curly and her quests (fun fact: they are in the game files, just\
      \ not accessible)\nIf the missing content is added, this will be the best version\
      \ of this game (though the leaderboards are likely way more populated on Switch\
      \ if you're into time trial competition)\n\n[h1]about the game:[/h1]\nThis is\
      \ the most accessible game in the series yet. \nIf you find any of the main\
      \ quests too difficult you can resort to using food items which give various\
      \ boosts (such as longer rope or higher jumps) or playing as Cotton - she can\
      \ fly on her broom briefly in addition to having Kawase's hook.\nIn my playthrough\
      \ I felt that the quest mode didn't have any major roadblocks, like every other\
      \ Umihara game seems to, even without food boosts or Cotton this is the easiest\
      \ set of levels in the franchise.\nThe quests do get pretty repetitive, and\
      \ some are so short they're over before they start.\nThe hunger system is really\
      \ just a disguised timer, so I did not mind that as much as many other players\
      \ have.\nThe open world here isn't that interesting... I don't think this is\
      \ the direction the series should go in (if it will go on at all, considering\
      \ no one bought this). The tighter level design of the previous games was definitely\
      \ a much better fit.\nThe story is a total mess and you will not be missing\
      \ out if you skip all the cutscenes.\n\n[h1]tl;dr:[/h1]\nif you've enjoyed the\
      \ Umihara games, try this one out if it gets a serious discount (or get it on\
      \ Switch, much cheaper there). Keep in mind that it is pretty different, though.\
      \ If you haven't played a Umi game before, you probably shouldn't start with\
      \ this one - the other ones are both cheaper and better in my opinion. If Steam\
      \ had a neutral option I would've picked that instead - the game is good, but\
      \ some aspects of the port and the pricing are unacceptable."
