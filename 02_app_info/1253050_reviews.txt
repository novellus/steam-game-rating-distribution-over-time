I think for the price it is a great addition to anyone's VR library.\n\nPS: I've heard the game is getting a big update soon, so look out for that in the near future.","timestamp_created":1604639725,"timestamp_updated":1604639725,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ43OL+zfUCerXOrAI="}
