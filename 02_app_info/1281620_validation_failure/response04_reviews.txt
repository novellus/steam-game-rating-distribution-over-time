BUT ...\n\"Mixed martial arts\" animation missing, it's just stationary identical toe to toe slugging each other with occasional knee and kick as HP counts down.\n\"Profit on betting\" doesn't work. Can't place bets and the reports are always \"zero profit on fight\".\nIf you Rent to a fighter they will lose all their Stats down to 1 for everything. As you fight your Fighter the Stats SLOWLY rise, sooooo SLOWLY, then all of sudden they will reset back to 1 and they fight like they're untrained, losing. I've taken care not to over-fight them with fights too close to each other. Best to just to use Adventurers for now till this gets fixed. Adventurers don't seem to lose or gain Stats as they fight but it is fun to watch.\n\"Medicinal plants\" (plural) is only one plant, Sothia. The Pipe Herbs don't count as they were mentioned separately and it is just \"pot\" anyways.\nThe Alchemical Table only makes Poison and Ash drugs for 2 serve-able drinks, no \"medicine\".\nThere is no climbing pole for training. Only one Punching Bag despite plural \"bags\" said.\nGuests continually walk through the fighting ring during a fight.\n\nAVOID at all costs (for now) building the underground. The Forum is full of reports of the basement destroying the ability to furnish and decorate the Main Floor. And you can't delete the basement as long as the Main Floor is constructed. Build everything above ground (for now).\n\nWill update this Review as DLC gets repaired.","timestamp_created":1599687663,"timestamp_updated":1600609933,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47Kry1fQCcorsoAI="}
