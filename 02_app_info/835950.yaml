      /><br><br><br>The universe renews, refreshes and repeats, infinitely folding
      in on itself. I am made of its energy. My past and future selves are always
      with me. We work together to generate the infinite cycle of creation and destruction.
      I exist within and without time, I am inevitable, I am eternal. Time and gravity
      are my tools to manipulate the world. I don't recognize this world, but I know
      I have been here before. <br><br>Transpose is a dreamlike VR puzzle game set
      in a universe where time and gravity are used as tools to manipulate the world.
      By creating and working with looped recordings of their actions, players must
      solve increasingly complex physics puzzles in a mysterious setting where notions
      of space and time no longer apply. <br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/835950/extras/PlayerEchos.png?t=1589493605"

      recording, allowing you to play back your actions one to one in real time while

    review: "Rough around the edges, but a satisfying puzzle experience. $10 is an\
      \ appropriate price.\n\nThe concept is simple: You perform and record actions,\
      \ then those actions are played back as you perform other actions. This is always\
      \ in service of getting one or more boxes from point A to point B. You can have\
      \ half a dozen past versions of yourself running around a stage, gravity being\
      \ inverted, and it's the building blocks of a solid puzzle experience.\n\nPros:\n\
      I love the atmosphere of the game, such as the minimalist sound design. The\
      \ strange geometry the world is made of does a great job preparing the player\
      \ to lose all sense of \"down\". Gravity flipping and multiple time loops, all\
      \ combined with required 3D spacial awareness are building blocks for insane\
      \ challenges. \n\nCons:\n-As great as those building blocks are, I don't feel\
      \ like they were used to their fullest extent. The most challenging puzzles\
      \ -felt more like busy work than an actual challenge of sequence. It seems like\
      \ the concept wasn't fully cooked.\n-What was most annoying of all, were these\
      \ art student quotes at the start of each level, and violent breaks in flow\
      \ where control of your character is lost and your vision turns wide screen.\
      \ They are annoying and entirely unnecessary. These moments broke all immersion.\
      \ \n-There were also times I'd accidentally grab the cores of my past lives\
      \ and entirely ruin the chain I was building up to, and have to start all over.\
      \ All I was trying to do was fast-forward. This happened to me a lot. \n\nConclusion:\n\
      Transpose annoyed me. It challenged me, it bored me. When you distill the game\
      \ down, there's two moments that will stick with me: The first time I had to\
      \ throw a box to myself in different gravity orientations, which blew my ever\
      \ loving mind. Second, the last moment of the game, after spending an hour on\
      \ the final puzzle, finally getting the door open, I stopped and played the\
      \ entire winning timeloop. I watched six versions of myself running around completing\
      \ tasks. Finally the last version of myself slamdunks that final box. I watched\
      \ myself shoot both hands into the air and do a victory lap. I felt like a satisfied\
      \ older brother to myself at that moment. That's going to stay with me the rest\
      \ of my life. \n\nI hope Secret Location creates a sequel to Transpose one day.\
      \ There's a lot of room for quality of life improvements, as well as the untouched\
      \ potential of what challenges this is already capable of. Hell, you can run\
      \ a sequence using four lives, then delete the third life in that chain, and\
      \ that mechanic as a puzzle's solution was never touched upon! The potential\
      \ here is limitless."
