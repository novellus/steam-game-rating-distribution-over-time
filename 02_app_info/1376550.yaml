      /><br>After the world shatters, your direction becomes unclear. Through these
      broken paths, conquer obstacles, hazards, and puzzles with your new-found ability
      to flip the world. Piece together what remains by relying on the friends you
      encounter along the way and taking advantage of their strengths to find where
      your own truly lie. Reveal the truth, take back control, and reconcile with
      who you are -- or what you've become.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1376550/extras/flip_mechanic_description.gif?t=1608327814"
