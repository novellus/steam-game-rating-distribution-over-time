This game genuinely made me reexamine some lifelong assumptions.\n\nIt's also very cute, and obviously a labor of love. The art is gorgeous, and the music is very pleasant - it feels like the aural equivalent of a nice rambling walk.\n\nAnd it's surprisingly ambitious! There's a ton of branching paths, which I wasn't expecting. I definitely want to replay it to get the other routes and hear all the other dialogue.\n\nI also want to mention how impressed I was with the structure of the game mechanically. It's pretty simple - basically, time passes as you walk around and do things and eventually you need to go to bed - but it's a really powerful framing device. You get to see the other characters go about their days as you go about yours, and conversations often result from running into them in a very natural way. It's real clever.\n\nIn short: it's a gem of a game. I'm going to be thinking about it for a while to come.","timestamp_created":1600419860,"timestamp_updated":1606383638,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw36L7gfYCcN3DogI="}
