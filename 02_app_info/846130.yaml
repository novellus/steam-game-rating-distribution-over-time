    review: 'It''s a great game to play when your friends are around, though you need
      to find enough controllers for everybody.

      But when you have found these controllers, oh boy, fun guaranteed.

      Sometimes you need to explain the game a little, and for me it''s lagging a
      bit now and then but otherwise a really fun game.'
