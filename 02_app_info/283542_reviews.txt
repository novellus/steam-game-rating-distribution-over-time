Yes, I got this on sale, and at the sale price of about $1.60, would be equivalent to about a third of what I would pay full-price for what is on offer here (I appraise this asset pack to be a solid $5).\n\nSo, do I recommend this?\nAbsolutely, but get it on sale. It's worth having, no doubt about it. The two other reviews for this pack are best ignored short of talking about the price being too high.","timestamp_created":1575186736,"timestamp_updated":1575186736,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuMSc4O4Cd5/D4AE="}
