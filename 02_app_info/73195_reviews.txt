Turns last no more than about 30-40 seconds for me which is definitely good for a game like this.\n\n[b]The setting and features[/b]\n\nThe setting is great, the Great Powers have their own goals and agendas, there are tons of different units and I love how you are sending expeditions to the colonies as units and then using decisions to influence how those develop. The colonization is definitely something amazing here.\n\nThe military system is simply amazing with enough units to make your head spin. Overall, it is a very good and tested system for military matters and it is a much better game than Victoria 2 and Hearts of Iron when it comes to military things and the depiction of 19th/ early 20th century conflicts and WW1. It suits how armies were moved and organized back then.\n\nThe setting, however, is not perfect. In 1880 Napoleon was no longer the leader of France, and definitely not a president of the Republic, \n\n[b]Summary[/b]\n\nGive this game a chance and try it. It works really well now and it can certainly be much more fun than Victoria II.","timestamp_created":1504364485,"timestamp_updated":1504364485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.711067676544189453","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mIvHod4CcJuphAE="}
