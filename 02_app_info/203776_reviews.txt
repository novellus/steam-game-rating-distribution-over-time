It allows you to create a non-historic character to start your dynasty off. The character takes the place of a historical character, and you get to choose his or her dynasty name and shield, age, stats and traits, appearance, religion, culture and if you’re married (with children). Some things, like traits, cost points though and you have a limited amount of points, so you can’t make Crusader Clark Kent (without cheating). Starting off with a custom ruler will also disable achievements.\n\nAn argument can be made that this DLC should be free, because it doesn't add any content. On the other hand, customization in strategy games is not a given (I don't think any other Paradox Grand Strategy game had had any significant amount of customization prior to CK2) nor was it present in the base game. The developers went out of their way to make customization possible and coders probably had to work more than half an hour to implement these features.\n\nBuy this DLC on sale, if designing a custom Crusader King is your thing.\n","timestamp_created":1609166895,"timestamp_updated":1609166895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+cb01PYCcNOPvgI="}
