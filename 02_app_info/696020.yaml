    review: "After the other 3 of the Surface series I've played, this came as a bit\
      \ of a disappointment.\nIt's still a fairly good HoG, and I'm still recommending\
      \ it as such, but there's an undefinable lack of... something... in this one\
      \ compared to the others. \n\nHere's a quick brain-dump of some of my thoughts:\n\
      \n- Compared to the others in the series, it seems very linear. Although you\
      \ sometimes have quite a few items in your inventory, it's usually the case\
      \ that only one ever does anything at any given time. The other games somehow\
      \ seem to mask things so that there [i]always[/i] seems to be plenty to do.\
      \ In GoG, I frequently (i.e. almost the whole time) was road blocked because\
      \ a single specific task had to be done to proceed.\n\n- Seemed like less variation\
      \ in the activities you do. In Pantheon there was always something new and different\
      \ turning up. Here it's the same 'Use item A on location B to do C' or generic\
      \ HoP D. There were one or two nice moments, but overall the whole thing felt\
      \ decidedly cookie-cutter.\n\n- Far less plausible. The premise is no less realistic\
      \ than the other games. Yet somehow those seemed to obey a general principle\
      \ of logical cause and effect. Here you can, for instance [/spoiler]play a whistle\
      \ to a vulture and suddenly it transfers to your inventory. wtf?[/spoiler].\n\
      \n- Occasionally I noticed slight glitches. Clues incorrect, or text completely\
      \ wrong.\n\n- The writing/voice acting was significantly less polished and engaging.\
      \ The characters, like the rest of the game seemed generic and off-shelf.\n\n\
      - Frequently when you got to a new scene, you'd look about for a while and then\
      \ click to make your first interaction. And [i]then[/i] it jumped to a cut scene.\
      \ I don't know why exactly, but I found this [i]really[/i] annoying.\n\n- Cursor\
      \ positioning (for interactions) seemed a bit off/inconsistent, sometimes.\n\
      \n- There are very few collectables. 16 in the whole game. Which means they\
      \ are easier to miss, as you aren't always looking for them. I guess that might\
      \ be the point, but it just felt cheap to me.\n\n-- Others games in the series\
      \ had a truly excellent approach to music; trigger a piece of fixed-length,\
      \ appropriate music when certain events happen, and then stfu. Here we seem\
      \ to be back to the 'play a constant, repetitive dirge in the background endlessly,\
      \ regardless of what's happening. Maybe an exaggeration, but this is the first\
      \ in the series where I found the music genuinely getting on my nerves.\n\n\
      It's not all negative.\n+- The premise of the story is interesting. (Although\
      \ not especially original; Think a dark version of Jumanji set in multiple locales).\
      \ But I never felt it made the most of its potential, and the ending is just\
      \ far too weak.\n\nBut the outright highlight for me has to be: \n+ The hilarious\
      \ accent of the Viking guy you meet near the start of the game. It's somehow\
      \ a mixture (to my ears) of Scottish, Irish, Dutch, and.. South African?\n\n\
      So what we have is a lot of slightly niggle negative points that wouldn't probably\
      \ even get a comment in another HoG. But in this series, where all of these\
      \ things have already been completely nailed, it seems like a bit of a lacklustre\
      \ effort."
