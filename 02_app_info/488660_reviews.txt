There may be some mistakes.\n\nAll clearance, 30 hours, played three times, now basically complete. Every single line, every daily event, and the end of the whole character. Now it's just the end of a common relationship I really don't want to collect it.\n\nThe characters are all classic models, and the plot of characters is also a classic four paragraph pattern -- understanding, deepening, secret and love.\n\nOn the whole, there are not too many surprises (except CG with great painting style), but there is nothing particularly bad. English dubbing is a bit strange, but it's emotional.\n\nThere are some bad experiences. I'd like to give some feedback to the official here\n\n1. You can't save the game when you choose the ending, so you have to play boss fight again and again to collect the ending of other characters, which is very troublesome.\n\n2. The task is single and boring. Many tasks are to give girls something they like. The dialogue is simple and can't get even a little favor bonus.\n\nMany of the tasks are \"asking for gifts\". The protagonist is just paying, paying and paying, and there is no return.\n\nThe \"support\" provided by girls actually costs money. Sometimes, they watched me being killed for lack of money.\n\nI suggest adding some interaction, and \"task reward\" beyond liking.\n\nThe game is more than just the plot and the text. Feedback from playing methods and behaviors These and \"plot text\" should be a complete whole.\n\n3. There's a big problem. This game can't trigger \"achievement\". I don't know what's wrong. I've passed the customs, and the achievements on steam are still 0.\n\n4. It's a pity!! There is no H content.\n\n\n\nHere are some of my experiences——\n\n1. If you want to conquer all the girls, you must collect at least two \"alien lucky pendants\", the one worth 1.5 million. Otherwise the money won't be enough. The game also has a name called \"gift giving simulator.\"\n\n2. If all the girls are in love, you can collect the picnics on the morning of the 22nd-24th, but it will take one day (it will start to act automatically from the evening of that day). Be careful.\n\n2. In the first few days, do more physical exercise with girls\n\nEarly patrol rely on red hair or commander, to avoid the situation of three monsters, can't beat.\n\nThe goal in the early stage is to save money and buy a rocket launcher at about 1.5 million BZ. With a rocket launcher, you can solo without spending money to call for support. Although the shotgun is also very good, the rocket launcher can let you take charge.\n\n3. It's better to get the rocket launcher, shotgun and the most expensive armour in order, and then you can choose to supplement them according to the situation——\n\n——Submachine gun (it can attack two monsters at the same time, mainly to make up for too few bullets of rocket launcher and shotgun, and too many shield monsters and blood returning monsters in the later stage)\n\n——Brush monster must have \"heat insulation armor\", which can make you immune to fire damage\n\n——Medicine bag and shield breaking grenade\n\n——Or you can take another armour. Changing armour does not consume combat rounds, which is equal to free HP\n\n4. In the early stage, we mainly exercise our physical strength and can do more things.\n\nStart to swim more in the middle stage (first hand) and practice shooting (hit rate)\n\nOf course, it's better to practice with girls on the way\n\n5. If girls are sick, they can't exercise or patrol together But you don't need to buy medicine, just a cheap gift that girls like. It may be a bug, but it really saves money.\n\n6. Every morning, afternoon, evening and night, you can receive new tasks. The premise is that you have finished the task assigned by this role. So - try to do tasks that can be done quickly and cheaply.\n\nIn addition, too expensive gifts will not give more favor. No matter how much the price is, the increased favor will be the same for those who like (+ 20) and super love (+ 35), and the favor will be devalued if they are given repeatedly.\n\n7. Remember to leave at least one million for the decisive battle and use the \"ultimate weapon\"\n","timestamp_created":1608946942,"timestamp_updated":1608946942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg8CtzvYCfoaevQI="}
