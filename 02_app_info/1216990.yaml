    about_the_game: "In Pawnshop Tycoon, you start the game with a garage full of\
      \ old junk and gradually expand into a thriving retail business with multiple\
      \ stores spread out across the city. You'll spend time at first organizing your\
      \ goods into departments, training sales agents, managers, hiring cleaning staff,\
      \ security, selling online, watching for theft, negotiating, selling, trading,\
      \ pawning, repairing and even dropping off daily reports at the local police\
      \ department. With enough experience, your time will be better spent managing\
      \ your store chain and setting up advertising campaigns or getting one of your\
      \ shops featured in a network television show.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen picking\
      \ a location for your pawn shop, you'll need to consider the area. Is there\
      \ a police department or post office nearby? This would make it easier to deliver\
      \ daily reports and mail. What kinds of retail stores are in the neighborhood?\
      \ People who already shop at one type of store may find themselves browsing\
      \ your store as well. Want to sell tools or construction equipment? Then situate\
      \ your shop near industries or construction zones. Have a lot of music gear\
      \ to get rid of? Take advantage of a competitor's music store customers by parking\
      \ your shop right next door.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe micromanagement of each\
      \ duty is learned and then handed down to a hired clerk who will continue redundant\
      \ tasks automatically. As you continue to play, you'll uncover all of the various\
      \ steps of building a big time business as a Pawnshop Tycoon!"
