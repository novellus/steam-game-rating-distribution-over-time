However, this means that every feature is a bit half-baked: the shop is clunky, leveling up is simplistic, quests are fairly basic. Worst of all: the combat is in this bad area where it uses clunky core mechanics (turn rates, your bullets hitting small bumps in the ground instead of your enemy because it's technically 3D), but doesn't embrace them enough for dealing with the problems to feel like part of the challenge rather than just unpleasant annoyances. (See, say, Brigador, where thinking about which way your mech is facing actually matters because turning takes so long)","timestamp_created":1554878369,"timestamp_updated":1554878369,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.608076989650726318","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zqH+guoCe8n6vgE="}
