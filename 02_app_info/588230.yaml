    review: "Truly unlike anything I've played before. While certainly a short and\
      \ rather linear game, it uses the medium of gaming to tell a story in a unique\
      \ way, you could not simply replicate this experience in any other form. It's\
      \ a grim fantasy that carries with it a breadth of commentary on modern society\
      \ and manages to keep it interesting with a constant change in the gameplay.\
      \ \n\nAbsolutely worth picking up purely for the way it breaks the mold of gaming."
