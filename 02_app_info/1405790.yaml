    review: The gameplay itself I'd say is solid enough. It is fun and tactical and
      can feel very rewarding when you succeed. There is some goofiness when you play
      with sightlines and a few other things but it's fine. My issues are mainly presentation.
      I would like some more time and effort put into making the movements and animation
      a bit more smooth and interesting to look at, especially since they have a real
      time replay feature (something I absolutely love but feels kinda off in this
      case because of the awkward animations). Still, good fun for a few hours of
      your time.
