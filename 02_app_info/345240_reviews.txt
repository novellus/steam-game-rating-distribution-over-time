Even after all these years, it is still an amazing game, one that has much to offer.  Why is it still an interesting game to play after 20 years since its publication will you ask?  Because this game has many qualities that will make it worth your time.  Here are a few reasons explaining why you will enjoy playing it: \n\n- it is simpler to play than the newer titles in the Total War series and is a good introduction to the game system;\n- simpler means you could run the game on your toaster and still be able to play;\n- it works without a hitch in Windows (XP, 7, 8 and 10);\n- graphics are surprisingly good for a game of that age, the animations are great, sound is also very good;\n- it has these very nice cut scenes that are fun to watch whenever some momentous event happens (these nice cutscenes are absent from the following titles);\n- victory means some nice ending cinematic cutscene instead of a bland victory message;\n- the game is still supported, if you have a problem with the game that you are not able to solve, you can still contact SEGA for help on their support website and get assistance!\n\nIf you prefer a game that will be more sophisticated, later titles in the series will easily make you happy.  If you want to play a classic that established a milestone in the gaming world, buy Shogun and you won't regret it!  I played it in the past and never had any technical problems with the game, but the Steam version seems to have a couple of glitches.  The Throne Room has a glitch where the counsellor offers you advice, but the voice does not come through.  The historical campaigns have bugs that may prevent completing some of the campaigns.  Luckily, if you go to the discussions on the game forum in Steam, you will find some fixes that will solve this last problem.","timestamp_created":1609975322,"timestamp_updated":1609975322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2bqA7fYCddSRwQI="}
