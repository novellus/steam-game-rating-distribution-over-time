    about_the_game: "In this FPS game, you control a survivor in an apocalyptic world\
      \ infested with zombies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWatch your bullets, reload your\
      \ weapon before any zombie reaches you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nZombies are very\
      \ strong, 3 to 4 hits usually will kill you, watch out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      This is a classic First Person Shooter ( FPS ) game with pixelated ( low poly\
      \ ) graphics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDon't attack zombies desperately, if they didn't\
      \ detect you reload your gun and shoot when you see the undead in your sights.\
      \ The apocalypse is coming now, don't hesitate to shoot anything that moves\
      \ around you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach level you need to kill a specific number\
      \ of zombies. Hold your weapon firmly and them. Kill zombies separately, it's\
      \ easier this way. If two or more zombies see you, run for your life. Don't\
      \ let any invader attack you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is an offline FPS game,\
      \ you fight against the AI ( artificial intelligence ), you can't play with\
      \ your friends, I mean, no multiplayer option.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf an undead\
      \ strike and not hit you, this is an excellent opportunity to leave and reload\
      \ your ammunition. If you with full ammunition, counter-attack them immediately.\
      \ Pull the trigger as fast as you can. You need to survive at any cost.<br />\r\
