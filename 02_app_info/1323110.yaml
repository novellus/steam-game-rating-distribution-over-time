    about_the_game: "A person who experienced a traumatic or otherwise shocking experience,\
      \ can find it difficult to process this on their own. This can lead to recurring\
      \ and stubborn psychological complaints. EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization\
      \ and Reprocessing) is a form of therapy that offers the eyes and/or ears of\
      \ the client rhythmic visual and/or auditory stimuli, switching between left\
      \ and right. The purpose is to reopen communication between different parts\
      \ of the brain, making it more accessible to process the experience.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nThe advantages to do this in VR, are that the visual stimulus always\
      \ remains centered in view, distractions from the client\u2019s physical environment\
      \ are minimized, there is a variety of different pendula, sounds, movement speeds\
      \ and directions for the therapist to choose from. Most of all, the therapist\
      \ can now fully focus on their contact with the client.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      EMDR is a method designed by psychologist Francine Shapiro. We recommend any\
      \ therapist to know, and understand how to practice EMDR protocol before using\
      \ this program."
