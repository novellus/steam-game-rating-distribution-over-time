    about_the_game: "12/02/2015. Well am happy to say this is a true horror survival\
      \ game. Some bugs to work out, but will have that resolved for the most part\
      \ by the 20th. We have also uploaded the new footage of the game on here. <br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n11/30/2015 UPDATE: WE ASK ALL REVIEWERS TO REPLAY THE GAME.\
      \ THE FOOTAGE ON THE STORE PAGE IS 100 PERCENT IN ACCURATE AT THIS TIME. OVER\
      \ THE NEXT 48 HOURS WE WILL BE UPDATING THE TRAILER, SCREENSHOTS AND MORE. THE\
      \ GAME IS NOW A TRUE SURVIVAL HORROR GAME. WE HAVE CHANGED OUT THE MESH, CHANGED\
      \ THE LEVEL DESIGN, MADE THE GAME MUCH SLOWER. WE COMPLETELY 100 PERCENT RIPPED\
      \ OUT THE OLD A.I AND REPLACED IT WITH NEW A.I. THE ZOMBIES WILL NOT DAMAGE\
      \ THE PLAYER AT THIS TIME BUT WITHIN A FEW DAYS THEY WILL. AGAIN THIS GAME IS\
      \ NOT THE SAME IT ONCE WAS WE ARE TAKEN FULL STRIVE IN CHANGING THE PLAY MECHANICS\
      \ AND WE HAVE DONE SO WITH GREAT STRIVE THE LAST 72 HOURS. THE GAME DOES NOT\
      \ REFLECT AND VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE NOR DOES IT REFLECT ANY REVIEWS AT THIS CURRENT\
      \ TIME UNTIL SUCH REVIEWS ARE UPDATED TO THIS DATE. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWE DO\
      \ APOLOGIZE TO EVERYONE, AND WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT AND NOW ARE APPLYING WHAT\
      \ WE HAVE LEARNED INTO CHANGING THIS GAME AROUND. COMMENTS HAVE ALREADY COME\
      \ IN FROM YESTERDAYS BUILD WHERE SOMEONE COMMENTED THE GAME IS NOW DECENT, THAT\
      \ ALONE IS A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT. TODAY WE FIXED A TON OF MORE THINGS AND ADDED\
      \ QUITE A BIT. WE ASK FOR YOU HONEST FEEDBACK, SO WE CAN REALLY MAKE THIS GAME\
      \ SOMETHING AND GIVE YOU ALL THAT GAME THAT YOU DESERVE AND CAN PLAY. <br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nWE APPRECIATE EVERYONES TIME.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n11/28/2015<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nWe are under going the Remake of T.R at this time. Over the next\
      \ couple of weeks you will see massive amounts of updates. We will have a new\
      \ build up and running within the next 24 hours. The game has already changed\
      \ drastically and for the better. You now play as a 3rd person/FPS view. We\
      \ have really slowed down the game play, and really have made this a very creepy\
      \ survival horror game. Gabby now plays a huge role in the game as well, and\
      \ will continue to do so throughout the series. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe community\
      \ has spoken, and it is a bout time we got are foot in gear and did something\
      \ about it. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nT.R Will now offer you dark creepy areas, where\
      \ only a flashlight tied to your hip and 2 of your weapons will only be able\
      \ to see the light of day, in most areas. Play as Mark Forah a former scientist\
      \ who created an Obelisk that could harness energy from organic objects and\
      \ use that energy into the newest power source for the world! Soon after his\
      \ discovery Mark was taken along with his daughter to a research faculty, where\
      \ he was demanded to show them how he created the Obelisk. After his refusal,\
      \ his daughter was used as a bargaining chip, which they went to far on and\
      \ injected his daughter from the Obelisk harnest energy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      Now Mark wakes up in a prison with no memory of what has happened. He must quickly\
      \ learn that survival is number one on the list, and find his daughter."

    review: "[i]This is the [b]20th[/b] review of the Steam Redlight series, a series\
      \ where I purposely seek out negatively or controversially rated games on Steam\
      \ to see if they're as bad as the Internet says they are. It's accompanied by\
      \ a video review that can be found [b][url=https://youtu.be/tb8JkRIm-uk]here[/url][/b].[/i]\n\
      \n[b]In summary, I can\u2019t recommend this game to anybody[/b] as it\u2019\
      s completely unfinished and has absolutely no enjoyable features. There\u2019\
      s only two soundtracks in addition to large, empty and meaningless levels that\
      \ are all poorly designed, enemies that don\u2019t do damage (or have death\
      \ animations), as well as having no discernible plot or character development.\
      \ The balding child villain is a nice touch, though.\n[h2]Introduction[/h2]\n\
      Time Ramesside (subtitle, A New Reckoning) is a basic undead-shooter. You play\
      \ as this dude named Mark who wakes up in a prison with no memory. Soon, he\
      \ encounters some dying dudes that are like \u201Cyour balding child is a demon\
      \ and is killing everyone, you terrible parent\u201D so I guess the underlying\
      \ plot is that you\u2019re trying to put your daughter in time-out. This is\
      \ no easy feat since your daughter spider-crawls on walls like the possessed\
      \ love-child of Dr. Phil while summoning the undead. The game makes no effort\
      \ to explain itself, so you\u2019re left to your guesses as to what is actually\
      \ going on.\n\nThis game features typical WASD shooter controls and only two\
      \ weapons - a pistol and this exploding crossbow. Mark is also an amazing endurance\
      \ runner since he has no stamina and outruns every enemy in this game. You ever\
      \ heard the term \u2018breaking ankles\u2019? Mark invented that term back in\
      \ Humboldt College back in \u201896. It might be worth noting that there isn\u2019\
      t any melee options available, but for some reason there\u2019s a summonable\
      \ textbox if you press \u201CC\u201D, so maybe you can try and guess your daughter\u2019\
      s full name to invoke fear into her.\n\nOnce you make it to the end of the level,\
      \ you\u2019ll be transported into the next until you get to the [i]\u201Dlast\u201D\
      [/i] level where you\u2019ll be brought back to the main screen, wondering why\
      \ you spent any time at all trudging through empty sewers. If you want to experience\
      \ the joys of a level twice -- don\u2019t worry, the game has a level selector.\
      \ There\u2019s even more [b]\u201DLevel In Progress\u201D[/b] lines than actual\
      \ levels, although they\u2019re more empty-promises than things to look forward\
      \ to.\n\nFor some fun-facting, this game actually has over 300 reviews with\
      \ only about 15-16% positivity. The reviews you see today are post-relaunch\
      \ that happened back in 2015. This level of relaunching also is seen on another\
      \ release of the developer\u2019s, The Sacred Stone. For another fun fact, this\
      \ game\u2019s last update was in 2015! So, it\u2019s safe to say this game is\
      \ abandoned.\n\nThat\u2019s about all I can explain since this game doesn\u2019\
      t have much going on, so let\u2019s talk about something I did like about this\
      \ game.\n[h2]The Good[/h2]\nThis game\u2019s most redeeming factor is that it\
      \ exposed me to a level [i](Called \u201CThe City\u201D in the level selector)[/i]\
      \ that has grass that\u2019s too tall to see past unless you jump. I haven\u2019\
      t seen a game that featured that kind of design and I figure if there\u2019\
      s a fully-functional horror game that can actually carry atmosphere, I\u2019\
      d be interested in playing it.\n\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s about it. Let\u2019\
      s move onto what I didn\u2019t really enjoy.\n[h2]The Ungood[/h2]\nTo start\
      \ with the lesser of the evils, there\u2019s seemingly only two music tracks\
      \ in this game. There\u2019s this eerie-like song that [i]tries[/i] to set the\
      \ atmosphere of a horror shooter, but the only other track is this high-energy\
      \ orchestral song that you hear in the main menu. In Level 2, the eerie-song\
      \ is overlaid with this endless dripping sound that doesn\u2019t go away, which\
      \ is what I\u2019m now calling Ramesside Water Torture.\n\nNext up is the level\
      \ design - there\u2019s really only two somewhat interesting levels being The\
      \ Maze and The City. Everything else is oversized and empty with enough space\
      \ to just run around the enemies to pass them. The Maze breaks away from the\
      \ poor design, and as I said earlier I thought the concept of The City level\
      \ was cool, but is still oversized and empty. The Sewer seems to be the last\
      \ level worked on, since it only has [i]\u201Done enemy\u201D[/i] in the entire\
      \ level, and it looks like a scorpion\u2026 tail? Too many questions about [b]everything[/b].\n\
      \nNext up is the lack of a story \u2014 I have no clue what the first iteration\
      \ of this game was like, but based off of what I\u2019ve seen from other screenshots\
      \ or gameplay videos, the game made an attempt to explain what was happening.\
      \ In this iteration, there\u2019s like\u2026 8 lines of dialogue? And only one\
      \ or two of them actually contribute to the lore. The developer may as well\
      \ just use X17\u2019s store description and nuke any semblance of story so we\
      \ don\u2019t have our expectations set any higher than a children\u2019s book.\
      \ Personally, I like the idea of this villainous child being on their quest\
      \ for Rogaine, but feel free to invent whatever plot you\u2019d like to numb\
      \ the pain.\n\nAs if this game couldn\u2019t even [i]try[/i] to seem completed,\
      \ we\u2019ve got one hell of a performance by the game\u2019s enemies. There\
      \ are a couple of different models, but they all honestly perform the same.\
      \ They hone in on the player character and follow him forever. If you ever stand\
      \ around them, you\u2019ll learn that [b]they don\u2019t do damage[/b]. The\
      \ only way you\u2019ll die is by the splash damage of the exploding crossbow.\
      \ So not only is the game unfinished, but you don\u2019t even get the thrill\
      \ of combat since this game is more of a janky shooting range game than a horror\
      \ shooter. This is on top of the fact that you can just outrun every enemy,\
      \ reserving your bullets for those blocking a path. The real icing on top of\
      \ this undercooked cake is that there is [b]no death animation[/b]. Once you\
      \ kill an enemy, they just disappear.\n\nIt\u2019s honestly amazing how unfinished\
      \ a non-Early Access, $8 USD game can be. This game even had the audacity to\
      \ sink no lower than $2 USD on sale, although I\u2019m certain no price tag\
      \ is appropriate for what I\u2019ve experienced.\n[h2]The End[/h2]\nWell, this\
      \ is definitely the most unfinished game I\u2019ve played to date. The developer\
      \ has two other games that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be covering since these\
      \ all seem to follow the same release, relaunch, and development cycle.\n\n\n\
      [i]If you\u2019re into curator groups, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38757311/]we\
      \ have one of those[/url]. [i]Did you like this written review? Watch the video\
