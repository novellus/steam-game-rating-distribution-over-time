Today we will be looking at the DLC “Faith Undone” another Priority Assignment that includes a cosmetic item upon completion.  Is it worth the $3?  Let’s find out!\n\nEvery Branch on the Way Down:  I must say that each of these priority missions seems to be getting worse and worse.  This one only gave me one path and the reward was equally bad.   You get a cosmetic footprint skin that is little ice shards but they don’t really do anything but appear then disappear.  They don’t crack or shatter and the little ice effect under them would be preferable than the ice shards itself.  \n\nThis footprint cosmetic is not as enjoyable as the acid or the light and the priority mission itself leaves a lot to be desired, would have taken someone a matter of minutes to come up with more twists and turns.  I’d avoid this one unless you are a completionist or buying in a bundle.  Enjoy!\n","timestamp_created":1590961066,"timestamp_updated":1590961066,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.554750740528106689","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgeqqtvICfdq8iwI="}
