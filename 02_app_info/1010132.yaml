    review: 'It''s difficult to know how to rate this DLC because while the locomotive
      itself is superb the West Somerset railway you have to use it with is frustratingly
      limited limiting the powerful Western to just 25mph and at times just 5mph.


      Although I''ve never seen one of the Westerns in real life I was curious about
      it particularly the unusual (for a locomotive) diesel hydraulic drivetrain.  The
      locomotive looks great inside and out and it gets even better when you give
      it some throttle, hear the two mighty engines spin up as it surges forward with
      the rpm dials climbing.  But then you have to immediately stop because you''ve
      hit the 25mph limit.


      The choice to only allow the locomotive on the West Somerset railway is baffling
      and I find it immensely frustrating.  There are three scenarios, one where you
      do a brief bit of shunting, one where you move one stop and then put the Western
      on the turntable (which seems very buggy for me) and a final much longer scenario
      where you move along the entire line again with a maximum of 25mph and sections
      of 5 and 10mph.  It finishes after a long slow 5mph leaving you with a view
      of the mainline where the Western could finally get up to speed but not this
      time.  I like the diesel gala idea and it''s certainly what some of the classic
      vintage locomotives do in real life but it feels like it should be a bonus scenario
      and powerful locomotives like the 52 should get the chance to do some express
      passenger work as they were designed for.


      Ultimately I don''t regret buying the DLC and having been using a mod to allow
      me to use the Western on other routes (with mixed results), I find it a good
      locomotive to drive with the well lit cabin and responsive controls.  It''s
      just a shame by default it''s so limited.'
