    about_the_game: "Heavens Tournament is a hardcore realistic fighting Virtual Reality\
      \ game that will test your power, reflexes, dexterity and skills. So, although\
      \ it has anime characters, the fighting won't be anything like the animes that\
      \ we're used to watch. You will actually have to keep your guard up, dodge,\
      \ hit hard and make smart decisions, just like in a real fight with combat realism\
      \ being the main philosophy, that's one of the reasons that there isn't TouchPad\
      \ locomotion, because footwork is extremely important in a fight, due to that,\
      \ Room Setup is necessary to play this game. Wanna hurt the opponent? Then swing\
      \ your arms like you would in a real fight. And do expect to feel your arms\
      \ heavy and lungs burning a little while playing this game ;)<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nIt has a unique feature that the opponent will block the incoming attack according\
      \ to the direction that the player is striking or even try to knee the player\
      \ if they see a level change of the player going for a takedown.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nThe combat has a simple realistic fighting system, such as, the wider\
      \ and faster your attack it, the more damage it will deal, just like in real\
      \ life. It sounds silly, but this is one of the only or the only game like that\
      \ out there for now. Most VR games out there, you can knock the opponent down\
      \ by just waving the controller on the their faces really fast, and that's very\
      \ unrealistic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExpect real challenges, each opponent having\
      \ a different fighting style and ability.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough the combat\
      \ is realistic, Heavens Tournament has a few flashy abilities inspired by Animes\
      \ (and my personal favorite, Hunter x Hunter), making the combat even more fun.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game can be a stress reliever or just some casual fun\

    review: cool idea but god damn is this game a mess with a colour scheme that made
      me want to puke, should have released this in early access, I mean alone the
      fact there is no locomotion is just terrible. I would not reccomend until there
      are some major improvements.
