    review: "Since DLC multiplayer lobbies have been long dead, the only thing you'd\
      \ really be playing in this pack is the Die Rise Zombie map and most likely\
      \ solo. The multiplayer lobby even for this pretty Good map is often dead. You\
      \ might get lucky and find other players if you wait in the lobby long enough\
      \ but in any case the four multiplayer maps you get are useless and irrelevant\
      \ in 2020. The \"Turned\" Zombie mode while being interesting in it's concept\
      \ and approach follows the same fate as the aforementioned multiplayer maps....................\
      \ no one plays them. The player base for the game in general is small as it\
      \ is. That being said, Die Rise is a very fun and in my opinion a very underrated\
      \ map. \n\nDie Rise\n- Jump between two large decaying skyscrapers in a Chinese\
      \ mega city. It's atmospheric, creative and there's a lot of things to do. Perks\
      \ are in elevators that move randomly when you turn on the power but can also\
      \ be summoned with a key. You can build things like a trampoline that throws\
      \ zombies forward often killing them. (you can also use these to launch yourself\
      \ between buildings) Every several rounds the special zombie wave will see you\
      \ being attacked by these extremely bouncy and flippy grey zombies. The issue\
      \ a lot of people have with Die Rise is that it's insanely easy to fall off\
      \ the map and die..... don't fall and you'll be having a good time. \n\nNow\
      \ is one Zombie map you're likely only going to be playing on solo worth $15?\
      \ No of course not. Wait for a sale"
