After replaying Aetherfall till I was satisfied with how my character turned out it was a huge dissapointment to discover almost nothing you did in Aetherfall seems to carry over or affect Shattered Worlds. I understand if the author wants to write a new story but it really diminishes the satisfaction of a player when nothing you did in the previous book seems to matter. It's as if you start the game on a completely blank slate. I was Head of the Society, managed to keep my recruits together, optimize my stats, etc. but now all the stats start blank and you can't call upon anything from the previous instalment to assist you. The narrative of this book also seems to be quite weak. Plot threads jump at you here and there, and the whole time it seems as if the protagonist is the only person in the universe, and so tasked with solving every problem, from the largest to the smallest, by himself. It's just strange that you're forced to deal with huge political matters by yourself and entire organisations solely rely on you to succeed. Sorely disappointed.","timestamp_created":1577867097,"timestamp_updated":1577867097,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.588593363761901855","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uqaNsO8Cf77u6AE="}
