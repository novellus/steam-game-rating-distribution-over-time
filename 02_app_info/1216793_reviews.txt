Though I don't know if some of the things in this are that realistic.\n\nThe ride starts off quite suddenly with a plunge downwards taking you around and about in the darkness till you reach the house, there's a few decent scares in here nothing gory but a couple of ghostly jump scares to scare your friends with. A very good atmosphere in this one and by the end you don't know what's going to jump out at you (well unless you've ridden it before)\n\nOverall I'd say this one is worth the price on it's own and definitely if you get it as part of the bundle.\nhoping for a few extra scares in the future.","timestamp_created":1579093560,"timestamp_updated":1579093560,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrPHT1O8CfMuJ7AE="}
