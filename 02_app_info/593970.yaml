    review: "I saw this game when it was in Greenlight. It is good to see that it\
      \ came through. Since then there is a huge improvement in graphics which was\
      \ the primary concern back then. It is certain that the developers had considered\
      \ the feedback that is given there.\n\nModels of the ships and the water reflection\
      \ is stunning. Most VR games do not use water like that so that's a first for\
      \ me.\nAnimations are also nice but I wished that ships kept burning after sinking\
      \ (the parts above the water at least).\n\nThere is need for improvement nonetheless.\
      \ Terrain looks a little dull and empty but I personally don't care then again\
      \ some people might.\nAlso I cannot wait to see the multiplayer of this. There\
      \ is a comment on moving the board around and I totally agree. The area in which\
      \ you play must be movable somehow. Timing between the turns may be a little\
      \ shorter but it is a minor thing.\n\nAs a battleship enthusiast I played VR\
      \ Battle Grid as well but I can tell you that this one is way better considering\
      \ the graphics, interaction with the ships and implementation. That's why I\
      \ cannot understand people who didn't try the game but say that it is a cheap\
      \ copy. To those people I wanna say try it out first. It is a good game and\
      \ obviously a lot of thought and effort was put into the game. \n\nI specifically\
      \ liked how you can place your ships as you wish unlike the random case in VR\
      \ Battle Grid. I believe anyone who likes to play battleship knows that you\
      \ shouldn't know which ship or which part of the ship you hit. That is where\
      \ the logic and the fun of the game is. This game implements these aspects as\
      \ well.\n\nPeople may not like the battleship game itself but as far as the\
      \ implementation and the effort goes this game does a good job. I will try and\
      \ update my review in case of an update.\n\nSo first play the game fellas. It\
      \ definitely worths the price. Highly recommended.\n"
