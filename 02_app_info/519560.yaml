    review: "3 sessions in and I am already appreciating how the conceptualisation\
      \ technique(s) for proportion are/will improve my ability to generate human\
      \ forms from my mind grapes. \n\nShort classes and instructions for each make\
      \ this course easy to digest at own pace. Pretty good however fingers crossed\
      \ more subtlety will be covered outside of the 8 heads method experienced so\
      \ far."
