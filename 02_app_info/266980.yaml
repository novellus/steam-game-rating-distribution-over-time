    review: 'Sadly I can''t recommend this game, and I don''t believe it could be
      called a classic. The fact it unfortunately came out a few months before Myst
      does not take out the fact it is in itself not a good game. It has good ideas,
      and wants to tell a nice story, but ultimately it is quite academic, boring,
      and repetitive. So much wandering in labyrinths without anything to do, and
      with totally unjustified and random environments. The art also is quite messy,
      and often doesn''t fit. It is not an awful game, just mediocre/bad. So many
      text adventures are better than this, and to be fair, if you need to play fantasy
      3D puzzle games from the 90s, Myst is the masterpiece.
