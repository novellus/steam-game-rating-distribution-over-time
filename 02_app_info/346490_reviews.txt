The enemies run strait towards you in an awkward fassion, all the technical issues make the game near impossible even on the easy setting. If you want a good game like this check out Hypercharge Unboxed or The Mean Greens, both of those games are around the same price as this and are Infinitely better. The Mean Greens is multiplayer combat, Hypercharge Unboxed is wave based co-op/singleplayer. I wanted to like this game but it's just too flawed and there are better free game out there than this, If you want a free game similar and better than this google World Of Padman. It's a free, open source, bot supported multiplayer game. All of the games I listed have you play as a toy like this game.","timestamp_created":1541432884,"timestamp_updated":1541432884,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsuej8uYCduqNrgE="}
