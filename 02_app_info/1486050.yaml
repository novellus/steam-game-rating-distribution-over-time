    review: 'I would like to see Shogi problems that the player actually attempts
      to solve.  Tsume Shogi (mating problems)  and problems on tesuji would be very
      welcome.     As is the program is easy to use but it would be nice if there
      were more features to allow players to improve and if the ideas behind things
      like castles were explained so that new players can understand them.

      If all that is desired is a computer opponent this program is fine but it will
      not satisfy the needs of more serious players of the game.'
