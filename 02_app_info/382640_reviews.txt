But funny. Still fucking stupid. \n\nPlot: Everyone works in a cinema and each one has their own points / things / paths that they have to do to survive / become a better person. \n\nDefinitely worth a rent, and a buy if on sale with other indie movies. Otherwise I'd pass on it.","timestamp_created":1486628950,"timestamp_updated":1486628950,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.457589268684387207","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/7H/kNoCcrXVcQ=="}
