    review: "-- Make sure to follow my curator page (GG Reviews - https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33476951/)\
      \ to hear more about which games I would recommend, and which I wouldn't. For\
      \ real and honest opinions --\n\n-*-*-\n\nI used to love this game when it first\
      \ came out, as it reminded me of Swords and Potions 2, a game I played for many\
      \ many years. Cloudcade was scheduled to take over S&P2, but in the end it didn't\
      \ go through.\n\nThey made this game however, and back then it was a great game.\
      \ They communicated nicely with their player base and I have even given them\
      \ many ideas to make gameplay better, including ideas that are implemented in\
      \ game. I felt appreciated and thus I loved supporting them.\n\nI recently returned\
      \ to play again, and enjoyed it a lot, until I ran into trouble that wasn't\
      \ there before. They made changes in game to punish new players and to reward\
      \ their old. As new player, you get many restrictions that make you even more\
      \ behind on the older players than you already were.\n\nThey want you to pay\
      \ for everything, and their ingame packages are extremely expensive. \n\nWhen\
      \ you start to talk to cloudcade themselves, they are extremely rude and disregard\
      \ you in every possible way. Sadly, it has begun to feel like an unfair game\
      \ to new players, and I suggest not getting started on this one. It's a nice\
      \ game, but extremely unfair and it's only there to fill their pockets with\
      \ your hardearned cash. \n\nThey even make fun of you if you have more accounts\
      \ (different platforms) and let you know it is not allowed, even though you\
      \ just started the game on different places and you can't help you can't link\
      \ them to the other places. So it's your fault that they don't give you the\
      \ option to log in from one place on different places. They are funny sometimes.\
      \ Blame the players and not the company!\n\nNot even worth 1 star. Luckily I\
      \ don't need to give any with the steam system ^^"
