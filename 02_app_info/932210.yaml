    review: 'I started off with an OK team.

      I walked into a random encounter tile.

      The tile asked if I wanted to drink from a fountain.

      I did.

      The fountain mega-poisoned my entire party, because you would totally have your
      entire party drink from an unknown fountain at the same time.

      They all died from poison.

      That''s okay, it''s a roguelike. I restarted...

      ...only to find out the poison didn''t wear off when they died.

      So all my games from that point on would lose before the 20th tile I stepped
      on.

      I tried to drink the health potion you spawn with to fix it.

      It removed the poison from my defender.

      Everyone else died. I suicided into a battle.

      I restarted the game.

      Everyone except the defender has poison. I did not spawn with a potion.


      This is why I stopped playing.'
