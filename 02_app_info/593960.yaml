    review: "Sountrack and voice acting are excellent.\nThe mix of 3D and 2D graphic,\
      \ together with a masterful use of colors make this game the prettiest of the\
      \ trilogy.\nThe story didn't hit me as hard as the two previous chapters, but\
      \ it's a solid and enjoyable story, as well as a fitting conclusion to the saga.\
      \ \nPuzzles felt toned down (still maintaining their creepy factor), so getting\
      \ stuck is not a problem with this one.\n\nFound no bugs, except for the dialogues\
      \ clipping in a few instances.\n\n\n"
