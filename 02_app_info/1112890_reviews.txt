Unfortunately I cannot. I can however say the following;\n\nI recommend this game IF;\n\n- You understand and accept that it is incredibly buggy. It is filled to the brim with amazing ideas, though unfortunately they often stumble at the finish line. An example is disappearing animals, ridiculous amounts of clipping and the fact that changing the colour of your clothes often doesn't work at all.\n- You do not expect complexity in your story. \n- Are okay with a preciously short game. \n- Are not fuzzy about buggy quests. \n- Do not mind exceedingly simple graphics. \n- Buggy buggy buggy controls. \n- Regular bouts of frustration. \n- Very shallow mechanics. \n- Do not mind a game that plays like it should be in early access and no more. \n\nThat being said, what you get in return is;\n- Buckets of charm. \n- A game built on a concept rarely seen. This is the place to live out your magic girl in a marshmallow world dreams!\n- Creative clothes and furniture, when they work. The aesthetic is precious. \n- The ability to play with magic and animals! (More magic, perhaps the ability to pursue witchdom, would have been amazing).\n- Adorable NPCs. \n- Round soft girls, which is a rare sight in games. \n- Marshmallow graphics that grows on you with time. \n- A game that can run comfortably on even the most basic of laptops. \n- A game that is an early access title in all but name and price. \n\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nI can't quite tell if I love this game, or if I love what it could/can be. I've never come across another title that allows for round, sugary sweet magic girls in a marshmallow world and it's a nice escape. Unfortunately, whenever I start to get into the game, one but or another ruins the immersion. The promise of a sweet world that you can lose yourself in is there, but that's all it is at this point; a promise. It's too buggy, too simple, too unrefined and too small to be a proper game.\n\nIf the game had been listed as an early access game, with a road map clearly listed on the store page, this review would have read very differently. Unfortunately, at the time of writing, that is not the case.\n\nI do not believe that the current state of the game warrants a price of â‚¬9. I want to see more games with this concept and aesthetic, but if you're looking for a game more than an 'experience', this is not the right place.\n\nEdit 07/01/21: I would like to note that the recent patch added several minor quality of life updates. While it is not enough to alter anything said in my review above, I am optimistic that if the developers keep working on the game and listening to the players, this game will become worth what it is priced at.
