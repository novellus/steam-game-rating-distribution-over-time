At least, the way I play it. There is combat involved, too, but I'm more for the trading side of it. Let me run my stations in peace!\n\nOkay, for reals; the sheer variety of spaceship and economic trading is fascinating, and while I haven't delved too deeply into the combat aspect I can already see it has plenty of potential. Turrets, missiles, lasers and the ability to decide the function of all of these for oneself. Not to mention the different aspects of the ships! My only complaint with this is that the more potent ships are inordinately expensive, meaning your economic strength will be tested first and foremost. Fine for me, but it can take... a while.","timestamp_created":1609244175,"timestamp_updated":1609244175,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qa2b1/YCf562vgI="}
