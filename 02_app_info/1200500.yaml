    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Save the island of Abomi Nation!</h2>Every
      100 years, two island spirits are reborn to fight over control of Abomi Nation
      and the Abomis that reside on it. One aims to allow Abomis to live freely and
      form societies, while one aims to revert Abomis to their primal, brutal natures
      and have them fight to their deaths. It is up to the light spirit to assemble
      a team of Abomis that can put a stop to the dark spirit's reign.<h2 class="bb_tag">Explore
      a world unique to your playthrough!</h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1200500/extras/gif2.gif?t=1578497310"
      /><br>Every run of Abomi Nation will generate a uniquely-shaped island for your
      team to traverse, offering up a different combination of areas, bosses, and
      Abomis to recruit every time you play. Replayability is a main focus of Abomi
      Nation, and there will always be ways to tweak your game's settings to keep
      each new run feeling fresh.<br><br>Want to completely randomize which Abomis
      can spawn at any level? Want more control over who you add to your team? Want
      to control whether your team members will permanently die in battle or not?
      You'll have the freedom to play the game in a manner that suits you.<h2 class="bb_tag">Battle
      for control of Abomi Nation!</h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1200500/extras/gif1.gif?t=1578497310"
      /><br>Every Abomi throughout Abomi Nation possesses tremendous abilities. Via
      their elemental types (Neutral, Fire, Water, Ice, Plant, Lightning, Air, and
      Earth), Abomis previously utilized power and strategy to dominate each other.
      After becoming civilized, most Abomis tended to forget about their violent history.
      But, now, as a powerful threat emerges, your team will have to learn to rediscover
      their powers and fight for Abomi Nation's safety.<br><br>Master a unique turn-based
      battle system that emphasizes 1-on-1 combat, but allows for tactics that impact
      benched Abomis before they even enter the fray.<h2 class="bb_tag">Watch your
      team bond!</h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1200500/extras/gif3.gif?t=1578497310"
      /><br>No two teams will be alike in Abomi Nation thanks to the myriad of randomized
      factors that go into each run. Abomis have different personalities from one
      another, and this will impact how multiple Abomis react to the same situation.
      As your adventure unfolds, the bond between any two Abomis will grow, causing
      them to behave differently when their friends are in danger.<br><br>Not everything
      in Abomi Nation is about fighting, either. Your team can boost its stats by
      eating together, playing minigames, and participating in all sorts of events
      offered by NPCs. It's OK to enjoy some down time in between life-risking battles.
