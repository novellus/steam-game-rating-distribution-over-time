    review: "Really good and honest DLC. \n\nThe horribly translated store page tells\
      \ you this DLC won't start manually. \nThat was the other one...\nThis one here\
      \ works. After having installed the game and playing for one hour straight without\
      \ and with \"KiLL The EnginE\" (offline play) the only noticable change is the\
      \ big wallclock being moved from left wall to the right wall in the beginning.\
      \ According to the very fair pricing (free when purchasing the standard game)\
      \ this DLC is actually better then some other DLCs from real games. \nAnd it's\
      \ 100 times more honest, because the engine used for this game and the DLC,\
      \ FPS Creator, is literally the killer of all engines... Because... It riuns\
      \ any game created with it, already before release. So, attend the User License\
      \ Agreement, which this time didn't lie! \n\nI am looking forward to see this\
      \ DLC and the game it belongs to finally getting removed from Steam, so nobody\
      \ will ever be fooled by by the screenshots again. \n\nI would love to give\
      \ you a positive rating, but I am afraid this DLC is too good to have the same\
      \ charme as the original InsanZ, which impressed me with it's low quality. As\
      \ this DLC didn't offer anything to joke about, I see myself forced to give\
      \ you a negative rating. \nBut you may have this one more chance because I am\
      \ really sad about how bad your programing and language skills are and I hope\
      \ by rating all of your disgusting work positive I might encourage you to improve\
      \ and get some actual game done...\n\nOr at least to do anything useful."
