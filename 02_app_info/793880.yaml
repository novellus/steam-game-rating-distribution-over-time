    review: "Exactly what I was looking for. \nI'm currently using this in conjunction\
      \ with an exercise bike. Hop on, put on your music, and workout to a selection\
      \ of beautiful and immersive atmospheres that react to your music.\n\nI only\
      \ wish there were more scenes. A way to connect a bluetooth cadence sensor for\
      \ a workout machine would also be an incredible addition to this. Imagine your\
      \ stationary bike actually allowing you to pedal forward and move through these\
      \ environments all while listening to your music. Turning this into a fully\
      \ fledged fitness app + standalone music visualizer would be a worthwhile investment\
      \ IMO.\n\nIn any case, if this sounds like something you might use it for I\
      \ totally recommend trying it out. I've never felt so motivated to stay on that\
      \ bike."
