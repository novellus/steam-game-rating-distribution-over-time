The game is very tight, for length, mechanics, and choices, and the setting features futuristic Science-Fiction (though set in an alternate 2015), corporate and government espionage and surveillance, stealth, gadgets, pseudo-hub worlds between missions, and a retro 80s neon sci-fi visual style and great electronic soundtrack, which I would never listen to normally, but totally complements everything about this game. Your play style really determines how much you enjoy it, I think. If you run in and knock out every guard and just bee-line the objectives, it's a relatively fast (short) game. However, getting the S rank in every level by 'ghosting' through, completing the optional objectives, and finding the collectables in each course becomes a great stealth game. I'm a huge fan of [i]Perfect Dark[/i] and [i]Clandestine[/i], so this game is right up my alley.","timestamp_created":1609080406,"timestamp_updated":1609080406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/8+q0vYCd47jvQI="}
