The main downside is that Europa is not included in ranked matches. You also won't see it in the infinite map challenge. The full price of 15â‚¬ is also steep.\n\nHowever, price and lack of ranked matchmaking for Europa aside, it's a fun little addition to the game. The color palette is very nice and makes for a pleasant experience playing on it (opposed to the understandably dull gray Ceres for example). The gameplay changes compared to Mars are subtle, but they add up and tweak the gameplay enough for it to feel fresh.\n\nOverall I would only recommend this at full price to hardcore fans of the game. As long as Europa holds no relevance in ranked matches it's probably best picked up during a sale.","timestamp_created":1589907880,"timestamp_updated":1589907880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhJ/5lvICeurtiAI="}
