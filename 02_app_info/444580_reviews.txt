You get through these by tossing something metallic through them to find the safe path. (Not all of them HAVE safe paths! Some are just there to usher you down another hall). \n\nAlternatively you have a second type of death zone which involves you running through areas with randomly arcing insta-kill lightning. (There is no pattern or indicators that will help you through these. You simply have to run through and hope the dice rolls are on your side.)\n\n-When the game isn't infuriating you with cheap lightning it's practicing blandness in the extreme. 95% of the areas in the game are hallways that look exactly the same. For example, there's a picture on the store page of a room with trees. That's literally the ONE and only room in the whole game with trees. \n\n-The base is large just for the sake of being large. It fails to justify it's size in both design and content. \n\n-The puzzles are the least painful part of this game. And they're just average. Not annoying, but not particularly memorable. Most of them are a tile-style thing where you need to make a complete circuit between point A and point B. \n\n-The story is told through logs you find on computer consoles and without spoiling anything it utterly fails at hitting any sort of satisfying conclusion. The game just kind of ends. Which is super disappointing given that it seemed off to an interesting start. \n\nI'm rarely this brutal in a review. Even in games I don't recommend I almost always try to find some good aspects, because honestly, most games DO have some redeeming qualities, even if they aren't worth it. \n\nBut this?  I lost six hours of my life playing this game and I've never felt so robbed.  :(\n\nTLDR: [Not Worth it, at ANY price]\n\nSuggestion:\n\nI've played several much shorter sci-fi exploration-type games that were vastly superior to this because of how well they used their time. \n\nIf you're looking for something similar but much better executed,  you may want to consider: \n\nCAT Interstellar, (Free)\nVerde Station, (Free)\nSpirits of Xanadu, (cheaper)\nThe Station (more, but a much better deal)\n\nAll these games are a vastly better deal in terms of both time and money.","timestamp_created":1608264433,"timestamp_updated":1608264502,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508379876613616943","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr5mCuvYCfMmMuwI="}
