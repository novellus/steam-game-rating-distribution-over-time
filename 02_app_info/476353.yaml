    review: Complete Garbage,  Three players required to play,  otherwise you can
      only play the quick vote.  This quickly gets boring and value is just not there.  Wanted
      to like it but went to play a buddy and couldn't because we didn't have a third
      player.  Maybe they need to have a AI option.  Not sure but until this game
      gets a big following or finds a weigh to not require at least three people.  Then
      don't bother.
