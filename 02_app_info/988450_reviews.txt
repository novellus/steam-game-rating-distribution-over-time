I wouldn't have played Endless Legend in December 2020 had I not had the curiosity to see how the Myakara play (and had it not been discounted). I played my three games with them, maybe I'll take one of my favourite faction and play against them once, and that's going to be it.\n\nThe faction is ok. The Urkans are brokenly strong and at the end they are as fun as a sledgehammer, but some people are known to like sledgehammers.\n\nBuy if it is discounted and you are feeling nostalgic for EL but have otherwise played every faction to death.","timestamp_created":1607504770,"timestamp_updated":1607504770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvYawo/YCdrOtuAI="}
