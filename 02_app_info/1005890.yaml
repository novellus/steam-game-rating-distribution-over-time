    review: "If their was a neutral option Id put it down for this game, however since\
      \ the game has great artwork and a lot of effort put into it Ill leave it as\
      \ a positive. spoilers ahead. \n\nReally Kaleido Stella feels like a worse Vanilla\
      \ Garden of Judgement for me in several ways as the games are very similar in\
      \ themes. Both games feature a dominantly female cast in which everything isnt\
      \ what it seems at an eyes glance. The protag has to interact with several people\
      \ while growing themself in order to complete an objective often personal growth.\
      \ In the process losing everything in their starting situation. While Vanilla\
      \ focused on atonement and acceptance from a spirtual pov which was captivating,\
      \ the message of Stella seems to mirror that but falters. It does this thing\
      \ where \"space\" has to be forcefully injected into most conversations making\
      \ it sound deep but in reality sounds completely nonsensical by the end of it.\
      \ To make it easier let me bullet point some points of contention/pros I had\
      \ with Stella.\n\n/Manako as a protagonist has a lot of potential however he\
      \ is squandered as his growth is very inconsistent if not present at all. Despite\
      \ wanting the world to end and having nothing to do with it, he attempts to\
      \ save the world out of obligation and up until the end he seems like the same\
      \ character as when he started. Which im all for static characters however the\
      \ game makes it seem like hes grown when he still complains about the same shit\
      \ from the start. Also if I hear him complain about him not being able to do\
      \ his schoolwork one more fucking time I will snap\n\n/Mira's motivations dont\
      \ make sense for a multitude of reasons. I dont see why she'd help Manako if\
      \ her intent was to save Mars, a more fitting role would be to mislead Manako\
      \ or confirming his insecurities in order to make him either fail or give up\
      \ saving the world. Instead she only has one instance of this happening and\
      \ it seems unintentional.\n\n/Meme: Actually one story beat I find to resonate\
      \ with, I think this is the best part of the game for me which compliments Manako\
      \ a lot (aside from the bath scene).  Manako having to move past the fact he\
      \ contributed to his sisters death and was very resentful of her was deeply\
      \ touching, they also make use of a mechanic in Stella explained by Gaea which\
      \ was clever given Meme comments on it just meeting them. Only real flaw is\
      \ for some reason MIra somehow remembers despite acting like they cant at the\
      \ start which she never talks to Manako about substantially.\n\n/References\
      \ to old stories: While for long time Charon supporters seeing old figures come\
      \ back for this entry would have been amazing to see... however for me that\
      \ wasnt the case. Games like Tsukimi Planet and Cradle of Ruin had their stories\
      \ concluded perfectly, so to give them a reboot to continue with this game just\
      \ felt like manipulation of what came before. While I admit Kujirata's character\
      \ was fantastic and greatly written, the implementation of Kaguya with Tsukimi\
      \ planet in mind is just something I cant justify.\n\n/Mahori: God, this characters\
      \ execution was just fucking awful from start to finish which is a honest shame.\
      \ This ties in with my previous bullet but in summary the way they deal with\
      \ this character feels insulting to say the least. Wouldnt killing Mahori result\
      \ in the cult's resolve being strengthened 100%, because they did not tackle\
      \ the root of the problem at all? Which was the fact that the world is so fucked\
      \ that restarting it would be the only logical thing to do. Seeing Mahori die\
      \ the way she did would 100% boost the resolve of the cult thus leading to calamity\
      \ regardless. A personal way id like to see this play out is since Mahori is\
      \ a near perfect representation of Manako's desires realized, have Manako persuade\
      \ Mahori into believing otherwise. Instead she gets killed and is proven to\
      \ be right by the end of it because Manako's and everyones fucked up life is\
      \ still worse for bare along with mars getting yeeted.\nEdit:Another insult\
      \ to injury is this is the only character where the best option is to just beat\
      \ the shit out of them. Instead of an option to improve their mindset they get\
      \ shafted. It rubs me the wrong way hard.\n\nMain complaint and summary: Really\
      \ the liberties taken with the story can be excused up to a certain point, however\
      \ this game fails with its message. Manako despite \"overcoming\" his hardships,\
      \ at the end of the day would have benefitted from the meteor destroying the\
      \ planet. He lost Meme, Mira, and is left wondering what else is their to do.\
      \ Since he didnt sacrifice himself to take Gaea's place the world will one day\
      \ reach its end so its just delayed. A good post I saw from someones youtube\
      \ channel narrating it is that this game is too long, which it is. If Charon\
      \ got someone to review the script, remove space from every other dialogue and\
      \ shortened the games length it would have been a good game. As of now this\
      \ is the only Charon game that Ill forget, which is a shame since that it has\
      \ a higher quality production but worse story."
