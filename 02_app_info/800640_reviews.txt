The game mechanics are frustrating a feel buggy. The polish feels quite low but maybe that'll translate into a longer campaign. It does have a low price point. I'm not really interested in playing it so I'm not sure how long it actually takes to complete.\n\nIt sort of has elements of an escape room [spoiler]to unlock the actual game then has odd mechanics for the more actiony areas.[/spoiler] I could see it being useful for streamer wanting an oddball game to over react to. I could also see a strange demographic of people who play games for a funny bad experience but it was made this way on purpose.\n\nIf you buy play within the 2 weeks so you can refund if you are not happy with your purchese, I did not. I did at least get on sale and isn't that pricy to begin with.","timestamp_created":1531873573,"timestamp_updated":1531873573,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4iPex1eQCfummpgE="}
