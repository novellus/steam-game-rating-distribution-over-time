    review: This version of Cut the Rope is a must buy, it's way better than the mobile
      version, because Zeptolab decided to shove in Microtransactions, Non Skippable
      Ads, & A Paid Membership for money. The mobile game was completely euthanized...
      thank god the PC version exists, it has all chapters unlocked, more music, widescreen
      support & more.
