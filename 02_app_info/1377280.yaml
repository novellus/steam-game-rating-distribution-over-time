    about_the_game: <strong>Overview</strong><br>Electioneering is, at its core, a
      strategy game.  The map is shrouded under a Fog of War, and as you pierce that
      Fog, you'll start to develop more specific strategies.  We don't tell you how
      to run your strategy; there's no winning argument.  Voters change; if you keep
      pounding things into them, there's a chance they'll respond.  Well, if you can
      overcome their starting biases, challenging but possible!  <br><br>As the Electioneer,
      your focus is on changing voter opinion to win votes for the candidate you support.
      2020 has been a busy year. Events such as Trump's Impeachment or the COVID-19
      outbreak create new issues for the voters to consider. As things unfold, you
      research topics within each new issue, such as Trump's acquittal and the first
      Covid-19 case in America, and make strategic ad buys to sway voters. While you're
      off spinning the issues, the candidates don't even know you exist. Their goal
      is to crush each other, just like the actual election. They apply strategies
      designed to win over voters using any method they can to win. <br><br>Your job
      is to learn what voters think by taking out polls, hacking the candidates, and
      stealing information from their campaign! Making sure your candidate comes out
      on top is not going to be easy. The landscape is changing; electioneering mimics
      this new environment, asking users to choose between hundreds of different Events,
      Issues, Topics, and Arguments (spin) to reshape the conversation and even the
      country.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Choose your

      information, we're spreading lies. We're Electioneering. This time it's Trump
      and Biden; it's your job to use all the resources at your disposal to make sure
      that your candidate wins. Can you convince the voters to ignore what they see,
      ignore what they feel, and vote your way? Can you lie, cheat, and steal this
      election? We'll give you a weekly stipend and some contacts; the rest is up
      to you. If you get caught, we don't know you. If you lose, well. These aren't
      the kind of people you want to disappoint.
