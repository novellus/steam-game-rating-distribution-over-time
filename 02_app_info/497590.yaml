      **QUICK THOUGHTS**


      I went into this game expecting another generic horror themed title on Steam
      everyone would probably forget about pretty quick. Yes, the graphics looked
      like crap and the game boring due to the trailer on the page. Thankfully, this
      first person reimagining of Bomberman from indie dev WTFOMGames is honestly
      not that bad a title. This isn''t to say it isn''t without faults.


      Every stage you feel like you''re walking on ice, making it very troublesome
      to navigate. On top of that, the mouse sensitivity is incredibly high to the
      point that you wind up doing a 360 degree turn with a meer twitch of the wrist
      if that. But once you get the hang of the controls and movement of the enemies,
      which all move along a pre-determined path (or so it seems) unless you''re right
      up next to them.


      As it stands, Sapper''s Bad Dream isn''t as bad as the trailer makes it out
      to be. Yes, visually it could do with a lot more work, but overall being cast
      into a labyrinth with ghosts of past bombermen (or so I assume they are) is
      a nice, lamenting touch. The game has its issues, not to mention some really
      out of place enemies, but even with those it still stand a surprisingly fun,
      even tense little offering.'
