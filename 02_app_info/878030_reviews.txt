We couldn't get the multiplayer to work. However, I believe the price is a little too steep. Just crashes a little too much in it's current version for me.\n\npros:\n+ for the key binds.\n+ for the animations and sounds (the bumbly choo choo).\n+ economy of the game.\n+ couldn't aggressively expand.\n+ China was a wasteland of peaks and valleys.\n\ncons:\n- esc pauses the game in menus.\n- Hawaii and China looks the exact same on the preview.\n- The game does crash sometimes.\n- No loading screens.\n- The zoom moves if you zoom all the way in.","timestamp_created":1580507807,"timestamp_updated":1580507807,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.632854819297790527","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1583902964,"developer_response":"The 0.3 update should address a number of the Cons"}],"cursor":"AoJ40efm/u8Cc7ez7wE="}
