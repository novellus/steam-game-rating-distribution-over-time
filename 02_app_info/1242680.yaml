    review: At first I wasn't very into Empress playstyle, but after I got the hang
      of it, I really enjoyed playing with her. There aren't many power ups like in
      Jason's or Copen's runs, but I can't say much about it 'cause even in DMFD she
      doesn't have anything more than her sword and dragon shot. Everything she has
      in the og game, she has here, and it works pretty well. (And yeah... I know
      that in DMFD she can change attribute and have different tipes of d.shots, but
      the fire one would be the best choice anyway, so I don't count it)
