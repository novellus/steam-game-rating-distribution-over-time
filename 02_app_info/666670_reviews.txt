Even still, that does not detract from the fact that the composers of that era were hardworking geniuses that could cram a mountain of melody and harmony into their compositions.\n\nYears later, alongside the release of The End Is Nigh comes possibly the soundtrack that made me start really appreciating Ridiculon. I wasn't all too enamoured with Isaac Rebirth's soundtrack initially, but their remixes of well-known classical tunes married together rock and classical into a rather potent combination that keeps TEIN tense and exciting at various stretches.\n\nNote: This almost NEVER goes on sale on Steam. If you ever spot it on sale, make it a point to pick it up.\n\nTrack picks:\nTHE ARID FLATS - New World Symphony (Dvořák 1893) [but why couldn't they have put BOTH the Past and Future versions into the download instead of remixing both into a single track?]\nTHE MACHINE - Flight Of The Bumblebee (Rimsky-Korsakov 1899) \nGOLGOTHA - Night On Bald Mountain (Mussorgsky 1867)\nACCEPTANCE - Hungarian Rhapsody (Liszt 1847) \nTHE FUTURE - Requiem (Verdi 1874)\t\n\n[h1][b]9.5/10[/b][/h1]","timestamp_created":1581508532,"timestamp_updated":1608993097,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.595360398292541504","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40sjdz/YCe5Dl8QE="}
