    short_description: While you were battling the evil forces of D'Sparil, the other
      Serpent Riders were busy sowing the seeds of destruction in other dimensions.
      One such dimension is the decaying world where Hexen takes place. A world littered
      with the mangled corpses of nonbelievers and inhabited by the undead followers
      that executed them.

    review: I used to play this game all the time with my dad when I was younger.
      I always enjoyed the crap out of it. Its a really fun fantasy / medieval take
      on the doom formula, but that doesn't do justice to the feel of the game. It's
      definitely its own unique experience.
