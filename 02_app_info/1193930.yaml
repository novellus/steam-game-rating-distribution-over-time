    review: '"You get what you pay for", yeah, that''s pretty much the way to sum
      up the experience with this game. That said, don''t expect a masterpiece, it''s
      a basic game that you can use to kill some time whenever you feel like it.


      This title doesn''t really have a "story mode" available or something, but there''s
      a campaign of 60 levels that you can get to beat, in order to complete it. The
      more you advance, the more complex the levels get, with obstacles that you need
      to avoid, or that you can also try to use it in order to fool the AI.


      The graphics are pretty much basic, but that''s not really a problem, as you
      can get to see what''s going on around without any struggle. The sound effects
      are ok, as for the music, there''s only one available and I''ve turned off after
      the very first minutes, which was actually another frustrating discovery, because
      whenever you hit the "ESC" key during a run, you simply leave the game and lose
      all your progress (points). At least the game saves at the last level you were
      playing, just so you don''t have to start all over from scratch again. Be careful
      not to hit the "new game" option by accident on the main menu, though, that
      can be really frustrating.


      Considering the mechanics, the power-up items (if you may really call them this
      way), may provide you some extra small amount of points (or make you lose them),
      to make the ball go slower, faster or smaller, to get any random item or simply
      to lose a life, which I think it''s the most stupid thing ever. Talking about
      lives, for every level that you play, you and your opponent get 3 lives each.
      When the first player loses all of their lives, the other side wins.


      Ok... So while there''re only two difficulties available (Normal and Hard),
      one of the achievements is for beating the "Easy" mode. Another thing that I
      thought that it was annoying, is that it doesn''t matter if you finish the game
      on the "Hard" mode, you need to play all over again on the "Easy" mode as well,
      like, come on, at least in my opinion, I think that''s something very redundant.


      Nonetheless, despite everything, it''s still a fun game to kill some time, so
      if you''re looking for a quick experience that you can also get to unlock all
      the achievements with a bit of patience, this might be an interesting option.'
