    about_the_game: "Central Intelligence is the ultimate test of your strategic skills.\
      \ In this CIA style mission you can operate in three areas, Propaganda, Military,\
      \ and Political, to achieve your objectives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChoose your\
      \ moves carefully - you could set up a chain reaction of events that may backfire.\
      \ The theater of operation is immense.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA strategic game of\
      \ espionage and undercover operations with a lot of political undertones. You\
      \ play a CIA chief sent to the island of Sao Madrigal, which is currently under\
      \ a dictatorship. This dictatorship is supported by the Chinese government and\
      \ it seriously jeopardizes the U.S.A.'s interests in the region, thus it is\
      \ your mission to organize the return of democracy, by any means necessary.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nYou have at your disposal a series of CIA agents divided in\
      \ three branches: Political, Propaganda and Military. But the object of the\
      \ game is not to organize a military uprising, but instead to support and organize\
      \ the island's many opposing factions (like angry students, guerrillas, political\
      \ parties,etc.) against the dictatorship (with or without their knowledge of\
      \ your interventions) via propaganda, bribes, subterfuge, assassinations, blackmail,\
      \ etc."
