    review: 'Played and beat the game in one sitting.  My overall impression is that
      there is a decent game that just can''t get past all the jank.  The game can''t
      make up it''s mind if it wants to be a 2010''s era cinematic shooter or an arcade
      blaster.


      The story and presentation is good enough.  Mad scientist takes over city.  Oppressive
      regime makes mulch out of the locals.  You get to do something about it.


      Inventory is kind of puzzling.  There is no clean categorization of which guns
      go into which slots.  You start off with the baton and pistol, which is well
      and good.  Then you get the Tec 9, which sits in slot 3 but uses pistol ammo.  Then
      you find the m4...which replaces the Tec 9 for some reason.  There''s no real
      rhyme or reason as to which guns go where.  Nor is there any to the various
      accessory loadouts you find on guns.


      Level layout doesn''t know what it wants to be in a lot of cases.  There are
      lots of winding linear corridors for cinematic shooting.  Then you have large
      open areas, which kind of goes against the stealth angle routinely being pushed
      by the story.  The vehicle section feels entirely unnecessary.  The stealth
      sections feel forced given the gun play.


      The gun play is a real mixed bag at best.  The game forces you to aim down sights
      in order to hit anything.  The blur effect is blinding on a lot of guns.  Most
      enemies are painfully spongy and can eat ammo by the mag.  This makes ammo use
      and management a problem.  Reloads are painfully slow.  Ammo is surprisingly
      scarce.   Shooting enemies don''t actually drop as much ammo as it takes to
      kill them.


      The ending fight really soured the game for me.  It highlights a lot of what
      the game does wrong: poor feed back, gun play that''s a mushy mess, and arenas
      that don''t work for what they are intended to do.  Without this part, I could
      have just said "yeah, it''s a janky budget shooter," but I''m hesitant to recommend
      after that.'
