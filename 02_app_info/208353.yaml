    about_the_game: The Class 380 electric multiple unit is a great modern image British
      train, and runs on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/24065/" target="_blank"
      rel="noreferrer"  > Glasgow Airport Rail Link </a> route (also available for
      Train Simulator). <br><br><br>A total of 38 Class 380 sets were ordered for
      introduction on electrified routes in Scotland. The 38 units comprise a total
      of 130 vehicles forming a mixture of 3 and 4 car sets. This flexibility allows
      ScotRail (the operator) to run a variety of train lengths depending on the particular
      demands of the service. One of the most distinctive features of the Class 380
      is its dramatic front end style designed to conform to the latest safety standards.
      This gives the unit a swept back look like an express train. The ScotRail Class
      380 fleet is based at Glasgow Shields Road Train Maintenance Depot. The Class
      380 for Train Simulator is highly-detailed with accurate controls and a recreation
      of the correct ScotRail livery.<h2 class="bb_tag">Includes</h2>Class 380 electric
      multiple unit with Driving Motor Open Standard, Trailer Open Standard with and
      Class 380 Pantograph Trailer Open Standard with Lavatory &amp; Wheel Chair access.
