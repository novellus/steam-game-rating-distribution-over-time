    review: 'I wanted a game for the kids to roam about and the videos of the Deep
      Diving Simulator looked very nice. However, the game does not work for us. I
      reinstalled it, I even upgraded to Win10, but we cannot even get it to dive
      from the initial boat. The sound does not work and on exiting the game hangs
      on a screen with a caption in Polish.


      We got the non-VR version, because we have no goggles, and I was hoping the
      game could be controlled with the keyboard and mouse only.


      What''s going on here? What else should we do?


      Edit: After much head-scratching and digging I think I''ve found the probable
      reason why the game does not work - my configuration is i5-2500K @ 3.3GHz, 16GB
      RAM, 64bit Win10 and GeForce 460 SE with 1GB DDR5 (probably). It might be the
      1GB of memory. My NVIDIA Control Panel does not have the option to Run With
      Graphics Processor option.


      I guess I could have dealt with this in the discussions because the developer
      appears to be very responsive, but I think the game should give more clues that
      it will refuse to run on a configuration other than, well, just not running.
      That is the reason I''m keeping the ''not recommended'' rating.


      I''ll be keeping it in my library in case I can get it to run later, though,
      because I think the gameplay would be perfect for kids aged 8 and 5.'
