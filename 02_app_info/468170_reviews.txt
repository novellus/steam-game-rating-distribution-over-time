You can tell this is a passion project and it's their baby. And thank God! We've NEEDED this game to do the [cyberpunk] genre justice since VR's inception and to my opinion most all have missed the mark until Doll City. \n\nI've had this game since May 2020 and wanted to wait until I had some valuable time in it to see what the devs would do over time before I wrote a review. And HOLY F**KING 'ISH! Doll City is my VR drug! It's 100%! immersive, trippy, psychedelic, sexy. grimy, industrial, and addictive. Great aesthetic, music, and style. Gameplay needs a little twerking but has majorly improved since I first strapped on back in May. I hope the guys at GaelDK keep building this and move on to bigger and better cyberpunk projects for this is not only the foundation of something amazing, this game is the foundation of what Cyberpunk in VR is and should be. Thank you GaelDK and Infiniverse! If you ever need anyone to test any of your projects, I'm more than willing. A+ guys! Cheers! \n\nNeonyx","timestamp_created":1606992272,"timestamp_updated":1606992272,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwqIONlPYCcMD7tgI="}
