I really liked the Rogue Legacy songs and their 8-bit vibe. Basically, if you were fond of how the game sounds and/or like the sound of old-school platformers then this is a DLC for you. Not a bad deal full price but definitely a must-have on sale if you enjoy this type of music. \n\n[b]P.S.:[/b] Soundtrack can be found in \"..\\Steam\\steamapps\\music\\Rogue Legacy Soundtrack\". This DLC does not appear on the store page of the game, only [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229970/Rogue_Legacy_Soundtrack/]HERE[/url]. It also does NOT download when you install the game. You need to Download Album in the Soundtracks section of the library filter.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this DLC review you can find more in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]","timestamp_created":1581457839,"timestamp_updated":1581457839,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ufKOm/ACda7Y8QE="}
