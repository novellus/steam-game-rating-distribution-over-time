You only need 2 things, the P42DC and the Montana Hi-Line. So it's a simple scenario pack, the scenarios are good and in the freight scnearios you aren't time rushed. (You'd know if you see 1000 points on the area where you'd see your TS score) So it's a good scenario pack.","timestamp_created":1594600861,"timestamp_updated":1594600861,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41MXnovMCev/1lAI="}
