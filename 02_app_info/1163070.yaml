      /><br><br>Just as the world has finally begun to enter an era of peace, it is
      once again being threatened by Trizon, an evil organization hell-bent on conquering
      the world with its army of giant robots. To stop Trizon from realizing their
      evil goal, a protector has emerged in the form of RaiOhGar, a powerful super
      robot piloted by the courageous Kouta and his girlfriend Asuka. Combating the
      evil organization on all fronts, RaiOhGar thwarted Trizon's plans, again and
      again, forcing the organization into giving up more ground with each victory.
      Frustrated at their repeated defeat, Trizon retreats to the remote island of
      Okigashima and begins to take the town by force. To save the town from destruction,
      Kouta and Asuka swiftly follow Trizon there, and the latest battle between RaiOhGar
      and the evil organization is about to unfold in this remote island town.<br><br>However,
      this was all a ruse to lure our heroes into the traps set by Trizon...<br><br>*Includes
