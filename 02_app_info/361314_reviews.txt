The handle is pearl with gold inlays for the pommel, screws and tang, The blade itself is accented in what appears to be gold but is most likely polished brass to be used to deflect oncoming blows. I like to personally use this knife more than the others that I own. I think we're gonna need a bigger boat!","timestamp_created":1595053858,"timestamp_updated":1595053858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzcunsPMCcOqBlgI="}
