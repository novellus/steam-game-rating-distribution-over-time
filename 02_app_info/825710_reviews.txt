Soren is not even pretending to be decent as you can see. He even brazenly put \"Thanks for the feedback\" as the reason for the ban.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2127547497\n\nSo yeah, Steam is good but at least part of My.games is staffed by proud morons who treat their paying customers like dirt... sad to see a potentially good game in such hands.\n\nOld Review:\n\nIt's far too expensive IMHO so only buy it on sale. If you get it on sale, it's one of the best and most versatile vehicles in the game.","timestamp_created":1566057450,"timestamp_updated":1596934063,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497607648372650146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uYCs6PMCf7/E0AE="}
