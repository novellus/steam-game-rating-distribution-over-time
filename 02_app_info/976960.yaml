    review: 'What a nice match 3 game! :) Exactly what I needed.

      What I really like about the game is the relaxed mode, which you can switch
      on or off at any time. If you like a little bit of challenge - play the timed
      mode, if not - relaxed mode is really awesome.

      The levels are not too long (the longest ones took me maybe 3 minutes). 200
      levels of pure joy and the addition of "find the difference" or "hidden object"
      stages  made this game even better to me!

      The graphics are really nice and the music is just wonderful.

      The only tiny minus is the story...It is kinda weak (and yes...the main character
      does remind me of Lara Croft), but then again...many match 3 games don''t have
      any stories.

      I highly recommend Heart of Moon: The Mask of Seasons to anyone that likes to
      relax with a nice casual game.
