I still remember having a blast with the demo version of this game back on Gamejolt. Of course, this features loads more content, which only further improves the experience. More abilities, more characters, just a ton of fun all around. \nOverall, this game is a very good time with friends, and even shows some competence in single player. The team behind it is clearly great at what they do as much as they are passionate, and you'll get your money's worth whether the game's on sale or not. If you don't believe me, you can always try out the risk free demo for yourself.","timestamp_created":1596880406,"timestamp_updated":1596880406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw36jf5vMCc5eUmgI="}
