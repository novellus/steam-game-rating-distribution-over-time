I was very salty at the cliff hanger kinda ending with my romance, the game did promise romance but with the person I chose I felt like most of the \"romance\" was just edging me into a hopeful steamy scene only for it to be delayed and delayed only for it to never happen. I will probably do a second play through with another character and see if this is similar to the others. I still HIGHLY recommend both Wayhaven books, they are just too good to pass up even with my small gripe.","timestamp_created":1608714183,"timestamp_updated":1609616020,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwouql4vYCeOayvAI="}
