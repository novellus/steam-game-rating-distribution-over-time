I Found it was just to grindy to recommend. The best part about the game is the different types of knifes. I also thought the space station level was really fun. There is no achievements for unlocking the knifes or the locations. You just get 1 million nice slices. I would have had more motivation to play if the achievements were more fun. The only way I would recommend this game is for the achievements, and that was not great.","timestamp_created":1594472689,"timestamp_updated":1594472689,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41s3+nvMCdODHlAI="}
