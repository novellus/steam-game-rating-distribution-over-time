      Pinball : Ice Age</u></strong></h2><br>Background:<br>A lone survivor of an
      exploration craft that crash landed on a remote and desolate collection of passing
      meteors, that have entered the solar system, the home of man.<br><br>As a flight
      engineer, your mission is to retrieve the 3 coloured spheres and plant them
      into the right receptacles, somewhere on this frozen surface. We have no maps
      of the surface, so you will have to search for the spheres to begin your mission.
      Your flight suit will be sufficient for you to travel on the surface but it
      must not get wet! Stay away from any surface or underground fluids.<br><br>A
      previous expedition set up some rails to transport the spheres but have not
      been heard from for the past few years. If they are alive, make contact and
      complete the mission.<br><br>Care must be taken as the rails are designed for
      robots to navigate. Should you fall and get lost in the tangled nest of underground
      caves and gullies, you may not live to tell the tale.<br><br>Once all three
      spheres have been successfully recovered into their flight receptacles, a rescue
      beacon will be turned on and a rescue ship will be sent to recover the spheres
      and the escape portal energised. Good luck.<br><br><strong><u>Re Release:</u></strong>
