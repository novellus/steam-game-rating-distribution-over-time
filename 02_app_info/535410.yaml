    review: 'I really REALLY wanted to love this, but the final release is still little
      more than a tech demo.  Not that I expected a AAA RTS, and for the 1$ sale I
      got, its OK for an hr.  It looks like most of the positive reviews were from
      EA based on potential and the great progress the responsive dev was making.


      Pros:

      - tactical VR space fleet

      - decently crisp gfx and visually differentiated unit types

      - good unit variety with different weapon systems and purposes

      - campaign, skirmish w/ bots, multiplayer (if you can find someone else playing)

      - minimap


      Cons:

      - no plot at all

      - no objectives beyond kill or be killed

      - no actual RTS elements, looks like these were planned but dropped

      -- no resourcing, no mission to mission state, no research/upgrades/promotions,
      no unit building facilities, etc

      - in practice, it''s more tactical than strategic

      -- each mission starts with some credits to buy a small fleet with and you earn
      somewhat more credits during the mission

      -- each mission starts fresh with 2 fighter squads and mission specific amount
      of credits (no fleet progression or mission specific setups)

      -- "campaign" is 8 or 10 missions that introduce more ship types and larger
      battles

      -- finished "campaign" in half an hour, most the missions I just purchased a
      few units and watched without directing much

      - controls are clunky and should have been more gestured based (like Tethered)
      rather than button based and/or some sort of in game HUD

      -- selecting units (beyond 1 or all) was really hard

      -- no pause/slow (strikecraft are always moving)

      -- no ability to select by unit type (anti-strikecraft, anti-frigate/cap)

      - no stats listed for the ship types'
