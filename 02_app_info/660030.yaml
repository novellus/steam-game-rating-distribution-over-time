    review: Probably the best one so far sequentially in the series.  The colors are
      better and some of the pictures are much more interesting.  However, I still
      counted maybe 3 out of 100 where the last couple of tiles could go two ways,
      and you had to use the picture and guess, rather than using logic for certainty.  Still,
      that's pretty minimal.
