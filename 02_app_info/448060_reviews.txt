It's honestly a shock as to how much more awful it runs compared to the screenshots. It chugs like crazy, and the writing and voice acting, what little there was of each, was insanely bad. This was Unreal Engine 4!\n\nStory? Lol, what story?\nAny level of quality in gameplay? I wish.\nDid I enjoy this? How do I say this in Spanish? NO.\n\nDon't let your wallet become victim - spend your money and time elsewhere.","timestamp_created":1593824146,"timestamp_updated":1593824146,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwpc7Ui/MCfbLNkgI="}
