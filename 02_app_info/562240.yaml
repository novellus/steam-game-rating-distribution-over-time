    review: "Game Guru is the one engine I have a sick fascination with. Most developers\
      \ use this engine to crap out absolutely atrocious games to sell them on any\
      \ storefront they can and this game is no exception. \n\nStory:\n\nIn The Spirit\
      \ Underneath you play as an unnamed man who awakens in a mysterious graveyard\
      \ , with no idea who he is and how he got there, as you try to piece together\
      \ the story and escape hell. \n\nIf you played My Bones, the story is almost\
      \ an identical rip off, like I mean even the plot twist is the same. It's absolutely\
      \ terrible and when you read the first note you already can easily guess how\
      \ the story plays out. Even the ending of the game has an identical choose how\
      \ you want to proceed with the story. Literally no effort put into the game.\n\
      \nGraphics:\n\nLike most Game Guru games the game is filled to the brim with\
      \ a bunch of asset flipped locations and items. You remember My Bones, the game\
      \ I mentioned at the start of the review. Well these two games look identical,\
      \ the first location is literally a fiery red graveyard that looks abysmal.\
      \ \n\nThere is a few moments where character models appear and they seem completely\
      \ out of place and it honestly makes me laugh. There's on part in the game where\
      \ you encounter killer bunnies that look like Robbie from Silent Hill 3. \n\n\
      Audio:\n\nThe audio like most of the textures is all stock. The music is constantly\
      \ looping and absolute pain to listen to, The stock effects like a scary noise\
      \ happening when you get too close to a certain object sounds like it was pulled\
      \ straight out of a 3 AM video. \n\nGameplay:\n\nThe Spirit Underneath is basically\
      \ a walking simulator where you hunt keys and unlock doors until you finish\
      \ the game. It's really boring and not to mention at first you think there is\
      \ going to be threats going after you because you have a HUD that displays your\
      \ health and lives and you simply can't die in the game. \n\nJust like My Bones\
      \ this game is also insanely short. A single run will take you less than 10\
      \ minutes and there is another ending in the game for you to check out, but\
      \ even then these endings are joke endings that make literally no sense. \n\n\
      Verdict:\n\nThe Spirit Underneath is absolutely atrocious. It's not scary, really\
      \ boring and not to mention absolutely horrendous. When I played My Bones I\
      \ thought that was the bottom of the barrel, but The Spirit Underneath managed\
      \ to dug past the trash and crawl even further down the same barrel. It's an\
      \ atrocious game that is not worth a single cent from you.\n\nFinal Rating:\n\
      1/10\n\nPros:\nN/A\n\nCons:\n- Asset flip \n- Stock music makes you laugh rather\
      \ than scaring you\n- Pretty much a direct rip off of My Bones \n- Really short\n\
