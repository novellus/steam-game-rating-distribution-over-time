It is telling me I need some gibberish I don't understand. If this (gibberish) is software, why isn't it included with the game?\n\nIf it is hardware, why isn't it listed as a requirement on the store page?\n\n(I have: Reverb G2, 3090, 10900k 64gb ram)\n\nEdit: googled the gibberish, downloaded it from microsoft store (cost me £1), restarted, ran the game. Still doesn't work. Refunded. Can't refund the £1 from microsoft though.","timestamp_created":1608111334,"timestamp_updated":1608111334,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwp/S5tfYCe4/UugI="}
