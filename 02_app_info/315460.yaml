    short_description: Crash land on a hostile planet where you'll have to build the
      strongest defenses if you wish to live to escape from it. But be warned... this
      planet is merciless. Build strong, and smart; else physics may flood or destroy
      your only hopes of survival.

    review: "Dig or dig and that is what this game should do just die! 9/16/20It\u2019\
      s unrealistic and unbalanced game play is mostly what this game is about!You\
      \ would think after being out so long they would have seen this issue even when\
      \ told, but what does it matter our opinion is just another customer that already\
      \ paid for the game.  I posted this way back of how the bugs are so unrealistic\
      \ in how much damage they do and the items are who knows where most of the time.\
      \  After many hours of look at dam You Tube and finding that items I so far\
      \ up in the air it is just for another stupid item.   Also the lava is like\
      \ the stupid water but even worse it burn so much of the land if this was even\
      \ remotely real the world as for this plant would be destroyed in a shot period\
