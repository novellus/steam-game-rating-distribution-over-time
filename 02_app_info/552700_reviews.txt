It's unique, colorful, and fun with turn-based combat. You get to meet characters from previous Final Fantasy games (in adorable chibi forms known as Lilikins) as well as find many major references to past games as well. You'll also visit familiar locales and dungeons, such as the train graveyard from Final Fantasy VII. Overall a good game for Final Fantasy fans.","timestamp_created":1610055884,"timestamp_updated":1610055884,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzuOz7/YCcaCxwQI="}
