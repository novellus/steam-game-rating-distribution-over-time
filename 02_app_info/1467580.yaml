    developer_response: 'Hello!


      You can get help while you are playing. Press the H key to show or hide the
      corresponding actions and keys that are currently available.

      You must be in build mode to open the parts set. By pressing the R key (by default)
      you can toggle between construction mode or exploration mode.

      In construction mode you can open the set of parts with TAB key (by default).


      I hope my answer has helped you.'
