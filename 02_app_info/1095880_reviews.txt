Guess nobody wants to admit they overpaid for what amounts to a handful of H CGs. I have no shame, however, and so I've come to tell you that there is not actually \"plenty to do and see even in just one day.\"\n\nThe content in this is swift. If you were expecting the typical extra-story content you might find in a traditional otoge, where a cute little story happens and you find out more about the character or something, don't bother with this. You start the day, pick up your man from the guild, go to a dungeon, maybe he says something or if you're lucky there's a CG, go back home, go to sleep, get laid with an additional two or three CGs, then fade to credits. You can get through all three guys in less than thirty minutes, which might be all you end up doing if you're like me and don't care for buttman Brian or the, ugh, sounding guy.\n\nIgnoring the sparse content, there are some other problems. The CGs are censored. Well, okay, one CG is censored, because the rest of the time you don't see anything at all (yes, the CGs are barely explicit.) Similar to the first game, there's no gallery mode so I can't even double-check my claim. The sound levels on the audio are all over the place, with Sam incredibly loud and Will incredibly quiet. There are also typesetting issues with missing spaces or extra spaces in what little dialogue it has (the translation is OK but localised weirdly in some places.) The price of this is also more than the original game (either version), even on sale!\n\nAll that aside, why am I not marking this as not-recommended? Because this was published by the developers themselves and not sekai/denpasoft. I still remember their failed indiegogo for the original game's translation, and in general I'd like to support them because we don't have enough ero otoge in English, much less otoge with ojisans. If you're not feeling as benevolent, you're not missing anything by skipping this.","timestamp_created":1606762155,"timestamp_updated":1606762155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.584905624389648438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v5mfjfYCcZ7/tQI="}
