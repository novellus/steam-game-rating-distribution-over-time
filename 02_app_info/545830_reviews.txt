It also doesn't queue up or let you \"turn in\" two of the same with a single click to the location. For example, you have the character take two customer orders then click to turn them in. It only turns in 1 of the two and won't permit a second click until the first event happens. Not worth the aggravation.","timestamp_created":1600360738,"timestamp_updated":1600360738,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzd27zvQCdNqzogI="}
