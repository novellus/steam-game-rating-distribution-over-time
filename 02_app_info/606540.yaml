    review: 'Joker Game is an espionage thriller set in World War II from the perspective
      of the fictitious Imperial Japanese intelligence network D Agency. The format
      is more of a series of side stories than a single narrative, jumping from different
      agents within the agency between each story with Colonel Yuki, the head of D
      Agency, being a recurring figure.


      The espionage stories explores D Agency''s method of operations in various precarious
      situations, ranging from operating undercover in hostile territory to the death
      of a fellow agent on the job, which are probably the most gripping part of this
      series. The fact that the cast changes between stories made it difficult to
      remember names other than Yuki''s, which greatly affected my ability to care
      about the protagonists themselves. There were a few D agents who exhibited interesting
      personalities, my favorite being the agent from the Asia Express episode, but
      most characters are simply forgettable.


      This is one of those series that it is difficult to straight up recommend. It''s
      enjoyable if you are in it for some espionage stories, but don''t expect a whole
      lot of depth.'
