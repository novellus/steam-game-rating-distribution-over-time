There are several different variant possible though the various choices and ending. And the notes and map that show the information you've acquired through the timelines are a nice touch.\n\nHowever there is a bit of a downside in the choice of game engine. Not so much a bug as what it doesn't have compared to other visual novels. Basically you have to click a button to advance the dialogue every time. You can't skip things you've seen before, and you can't go backwards without jumping all the way to a specific map checkpoint.\n\nIt's not bad exactly. You can click the button very quickly if you know it's old information. But that also makes it possible to miss the occasional new bit of dialogue that pops up as you gather more timelines.\n\nOn the whole though I would say that isn't enough to keep me from recommending it to any other fan of time loop games. Though perhaps not people who are new to visual novels.","timestamp_created":1577862903,"timestamp_updated":1577862903,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559032738208770752","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zab9r+8CfInt6AE="}
