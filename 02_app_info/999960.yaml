    review: 'It fascinates me to see that simplicity is not at odds with pure fun.

      This game treasures both things, it''s simple at the same time at the graphic
      level, with a style that reminds us of the old Spectrum computer games, even
      from the time of the Atari console, but then it has a gameplay that reminds
      us a lot of what we lived in the 8-bit era of the Nintendo NES where great horizontal
      scroll action games reigned. It''s a minimalist reinvention of the classic Rolling
      Thunder, one of my favourite arcade games.

      That''s why I''m pleased to be able to help its creator financially by buying
      the paid version.

      Keep it up, because I think you have a lot of future as a game designer.
