    review: I honestly like the game, but I wouldn't recommend it just because how
      short it is. I have to say that I was excited to try this game out when I played
      the demo, but I feel like the game went the complete opposite direction. It
      felt strange to me that I enjoyed the Demo more than the full game. I'm a fan
      of this kind of art style, but it felt like it was cut way too short. Boom,
      you get transported into the game. Have a chat with some people and *BAM* the
      Final Boss wants to fight you and you one shot her. I'm not trying to be harsh,
      but I see why Steam offered the bundle. That game by itself wasn't really worth
      it. Also, I felt like the story was going somewhere but it ended all too sudden.
      Anyways, even though I may not recommend it, that doesn't mean you don't have
      to get it. I was honestly hoping there to be more, or at least a secret input
      or some sort of Easter Egg.
