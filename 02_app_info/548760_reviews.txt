I still love this progrem.  Its not my go to to finish a photo, but to have some great presets for filters, its phenomenal to get some extra versions of a picture.  \n\n***UPDATE:\nI used to love this program to get some filters and extra edits..  It had some great fine tuning tools, but it constantly crashes and is unusable.  I'm really disappointed, used to be great.\n\n****Orinigal review:\nI got CB Photo on an 80% discount because I had CB2.  So far, a nice UI improvement and alot of control over your editing.  Will this replace photoshop, paintshop pro, affinity, or others.  No.  How I use this program:\n\nI edit my photos and touch them up with PSP or Affinity and get them to a nice \"traditional\" look for my clients.  I will then take the final edits and open them into CB Photo.  I then add extra filters, adjustments, and colors to give it a more \"creative and artsy\" feel.  The process is really quick and effective.\n\nThis program does have a lot of cool features about it.  It doens't do everything, but what it does do, it does great.  It has a lot of filters with previews.  I really like the fact that everything that can be edited can be done so with exactness.  There are sliders and scales for all the adjustments and edits so you can fine tune your photo to your hearts desire.  \n\nAs I said before, it does a great job getting some extra filters and adjustment to my photos.  Ive seen in some review that people have had trouble opening their files, but I have had 0 issues.  I have all my photos in JPG and RAW format.  I've never had an issue.","timestamp_created":1481097710,"timestamp_updated":1603543895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vcGqrfUCeK7Zaw=="}
