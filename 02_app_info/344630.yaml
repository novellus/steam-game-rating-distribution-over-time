    reviews: "\u201CPrincess Evangile is exactly what the world of all ages visual\
      \ novels. needs. It tells a fantastic story with deep, rich characters. It keeps\
      \ its themes mature while keeping a balancing act between suspense and comedy.\
      \ And above all, it\u2019s a story worth reading. Hopefully this will be a title\

      \ Evangile is a fantastic game and I\u2019m disappointed that I didn\u2019t\
      \ play it in 2015 when it first came out. Eroge like this, let alone games like\
      \ this, aren\u2019t all that common these days it seems. [...] What Princess\
      \ Evangile did for me, was actually make me pause and think. [...] Unless you\
      \ really just don\u2019t like romance stories, I can\u2019t think of why you\
      \ wouldn\u2019t want to own this one.\u201D<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://operationrainfall.com/2017/08/04/18-eroge-review-princess-evangile/\"\

    review: "Wow, what a great game! \nAnd a long one too! \nI've played countless\
      \ \"visual novel\" games, but this is now my favorite.\nI must admit, now i\
      \ kinda feel bad for buying it on sale, instead of full price.\nThe story was\
      \ very well written, with nice twists and turns. Same goes for the character\
      \ development."
