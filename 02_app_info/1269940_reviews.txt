Movement is slow, AI is stupid, you have to guide survivors back instead of just walking into them like in Zombies Ate My Neighbors, you can't push by them if they block you in a tight space during the journey, if you have to carry someone back the zombies will walk 3x faster than you and it's impossible to avoid being injured... frame rate is terrible, voice acting is atrocious, dialogue is cringey, I got to the second level then it glitched out where I got stuck on the side of the bus and couldn't move when I tried to bring a cat back to the bus to rescue, couldn't undo the glitch so I just quit. I'm uninstalling and requesting a refund.","timestamp_created":1606780302,"timestamp_updated":1606780302,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwq7bkjfYCdLmQtgI="}
