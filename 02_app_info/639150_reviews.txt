Let's get this out of the way however. Like the previous installments in this game, the game spends its majority of your playthrough trying to scare you with 1 thing and 1 thing only; Jumpscares. While this game puts in some background music to try and boost the atmosphere, it doesn't work as seconds later you're bombarded with jumpscares. The game does have a considerably more interesting concept than its base game. However, it doesn't take long to realize the 'choose your unique response' isn't under your control at all, which was the only thing the game seemed to try and do different from the others. It fails to scare with lazy jumpscares and an even lazier ending, including the use of recycled resources from previous installments. The game is simply not a horror game when it comes down to it. Like its base game, it can be acurately described as: Jumpscare Simulator. The developer certainly needs to learn that the use of constant jumpscares DOES NOT WORK THE 6TH TIME AROUND, IT DIDN'T WORK THE 5TH TIME, TIME TO CHANGE IT UP. This game is not worth your money at all, especially considering you have to buy the terrible base game to play it.\n\nEdit: If you're wondering how I'm reviewing this with 0 hours of play. The game adds your hours of play from the DLC, to your hours of play for the base game","timestamp_created":1538447934,"timestamp_updated":1538448020,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJworqpmeYCeYztqwE="}
