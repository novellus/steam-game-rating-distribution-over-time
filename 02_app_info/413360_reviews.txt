It's a competent mission. Plot left much to be desired there was room for so many reveals and secrets yet you only learn one or two bits of information about entities that only show up in mankind divided. There was so much room to refer to the original games yet at every opportunity nothing was there. It was a huge letdown in story. Almost no major plot choices and almost no flexibility in the mission itself. Best part was the thermal sensing robots at a certain point. Made stealth different, stand in the right place and they won't see you a few feet away. Stand in the wrong spot they'll see you through walls.\n\nWorth no more than $5.","timestamp_created":1609603257,"timestamp_updated":1609603257,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qpL14fYCcZTivwI="}
