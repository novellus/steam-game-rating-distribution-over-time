    review: "I am a [i]huge[/i] fan of these kinds of old school adventure games,\
      \ so when I came across this game I was excited to play it. Unfortunately, I\
      \ encountered several bugs that make the game unplayable and my post in the\
      \ forums about it went unanswered, which is why I can't recommend this game\
      \ for anyone.\n\nThe specific bugs I had to deal with are listed below, although\
      \ I should note that I'm running Windows 10 on dual monitors, one 4K and one\
      \ 1080p.\n\n[list][*] [b]Saves won't actually save:[/b] I've typed in the save\
      \ name, pressed \"Save\" but then nothing shows up, so I'm unable to save/load.\n\
      \n[*][b]Windowed mode doesn't work:[/b] When playing in windowed mode, the game\
      \ loads up but fails to recognize my mouse. I can't click on anything and the\
      \ in-game mouse cursor doesn't work at all.\n\n[*][b]Fullscreen mode resizes\
      \ my windows:[/b] I can play the game in fullscreen mode, but when I quit it\
      \ momentarily disables my second monitor, changes the screen resolution on my\
      \ main monitor, and consequently resizes all of my windows (Steam, Chrome, Discord,\
      \ etc etc). \n[/list]\n\nAt this point I don't think the devs are pushing any\
      \ more fixes for the game, which is a shame because I really wanted to be able\
      \ to play it. If they ever do push a patch that enables me to actually play,\
      \ I'll come back and change my review."
