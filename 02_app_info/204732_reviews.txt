It's a character in, a game with many characters and a max party size of 3. He's pretty good but he's certainly not a game changer. In the end you're paying almost four dollars to get a medic class that comes with his level cap unlocked. That's certainly helpful but by no means worth the cost. If you're a diehard Krater player and want a little variety or need a little something more in your medic slot then wait for a sale and pick him up on the cheap.","timestamp_created":1439908945,"timestamp_updated":1439908945,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.609092652797698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xtvQoM8CeqyRQw=="}
