    review: Meh...   Half interesting concept, but I don't get it.  Got through a
      couple levels, all they tell you is you can click on black objects.  3rd level
      I have a piano, street signs, rope (hose?) and a truck.  The guy never goes
      in front of the car which is the only thing I can seem to move.  Somehow the
      piano moved to the back of the truck, not sure how that happened, but can't
      seem to do anything.
