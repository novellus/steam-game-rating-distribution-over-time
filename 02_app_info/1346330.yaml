    reviews: "\u201CThe pixels are colourful, the action is smooth, but this isn't\
      \ the sort of title that's going to push the hardware. That doesn't matter at\
      \ all, of course, as the core gameplay is fun and challenging enough to justify\
      \ itself a place in the library.\u201D<br>NA \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.thedreamcastjunkyard.co.uk/2020/11/flea-brand-new-release-for-dreamcast.html\"\

      Flea is a stunningly good independent game with a unique mechanic that is bound\
      \ to make the retrogamer in us all smile and laugh our heads off whilst keeping\
      \ the difficulty curve to make this game good for speed running. In my opinion,\
      \ this game is good and addictive enough to be the next Super Meat Boy, and\
      \ is also family friendly enough that both the dad and the kids in the family\
      \ will want to play it. Also, it\u2019s been the most fun I\u2019ve had in reviewing\
      \ a game for ages.\u201D<br>NA \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://xblgamerhub.com/flea-the-review/?fbclid=IwAR1BhcKXMIuD-WCg-_ef3od_r5mLmeFV1LO-PSoQeNXZPt_BrBQxQCpe2LQ\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GamerHub</a><br><br>\u201CIn short, Flea!\
      \ is a great example that many systems that some believe are obsolete have a\
      \ lot to give, since in this case it has been possible to adapt a genre that\
      \ is very dynamic and demanding such as precision platforms in a very well achieved\
      \ and polished way, resulting in a very pleasant experience that leaves a good\
      \ taste in the mouth.\u201D<br>NA \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://retroorama.blogspot.com/2020/11/indie-review-flea.html\"\
