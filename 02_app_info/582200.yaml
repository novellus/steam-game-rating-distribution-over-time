    about_the_game: '&quot;The Physiology of the Eye&quot; is an interactive VR platform,
      that features two modes. It starts in a real-time automatic training mode that
      guides you through our visual content. Then, at any time in the application,
      the user can push the &quot;Mode&quot; button on the VR controller and switch
      to our interactive training mode. This allows the user to choose which areas
      they need to focus on and learn at their own pace. This includes a new labeling
      system which allows you to expand each label to find out more about the exact
      3D piece you have selected and to get an in-depth understanding of each structure.
      <br><br>These new labels also have audio clips attached to them so you can hear
      exactly how to pronounce the various parts of the model. Even in Chinese. This
      application also includes an assessment system to judge your learning comprehension
      with our interactive testing system. It will also provide you with a final GPA
      at the end of the course.<h2 class="bb_tag">Quotes:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li><i>&quot;...facilitates

    review: The company who made this create bespoke programs for teaching. Quality
      of images are amazing and it fits in nicely with a university teaching framework.
      I persoanlly see this as a major contributor to teaching and engaging students
      as well as of general interest to those curious about how human anatomy works.
      Would to love to see more from Intervoke.
