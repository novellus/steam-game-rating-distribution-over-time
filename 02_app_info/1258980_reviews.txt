Since I have this game I am playing it with a friend of mine. We are speaking on Discord while dueling and we can’t stop laughing and yelling at each other. SpellPunk is super fun and is one of those games that are easy to learn but hard to master. Since my first hour in the game I am pretty confident that I can draw all of the spells. Drawing spells is super intuitive as you are making it with your hands and there is no need to smash some unnecessary buttons. I also enjoy the music and think that it corresponds great with Spellpunk’s visuals","timestamp_created":1604926776,"timestamp_updated":1604926776,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwrOTF1vUCdMOrrQI="}
