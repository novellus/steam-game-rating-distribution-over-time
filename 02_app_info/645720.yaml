      /><br><br><strong>Once upon a spacetime there was a young knight who went on
      a brave adventure...</strong><br><br>As your Royal father''s last hope, battle,
      loot and upgrade your way through the galaxy. Engage space-knights in challenging
      close combat, explore a storybook-like retrofuturistic universe and save the
      kingdom from the dreadful Void Lords who stole the Sun.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Top-down, tactical physics-based action combat with
      stylish real-time-lit pixel art visuals</strong><br></li><li><strong>Artistic
      vision of the Middle Ages infused with futuristic elements, as medieval knights
      clash in armored spaceships</strong><br></li><li><strong>Deep and atmospheric

      this artistic mashup of the <strong>Middle Ages</strong>, <strong>folktales
      </strong>and <strong>outer space</strong>, you take on a hero''s journey as
      the King''s youngest child. You explore the furthest corners of the galaxy in
      your trusty spacecraft and engage other space-faring knights and creatures in
      battle using a unique, techno-fantasy themed skillset.<h2 class="bb_tag">Adventure</h2><br>Explore
      a randomly generated universe of hidden secrets and grave dangers by traveling
      on a galactic starmap, where each place yields a new encounter. Plan your exploration
      well and be mindful of your choices. Resources and friends are scarce in Fabular''s
      deep space, and they can make or break your adventure. The adventure part of
      the game is influenced by modern day rogue-likes such as FTL: Faster than Light
      and Hand of Fate.<h2 class="bb_tag">Battle</h2><br>Control your spacecraft directly
      from a top-down view, and use the skills and equipment of your spaceship tactically
      to overcome the enemy. The combat system is deep and challenging with large
      ''build'' variety. The battle part is inspired by the Star Control series and
      Dark Souls.<h2 class="bb_tag">Manage</h2><br>The outcome of battles depend largely
      on the condition and equipment of your ship. There is only so far your action
      skills can take you, if you are not equipped for the situation, you will likely
      perish. After each battle you get some form of loot (currency, resources or
      items) which can be used to upgrade your ship, trade at shops or enhance your
      battle gear. The management portion of the game draws inspiration from such
      classic Action-RPGs as Diablo and Path of Exile.'
