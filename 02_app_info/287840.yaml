    review: "Hoo boy... alright so I feel like I need to address this game.\n\nAs\
      \ a long-time fan of the series who has played nearly every incarnation of the\
      \ game, from the very first Ty on the Playstation 2, to the sequels on the GameCube,\
      \ to the remakes on Steam, even to the GBA ports (yes, there were GBA ports,\
      \ and they played very similar to this game), with the only game skipped being\
      \ that one mobile spinoff I can't remember for the life of me, I feel like I\
      \ have a pretty good perspective on this game. And, well...\n\nMy initial thought\
      \ is that it's painfully obvious how low-budget this game was. It's pretty clear\
      \ to me that Krome Studios was probably in a pretty low place when they made\
      \ Ty 4, and it shows. I don't think Krome was [i]trying[/i] to put out a low-quality\
      \ game, they just didn't have the resources for something more ambitious. Blade\
      \ Kitten didn't get as much as attention as Krome would've liked, I'm sure,\
      \ and that one mobile game... I'm probably the only person here who's even heard\
      \ of it. I'm amazed Krome even stayed afloat long enough to port the Ty games\
      \ to Steam, though I'm glad they did. But Krome definitely wasn't ready to try\
      \ to tackle a sequel. \n\n\n\nLet me at least get the positives out of the way.\
      \ \n\nThe soundtrack is as wonderful and unique as ever, at least in my opinion.\
      \ I always love the feel of Ty's music, the instrument choices, the motifs,\
      \ it's always a delight. Even here, I still feel like they did a good job. \n\
      \nThe art is pretty to look at, character designs are as interesting and unique\
      \ as usual. You can actually pick from multiple characters and outfits if you're\
      \ willing to buy them, which is a nice touch even if they don't do anything\
      \ different. The way the designs mimic the concept art is actually pretty neat.\
      \ But I have more to say about the art overall. \n\nThe level design is... usually\
      \ pretty solid, at least as far as I've gotten. It still feels like there's\
      \ a lot of secrets to dig up, even despite the restricted 2D environment. I'd\
      \ argue it might've even done this better than the GBA games, though to be fair\
      \ my memory of the GBA ports is shaky as it's been probably a decade or so.\n\
      \n\n\nOn to the negatives, of which there's quite a few, sadly. \n\nThe rest\
      \ of the sound design, other than music, is rough. A lot of it feels... jarring?\
      \ I don't know how to express it exactly. One notable one though is the outhouse\
      \ sound effect, which often sounds like it's... clipping? I think that's the\
      \ word for it, but I'm not a sound design expert. \n\nWhile the art itself is\
      \ nice, the actual [i]animation[/i] looks very cheap, like a bad After Effects\
      \ puppet. Movement is stiff and sluggish, expressions are exaggerated weirdly.\
      \ It all looks very fake, like you can tell it's individual static images being\
      \ moved around. It can also be hard to separate foreground and background at\
      \ times. \n\nWhen the level design is bad, it can be really bad. I think one\
      \ good example is an invulnerable crab that you can't attack normally being\
      \ right in front of a flamethrower so that you get punished for jumping over\
      \ something you can't kill normally, and you can't hit the flamethrower guy\
      \ either because the crab is in the way. There [i]is[/i] a way to kill the crab,\
      \ but that's another issue I'll go into in a bit. There's also several platforms\
      \ that you're supposed to be able to reach, but are juuuuust far enough away\
      \ that you need to pretty much do a pixel perfect jump to reach, but also have\
      \ a massive pit below so that if you screw it up you have to go all the way\
      \ through half the level to reach it again.\n\nThe writing is very... bland.\
      \ The interactions between characters were probably the biggest selling point\
      \ to me in Ty 1-3. I loved the cheesy dialogue Ty had with the others. I feel\
      \ like it's a lot more bland here. Mostly just telling you what you need to\
      \ do, and that's it. Maybe it gets better later, but I can't really get through\
      \ more than the first hour or two of the game due to its various problems to\
      \ tell if the story overall is any good. \n\nThe gameplay. Well, it's pretty\
      \ much standard fare for 2D Ty, but even though it's been a while, I still feel\
      \ like the GBA games had a better feel. Switching rangs is obnoxious, as you\
      \ can't scroll wheel through rangs. You have to press a key to bring up the\
      \ menu, then key through them, THEN click the one you have selected. Even the\
      \ radial menu in the 3D games feels better with keyboard and mouse than this.\
      \ The midair controls are very sloppy. You have to constantly flip left and\
      \ right if you want to just fall straight down. There's no deceleration when\
      \ you release or switch directional keys, it just keeps or instantly switches\
      \ your direction and momentum, making precise jumps a pain in the rear. Gliding\
      \ is also a lot more of a pain as you tend to start dropping quickly. Oddly\
      \ enough, your glide even works when you're short a rang or two, which is incredibly\
      \ weird considering Ty always used the rangs to glide, so now it just looks\
      \ like he sorta floats for no real reason. Speaking of floating, falling in\
      \ this game is really slow. There's no weight to Ty when he impacts the ground\
      \ and makes fall damage hard to believe, plus it's just annoying. Movement in\
      \ general feels slow, in fact, and coupled with the sluggish animations, it\
      \ makes the whole game just feel really slow and not fluid at all. The game\
      \ also gives you a power attack that briefly slows down time (too much, again\
      \ making the game feel sluggish) and lets you aim even in midair, but there's\
      \ a problem... for some reason, it costs money to use. While it's not an extreme\
      \ amount, it still chips away at your cash, and enemies killed with it rarely,\
      \ if ever, give back enough to compensate. It can definitely chip away at your\
      \ funds in levels with a lot of sturdier enemies. It also doesn't really make\
      \ for a very strategic limitation. As long as you do have the cash, you can\
      \ spam it all day if you really wanted to, though honestly the start-up time\
      \ should be restriction enough, but if they had to add one, just use a cooldown.\n\
      \n\nOverall, I find Ty 4 just too rough to recommend, unless you just want to\
      \ support the developers, which I can understand. Still, I'd only recommend\
      \ for that reason, and not to actually play. For that reason, I know Krome Studios\
      \ wants to move on from Ty 4, but if they make another 3D game, they should\
      \ really consider remaking Ty 4 from scratch in 3D so that people don't get\
      \ utterly confused when they see Fluffy show up again, or alternatively ditch\
      \ Ty 4 entirely and have the next game retcon it. Considering only perhaps a\
      \ few hundred people have played Ty 4, a large majority of the audience would\
      \ just end up confused otherwise. Heck, the FAQ has even asked several times\
      \ when Ty 4 is coming out, if there's plans for it, etc, with the devs having\
      \ to explain that Ty 4 already exists. Ty 4 was a complete and utter market\
      \ failure, and trying to continue off of it just feels like setting oneself\
      \ up for failure. Reworking it from scratch in 3D both in terms of writing and\
      \ gameplay, or making an entirely new Ty game that retcons it, after the attention\
      \ from the remastered ports, seems like a much more viable option right now.\
      \ But there is definitely reason that this 2D Ty 4 game did not sell well, and\
      \ I just cannot recommend playing it."
