      \ weaponry, from the humble but effective shotgun all the way up to the devastating\
      \ plasma cannon and the blazing-hot flamethrower. You\u2019ll also gain access\

      \ and a ton of grenades and mines.<br><br>Killing a single bug is easy. You\
      \ might even be able to taken down a hundred of them. But to withstand thousands\
      \ upon thousands you need to understand their strengths and weaknesses, adapt\
      \ your equipment and weaponry to hit them in their weak spots and co-operate\
      \ with your squad to maintain an effective perimeter - if they\u2019re still\

      I bought this and had 6 minutes of game play before being unable to play again.
      Couldn''t get a refund for the game either. Their other game is "MIGHT" and
      had an identical fate in which game access was entirely removed.'
