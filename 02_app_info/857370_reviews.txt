Given the number of times the game flat-out broke, and that there has not been a material update in 2 years (I suspect the dev has ceased working on this title), this game should be put on perma-sale at $0.99. Only then could I say you were getting your money's worth.","timestamp_created":1601534189,"timestamp_updated":1601534189,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43Iu48fQCetiTpQI="}
