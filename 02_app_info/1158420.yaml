      the gameplay you want complete with full 3D graphics, rich animation, immersive
      audio, and a soundtrack that will have you hooked. SimCasino truly gives you
      the full experience:  <br><strong>Graphics. Gameplay.   AND Full Soundtrack,
      from world-renowned composer Jerry Martin!</strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Fast-Paced
      &amp; Easy to Learn</h2>We aren''t in the 90s anymore;  we''re in the era of
      instant gratification and SimCasino aims to give you plenty of that.  You have
      full control, and you have it now; construction is rapid, inventory is easy
      to manage, and the controls &amp; mechanics feel so familiar that you''ll be
      building mega casino/hotels your very first day.<h2 class="bb_tag">You are the
      Casino.  Does the House Always Win?</h2>The saying is that &quot;The house always
      wins&quot; -- but is that actually true?  Thieves, cheaters, and criminals can
      tilt the odds against you and while you can set the odds, you need to make sure
      that the customers are getting some entertainment value if you want them to
      be repeat customers.  You will want to incentivize customers to join your VIP
      Player''s Club so that you can track them, and reward them with &quot;comps&quot;
      to keep the money machines printing!<h2 class="bb_tag">Get Creative - Customize
      &amp; Design <i>Every Aspect</i></h2>This isn''t a one size fits all kind of
      game.  There''s virtually no limit to your ability to be creative.  Build luxury
      hotels or cheap no-frills casinos. Choose every finish, from the walls &amp;
      flooring styles, the lighting, the counter-top &amp; bar-top materials, even
      the restroom stalls.  You are the architect, the designer, the operations specialist,
      and ultimately <strong>you own the casino!</strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Dynamic
      &amp; Event-Driven Gameplay Experience</h2>Incredibly dynamic &amp; extremely
      event-driven gameplay where you''ll experience many emergent behaviors from
      customers &amp; the patrons of your gaming establishment.  This provides tons
      of opportunity to have fun in SimCasino, regardless of your play-style:   you
      may prefer to focus on the design aspects, or perhaps you''re focused on creating
      an ultra-high efficiency resort, or if you want to be purely profit-driven and
      truly challenged then the criminals, cheaters, and petty thieves are always
      looking for an edge.  <br><strong>No matter your play style, SimCasino is ALL-IN
      &amp; you are covered!</strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Deep Gameplay</h2>While SimCasino
      is extremely easy to learn &amp; you''ll rapidly be building Bellagio-class
      resorts, that doesn''t mean that it lacks depth.  On the contrary, your gameplay
      experience is tailored to you;  you can go as deep (or as shallow) as you''d
      like!    If you want to manage every last chip in the casino''s vault, micro-manage
      the games &amp; odds on slot machines, keep tabs on every deck of cards, or
      even design the ultimate high-efficiency staff schedule &amp; security patrol
      scheme -- you can do all of that, and a lot more.'
