It follows the usual format. Has lots of hidden object scenes. Due to the age of the game, these are all just word lists. It has good mini-games that are not the same ones used over and over in the newer games. Decent story for this type of game.\n\nKeep in mind that it is a very old game. It does not have a map, but for the most part, I didn't miss it due to how the game proceeds. It either didn't have a Hint button during main game or it was useless (I can't remember). However, it has a strategy guide, which was good enough for me the couple of times I got stuck.\n\nI purchased the bundle of this series. This is the third game I've played. (I've played them out of order.) So far, they are all above-average HOGs.","timestamp_created":1599257860,"timestamp_updated":1599257860,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+srMrfQCcL7pnwI="}
