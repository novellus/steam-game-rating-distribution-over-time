Too bad most of the game is excruciatingly cryptic. And not in the NES way where you could figure most things out with in-game hints. In Owlia, many of the puzzles are just guess work. Many puzzles require bombs and whatnot that require a lot of grinding if you're not lucky enough to figure out the solution to the puzzle before running out of bombs. \n\nIn Owlia, every treasure chest contains gold pieces. Strange, being you don't purchase anything in Owlia. Gold is used to enter every dungeon.... Yep, you have to grind hundreds or thousands of gold pieces just to enter a dungeon.  Too much tedious grinding. If the grinding was removed, the game would be fairly decent. If the puzzles weren't terrible, the game would be good, even. But in its current state it is not good, imo.\n\nIn the game's three to four hour duration (the game would be maybe 1-2 hours if the puzzles and grinding were removed), there are a few good boss battles and nostalgia inducing sounds and imagery. But if you want a FUN game, you're going to be a bit let down.\n\nPros:\n\n-great OST\n-decent sprites\n-a couple good bosses\n-interesting world and story\n\nCons:\n-Grinding!\n-Gold buys nothing\n-Puzzles are annoying\n-Padded adventure to bloat its duration\n-Some rooms in dungeons are crammed with monsters,\nleading to cheap deaths\n-Seriously, whose idea was it to put gold currency into the game but have nothing available to buy?\n-Treasure chests galore and NO ITEMS IN THEM!\n\n\nOwlia is a well designed game in the technical sense, but more care next time around focusing on fun factor would be appreciated. Less grinding. Less cryptic puzzles. NES was great, but this game took it too far.","timestamp_created":1484245062,"timestamp_updated":1515020752,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522482872009277344","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyMKR3+ACffS1bw=="}
