    review: "Jo\xE3o Ferreira's Snaliens \u2014 which I still have to remind myself\
      \ is snakes+aliens, not snails+aliens \u2014 puts you in charge of a trio of\
      \ ship-wrecked aliens, each with a different ability, puzzling their way back\
      \ to their rocket. Snaliens has quite a mixture of different mechanics and explores\
      \ how they work together, building circuitry-based contraption puzzles out of\
      \ the various cables, switches, gates, and other such devices.\n\nIt's main\
      \ gimmick, although it does not appear in every puzzle, is an object that the\
      \ aliens can pick up which follows them like the body of a snake. This ends\
      \ up having all sorts of great interplay with the other mechanics which creates\
      \ some really fascinating puzzles. It's a little strange that the game didn't\
      \ entirely focus on this idea, but the other puzzles without that mechanic were\
      \ still very enjoyable in their own right. Perhaps the only strangeness is that\
      \ the game is named after it. If you're looking for a pure puzzler with tons\
      \ of clever puzzles and a lot of variety, this is it."
