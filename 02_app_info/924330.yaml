    review: The best 8-Bit game OST I've ever heard. I purchased all of the OST for
      The Messenger and that's the only Steam OST I have that I've willingly paid
      for. It's so good. The only other one I wish to get is Cuphead's, you can check
      that one out too but bear in mind it's not 8/16-Bit.
