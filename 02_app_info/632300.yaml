    about_the_game: "Welcome to Praslav, a cold Central European city that grows even\
      \ colder with the coming winter. Praslav is recovering from the political turmoil\
      \ that followed the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Communist regime,\
      \ which held the country in its iron grip for decades. <br><br>While most people\
      \ eagerly awaited the coming of democracy and capitalism, some were unable to\
      \ adapt to the new socio-economic climate. Soon they found themselves on the\
