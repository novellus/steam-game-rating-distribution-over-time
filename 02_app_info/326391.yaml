    review: 'So yeah what will i say about Shield of the Prophet?


      Its phenomenal !


      I started with the Iranians. You start outnumbered and outclassed. Your british
      Chieftains are heavily outnumbered and you cant expect to hold the line with
      them forever. So you give ground slowly...then faster...then most your tanks
      are getting destroyed. Round after round. Loosing ground and giving it freely
      so you can retreat.

      And when you think all is lost...enemy around you...cant hold anymore....BAM
      THE REINFORCEMENTS! THE RAGGED IRANIAN 92nd with new M 60 TANKS !!!

      And the winds of war change direction. The soviets give ground but for each
      casualty of their own they try to make us pay with blood. Yet they cant hold.
      They fall back and in the end the operation is ours !



      So yeah this DLC is worth every cent. Its great.

      While this game is set in a fictional history ( Iran vs Soviets in afghanistan
      79), you can easily imagine this as one of the operations in the Iraq Iran war.


      BUY IT!'
