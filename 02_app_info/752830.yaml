    review: 'Like most games by this studio, it''s well written and fun. Happy to
      see nonbinary gender options and various sexualities for the main player. Compared
      to other games though - especially the other "rise to fame" game SLAMMED! (a
      pro wrestling choose your own adventure game) - it''s really short and not as
      in depth. There was a good variety of options for how you approach your music,
      though!


      Overall, too short, but worth a playthrough.'
