Has moves similar in appearance to Watchbot, but functions differently. He lacks a standard dash or dashkicks, instead having a sprint. He makes up for this with the beam sword his specials give him, which effectively allows for a damaging special cancel without meter. Overall, a very fun mech to play if you're looking for something different (and let's just be honest, he's really cool).","timestamp_created":1555131841,"timestamp_updated":1555132941,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.681534171104431152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rLDJiuoCcPmQvwE="}
