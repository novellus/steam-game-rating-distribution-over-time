    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Synopsis</strong></h2>You materialize
      in a mysterious realm where a titan who goes simply by the name 'Mr. T' welcomes
      you. &quot;You have returned to the afterlife, I see.&quot; Without much explanation,
      your adventure in this dark and gritty dungeon begins. Face off against bats,
      snakes, and even the shadows as you work your way to the end of this forsaken
      world, and earn your right to reincarnate once again!<h2 class="bb_tag">The
      word 'Anamnesis'</h2> It refers to memories from past lives. In Anamnesis, the
      cards are your '<i>memories</i>'. Each run, you can choose your starter deck
      of 10 memories. Every time you finish a run, whether you win or lose, you can
      keep one. Will you remember what it takes to beat the game?<h2 class="bb_tag">Learn
      From Your Mistakes</h2> In Anamnesis, each boss has a unique approach to defeating
      it. A boss may have a shield that only goes away with fire, by dispelling it,
      or just waiting it out a set amount of turns. The unique combo system also provides
      special boosts that are character-specific and helps to balance those runs where
      you didn't get the ideal setup that you wanted. This makes each successful playthrough
      a fulfilling experience, and on runs where you lose, you'll eventually learn
      why and come back even wiser!<h2 class="bb_tag">Less RNG, More Strategy</h2>
      Unlike other games, Anamnesis focuses more on strategy than RNG. Even if you
      didn't get the cards you needed to dispel that boss's shield, your combo system
      has you covered! Each character will have unique memories and boosts that are
      suited for them to approach every obstacle in the game. This means that defense
      as well as offense are both important tactical decisions. It's not all about
      RNG!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Current Features (Act 1)</strong></h2><br><ul

      The game is still being shaped into its final form, and there's room to add
      even more systems to the mix. For now, Act 1 is complete and the game includes
      all of the systems from the original vision -- systems from some of our favorite
      games, like combos and limits. Now, it's time to add even more substance to
      a solid foundation, and we hope you will join us during this great adventure!

    review: "The game is what you expect from the pictures and videos. Slay the Spire\
      \ clone with small changes in between here and there. Has lot of replayability\
      \ to it and you could spend lots of time playing it.\n\nWhat I find bad is that\
      \ there is no support for 3440x1440 in my case, and the settings of the game\
      \ can't be changed that much so you are pretty much stuck with same resolution\
      \ overall. \n\n If you want to see my full review check it out on Youtube."
