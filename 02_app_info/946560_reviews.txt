The art is pretty, the UI looks snappy, I liked most of the character designs and dialogue, and the music was very good. As an aside, the minigame featured prominently while playing was also pretty fun. \n\nDespite this, I wasn't sold on the story. The protagonist, Bolt, is a pro-gamer trying to make it big in the South Korean Esports scene with help from his friend who he has \"a latent crush\" on, Jett. The premise is interesting, and I enjoyed playing SC2VN, so I figured I should give this game a shot. Unfortunately, the climb to the top story that made SC2VN so compelling did not translate well to the bigger scale of \"Don't Forget Our Esports Dream.\" It seems like this VN tries to bite off more than it can chew. The plot deals with a pro-gamer's struggle to be the best, a hinted at but ultimately never-explored romance (for reasons that aren't really explained), and then tries to comment on issues ranging from the organizational mess that is international esports, female representation in gaming, the bureaucratic nature of esports in South Korea, and even the unhealthy amount of studying and CSAT prep that Korean students face. \n\nIt's too much. The plot brings up these issues, has the characters discuss them, puts the issues to the side, and then suddenly realizes at the end that they need to resolve everything and just turns it into a massive infodump of dialogue between the two main characters. It felt like the story couldn't keep track of its own subplots, and it was a frustrating experience when things just ultimately weren't resolved beyond a simple 5 line conversation. \n\nIf you enjoyed SC2VN I recommend playing this. Honestly, I'd probably recommend playing this even if you aren't familiar with SC2VN. But the ending and epilogue is frustratingly shallow and doesn't do the great premise of the VN justice.","timestamp_created":1596845662,"timestamp_updated":1608071465,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54703831672668457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gumhtPYCcv+JmgI="}
