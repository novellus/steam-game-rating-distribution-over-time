    review: "Great game\nBut bad port.\nThe way they packaged this game contents makes\
      \ the game run bad on PC.\nWhy packaging game into 6GB and 10GB, making it a\
      \ pain for engine and system to load the content? And reduced quality videos.\
      \ \n.\nThere is guide for 60FPS and better cutscenes quality in community.\n\
      Overall, aside from the negative point of bad port, the game is really great\
      \ for:\n- Sailor Moon fanbase: I feel like those heroines are Sailor Moon characters\
      \ inspired.\n- Persona feeling\n- Nice art\n- Nice curves.\n- Rich story\n-\
      \ Combat is nice and challenging sometimes."
