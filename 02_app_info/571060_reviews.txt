I can't help feeling like the Zork tag came to this game late in development.  Its dark, oppressive, and mystical atmosphere doesn't fit with the comic snark we are used to.  If you found Grand Inquitor or Return to Zork to be overly goofy, you may still greatly enjoy this game.  It shares very little with them.  The focus is mainly on alchemy and hermeticism which is genuine enough to satisfy a this pagan with a classics degree.\n\nThis game is incredibly difficult and designed to be slow paced, but the solutions to puzzles are usually so cool that it was worth it to stand there staring at it forever.\n\nAlso worth buying for the soundtrack alone.  Its the first game Mark Morgan (Fallout, Planescape) did and it is a straight banger.   Like a first album almost.  Even in dos-box, the sound quality is amazing.  If you're not familiar, think Lustmord with bongos.  Either way, grab this.  Its a cool game too.","timestamp_created":1605572903,"timestamp_updated":1609593011,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s4fO4fYCer/trgI="}
