      \ your loving heart. Well, and those, who cope with all the tests, can expect\
      \ the Grand Prize \u2013 the smile of your baby, a lovely, harmless and not\
      \ evil baby. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/802730/extras/about.png?t=1538739725\"\

      \ on and what you must do next, so don\u2019t worry. We want to give you exactly\
      \ these feelings in our game.<br><br>At each new level the passing conditions\
