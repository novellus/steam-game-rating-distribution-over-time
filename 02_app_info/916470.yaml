    review: 'I bought this game with good hopes.

      But sad to say, it was worse than I had expected. Sure the game is 0.79 cents,
      but that does not mean a game has to be bad.


      The game has certainly some pros and cons.

      The pros being that:

      - Playing with your mouse enhances movement big time, and a love that aspect.

      - The music is a 10/10.

      - The overall thought of design is cool: nice shapes etc.


      Cons:

      - The graphics are so bad, that you can''t really see any of the bullets you
      are shooting.

      - 9/10 times you cannot see what bullets are coming towards you, because the
      bullets or enemies match the background 100%.

      - The game is so bare, there are no settings, no info, nothing.


      Even though this game is 0.79 cents, I am not tempted the slightest to pick
      up the game again. Which is really sad, because with some tweaking, the game
      could really be so much better.'
