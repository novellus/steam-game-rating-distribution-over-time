I played the initial beta when it was on Steam in the past. I didn't spend enough time learning the scoring system so I'm going to skip that. Even if it was a potential problem, the game has bigger ones as listed below.\n\nTl;dr: the game feels disappointingly unfinished. The main gameplay is there, but the game lacks a punch on both \nthe player character's and on the bosses part. Some of the design choices are also questionable. You're better off skipping this game.\n\nPros:\n+ Music was energetic, drum 'n' snare mostly\n+ Bosses were very distinct from each other in visual and gameplay terms\n+ Some skills and passives change the gameplay drastically, Gerhardt's plasma rifle being an example of this\n+ Good amount of graphic and audio options\n+ Rebindable keys\n+ The combo system (the more hits you get in without getting damaged yourself) rewards careful players with more damage output and faster kill times...\n\nCons:\n- ... But the combo system doesn't really make you feel much more powerful with 5 percent damage increments to already low damage output characters.\n- Some skills felt very similar to each other with small modifications or offered only very small adjustments to stats. Diversifying the skills and cutting out the similar ones would make the choices more\n- Randomized boss order. Depending on the the character played, you could start with a boss that is noticeably difficult to deal with unupgraded character. Option to pick the boss or having static order feels like more sensible choice\n- Randomized skills. Some of the skills are clearly better than others and it's frustrating when you might or might not get the skills you want. Having all the skills available would increase the options. If the devs felt like the player might get too powerful too fast they could have introduced resource that player uses to buy or equip the skills they want, with the better skills requiring more resources to buy or to equip, getting all the powerful skills more difficult or impossible to get. I remember there already being a skill shop in the beta so why they changed to this, I have no idea\n- The feedback on player character's basic attack is really lacking. It feels like you're slapping wet paper towel against a wall, no matter which character you play.\n- Lacking visual feedback on some enemy attacks and projectiles. I'm colourblind person and it was incredibly difficult to see spikes coming out of the holes in Dark Mechanism fight. The gas cloud on Warrior Spirit seemed to have a bit bigger damage radius than the visual cloud indicated\n- No colourblind options\n- You can get stunlocked and since there is no invulnerability frames, quickly killed. This seems to only be problem with the NODE (being able to drive on you) and Dark Mechanism (it can spin its cogs on you). Stunning mechanic didn't seem to be explained anywhere either\n- For how simple the game is, the player UI is really complicated and demands you to pay attention to different corners of the screen.\n- Really ugly and unintuivite menus\n- No controller support\n- Leaderboard is listed only in order of biggest points. Run time and character used is listed, but you can sort by these. Number of hits taken not listed at all.\n- Some arenas felt very uninspiring visually (Bermuda Devil, NODE) and flat without any physical obstacles to make the levels special (NODE, Warrior Spirit, Immortal Ringmaster)\n- The game lacks visual cohesion. The bosses, arenas and playable characters mostly feel like they're from entirely different games\n\nPersonal opinion: As the game is, I sadly can't recommend it at all. All the things listed previously make the game frustrating and tedious to play rather than fun. It hurts me to say this but I'd recommend saving your money and buying a better game in the genre, Furi for example.\n\nI'd like to do nothing more than to recommend the game (I enjoy boss rush games, the devs are from my childhood locale that doesn't have enough game development and I knew one of the devs at a time) but as the game is, I can't do that with good conscience. I only hope they get better in their craft and have the chance to keep working on the game or make their next game better.","timestamp_created":1531018383,"timestamp_updated":1531018416,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526315748691558838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+OHzu+QCfe7CpQE="}
