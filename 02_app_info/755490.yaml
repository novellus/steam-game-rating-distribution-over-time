    about_the_game: Rocket Blasters is a fast paced, action packed space themed shoot-em-up.  Rack
      up points by destroying asteroids and enemies on your trip through the stars.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2>There is nothing too deep going on here, blow up
      asteroids, enemy spaceships and occasional bosses in your very own super awesome
      rocket ship.  Get a variety of upgraded weapons in order to help blow up more
      asteroids, enemy spaceships ... you get the idea.  Find out if you have the
      right stuff to get on (and stay on) the Rocket Blasters Steam Leaderboards!<br><br><br><strong>Unique
      Scoring System</strong><br>Rocket Blasters has a unique system that rewards
      precision and restraint while blowing stuff up.  Each time you fire your weapon,
      you lose a point, that's right, you lose a point for shooting.  However, each
      time you hit something, you will get 2 or more points back, depending on what
      you hit.  Spamming bullets may be easier, but it will not get you the high score.  Check
      your score on the Steam Global Leader Boards!  <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/755490/extras/Inktober_031a.jpg?t=1572571279"
      /><br><i>The Dread Pizza Armada in all its glory</i><h2 class="bb_tag">Enemies</h2>Asteroids
      are not the only obstacle your rocket will encounter along the way.  The Dread
      Pizza Armada is planning an attack on Earth, and you must destroy as many of
      their drones as possible.  <br><br><strong>Drones</strong><br>You will encounter
      many of these dangerous robot ships on your journey.  Avoid them, and their
      lasers, or suffer a painful demise.  Shooting them will earn you more points
      than blasting asteroids, so thinking strategically about what you shoot will
      help you raise your score. <br><br><strong>Pizza Armada Battleships</strong><br>The
      Dread Pizza Armada was named after these oddly shaped triangular battleships.  Be
      careful of lingering behind them, as they have a dangerous array of lasers aimed
      right at you!<br><br><strong>Colossal Dreadnoughts</strong><br>The Colossal
      Dreadnought is the rarest and most dangerous ship in the Armada.  Huge and heavily
      armored, your rocket will have to be quick to avoid its dreaded Annihilation
      Beam, which destroys everything in its path, including asteroids, your rocket
      and even its own drones.  Finding its weak spot will be key in overcoming this
      deadly foe.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/755490/extras/Inktober_028a.jpg?t=1572571279"
      /><br><i>Battling a Pizza Armada Dreadnought</i><h2 class="bb_tag">Upgrades</h2>Your
      rocket starts with a simple laser blaster, however, as you progress through
      the game, you may find some useful, temporary upgrades along the way.  Look
      for the floating upgrade gear, and simply fly into it in order to upgrade your
      rocket.  Upgrades have a time limit, indicated by the numbers that appear above
      your rocket on the screen.<br><br><br><strong>Triple Blasters</strong><br>Two
      extra lasers allow you to clear a path through obstacles and enemies much more
      efficiently than the single cannon you start with.  <br><br><strong>Side Cannons</strong><br>Side
      Cannons allow you to slip past enemies and dangers, while giving you the power
      to blast them out of space from the side.  This allows for a very different,
      strategic approach when confronting enemies.  <br><br><strong>Energy Shield</strong><br>The
      Energy Shield is a very powerful upgrade, making your rocket completely impervious
      to all dangers for a short time.  Be careful of the timer though, it is quite
      inconvenient when you lose the shield in the middle of a battle.<br><br><strong>Destructo
      Beam</strong><br>Possibly the most effective offensive weapon in the universe,
      the Desructo Beam was actually a recovered Dreadnaught Annihilation Beam, which
      was re-engineered to fit on your rocket.  Enjoy its destructive powers while
      they last!<h2 class="bb_tag">Artwork</h2>Rocket Blasters is the end result of
      a small series of ball-point pen drawings I did in October of 2017.  The drawings
      were simple space themed images showing a small rocket ship, that developed
      into a story over the month long period.  Someone suggested I animate the images,
      and I did one better and turned them into a game.  <br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/755490/extras/Inktober_004a.jpg?t=1572571279"

    detailed_description: <h1>Rocket Blasters Update</h1><p>The game has been updated.  The
      destructo beam did not seem to be working, so I was able to resolve that.  However,
      it made me realize that the destructo beam was not available until a very late
      stage, because otherwise players would have noticed.  I have moved up the upgrades
      in general, so you should be able to find more unique upgrades earlier in the
      game.<h2 class="bb_tag">Faster Shooting</h2>Also, I sped up the rocket's shooting
      ability.  Now you can shoot about three times faster (three times more fun?)
      but be careful, you will still lose points for wasting bullets!</p><br><h1>About
