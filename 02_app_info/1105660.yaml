    review: "To be honest, not much of a fan, but it seems to work, has a thriving\
      \ a community and the creator still seems to be around.\nJust a very basic dungeon\
      \ crawl, rather confusing, but lots of guides for those willing to put in the\
      \ effort. \nGraphics are basic, music is simple, controls are okay. \nCheap\
      \ though, so there is that."
