The trailer looked intriguing, so I purchased the game. No refund for this dude. I freaking love this game.  BLOOD AND LIMBS FLYING GALORE! Also a lot of work has been put into it between release and now. The maker(s?) is/are very responsive to addressing problems with the game. While I've found a few funny glitches here and there, I cannot praise the game enough. Essentially you just enter the game and after selecting which mode you want to play, youre thrown right into the chaos. I just got right into the story mode. The 'story' is pretty much nonexistent, but it's still a very immersive game. I blinked a few times as various critters jumped virtually in front of my eyeballs. The environments are really cute and fun, and there's a good variety of weapons; slingshot/dynamite thing (haha), bow and arrow, chainsaw, and axes. There's a few other little addons I found once I got past the farm, but I won't spoil it for you cause its fun to figure out how to use them and to figure out what they are. Although there was one time I got out of the farm area, and the goodies did not spawn at all. Probably just a glitch. Anyhow, this is basically a wave shooter. You don't really move around at all, which is the ONE thing I wish I could change about the game. There are some really neat environments here, and it's a shame that I don't have the option to move around freely with the thumbpad button to enjoy them more fully. I can't even explain how amazing it'd be to move around the environments while fighting off the waves of zombified farm animals. Anyway, for the price I feel that it's a fair price to ask. It's one of my personal favorite games for the VR, and if free movement is added, this will be an absolute STEAL of a price. Congrats to the makers though, this game is amazing.","timestamp_created":1522429173,"timestamp_updated":1522429173,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.672448396682739258","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40LP2u+ICdNeAnQE="}
