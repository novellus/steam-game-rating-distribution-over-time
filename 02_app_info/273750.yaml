    review: I've played less than an hour and this game is awesome. I understand this
      is an old game and i'm probably one of few that just bought this game. I have
      known about formula truck as i have seen it in a few YouTube videos. I just
      typed it in on steam and saw it was only $9.99 so i bought it. It's a very fun
      game i got my G27 wheel working right away and i'm obviously still getting used
      to the game and what everything does, as i've never played a racing sim like
      this. I recommend this game but just a little tip to anyone that wants to buy
      this now. I've been playing racing sims for awhile and you have to be patient
      with the game. The trucks and tracks that are in the game is nothing like in
      Iracing or RaceRoom or any other game. You're driving a huge Volvo cab-over
      and they don't handle like the all-wheel drive cars that are all pepped up in
      the other racing games. Anyway I really like this game already it is pretty
      hilarious flying around a track in a Semi-Truck.
