    short_description: Adventure. Gunslingers. Outlaws. Shoot-outs. War. Set in the
      Wild West, Dead End Junction hits on themes relevant to the setting, such as

    review: "[i] \"Tolerance and apathy are the last virtues of the dying society.\"\
      \n~Aristotel\xE9s [/i] \n\nWell, my first negative review. Do you ask why? Let's\
      \ take a look, shall we?\nGame itself has promising potential, interesting setting\
      \ and definitely unique artstyle. It's not an usual novel, it's more like interactive\
      \ comix, which is fresh wind in this genre. There are likeable characters and\
      \ few plot twist, though they were easily predictable (watched too much anime,\
      \ it's hard to be surprised if you're able to predict, how it goes beforehand).\
      \ That ain't an issue though.\nWhere the game sucks badger's ass, is story.\
      \ For the love of God, can it be more obvious propaganda? There are four chapters,\
      \ where first one seems allright, but you'll get strange feeling that something\
      \ isn't right. And bam! 4th chapter is taken straight from the depth of tumblr\
      \ abyss. Why devs, WHY???? Why did you killed your own kid (aborted, dare I\
      \ say) with such obvious political propaganda? Sorry, but I can't give thumb\
      \ up. And yes, I stand by what I wrote, even though I know I'll feel the banhammer.\
      \ Never more!\n\nP.S. - bathing scene was completely pointless, you can't even\
      \ do correct fanservice. If it wasn't there, game would not be worse."
