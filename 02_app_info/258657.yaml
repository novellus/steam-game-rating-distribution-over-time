    about_the_game: "One of the most well-liked and successful locomotives of the\
      \ Great Western Railway, the Castle Class, speeds into Train Simulator in gleaming\
      \ BR Brunswick Green liveries.<br><br>Originally designed by Charles Collett,\
      \ Chief Mechanical Engineer for the Great Western Railway, the origins of the\
      \ Castle Class were in the Star Class of 1907, which introduced the basic four-cylinder\
      \ 4-6-0 layout to steam locomotives. When introduced, the Castle Class was heralded\
      \ as Britain\u2019s most powerful express passenger locomotive with an average\
      \ operating speed of 80mph (129 km/h) and a top recorded speed of 108mph (174\
      \ km/h).<br><br>The first models in the Class were built in 1923 for the GWR\
      \ at Swindon Works; construction continued at intervals until 1950, by which\
      \ time 171 locomotives had been built. The first withdrawals started in the\
      \ 1950s, with the last Castle Class being withdrawn in November 1965.<br><br>However,\
      \ eight locomotives in the Class have been preserved with two currently certified\
      \ for mainline running. These preserved locomotives are often called upon to\
      \ haul named special railtour services, including <i>The Cornishman</i>, <i>The\
      \ Bristolian</i> and <i>The Cornish Riviera Express</i>.<br><br>The Castle Class\
      \ for Train Simulator is available early BR and late BR Brunswick Green liveries,\
      \ as it operated for BR in the 1950s - 1960s, and includes a Collett 4,000 gallon\
      \ tender. The model features advanced steam simulations such as a reverser lock,\
      \ 3D fire in firebox, animated internal valve gear, cab controls animated in\
      \ exterior view, switchable headboards and coach boards. Also included are BR\
      \ Mk1 coaches in Chocolate &amp; Cream livery.<br><br>The locomotive is also\
