It's an adventure game. You'll explore an island, dungeons, mines and caves. \n\nThere is no tutorial and no hand holding. Want to know what those potions do or how to use them? How to save? Figure it out yourself. It ended up feeling a bit old school in that regard. You'll even be expected to figure out a thing or two before you get your first weapon.  \n\nCombat isn't Vanishing Realms and isn't the main draw of the game. It's about figuring out where that key is, or how to advance past that puzzle so you can continue to explore. \n\nOne of the nice parts about the exploration is that it's seemless. There is no loading. From the top of the mountain to the bottom of the mines. Not something that I would normally care about, but it was a nice touch which adds to the immersion. \n\nI got stumped enough that I got to explore the island a few times around. But it was that kind of stumped that it doesn't frustrate but gives you that little sense of accomplishment when you figure it out. \n\nAt that point the island was getting a bit small, but at 4.8 hours to finish it didn't overstay it's welcome.","timestamp_created":1532293726,"timestamp_updated":1532294203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580131709575653076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ458D24eQCc+vTpgE="}
