Makes the game funner... if you already enjoy the game. xD\n\nLong Version -\n\nBasically this DLC gives you space ships that you can't normally unlock in the first campaign. Two are level 4 ships and one is a level 3 ship. Basically what that means is that they ANNIHILATE. If you are having trouble with the campaign they turn the starting levels into a breeze. Quite fun to play with, or in my case re-play the campaign with these ships slaughtering stuff.\n\nI love this game so ofc I was going to buy the DLC. This is a nice DLC but doesn't really change the game in anyway. It alot funner playing with these with friends and its alot funner playing these in the campaign but I'd say only a buy if you already really enjoy the game.\n\n------\n\nGetting into more details I will specifically note that the Hiadran Runner and Saw Ship are VERY FUN to play with. The Hiadran shoot missile that then explode on second shot, the saw ship literally has a saw hahahahhaha. Dread streak is good because it moves so fast but the least interesting of the three ships.\n\nNote that the saw ship has to actually touch enemies to kill them.","timestamp_created":1588881729,"timestamp_updated":1588881729,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504854381084442139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43uSu+PECfJ6ihgI="}
