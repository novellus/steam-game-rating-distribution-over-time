    developer_response: 'Hey, thanks for trying out the games and taking the time
      to give feedback!


      I had put in a few fixes that I hoped would mitigate the problems with drawing
      games dropping, but clearly that didn''t work. I''ve just put in an update to
      the server code that should entirely fix those issues.


      Updating the How to Play descriptions is also something I''ve been meaning to
      do, and will try to get to soon.


      Please let me know if you have any suggestions, know about other bugs that need
      fixing, or have any other feedback. Cheers!'

    review: This game has potential, but needs some improvements. Can't fully recommend
      it just yet, but once some updates have been made I would be glad to update
      this review. There are definitely some good games in here. How to play's need
      to be updated to be more clear on what you are doing. Every game felt like the
      first round was learning. More so for those where a group of people are doing
      something different from the rest. There also seems to be an issue with the
      games being dropped. Couldn't play phonanigans with 8 people. Kept dropping
      the entire lobby half way through.  Drawing games seem more prone to the entire
      lobby being dropped and a new room needing to be made. Didn't have any issues
      with the text games. Really enjoy the music. Like being able to change tracks,
      and having the ability to kick out people. The game needs some bug fixes and
      a bit of polish but I think could be a worth while addition to games you can
      play with friends online when it gets them.
