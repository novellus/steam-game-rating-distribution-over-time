    about_the_game: Attention, everyone! We're looking for a van with money! And in
      that van, you. And you are at full speed on the road, consisting of some steep
      turns and trying to survive this deadly race. Intriguing, isn't it? And if there's
      a bunch of cash on the road that's going to be nice to put in your trunk?<br><br><img

      /><br><br>Control in a game very simple-your van is on a road that contains
      many twists and sharp stones on its sides. One wrong move and the car is going
      to become a pile of metal junk, and all your collected money crumble on the
      way. Try to prevent this by turning at a strictly defined point. Your success
      will be calculated from how much money you can collect. You'll be able to compete
      easily with your friends in someone who picks up more points and lasts longer
      in this crazy race. You can buy yourself a cool van and get more! It's a very
      exciting process, and it overwhelms you a lot of fun and joy.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/698330/extras/os.png?t=1504803783"

    review: 'Simple and Short amusing little game,

      Zigzag a van on the road collecting cash.


      May seem fast, gradually gets easier once adapted and knowing when to mouseclick
      to turn.

      Game ends upon collection of 5K cash.


      Low Price for a Perfect game.
