      Nine, while listed as a "Gore" video game is very much trying to be a horror
      game, utilizing all of the tropes that drive me insane about your average zero-effort
      jump-scare game. Extremely low quality textures, cheesy sounds, and lighting
      that made me want to punch my monitor made this game an absolute chore. Many
      areas, I couldn''t even see anything at all. Which is exactly what you want
      in a video game.... Utter blackness.


      Not scary, not well done, and not a quality product in any way, shape, or form,
      Nine left me wishing I had lobotomized myself as opposed to actually suffering
      through the game even as far as I did. It is an insult to charge any money at
      all for a game such as this.


      2/10. The only reason why it didn''t get a 1 was by virtue of it not crashing
      on me.'
