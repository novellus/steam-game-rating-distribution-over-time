    review: "[u] In a Nutshell [/u]\nCasual point and click, hidden object and puzzle\
      \ game with \"average\" story.\n\n[u]Pros: [/u]\n1. Gives good 5 to 6 hours\
      \ of game play with the free bonus content included. \n2. No time limits to\
      \ solve any puzzles.\n3. Has 4 game difficulty levels.\n3. Info button available\
      \ to inform how to solve the puzzle.\n4. Hint option available if you get stuck\
      \ anywhere.\n5. Has trading cards and easy to get 100% steam achievement. \n\
      \n[u] Cons: [/u]\nNothing major as such. Sometimes the game auto-hints can be\
      \ misleading.\n\nFor 100% steam achievement, please do the following:\n\n1.\
      \ Never use hints to solve hidden objects scene or puzzles. They are not that\
      \ difficult. If stuck somewhere, there are guides to keep You going. (Link below)\n\
      \n2. Do not skip any hidden object scene or puzzles in the base game story.\
      \ As mentioned above, refer to guides if stuck, but the puzzles are pretty easy.\
      \ Puzzles can be skipped in bonus story.\n\n3. Complete both 1st hidden object\
      \ scene and 1st puzzle within a minute. If You can not get it in 1st attempt,\
      \ delete and create a new profile as these 1st puzzle/hidden object scene comes\
      \ within 3 mins of game play. It might be a bit difficult to finish latter puzzles\
      \ under 1 minute.\n\n4. Find the morphing objects in whichever scenario You\
      \ find one. These are missable, so if you do not want to miss them, refer to\
      \ the community guides where exact details are provided on where to find them.\n\
      \nGame difficulty level does not matter for unlocking steam achievements.\n\n\
      As always, please let me know if You have any queries in comments section.\n\
      \nP.S: Following Guide was useful for 100% steam achievement: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2006445748"
