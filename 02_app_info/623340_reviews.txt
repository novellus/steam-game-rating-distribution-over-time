So this is for them, mostly.\nWe'll start with the good. I will check back in periodically, and I’ve decided to keep it rather than refund. I did not play this long enough to see everything, as it is there are enough issues from the beginning to fill a couple pages.\n\n- I want to like this game. It scratches an itch that I think a lot of people need scratching. The game plays much better, and I appreciate the change in starting experience. It's a survival game, and that's how it starts, nice! I entirely get the Firefly and space-western thing they've got going. I LOVE that talking to the NPCs actually yields useful items, but those items should be available through other means as well. If they're going for a mixed RPG and survival game like Fallout or something, that's exactly what everyone will compare it to. \n\n- Devs should be identifying what those games did well, and integrating those mechanics or improving on them. It’ll be essential for success.\n\nTLDR; Overall, I do not recommend incomplete games just because I see potential. The game could be arguably in an alpha state, but fails at a lot of basic game design. Don't buy it unless you are cool with funding the continued development of an indie title.\n\nOPPORTUNITIES:\n\n- The game suffers from a \"what's the point\" style of gameplay. I start in a beautiful, completely useless landing pod full of technology. Subnautica did this better. \n\n- Looking around, I can scan for ALL resources immediately, but I can literally see them in every direction for what feels like miles, regardless if they're currently useful to me or not. Do I need to see sulfur? What's the tech tree look like? Tutorialize me a little more, please. I don't want to sit and read how to play your game for 20 minutes. That menu with all the windows and instructions? TLDR.\n\nSOUND:\n\n- Music is wonderful, but still no master volume controls? \n- Environment ambience is EXTREMELY loud, and not just in volume. Rustling leaves and other intermittent sounds do not meld with the music hardly at all, and drown it out all the time. \n\nGRAPHICS & ART:\n\n- Oh boy, it is not optimized.\n\n- I have to be honest, craftsmanship on the art assets is still more than a decade out of style. Another review called it retro, which is putting it nicely. Using textures which aren't tiling on something as massive as a spaceport structure is just never going to fly. \n\n- You need to be using tiling textures and trim sheets to maximize your resolution on these assets, while keeping texel density consistent across the board. It's really underwhelming when something that looks like it's supposed to be impressive... looks like it came from 2001.\nGo get up to date on current environment art techniques.\n\n- LIGHTING & COLOR CUES! Basic game design these days.\n\n- I ran into another massive window. It's getting dark, and it's all lit up through some insanely huge window with no glass. Took a second to see the itty-bitty unlit door right next to it. \n  - It's an airlock? cool. Not sure why, though. I'm not wearing a EV suit and neither is anyone else. Think about WHY something is there.\nFrame rate cut in half while looking at some structures. \n- This rich and perfectly clean, MASSIVE spaceport is surrounded by old, rusted, abandoned and unmanned ruins. I don't get that. It's also mostly empty?\n- The street signs are 4x the size of a human being? Proportions are not normal.\n- Texel density is all over the place. \n - Metal ruins textures are at least half the resolution of the tree smashed right into the middle of it. Consider intersection points. The spaceport ring is just... coming out of the landscape grass.\n- Lots of issues with ground clutter. \n  * Foliage appears to be arranged in a grid, which is obvious at range. The wilds look like sowed fields.\n  * Break it up more, decrease the density. More rocks, other things on the ground with clusters of foliage will look more natural. Look at a reference landscape. Witcher 3 handles landscapes really well. \n- Rock detail-normals are strange, they look like leather almost. Very loud up close. Things at eye level should receive more attention, especially if you can harvest/interact with them.\n- Looks like the entire environment is 100% procedural, which lacks polish. Tree are clustered in forests, but all other assets seem to be spread out evenly.\n\nOther random stuff:\n- NPCs cannot just be standing in one place doing nothing. Unless you’re making Pokemon. Or some other JRPG. \n- Basically zero interpolation of animations. My character is not always walking on a flat surface in a straight line. \n- Dialogue camera shift is jarring. Just use something other games have done well, don’t overthink it.\n- Mining Pick hit and animation don't line up.\n- Minimize the dialogue spread over the screen. Look at any other RPG with subtitles. NO ONE wants to look from one side of their 32\" screen to the other to read something.\n- There are small tool boxes and things that you can't open or interact with, but are obviously things I should be able to loot from. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal Review:\n\nAmbitious game! Good on the devs for trying their hand at this. Honestly though, it's not ready for Early access. I enjoy the inventory system and the overall idea. Seems like it could be really fun once there's a truly playable build.\n\nGameplay:\n- Very buggy movement and interaction. Waiting a full second before accessing a loot box is an odd mechanic. \n- Got off my horse and was launched into space. \n- The Voice acting is cute, if difficult to understand. The heavy use of country-folk colloquialisms seems overdone.\n- VERY long runs through confusing space station-levels. Why do I need to run all the way around a structure with hallway-sized windows that have no apparent glass? Rethink your level design and consider more use of lighting cues. \n\n\nSound:\n- Everything is SO LOUD, and the horse-hoof sound effect cannot be shut off, even when all sound controls are put to \"0\".\n\nGraphics:\n- Some areas look decently fleshed out, like the prologue area, while much of the seems to lack environmental polish. \n- Craftsmanship on a lot of the texture work feels incomplete, and poorly implemented. Cut lines don't flow together. \n- The animations need a lot of work, and do not read well at all. \n- Characters look very young, and feel disconnected from their mature-sounding voices. \n\nAs it is right now? It's not in a place that I would consider paying money for. It's a great idea and I personally hope to see it get further. The current state is extremely rough, and a LOT more needs to be worked out before I'd add it to my library.","timestamp_created":1571116447,"timestamp_updated":1609897558,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.461409091949462891","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1606083051,"developer_response":"\nHey Outphased, thanks for the feedback!\n\nYour comments about Stars End were really helpful to our team. You gave us valuable insight, and we’ve used your comments to make many changes. We’d like to ask for your help once again-- Stars End is almost at the Alpha stage of game development and we finally feel like it’s almost ready.\n\nThe new version of Stars End includes a lot of changes: the environmental and character graphics are SO much better than they were back when you first played the game. The weird textures and animations have been completely re-vamped. In addition, we’ve added new enemies and creatures for you to interact with. Also, we’ve fixed many of the game’s most frustrating glitches. \n\nFinally, the horse-hoof sound is waaaaay more quiet (and realistic). A surprising number of players complained about that, lol. \n\nAs I mentioned last time I contacted you, our game dev team is really small. In the past we have struggled to keep up with major studios due to our small size, but I finally feel like Stars End is beginning to come together. In the coming months we’re hoping to figure out what direction Stars End will go in terms of storyline/focus, so keep your eyes out for that!\n\nI really hope you’ll consider joining us again-- we’d love to see you back in the game and hear your thoughts on the latest & greatest Stars End build yet!\n\nCheers! Shoot me a message if you have comments or concerns :) \n"}],"cursor":"AoJw/+fX6vYCffOR1AE="}
