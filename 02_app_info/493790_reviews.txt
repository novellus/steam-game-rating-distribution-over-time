It's probably fun for kids and it really has a lot of unique and creative variety when it comes to archery games. Don't expect much expect for some fun mini games and lots of hidden easter eggs and minigames to find.\n\nIf I could give it a neutral rating I would. Get it on sale if you really want to check it out or add it to your collection.","timestamp_created":1578363387,"timestamp_updated":1578363419,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l8/yvu8Ced+06gE="}
