The object of the game is to obtain and sell crops, eventually reaching a pre-determined (settable in options) amount of money. Each square on the board contains a different pre-set outcome, which is either to buy crops, sell crops, or suffer an event associated with that square, such as gaining money, losing money, gaining or losing crops, all based on farm themes (lose money by hiring help, gain it by winning a sheep-shearing contest, for example). There is some minimal strategy involved in determining how much cash to spend on crops and how much to keep in reserve for emergencies and avoid bankruptcy, and whether to sell crops at the first opportunity or wait to land on a better square with a higher price, but the game is mostly RNG. More strategic than Candy Land, less than Monopoly, especially given its lack of ability to interact / interfere with the other players. Kids 8-10 would probably enjoy it the most.","timestamp_created":1535605403,"timestamp_updated":1561878483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550172984600067139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g8rN0+sCde3LqQE="}
