A pretty tough wish list, and I spent a long time looking before I found this game. It's fiendish and quirky and humorous and very, very clever... Not sure if I'll ever beat it, but... No, I WILL beat it - I'm not going to give up :) And it's too addictive to stop playing, anyway.","timestamp_created":1602342663,"timestamp_updated":1602342663,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529750466346740723","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tZbEifUCfoCFpwI="}
