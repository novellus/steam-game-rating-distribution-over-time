    about_the_game: '&quot;In 1956, a nine years old child died in the psychiatric
      hospital of Santa Benedetta Martire. Her name was Allison. While alive, Allison
      wrote a personal diary, which is said to contain the truth about her past and
      the creepy life at the hospital. The diary was never found. A few years later,
      the hospital was shut down, and became a terrifying, god-forsaken place. You
      are Guglielmo Carter, a dauntless reporter interested in finding Allison''s
      diary and revealing its hidden secrets.&quot; <br><br>Taken from real facts,
      &quot;The Hospital: Allison''s Diary&quot; is a new horror virtual reality experience,
      putting the user alone in an abandoned hospital searching for the unknown with
      only the help of a single torch. You will face true fear in a way you had never
      thought possible. The whole environment is free to be visited, while jump scares
      and cinematic effects will literally make you forget about the real world surrounding
      you.<h2 class="bb_tag">KR Games</h2><br>As a small independent team, we started

    review: It is a short experience and it could be actually good. There is a poor
      implementation of controls, view related only, which made me a bit motion sickened.
      However i could play through the game and beat it with no real issues on my
      Oculus Quest and am looking forward to play the next chapters.
