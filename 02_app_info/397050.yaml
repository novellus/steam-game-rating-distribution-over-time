      RPG kingdom. Start small, with just a simple space to begin with, convince heroes

      adventurers into your kingdom and grow its fame in order to become the greatest

      for players of all ages. Giving you the freedom to develop your kingdom how
      you please... You can focus on questing, aiming to hire as many heroes as you
      can, levelling them and training them to be the best heroes in the land by sending
      them on quests, forcing them to complete bounties and slay villains or you can
      build and grow, turning your kingdom into a tourist empire with shops and facilities
      milking every last bit of gold from the adventurers you're attracting... Or
      you can settle somewhere in between. It's up to you, it's your kingdom.
