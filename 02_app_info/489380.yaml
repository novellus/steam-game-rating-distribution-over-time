    review: 'Will It VR?: Right on target. (But with an important, easy bug fix. Read
      Below!)


      VR seems like it was made for archery games. Unlike holding a gun in VR, pulling
      a bow feels natural and intuitive. QuiVr delivers that gameplay in a simple
      but engaging loop that has kept me coming back.


      QUICK BUG FIX TIP: Right now, QuiVr seems to have a bug that keeps you from
      collecting equipment. You can fix this issue by running QuiVr Vanguard once.
      If you do that, QuiVr should work correctly.


      QuiVr has come a long way from its simple static, wave-after-wave gameplay (though
      that experience is still available via QuiVr Vanguard). It''s still a wave shooter,
      but there''s a lot more to it. Power-ups, boss critters, enemies that require
      tactical thinking, and puzzle levels all round out the experience. Do it right
      and you''ll get a piece of equipment that you can use, and you can upgrade and
      enchant your equipment as well. There are a lot of simple subsystems mixed in
      - not so much that they''re distracting, but enough to give the experience a
      more polished and immersive feel.


      QuiVr shines in multiplayer, where you can team up to cover all your angles
      and have each others'' backs. Puzzle levels scale up to player number as well,
      so the challenge stays solid.
