    review: "One of the other games I also wanted to buy was Super Ledgehop Double\
      \ Laser. The game got updated recently so there were some changes to it since\
      \ it was first published back in 2018(?).\n\nAnyway, this game was the main\
      \ reason why I created my Steam account since I actually did want to support\
      \ the developers. Although the guy who mainly advertises this is addicted to\
      \ Yuuto (seriously, just read the descriptions of most of his videos past 2017),\
      \ I thought the game looked pretty solid.\n\nAnother aspect of the game which\
      \ I liked was how it made use of Yuuto Ichika, which was one of those memes\
      \ in the original Touhou Hell that was either hated or very loved. I initially\
      \ thought Yuuto was just meh but I did grow to appreciate her over the years\
      \ (I think a little too much because of Maki Ligon). \n\nGameplay-wise, the\
      \ game is also fun, being a mix of bullet hell and rhythm games. It's heavily\
      \ reminiscent of Yuuto Ichika's One Time Wonder, which was published in Touhou\
      \ Fangame Jam. I think that game was like a test for this one's gameplay except\
      \ it didn't have the rhythm elements.\n\nOn the graphics side, I like how the\
      \ color palette looks. The colors seem appealing to me even if there's only\
      \ four of them (though the later stages had fully-colored cities as a form of\
      \ symbolism, kinda wish they kept all of it.) \nThe art for this game is really\
      \ good, too. The character stills and cutscenes are things I appreciate a lot,\
      \ although I have some mixed feelings for the in-game sprites. I think it should\
      \ be a little bigger but that's only because my eyesight is bad even with glasses\
      \ on.\n\nAs for the music, its one of the best I've heard. I can listen to the\
      \ entirety of it for days (I even set my alarm as Yuuto's theme for like three\
      \ years just because of it, and I never got tired of hearing it after all these\
      \ years). I got into this expecting it to sound like Touhou (which, to be fair,\
      \ there was one track that did sound like it) but most of the music in the game\
      \ is its own thing.\n\nLast but not least, the story aspect. It's not the strongest\
      \ part of the game, in my opinion. I don't find it generic but I guess a little\
      \ lacking in some of the more serious scenes. Though since this game is light-hearted\
      \ (for the most part) I guess it's alright. If there's a sequel for this, I\
      \ can't wait for it.\n\ntl;dr \nThe game is fun but a little lacking in some\
      \ aspects.\nThe music is great and you should buy the album.\n\nOverall rating:\
      \ 8/10"
