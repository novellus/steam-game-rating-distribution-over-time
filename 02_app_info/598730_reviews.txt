The music is extremely well produced and dangerously catchy; not unlike Hotline Miami. The writing is quick witted and downright hilarious at times. Finally, the game play is responsive, fast paced, and quite addictive.","timestamp_created":1610052016,"timestamp_updated":1610052016,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551569521427154541","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+IKl7/YCerevwQI="}
