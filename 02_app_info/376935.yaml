    review: "The Outeniqua Choo Tjoe Route add on is absolutely incredible by all\
      \ means. Me, a huge Outeniqua Choo-Tjoe fan, was quite surprised for the quality\
      \ of the route and the rolling stock. \n\nUnfortunately there are some down\
      \ sides to this add-on. The sounds of the steam locomotive is really basic.\
      \ Based on what I've heard in real life the whistle does not sound like that.\
      \ Another thing to add is the driving cab. The cab is absolutely horrendous.\
      \ It's not realistic at all, it looks like something out of 2006 or 2007. If\
      \ the ride were to be more pleasant and fun at least make a more realistic looking\
      \ cab interior. \n\nOverall it's a great addon. Some features of the locomotive\
      \ has to be updated.\nIf your into the route is suggest buying it.\nIf your\
      \ into the train model. cab etc. etc. I don't suggest buying it.\n\nThanks.\n\
