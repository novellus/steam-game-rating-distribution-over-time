It is absolutely NOT metroidvania like in any other way.\n\nGraphics - 8/10, nothing revolutionary, but certainly nothing lacking for a modern 2D game\n\nSFX/Music - 8/10, Above average, again nothing amazing but many tracks jive well with the mood.\n\nControls - 8/10, this game took a hit compared to the predecessor, there are a few annoying kinks with the controls, so I had to knock off a couple of points.  Specific examples are hard to give if you have not played the game, but just know you will be occasionally frustrated with the controls.\n\nStory - 9/10, There is an amusing story that develops as you play this game. Considering that the game did not really even need a story, I would say that is going above and beyond.\n\nGameplay - 9/10, still one of the best puzzle/platformer games I have every played. Unfortunately they made a couple of bad design choices that knocks off a point compared to the first game.\n\nIt is a real shame that this game and it's predecessor, Stealth Bastard, are not more well known.  These are some of the best platform/puzzle games I have ever played. This one is not an overall improvement on the first game.   They improved on the gameplay but adding gadgets that you have to use to get through the puzzles, thus adding to variety of puzzles compared to the last game. Unfortunately, they did not quite get there with the controls in this game and some of the levels have errors in them.  So overall it's like a lateral step and I hold both games in high regard.  If you think to yourself at all that you like the puzzle/platformer genre, do yourself a big favor and pick both of these games up.","timestamp_created":1606703153,"timestamp_updated":1606703153,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49o++i/YCcYLLtQI="}
