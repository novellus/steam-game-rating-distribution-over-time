    review: 'The Mission DLC pack offers a handful of new weapons for each class and
      15 new missions. What''s missing here compared to the mission packs in 4.1 are
      the radio messages/story. Which is a pity, because in singleplayer I play the
      mission packs less, because they become very boring.

      There is a minor new feature for the Colonists (they just look like humans).
      They have armor and different weapons depending on the type.


      On the whole, you just get more EDF here and I like that a lot. EDF!'
