It really gives you an immersive experience into ancient India with all the exquisite Moorish palaces and buildings.  The music added to the ambience.\nYou are on a quest to find ancient knowledge in the hills of India.  You come across tablets which tell you about an ancient Sumerian culture. You jump, climb and paddle your way through different cities until you find what you've been looking for.\nPuzzles were medium difficulty, platforming was medium with some pretty difficult bits.  You have to find mandalas scattered about the places to activate doors to open.  You have light puzzles to solve and floating archers to dodge.  You have a water hall to solve (took me a while) and an astronomers hall to solve with different star signs.  I had to ask the developer for the solution!  Thanks Oleg!\nI struggled with the music puzzle because of my deafness, but got through.  I didn't get all the achievements....only got half of them.  Must be hidden treasures somewhere!\nMany say the graphics are low poly and the hero doesn't have a face, but that never bothered me.  No battle scenes, just strategy, puzzle solving and some nifty platforming!\nI struck no bugs, but the camera position was a little out of whack now and then.  Controls were responsive and I had no trouble navigating the man.\nThe ending was a bit disappointing as I wasn't sure if I understood it.  However, I thoroughly enjoyed the game and want to support the single developer Oleg.  Good value for money as I had 18 hours of play.  \nHighly recommend for those looking for something a little different.  I can't understand why so few people on Steam have played this.  A hidden treasure.  8.5/10","timestamp_created":1581857020,"timestamp_updated":1581857020,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.701803922653198242","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhtOBp/ACdeLS8gE="}
