    review: "Sailor Moon (Japanese: \u7F8E\u5C11\u5973\u6226\u58EB\u30BB\u30FC\u30E9\
      \u30FC\u30E0\u30FC\u30F3, Hepburn: Bish\u014Djo Senshi S\u0113r\u0101 M\u016B\
      n, originally translated as Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon[1] and later as Pretty\
      \ Guardian Sailor Moon[2][3]) is a Japanese sh\u014Djo manga series written\
      \ and illustrated by Naoko Takeuchi. It was originally serialized in Nakayoshi\
      \ from 1991 to 1997; the 60 individual chapters were published in 18 tank\u014D\
      bon volumes. The series follows the adventures of a schoolgirl named Usagi Tsukino\
      \ as she transforms into Sailor Moon to search for a magical artifact, the \"\
      Legendary Silver Crystal\" (\u300C\u5E7B\u306E\u9280\u6C34\u6676\u300D, Maboroshi\
      \ no Ginzuish\u014D, lit. \"Phantom Silver Crystal\"). She leads a group of\
      \ comrades, the Sailor Soldiers (\u30BB\u30FC\u30E9\u30FC\u6226\u58EB, S\u0113\
      r\u0101 Senshi) (Sailor Guardians in later editions) as they battle against\
      \ villains to prevent the theft of the Silver Crystal and the destruction of\
      \ the Solar System.\n\nThe manga was adapted into an anime series produced by\
      \ Toei Animation and broadcast in Japan from 1992 to 1997.[4][5] Toei also developed\
      \ three animated feature films, a television special, and three short films\
      \ based on the anime. A live-action television adaptation, Pretty Guardian Sailor\
      \ Moon, aired from 2003 to 2004, and a second anime series, Sailor Moon Crystal,\
      \ began simulcasting in 2014. The manga series was licensed for an English language\
      \ release by Kodansha Comics in North America, and in Australia and New Zealand\
      \ by Random House Australia. The entire anime series has been licensed by Viz\
      \ Media for an English language release in North America and by Madman Entertainment\
      \ in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nSince its release, Pretty Soldier Sailor\
      \ Moon has received acclaim, with praise for its art, characterization, and\
      \ humor. The manga has sold over 35 million copies worldwide, making it one\
      \ of the best-selling sh\u014Djo manga series. The franchise has also generated\
      \ $13 billion in worldwide merchandise sales."
