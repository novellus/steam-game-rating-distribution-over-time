      /><br>Star Singularity is a space-faring action-adventure game, combining skillful
      combat with strategic resource gathering and a procedurally generated galaxy
      to roam.<br>From the beginning of your journey, you will be thrown into the
      midst of a multi-faction conflict with some dark forces pulling the strings.
      Starting with a single spaceship and a humble base of operations, you will gradually
      progress through multiple galaxy sectors and eventually shape the outcome of
      the conflict. Wherever you choose to go and whichever side you choose to ally
      yourself with - the galaxy is yours to explore.<h2 class="bb_tag">Space Combat</h2>Space
      combat in Start Singularity is fierce and brutal, paying homage to classic space
      shooters - but with the sophistication of a modern physics engine and cutting-edge
      AI. To prevail you will have to become a skillful pilot and tactician, and craft
      a ship that can overcome (or evade) any foe. <br>Outside the main adventure
      mode, you will be able to test your mettle against AI opponents in multiple
      game modes ranging from tense 1-on-1 skirmishes to full-fledged armada VS armada
      combat.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/808800/extras/firstblood3.jpg?t=1586952930"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Ship Design</h2>Spaceships in Star Singularity are the
      sum of their parts. Different spaceships have different layouts and initial
      stats, but any spaceship design can be vastly overhauled and modified using
      components that you will acquire throughout the game: by crafting and trading,
      completing missions, or looting debris from fallen opponents. <br>Swap your
      shields with stealth modules to trade protection for the element of surprise,
      replace that gun turret with a directional engine for improved maneuverability,
      and pair unique items for overpowered combinations that even we didn''t think
      of. <br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/808800/extras/zoomoutin.jpg?t=1586952930"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Exploration</h2>The galaxy in Star Singularity is procedurally
      generated with some degree of randomness between playthroughs to give you a
      fresh challenge each time you play. While the main storyline will send you through
      predetermined locations, you are free to roam the galaxy and jump from one node
      to another in any order you like, and the various factions will change their
      attitude towards you based on your actions. This cosmic-sized adventure offers
      unique star systems to explore, full of unique encounters.'

    review: "I was really uncertain about this, and somehow I managed to completely\
      \ mash buttons to mangle my way through the tutorial, resulting in almost completely\
      \ misunderstanding the basic mechanics of the game.  I persevered though, and\
      \ after an hour or so I think I understood enough that I was enjoying what I\
      \ was doing, even if I wasn't sure exactly what that was, or if it had any of\
      \ the effects I thought it might.\n\nI enjoyed the roguelike aspects very much,\
      \ the campaign links I pursued so far were simple but enjoyable, and I really\
      \ wanted to find something I could pick up for an hour at lunch and feel like\
      \ I'd done something in, even if that was just a couple of upgrades and clearing\
      \ a sector.  \n\nSorry to not have any analysis, but for what it's worth, I've\
      \ been having fun with it!"
