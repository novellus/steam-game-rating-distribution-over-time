    review: 'https://youtu.be/e8cprsB2fIM

      A pricey game that seems like nothing more than an asset flip. The mouse handles
      horrible, the day to night cycle (I assume that''s what it is) is horrendous,
      and the enemies all look stock. The audio is good enough though, and honestly
      it achieves a cheap Devil May Cry (PS2) knock-off atmosphere I did appreciate.'
