    review: Zombotron is a game that i'd say is very well done in pretty much every
      aspect. The art style I'm a big fan of, the shooting mechanics have that old
      flash game vibe that I also like, the inventory and gear system are pretty cool.
      As a kid, I remember playing Zombotron 2 and one so far, is not very different
      from the second. So for me, it has sentimental value. I would recommend this
      game to anyone who might be on the fence about purchasing this game. It's def
      worth a shot if you like side-scrolling shooters.
