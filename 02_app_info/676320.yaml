      Thank for you review.

      Colud you please explain, what do you meen by ''For example, why would you include
      numbers in a word game? You''re trying to spell words, and then the number 2
      shows up.''

      Where did you see numbers? On the circles, alongside with the letters, from
      which you need to make words ?

      Also, was it arabic number, like ''2''?

      is it possible, that you misplace number with letter in Braille''s alphabet
      (this is one of game modes)?

      I''m asking because i definetely didn''t include numbers alongside letters,
      and i didn''t get such a bug during testing and playing.

      Also, if you have screenshots with the numbers, could you please send it to
      lettersettergame@gmail.com'

    review: "Keep in mind, this is a word game... \n\nThe instructions are: To get\
      \ hint need make word containing letter \"B\". For example it will be word \"\
      bullet\" then you must in required game mode make and destroy this word.\n\n\
      Things go rapidly downhill from there. For example, why would you include numbers\
      \ in a word game? You're trying to spell words, and then the number 2 shows\
      \ up. Huh?\n\nJust a sloppy 'game.' This is in the territory of being a scam."
