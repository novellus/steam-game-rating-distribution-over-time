    reviews: "\u201CNancy Drew: Ghost of Thornton Hall continues to provide some of\
      \ the best storytelling around, and the game\u2019s ample dialog means even\
      \ the most diehard player will take a few hours to unravel all of its secrets.\
      \ While navigation may be cumbersome, it\u2019s definitely not a deal breaker,\
      \ and it\u2019s far too easy to get sucked into the game and never want to stop\
      \ until you reach the conclusion.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamezebo.com/games/nancy-drew-ghost-thornton-hall/review\"\

      \ for Nancy to solve is as intriguing as ever, the writing and voice-acting\
      \ is solid (though a bit cheesy in places), puzzles are challenging, and the\
      \ atmosphere is suitably creepy. Nancy Drew: Ghost of Thornton Hall debuts two\
      \ wonderful gameplay additions: an expanded hints system and the ability to\
      \ fast-forward through dialog.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/nancy-drew-ghost-of-thornton-hall\"\

      It\u2019s yet another solid adventure game in a series that has always been\
      \ among the best the genre has to offer. I have no idea how Her Interactive\
      \ manages to keep their level of quality so high in such a consistent manner,\
      \ but whatever they\u2019re doing, it works.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://truepcgaming.com/2013/05/13/nancy-drew-ghost-of-thorton-hall-review/\"\

    review: I really suck at these most days because it involves math on quite a few
      puzzles, but other than that it's fun! One or two puzzles don't make any sense
      no matter how hard I look into it. Cool story and setting!
