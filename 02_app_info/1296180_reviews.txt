No events, quests, NPCs or anything of the like. You literally only do these three things: scan for doors, kill rats and open chests. \"Progressing\" down to the next level just resets everything, including every single thing you've gotten up to that point. Which leads to the question, what the hell's the point? Game screen is tiny with no options whatsoever. Pressing escape exists out of the game completely so if you intuitively press it hoping to access some options or exit your inventory, you'll close the game. Inventory is clunky, you can't just click and drag something to equip it, you have to click then drag then click again. Gold seems to have zero use. It feels like there was no love put into this game. Creator couldn't even be bothered to remove the item placeholder text on every item's description. Only cool thing about the game were the rocks which can be used as a ranged weapon. This just seems like a lazy cash-grab.","timestamp_created":1589850228,"timestamp_updated":1589850508,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.687596797943115234","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrrGelfICfaDciAI="}
