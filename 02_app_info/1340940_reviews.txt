If you go into files and check the soundtrack folder, you also get the soundtrack versions of the songs.  It's a good bundle of stuff.\n\nThe extremes are a pretty hefty step up in difficulty from anything found in the base game, and I wouldn't expect most people to even clear these charts on their first try.  The patterns are pretty complex, and I found myself performing some wacky finger gymnastics throughout the pack.  That isn't a bad thing though, these charts have some of the most fun patterns in the game, and they're also the most visually engaging charts to watch.  Remember Sailor is definitely my favorite, though I'm a sucker for 2DCAT charts.  I'd say that these charts are worth the price of the DLC alone, but you also get the aforementioned tracks models and story content - the former of which will be very fun to use in the editor.\n\nStory content isn't really my thing, but the story this does contain is a nice little add-on to the existing story.  The gimmicks in these missions are also pretty neat as well, and the random race mission is a nice little side activity to go do every once in a while.  These are some cool mission concepts.\n\nYou'll also notice that Hardcase makes an appearance in this pack, even though there's a version on the workshop.  Don't worry about that though, Hardcase got a pretty large overhaul in this pack in terms of visuals.  It's essentially a new charts based off the visual elements alone, but the Hardcase chart itself received some polish as well, and is overall more complex and difficult than the first version.  Hardcase got a large enough face-lift to justify being in this pack.\n\nAnother thing about Hardcase; I played the story missions before playing the charts in the arcade mode, and you'll notice (especially on Ultra) that Hardcase has some pretty brutal bursts that aren't present outside of the story.  I personally would've liked if the bursts were in the arcade versions of the chart, but it's pretty reasonable that they weren't; it would've made a pretty tough Extreme into something completely brutal.","timestamp_created":1594025180,"timestamp_updated":1594025180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtr/TkfMCevackwI="}
