Also, in my opinion, tutorial would be more better if it was a mini-level where you do step-by-step crafting to learn the basics. \n\nThe crafting system is complex and you don't know what to craft first - i recommend before jumping into game to have a look into craft sheet in the main menu and ignore warnings to see the basic stuff you need to survive the first night, i.e. at least learn how to craft campfire and spear. \n\nAt day you're free to explore and find a perfect spot to build a base and get some food, and by base i mean a location with plenty of woods and rocks around and set up a campfire that will scare the night monsters away from it.\nThe speach bubbles of main characters hints what materials you must combine together to craft something but it is pretty random and sometimes annoying because the game HUD is pretty large and you cant see much things around you.\nSo, coming back to crafting, it would be much better if at least the bubbles would show images instead of text because reading takes longer time and time here running extremely fast and you dont have such time to think. Besides there is a bug happening where your character literally spams a lot of different texts in one speech sequence, and the bubble itself change colors like green when its day but its actually night.\n\nPressing Escape button during the game doesn't pause the game, it still keeps running even in background leaving you vulnerable even in easy mode. There is no saving features as well.\n\nThe combat is just crafting a spear or spikes, hold them with LMB and aim at your enemies while keeping them at distance. That's it. Often you might lose the spear on the ground due to the limited range of dragging the items but you can find it with a tether between the character and the item when you're close.\n\nSome objects in game are really small and hard to see, like fish scale and glue. I think adding the background color behind them like shadow or icon might help to see them.\n\nAnd few more bugs i've encountered during gameplay:\n-I've managed to craft a boat and it had that windows saying \"press E to escape\", but spamming E led to nothing, big dissapointing bug. But i've managed to replay again pretty simple on easy and normal modes about 4 times, it worked;\n-The daytime should be much longer and the skills that slows time should be removed, because in the night, the creatures that run away from lights are hanging on the edge of the light radius trying to get you if you're close enough, and because its so easy to kill them that way, you can get huge EXP drops and unlock all skills in 5 minutes, including those that slows time by ~50% and this thing leads to the very very very long first night. This is problematic for the shark spawn rates that drops material needed for escaping;\n- Creatures killed in night respawns very often near the player and manage to successfully attack the player before retreating;\n-Also if you wander from the campfire in night you might see that those creatures are not afraid of lights at all, they walk bravely around the base and they only becomes afraid if you're close to it and run away;\n-Walls do nothing;\n-fishing nets are almost useless, i mean it kills small fishes when they bumb into it (sometimes) but i was thinking it could collect fish over time and make stuff easier;\n-Collected pages menu have duplicates among them;\n-Ending scenes does not unlock in main menu unlockables;\n\nHard mode is currently impossible because you start at starving and dehydrated state (and put in dying state in 10 seconds) with slow movement speed and you die like in ~20 seconds which is actually the time to walk to the closest tree/rock, break it down and craft a shovel // spear, it's pure RNG that the tree and the rock will spawn near campfire.\n\nAnother  thing is that you can die randomly by a thunder during rains, which is annoying when you almost done building stuff.\n\nOverall, i like it. I think it can be better. So far it's interesting.","timestamp_created":1600546067,"timestamp_updated":1600560113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481449604034423828","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41qS01PQCdObrogI="}
