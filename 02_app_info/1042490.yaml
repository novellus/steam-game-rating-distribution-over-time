    review: 'I''m only at chapter 3 but I think that''s enough for me.


      Pros

      - Great world building / design.


      Cons

      - Awful Crosshair design, when object/place is bright (color) you don''t see
      it. So you may miss something and stuck.

      - There''s a mouse smoothing which you can''t disable. It''s really irritating.

      - Puzzles doesn''t make sense. I played many adventure games, this is one of
      the worst. For example, even after looking a walkthrough I still don''t get
      [spoiler] frequency / organ puzzle. Pillar puzzle at chapter 2 was really bad
      too. [/spoiler]

      - No first person hands / feets etc, no animations / cutscenes. Game''s intro
      basically showing you logos with sounds / voice overs. This is cheap / lazy
      or whatever you prefer to call it.'
