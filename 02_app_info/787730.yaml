    review: "The name of the game sums up the experience pretty well. It's an adventure\
      \ game. You'll explore an island, dungeons, mines and caves. \n\nThere is no\
      \ tutorial and no hand holding. Want to know what those potions do or how to\
      \ use them? How to save? Figure it out yourself. It ended up feeling a bit old\
      \ school in that regard. You'll even be expected to figure out a thing or two\
      \ before you get your first weapon.  \n\nCombat isn't Vanishing Realms and isn't\
      \ the main draw of the game. It's about figuring out where that key is, or how\
      \ to advance past that puzzle so you can continue to explore. \n\nOne of the\
      \ nice parts about the exploration is that it's seemless. There is no loading.\
      \ From the top of the mountain to the bottom of the mines. Not something that\
      \ I would normally care about, but it was a nice touch which adds to the immersion.\
      \ \n\nI got stumped enough that I got to explore the island a few times around.\
      \ But it was that kind of stumped that it doesn't frustrate but gives you that\
      \ little sense of accomplishment when you figure it out. \n\nAt that point the\
      \ island was getting a bit small, but at 4.8 hours to finish it didn't overstay\
      \ it's welcome."
