    about_the_game: "The vermin are running rampant and the farmers are in need of\
      \ assistance. <br />\r\nStep into Vermin Hunter and clear out the vermin that\
      \ are wreaking havoc on the farms. The rats are eating the grain, the rabbits\
      \ are destroying the vegetable patches and the pigs are eating everything else.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you start, you are equipped with a basic pellet gun.\
      \ This may not be the best weapon to use but it does get the job done...eventually.<br\
      \ />\r\nBut do not let this hold you back. You will earn currency for killing\
      \ the vermin which you can later use to buy upgrades and bait (which helps attract\
      \ the vermin to your desired killing spot) but be careful, do not kill any of\
      \ the farmers live stock, because you will loose currency for killing the wrong\
      \ animals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBe patient in the beginning, while you hunt with\
      \ just your air rifle, and make sure you save up as much currency as you can\
      \ to get those much needed upgrades."

    review: 'gonna be honest, i spent 10$ for a game that i got to beat in less than
      2 hours. set a free mod on, include better guns and upgrades (like night vision),
      if there was a refund policy i would be doing it cause there is so much not
      there that should be kinda common sense to be there. alright game with potential,
      but as of now it needs a lot of work
