Some levels have (possibly unintended) shortcuts which can shove off many seconds while going for par or leaderboards. \nUnfortunately I cannot speak for the local multiplayer mode, as I do not own 2 controllers.\nOverall I'd recommend this game to people who enjoy challenges and time trials, as long as you have a working controller.","timestamp_created":1559423690,"timestamp_updated":1559423690,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539267003536224365","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0aS5iusCc+nGwgE="}
