    review: "It's a simple fun short game where you get to be a werewolf, killing\
      \ hippies in a chain scoring system through a variety of nonsensical wacky levels.\
      \ The levels are varied and atmospheric, music is good, but few tracks. \n\n\
      My personal gripes with the game is that the running is slow to start. You are\
      \ airborne for a ungodly amount of time. Jumping always kills your combo, so\
      \ it's useless 90% of the time. I have no idea when jumping would be a smart\
      \ move to make save for the few need jumps to beat few levels. The controls\
