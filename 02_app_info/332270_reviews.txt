There's a lot of skill in the combat as well as a lot of RNG. Most of the damage I took was because of the stupid ladders. It's short but if it was any longer it would overstay it's welcome. I would tentatively suggest this game at a 65% discount, if a couple hours of content is worth it. That said the item balance is all over the place and there's definitely a couple of them that in combination make the game difficulty a joke.","timestamp_created":1606764726,"timestamp_updated":1606764726,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw74CpjfYCe4mCtgI="}
