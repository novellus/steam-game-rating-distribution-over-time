But it would be nice if it had a little progression, starting with a slightly simpler scenario or variables and getting harder over time. It really is just pot luck a lot of the time as you are launched into the thick of it from the off. But with just a few tweaks so that it's not a \"return to main menu\" fest and MacDuff could consider this a nice little game concept well executed. For now, it's a bit relentless, but worth checking out. You might actually be good at it! I wasn't.\n\nReviewed in The Steaming Pile #2:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLWOJK7M-uk","timestamp_created":1511544090,"timestamp_updated":1511545011,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.444580733776092529","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s8/G998CdeLLjgE="}
