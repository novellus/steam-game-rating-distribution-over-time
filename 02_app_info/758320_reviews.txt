Max dodge characters get hit 100% of the time.\n- No clear explanation of game mechanics, need to figure out everything by trail and error\n- Incredibly grindy, at the very least they should reduce the need for \"arena\" battles dramatically.\n- Still no trans-romance option for a so called \"LGBT+ game\", with an overabundance of gay options.\n- Winter Wolves seem obsessed with making all good-looking ginger characters exclusively lesbian.","timestamp_created":1608219289,"timestamp_updated":1608219401,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.464770734310150146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4spPWuPYCfdT7ugI="}
