    review: 'BASS PLAYER REVIEW


      Hello once again. Just want to say, as always, I''m a bass player over all,
      and to be honest, I haven''t even tried playing these on guitar yet. Moving
      on.


      Bass players, this pack is great, but one song properly stand out as the most
      fun to play: Overlord! That song''s very fun to play, and you get to do cool
      bends! Unfortunately the song is in Eb Standard (A@440Hz).


      The other two songs are fun too, but not that challenging. The bass tone on
      them is really nice though and I can really see myself playing these a lot in
      the future! Big downside though is one of them is in D Standard (A@440Hz), so
      they''ll probably be played with the Motley Crue pack, also all in D Standard.
      The last song is in D drop C (A@440Hz), so you''re gonna need to have spaghetti
      strings or take out the bass you use for Dethklok and System of a Down, although
      the C string (E in standard tuning) is hardly used. I know sometimes Rocksmith
      can have trouble picking up my bass when it''s in C using normal strings as
      the strings bend very easily. Try being gentle, it''s the best fix for Rocksmith
      to pick up spaghetti strings.


      All in all: I think this is a must buy for the sheer fun! If you don''t want
      the pack, at least get Overlord, so much fun to be had despite the lower tunings.'
