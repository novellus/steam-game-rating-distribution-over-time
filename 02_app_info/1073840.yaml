    review: "There is nothing technically wrong with this game, but I expected it\
      \ to set a vastly different tone and I cannot help but to admit to complete\
      \ disappointment.\nFor a game essentially relying on text, not much love went\
      \ into the general use of language here. Contrary to popular belief, throwing\
      \ around loads of colourful adjectives is not the same thing as painting a scene.\
      \ Also, inserting a decidedly American attitude into one of the most iconic\
      \ British pieces of folklore has never been successful. Kevin Costner says hello...\n\
      \nAlso, the many downright pointless anachronisms along with weird popular culture\
      \ references do by no means blend in well with the classic saga. I am very fond\
      \ of the legendary context of Robin Hood and have read a lot of different literary\
      \ takes on the material. So the thought of a complex 'choose your own-adventure'\
      \ game appealed to me. But I ended up feeling betrayed.\n\n\"Ask a dragon lady\
      \ to help you with the ticket sale for a ball attended by ugly, chubby fairies\"\
      ?\n \n\"Have an 'archeologist' called  Jones pester you about sponsoring an\
      \ excavation, with your character suggesting that his first name might be 'Indiana'...\"\
      ?\n\nSeriously?\n\nAs a fantasy parody aimed at teenagers, I can accept this.\
      \ But as a serious take on the Robin Hood genre, hardly. Least of all for the\
      \ ludicrous price of around 17 Euros."
