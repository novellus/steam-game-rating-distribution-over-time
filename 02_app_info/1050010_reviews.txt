Well worth the time invested to experience this gem.[/h1]\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zg4iUmLvhxk\n\nThis review has been a long time coming. Mostly because I’ve been waiting for quite some time for this game to release officially. I’m proud of what Arin, the developer, has accomplished, and the ways he’s improved the game since I streamed it a while ago.\n\nThat said, this may not be considered a wholly unbiased review. I’m going off of a copy of the game that I received before steam, and I’m friends with the developer, sooooo consider this your disclaimer.\n\nEven for Eternia follows the main character, Rubellum, or Ruby for short, as she goes from loner in the woods to being of immense power and potential darkness, an Umbra, who fights off others of her kind who’ve totally gone off the deep end. It’s a solid story that focuses on loss, mostly on one’s memories, and the sacrifices one makes to protect those they care about.\n\nBut it tends to go wrong. Horribly wrong.\n\nThe thing I enjoyed the most about this game was when you realized something, it hits you HARD, if you’ve been following along with the game. When the name makes sense, you realize just what a character has given up. And for what? A world that reviles the Umbra. It’s thankless, but Ruby and her friends are hell bent on doing what’s right.\n\nAnother major plus is the crafting system. Each main area of the game has tiers of weapons that you can craft by getting materials from combat. If you’re struggling, CRAFT NEW STUFF.\n\n+Excellent Story\n+Multiple crafted weapons and armor.\n+Quick Party Swap in Combat.\n+Multiple strats for Combat to Win.\n\n=Wraith Enemies.\n=Sometimes the story feels forced.\n=Crafting is your primary source of income.\n\n-Crafted weapons are obsolete once you unlock factions.\n-Leveling Factions = Lots of Grinding.\n-Some Characters Need more Story Agency.","timestamp_created":1554745607,"timestamp_updated":1574800130,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.635799646377563477","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/d/Z1O4CcenuvgE="}
