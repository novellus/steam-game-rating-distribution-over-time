    short_description: Eye in the Sky is an asymmetrical local co-op escape room where
      a VR player and a Computer player solve puzzles from different perspectives.
      The goal is to share information from each perspective and overcome the obstacles

    review: I really have to recommend it to anyone that lacks friends that own their
      VR headsets. It is clear fun to play it with a friend especially when you are
      new to VR and you can experience it with a friend. The game was AWESOME and
      I would really like to see more levels or games from this developer. And I have
      to admit that playing with the physics and making PC player to jump infinitely
      on a barrel was pretty funny and made us both laugh and have fun for more than
      half an hour. Both players had fun and I think were treated equally good (but
      idk, I was only the VR one). Also the ability to use steam's option to play
      online with a friend in home was working well and done its job in those covid
      times.
