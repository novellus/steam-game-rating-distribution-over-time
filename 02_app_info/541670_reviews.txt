Runs way too smooth. I was getting 350+ frames on average. Every character is unlocked from the start, except for the newer characters that were added to the console versions before this game got taken down and re-uploaded.  This can be solved with modding. You also get most of the playsets too. I picked this game up during the steam winter sale for $8, and it was practically a steal. Sadly, all online features have been removed from the game since it got canceled a few years back, but that's not that big of a deal if you are just wanting to play the sets.  I would recommend this for new players, and even older players that want to get back into this game. I would try and get it during a sale. I dont think that this should be $30, but when on sale its worth it.","timestamp_created":1609708373,"timestamp_updated":1609708373,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wJCG5fYCeJeZwAI="}
