Yet every time I put the game down I find myself called to come back, as if a siren sings out in the night begging me to seal my own fate once again. Challenging, frustrating, rewarding and well made this is an indie game that pushes the boundaries of my sanity in all of the right ways. 9/10.","timestamp_created":1533485721,"timestamp_updated":1533485784,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593881845474243164","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvIO4heUCdOjTpwE="}
