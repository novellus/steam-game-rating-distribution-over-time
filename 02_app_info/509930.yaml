      spontaneously. In this catastrophic situation, a speck of light of HOPE appears.
      The person who has been lured to the battle field by the king of the darkness,
      is not a human being but a demon with unusual demonic power. He wants to fight
      against the evil forces. He had lost his family 5 years ago due to the sudden
      attack of evil spirits. He is now guided by a saint who provides him instructions
      from time to time. He is the son of the greatest warrior, Zaxina. He is Razor.
      There is a deep mystery behind the demonic powers of Razor, which his brother
      knows. Razor had never seen his brother from birth and hopes to meet him someday.
      His current aim is to seize and annihilate the evil demonic forces! At last,
      he would be able to rescue his brother but will he be able to rescue his father?

    review: "Not as much fun as Knock-Out Daddy (the game that everyone knows).\n\n\
      It controls like... actually it doesn't... at all.\nTries to be sonic, if sonic\
      \ had a crippling addiction to methamphetamines and nerve toxins. Personally\
      \ I think the full RETAIL price is abhorent BUT if you can get it in some sort\
      \ of bundle for say $30 with ~20 other game then I'd say go for it. \n\nOverall\
      \ 4.20/1000 (Blaze it, and by that I mean burn your copies)\n"
