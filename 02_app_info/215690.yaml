    review: 'Graphics have aged ok. and there is a slight bit of jank, but this game
      has a lot of heart and the developers make it clear this game is one worth playing.

      -Like the first one, the game is short story-wise in favor of a heavy emphasis
      on combat.

      -Combat is simple in essence, but it takes a lot of learning to get a good feel
      on blocks and dodges, grabs and weapon use. A decent variety in enemies and
      mechanics make for a fun run through the weird ass environments that make up
      the world

      -World is relatively small in scale, but is built to be an extension off of
      the first game, and the story justifies why your world is so bizarre, dangerous,
      and beautiful all at once, and each area feels the way they should.

      - Voice acting is 50/50, some characters have much better sounding dialogue
      than others, but you will know who is more central to the plot based on how
      clear their voices are.

      -Exploration and sidequest stuff is handled by multiple small collectible sets,
      once you finish collecting an item, you go to a specific place and receive a
      bonus you can use for the rest of the playthrough.


      Overall, Zeno Clash 2 is a strong 7/10, worth playing for the experience, Coop
      just helps make it more memorable.'
