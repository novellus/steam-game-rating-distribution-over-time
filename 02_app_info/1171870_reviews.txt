I plan to play it more in the coming days, but wanted to share the experience thus far. I am giving this game a positive review because I think it does a lot of things right, and the idea is something I want expanded on more. \nWith $5 and an open mind, I really do believe you will get your money's worth.\n\nPros:\n1. Combat feels really good to me. I love how powerful the dashes (shift by default) feel. I've only faced a few beginner mobs so far, but they all have unique attack patterns. Unless I'm swarmed with enemies, the combat always makes me feel in control. \nHowever, attacking is very simple; there is no way to mix up your combos. It is just left click spam when you want to attack. Maybe this changes with higher level gear? Personally, I like its simplicity. It lets you focus on movement and avoiding enemy attacks.\n\n2. I love the music.\n\n3. There is a lot of Quality of Life in this game that I didn't expect; Cut 1 log of a tree, and the entire thing is cut down. Progress bar for cutting/mining. No hunger to manage. Instant-forge your bars (no need to sit around waiting for them to smelt).\n\nCons:\n1. The Third-person controls will take some time to get used to; You have to be in combat stance (a toggle with Q by default) to change your camera angle, but everything else requires your passive stance; Mining, placing objects, interacting with doors/stations...\nI was able to temporarily solve this by creating a macro combining Q and F5 (Stance change, and Camera Perspective Change), but this is less than ideal.\n\n2. Not the developer's fault, but there isn't much information available for early game players; For example, I think Torches reduce enemy monster spawn rate but I can't confirm that, and I don't know how many tiles they affect; or where certain monsters spawn (such as the Giants). Personally, I am a little excited to know that I will have to tackle this whole game blind.. but I know that isn't true for everyone. \n\nSuggestions:\n1. To fix the Controls, I'd like to see both stances allow third-person camera movement by default. Allow basic interaction with the world while in the third person passive stance; E.G. Mining the blocks in front of your character, or opening the door in front of you. Lastly, for more control when harvesting resources or placing blocks, add a Hotkey that applies screenlock and gives you the cursor while held (I.E. Current functionality, but only while held).\n\n2. Although I have combat in the \"Pros\" section, I would still like to see a small mix-up option; Like a right click heavy attack or something along those lines.\n\n3. Some form of levels would be great, even if they were only for show or had very minor effects (like +1 hp, or slightly enhancing the suggested heavy attacks).  \n\n\nTL;DR I am genuinely impressed with what the game has accomplished for being only $5, and I think it has a lot of potential. It's missing some refinement (feels sort of like a Beta), but definitely has a solid foundation. The combat in this game is responsive (and simple) and enemy attack patterns feel very fair.","timestamp_created":1608853210,"timestamp_updated":1608853355,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4n7/Iy/YCcpT0vAI="}
