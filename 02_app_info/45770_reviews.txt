I would not recommend it because its a terrible port.\n\nNo controller support without using third party applications, game regularly freezes on startup or mid-game, forcing me to log out of Windows completely to reset it. As of 20 hours gametime at this writing it's frozen at least 3 times mid-session for me.\n\nGreat dead rising game, shitty port.","timestamp_created":1609799382,"timestamp_updated":1609799382,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv6bh5/YCf+PDwAI="}
