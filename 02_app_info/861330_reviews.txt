But there's only 12 short levels and got through it in about 4 hours, though I do play a lot of roguelikes. Hope the devs add more content.\n\nEdit: My review time is because after I beat the game (which took 4 hours) I decided to try to optimise my team and aim to be #1 on the scorboard, which brought my time to 15 hours. Then every so often I played this game when I was feeling stressed or wanted to relax, but I dunno if everyone would do that","timestamp_created":1567852103,"timestamp_updated":1607615325,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508466601371765137","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4tOTVpvYCeMjn0QE="}
