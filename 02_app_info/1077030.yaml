    review: "Ich wei\xDF nicht genau was ich schreiben soll und ob der Daumen nach\
      \ oben oder unten gehen soll :D. Ich bin so perplex. Ist es ein The Forest Killer?\
      \ The Forest 2? Oder gar der ultimative Fortnite Killer? Auf jeden Fall habe\
      \ ich es durchgespielt in meinem Lets Play. Ich hoffe ihr habt Spa\xDF daran.\n\
      \nhttps://youtu.be/U7AK0lRgd74\n\nMeine gro\xDFe Hoffnung, dass f\xFCr die 4\
      \ Euro wenigstens ein Update noch kommt :D. Ich kann das Spiel irgendwie nicht\
      \ ernst nehmen. Aber dies ist wohl auch das, was der Publisher ein wenig m\xF6\
      chte. ^^\n\nAm besten ist die Beschreibung im Shop: Dieses Spiel enth\xE4lt\
      \ m\xF6glicherweise Inhalte, die nicht f\xFCr alle Altersklassen oder zum Ansehen\
      \ am Arbeitsplatz geeignet sind: Gewaltdarstellungen, Allgemeine nicht jugendfreie\
      \ Inhalte \nxDDDDDDD\n\n"
