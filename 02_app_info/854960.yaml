    developer_response: This is really unfortunate and I'm sorry you encountered this
      frustrating issue. Something in one of the recent patches from Beamdog seems
      to have broken the wagon asset that allows you to interact with it to leave
      the area. It's been working for 14 years, so this was an unpleasant surprise.  We've
      come up with a simple workaround for the time being, until we get an official
      fix in NWNEE through Beamdog. Please contact me about it at info@ossianstudios.com
      (I'm Ossian's CEO) and I'll have our lead QA tester help you resolve this bug
      in short order.

    review: Initially having given a thumbs down due to a game breaking bug, they
      have since patched it and it now works fine.  With an engaging story and decent
      design it's worth a look now and devs being willing to fix things if they're
      broken is encouraging as well.
