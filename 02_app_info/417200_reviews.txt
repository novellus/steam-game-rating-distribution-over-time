Ultimately, I requested a refund.\n\nThe game has two modes: Story and Creative. In Story mode  you sail around in a circle collecting boat parts and chimes that expand the map, so you can sail around in a circle to collect more parts and chimes. In Creative mode, all the parts are unlocked and you use the boat editor to build boats and then sail them.\n\nThe boat editor is difficult to use. When rotating the parts they can get stuck in the foreground/background of the camera and won't snap to mounting points. The mounting points also misbehave or are difficult to determine you're on the correct one. Once the part is placed, your only option to move it is to delete/undo and try again. The parts are divided into 4 categories,  Hull parts, Buoyancy parts, Sails, and Other. Many are copies with cosmetic changes and once you have a lot of parts unlocked, it becomes an annoyance to scroll through all the Hull parts.\n\nThe sailing physics was OK, but had issues. I have some real world experience with sailing; having raced sailboats for a few years. I couldn't get the boat to sail upwind with the upwind sails. The best I could do was a beam reach, anything higher and the sails stopped working, the boat would slow to a halt, and then you're dead in the water. Once the boat stops moving your avatar drops the controls and you have to click to release then click again to control the boat. Although you can't trim them, if you're using the square downwind sails you can kind of backwind them to get the boat moving backwards and regain some steerage. However out of several attempts, I was only successful in backwinding and turning downwind once. Using the avatar to get out and push the bow around didn't seem to have any effect either.\n\nThe boats don't have any ballast or weight in the keel, only an overall weight to buoyancy ratio. To offset this, every design (that I saw)  has some sort of symmetrical outriggers to keep the boats from flipping as soon as they sails fill. Also, at times, it feels like you're sailing on a wine cork the way they'll bounce, especially with smaller builds. I tried making a smaller boat with an upwind sail to test the upwind physics and it was uncontrollable. And for lashed(?) together ship wreckage and barrels, these things move way too fast. It seemed like average cruising speed downwind with full sails was around 30 knots. Amazing for plowing through the water with no rigging to secure the mast.\n\nAnyway, this game has potential to be a fun sailing game, which I'm always excited to see because there are so few. The graphics and audio are good, in its current state its playable, if repetitive, but needs work on the main components of the game; the build editor and sailing physics.","timestamp_created":1608913426,"timestamp_updated":1608914039,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54462897777557373","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4jf6vzfYCcauMvQI="}
