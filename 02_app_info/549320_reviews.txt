I would watch the hell out of this on YouTube or Netflix or something. Steam makes it a bit awkward.\n\nAlan Tudyk really nails this, both as a writer and a performer. It's a great piece of work, and if I could hit the \"recommend\" button multiple times, I probably would.  It deserves a longer run with full length episodes.","timestamp_created":1536728808,"timestamp_updated":1536728808,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpJeL5uUCfOe+qgE="}
