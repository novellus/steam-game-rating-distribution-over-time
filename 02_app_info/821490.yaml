    review: 'This game is very fun picking up loot with crazy names like i identify
      as a goat is fun but i think it could use some features/changes: you should
      get better and more loot the higher the difficulty  also you should be able
      to see the rarity before you pick up and item add these changes and it will
      make this game even better!'
