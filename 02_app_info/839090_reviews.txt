Racket NX and Holoball are still the kings of this subgenre. Galaxy Ball Defender, unfortunately, is near the bottom. \n\nHere is my list from personal experience:\n\n1. Racket NX\n2. Holoball\n3. Plannes\n4. Duo\n5. Arcade Saga\n6. Ready Player One (Smash & Fracture) * FREE\n7. Proton Pulse\n8. Slum ball VR * FREE\n9. Magical Squash\n10. Pingball\n11. Galaxy Ball Defender\n12. Not even woth mentioning games this bad (note: did not include tennis/ badminton / pure racquetball games or ping pong) ** Never played Super Pixel Smash, but it looks good **\n\nSo why is Galaxy Ball Defender so low on the list? Well, the ball physics are off. Hitting the ball would lead to often strange results. You can control the general direction where the ball goes if you hit it well, but that's it. Several times the ball would go up and down the corridor as though I had hit a foul ball. I think part of the problem is the paddle. It's like a thin baseball bat. Not good for this type of objective game. Easy to mishit and generally impossible to be precise. \n\nThere's only one game mode. You lose and you start back to zero. There's local leaderboard only. Only 1 boring and simplistic environment. The rules are not explained. It said to press grip to bring ball back to you, but that never worked on the Oculus Rift. Extra balls spawned, but I had no idea why. Different shapes and colors. Not sure what they did. Sometimes I lost and wasn't sure why. Is there a certain distance the drones can get to before you lose? They didn't seem that close. Who knows. Nothing explained.\n\nRate 4/10. It was only $2 on the Steam summer sale, I played only 10 minutes. It's probably something I'll never play again without major updates. But I won't refund. It's not the worst game, just compared to other racket games it's pretty dull.","timestamp_created":1529868991,"timestamp_updated":1529872253,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565813541412353516","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hMDfmeQCdJCLpAE="}
