    about_the_game: <strong>The Vikings are back!</strong><br>Loki, known from the
      Nordic sagas as a versatile god of lies and weaver of many intrigues against
      his divine &quot;colleagues&quot;, has been banned from Asgard by Odin as a
      punishment for the trouble caused by the Midgard serpent. Now Loki is plotting
      revenge and searching for a possibility to sneak back into Asgard and pay Odin
      back. Out of spite, he abuses our four human heroes--Sigurd, the Frank, Hatschi,
      the brave Saracen, Bjami, and Crya--with his intrigues and traps. Embark on
      adventures and quests to help your allies wrest free from Loki's insidious machinations,
      whether it's a plague of serpents or the demon wolf Fenris dropping by for a
      rather unexpected visit. Ensure the health and safety of your people as you
      start with but a humble town and work your way up to a large city. <i>Cultures
      - Northland </i>offers the best combination of strategy and adventure!<br><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"> <li>Three difficulty levels that make the game fun for anyone  <br></li><li>Explore
      unknown territories and establish trade routes with other tribes<br></li><li>Watch
