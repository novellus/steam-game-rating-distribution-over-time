    review: 'it''s a pretty linear game. normally, i''m a fan of games that don''t
      make you back-track a lot... but this one was just ran straight forward.

      the whole "morphing objects" aspect was too much trouble to sort out and if
      you finished an area, too bad if there was something back there. because you
      weren''t allowed to go back.

      the mini games were just as bad... if you made a mistake, oh well, you just
      had to skip it because there wasn''t a way to undo anything and closing the
      window didn''t reset it either.

      the "positive" things weren''t good enough to pull the game out of the nose
      dive.

      basically, the impression i got was that this should have been listed as a Beta.
      Not sold as "Collector''s Edition" or even a Standard one. and given its age...
      it''s not going to be fixed. it''s an As-Is and in that state, i can''t in good
      conscious give it a recommendation. it''s rare that i''m not ambivalent about
      the yes/no rating but there you go.'
