    about_the_game: "Hack into the \xC6therNet, a world-wide, anonymously owned and\
      \ operated, magical networking grid to steal essence and send it back to your\
      \ corporation for research. As you collect essence, research further improvements\
      \ for your Shell, the digital presence that you use to fight off the \xC6therNet's\
      \ cyber defenses.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The \xC6therNet</h2>Nobody knows where\
      \ the \xC6therNet came from, or who runs it, but it serves as a free and publicly\
      \ available network with which the world can stay connected. Some corporations'\
      \ scientists and researchers have recently discovered that the \xC6therNet does\
      \ more than just provide a communication grid, it serves a more fantastical\
      \ purpose. It turns out that the alchemists of old were right, the classical\
      \ elements can be manipulated, and even mastered, and the \xC6therNet transmits\
      \ the essence of those elements and distributes it to the world. A study of\
      \ the Pillars, massive columns that act as the networking substations for the\
      \ \xC6therNet, has recently revealed that the seasons are actually caused by\
      \ the surging of a specific element during each season. Of course, as soon as\
      \ somebody found out about this new natural resource, they wanted it for themselves,\
      \ and that's where you come in.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Void Corp</h2>Of all the\
      \ corporations to find out that the Pillars are wellsprings of new natural resources,\
      \ Void Corp is the lesser of many evils. Void Corp, as a company, does research\
      \ and seeks to &quot;find solutions to the many mysteries of the boundless void,&quot;\
      \ or at least that's what their pretentious motto says. Many companies now vie\
      \ for the first mover's advantage in this new industry, and Void Corp is investing\
      \ heavily in its CyberSecurity professionals and researchers to make sure they\
      \ are the prime amongst them. That's you!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Essence Scraping</h2>You\
      \ work as a CySec professional at Void Corp, and have volunteered for reassignment\
      \ as an &quot;Essence Scraper,&quot; a new position tasked with infiltrating\
      \ the \xC6therNet in a Shell, a new form of virtual presence capable of establishing\
      \ a connection on the network's magical grid, developed by Void Corp's recently\
      \ established \xC6therNet Engineering team. Upon connection to the \xC6therNet,\
      \ you'll get to work fighting off its security measures and stealing as much\
      \ essence as possible. Whenever you get a moment to relax away from the hostile\
      \ security systems, take the chance to send the essence you've collected back\
      \ to Void Corp for further research. As you send essence back to the research\
      \ team, they will begin working on new ways to collect the essence in a more\
      \ sustainable manner, but also on new ways to improve your Shell for more efficient\
      \ survival and deeper delves into the \xC6therNet's vast web of connections.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Shells and \xC6theric Essence</h2>Your Shell is your tool\
      \ and your weapon. It is how you will crack through the cyber defenses of the\
      \ \xC6therNet and collect the essences that you are paid to find. The \xC6therNet\
      \ contains five different varieties of essence that Void Corp has found so far;\
      \ Fire, Water, Earth, Air, and \xC6ther. The classical elements. As you send\
      \ essence back to Void Corp's main repository, the research team will find ways\
      \ for you to use it to augment your Shell, making for even more efficient essence\
      \ plundering!"
