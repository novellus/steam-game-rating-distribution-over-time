I love the basic concept for this game and i think its potentially a winner its unique enough and compelling enough to make it a future sleeper hit but from what i have seen so far this game really does need a vast amount of work particularly in regards to enemy variation loot being both exciting and rewarding enough i may have just been unlucky but so far i get nothing but garbage and dead recruits far too many dead recruits and as new recruits dont come with weapons and even terrible weapons are insanely expensive to buy or make in its current state the game at least in my experience so far is very hard indeed. Only buy this if you really like the concept and want to help a brave and honest developer suceed if your just looking for a almost finished game look elsewhere for now","timestamp_created":1605669124,"timestamp_updated":1605669124,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511303186416625977","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw+s7V7PUCeauGrwI="}
