Great to have installed for offline play or during a big download while you have 20 minutes to spare. \n\nThe physics are sound and interesting, with new elements being introduced consistently as you move through the levels. the maps also offer opportunities to find new and, often very challenging, alternative ways to complete each level. I have spent a significant amount of my time in this game dying again and again to find the perfect angles and timings to speedrun a level. Some levels can be significantly challenging at times but it is manageable,  so that finally passing the level feels highly rewarding. (I've honestly needed to shower a couple of times after the stress of this game).\n\nThere is also a custom map creator tool in development which needs some work but shows promise. Put this together with the times and scoreboards and you have yourself a very competitive game style, vaguely similar to \"Golf With Friends\" and other party games, perfect to wash away Quarantine boredom.\n\nOverall verdict: 7.5/10. Will go up to 8.5 once the map creator tool is finish and some mechanic tweaking occurs.","timestamp_created":1592756713,"timestamp_updated":1592756713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44tbs6/ICcKaujwI="}
