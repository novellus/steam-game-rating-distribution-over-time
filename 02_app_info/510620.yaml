    short_description: THOTH is a challenging twin-stick shooter you can conquer alone
      or cooperatively with a friend. Each stage is handcrafted to test coordination
      and puzzle-solving skills. Colorful minimalist graphics combine with an intense
      unnerving soundtrack, making for an exciting mix of art and arcade.

    review: 'Liked: A monolithic theme cascading from the menu to the gameplay (even
      when losing in gameplay...by it focusing on the enemy mechanics rather than
      the stats of lives or points in a HUD, it gave a mood similar yet different
      to other cyber-based shooters). Since I have yet to try the coop with someone,
      I cannot say how the coop is.  This may also be a game that can motivate Unity
      users to make more creative projects within a familiar genre.


      Disliked: Probably the levels with the dotted lines. Though I understood afterwards
      and adapted (plus with the extra speed noticed with tinkering with how my character
      moves with and without shooting), it briefly reminded me of some asymetric gameplay
      where I lost some of the fun (and ya....lost most of the time). Maybe change
      the dotted line to a similar color of the enemies when one is fully shot (the
      black with stars void) to signify that the player can''t go in but the enemies
      can.


      Thank you for THOTH. Refreshing game. Recommending game.'
