For some reason I'm sure it'll be impossible to fail in this game.\nMain character seem to be nice even if standard.\nRomances seem to be rushed. At least the glimpses I seen.

Just a little story to read.","timestamp_created":1590070514,"timestamp_updated":1590070514,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwldLlm/ICcbyliQI="}
