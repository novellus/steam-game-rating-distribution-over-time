In a nutshell, the concept of the game is the only worthwhile part. The mechanics are completely unrealistic and totally not responsive. It's waaay too easy and punches are thrown and then land out of sync in totally unrealistic ways. I beat the entire game in less than 20 minutes, first try (and you probably will, too). The developers should try to get in touch with whoever made Thrill of the Fight. Those mechanics are the best I've experienced. I would not by this game unless some major work is done to improve the realism and responsiveness.","timestamp_created":1608518657,"timestamp_updated":1608518705,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ49vPLwfYCdYntuwI="}
