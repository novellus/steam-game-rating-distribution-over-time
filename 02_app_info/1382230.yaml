      later, I found myself in the grip of the Bolshevik revolution in Russia. Now
      I know how naive I was when I took this hasty step.<br>Now I am an artifact
      hunter and I make millions of dollars robbing ancient tombs. How did I transform
      from an idealist in love with the art to a professional looter?<br>This is my
