They've gone way overboard, and I've resolved to just get the characters and basic costumes.  What bothers me the most about this particular DLC, and I assume it's the same for both characters, WHY DO THEY SPEAK JAPANESE!  I guess it's the game their from, but all the other Japanese characters in DOA speak English in my game.  Why do these have to speak Japanese?  I mean, it just bothers me when I play a game and the characters aren't dubbed.  Call me what you will, but I want the option to hear English.  Overall not bad, just caught me completely off guard.","timestamp_created":1606882386,"timestamp_updated":1606882386,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhezpkPYCed/VtgI="}
