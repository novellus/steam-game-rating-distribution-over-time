    review: "[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers[/h1]\n\nYou\
      \ can watch my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/FGKjxNuFALs\n\nI have\
      \ no idea what I just experienced. There are two different experiences. One\
      \ you're on a stationary floating platform and watch a whole lot of nothing\
      \ happen. The other one you're flying around and seeing a whole lot of nothing\
      \ happen as well. Both experiences together took me a total of about 9 minutes.\
      \ There are no interactions and you choose the experience via gaze (the floating\
      \ balls to choose from are behind you on the Oculus SDK version). \n\nThe environment\
      \ does look kind of like a Salvador Dali-inspired world. The flying air craft\
      \ look like flying creatures. You're near a hill that looks like dinosaur bones\
      \ with Swiss-cheese eggs on top. It's definitely trippy. This one thing happens\
      \ but I have no idea how to even describe it. A lot of nothing happened in between.\
      \ \n\nI just didn't get it. I feel like I wasted $1.49 USD. However, I think\
      \ some people may appreciate the experimental art experience  (I think I'm being\
      \ generous calling it that though).\n\n[b]Rate 4.5/10. Do you have to be on\
      \ drugs to appreciate Whale Island? [/b]"
