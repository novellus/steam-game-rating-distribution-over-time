It doesn't realise that it could be much more with less.\nThe mechanics do not mesh and aren't in service to each other and seemingly exist only to add unneeded complexity. I have a massive board game collection and this felt like coming into a complex 4x game with two expansions already integrated and half the rulebook missing.\nI had to quit of of the basic tutorial and restart it twice thinking I'd missed something before getting frustrated and just quitting altogether. If your solution to negative reviews is to post an explainer video, then your tutorial is simply not good enough. Speaking of... After I came back and tried again, I got stuck in the fourth tutorial and had to force quit the game and try again before it finally let me through.\nAfter beating all the tutorials I think I actually understood less than when I went in and have zero inclination to actually play the game. It was as if it were trying to teach me 5 disparate games that were tied together by nothing more than a loose theme.","timestamp_created":1606623855,"timestamp_updated":1606623855,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mdCPifYCcYP6tAI="}
