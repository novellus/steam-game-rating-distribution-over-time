    review: 'Both the visuals/animations and music of Shikari Rising are already really
      lovely. As a fan of monsters, I love their design.

      I''m not too good at these kinda games, and still need to practice more, but
      I''m enjoying it a lot; it''s very fun and quite difficult. I recommend it to
      anyone who''s looking for a challenge. :)

      I''ve also encountered no bugs so far, and that''s a huge plus.'
