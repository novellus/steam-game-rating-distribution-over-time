    review: 'While I enjoyed the other two games so far in the series, this one takes
      a huge step back.


      Levels feel extremely constricted. For a game that lets you jet around 9 times
      out of 10 you''ll hit a wall and are forced to go through incredibly tight platforming
      areas, and with how fast and somewhat sporadic your character controls you''ll
      die a lot. The pits in these games are a huge problem and I wish they would
      just be removed entirely in this series- you never know just how far down the
      levels go until it too late and you die over and over. There''s not that many
      stars to collect. If you die, whatever red stars that you had are gone so you''ll
      have to redo everything just to get a chance at the bonus level again. The achievements
      are all level and star based which is great, except two which require you to
      slog through the bonus levels, if you can even get to them.'
