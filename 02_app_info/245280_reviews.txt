I loved the story, characters, the scenery. It looks very nice despite being 10 years old.\n\nThe platforming is like streamlined, you can't really fall or die in most of the sections, that's odd but it doesn't really make it bad, just simplified.\n\nThe camera is sometimes annoying, like I don't get why would they choose some camera angles really. Is just a minor detail that won't suck the enjoyment out of the game but its worth mentioning.\n\nPigsy's Perfect 10 was hilarious, an example of DLC done well. Recommended, nice game.","timestamp_created":1610124665,"timestamp_updated":1610124665,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541021227836608887","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ipS68fYCda/KwQI="}
