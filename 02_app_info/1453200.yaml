    review: "First off, the price is a bit high for the length and content that is\
      \ included. \n\nA very simple yet fun bare-bones Survival Horror game. The NPCs\
      \ have some glitches that can be abused to easily survive any encounter, but\
      \ the gameplay is pretty fun if roughly 1 hour is worth the price to you.\n\n\
      This game doesn't have a narrative (which isn't a bad thing at all. Just noting\
      \ for those of you who mind) and the ending is rather abrupt. I hope the creator\
      \ continues making games and keeps improving!"
