I thought this would be for just an hour, but I have already enjoyed it for about 15 hours and I am not done with it yet. Love it, I can heartily recommend this game to all lovers of twin-stick shooters. I really experienced a huge amount of fun while playing this game. There is a lot of progression and it is really great fun to shoot all the different enemies to pulp.\n\nThe design of the game is simple, enemies are approaching you in different waves and the goal is to shoot alle the enemies and not get hit. What makes the game special is that you have three different weapons (bullets, fireballs and lasers) that you can switch between. Also different for this genre is that your spaceship develops slowly during the game. This also my biggest criticism: if you want fast action right away the the first half hour will be boring because you are still so weak. However, I think that it is a big mistake to let this scare you away because the mid and endgame are nothing less than spectacular.\n\nThere are 7 different worlds with approximately 7 levels per world i spent about 7 hours copleting all levels, but I also backtracked to get some medals. When I was done I was positively surprised by the amazing endless level that I also spent a few hours in (perhaps an idea to make this game mode immediately available for the \"instant-satisfaction generation\").\n\n--- SPOILER ---\nFor me, the highlight of this game is the bonus planet which unlocks after getting all levels on gold. This planet consists of 3 incredible challenging levels that really test you to the limit. Sweaty hands! :).\n---------------------\n\nThe explosions and fireworks are beautiful but the graphics are nothing very special, just fine. The menu could be a bit more user-friendly but once I got used to it it was also fine. The music is fantastic, sometimes a bit strange for a space shooter (it varies from classical music to hardrock to techno) but it works absolutely great, some tunes were still in my head for days.\n\nPRO's\n- Just an insane amount of fun, awesome game mechanics\n- Surprisingly long playing time for this type of game\n- Spectacular explosions, like a firework show\n- Many hidden extra's\n- Soundtrack is amazing\n\nCON's\n- Start is slow, takes a while before the real action starts\n- Menu a bit annoying, needs getting used to it\n- Graphics nothing very special (except explosions)\n\nTo be clear, the pro's crush the con's with ease. An absolute recommendation, easy question!","timestamp_created":1576596882,"timestamp_updated":1576597059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4276giu8Cca385AE="}
