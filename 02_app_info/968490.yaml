    short_description: This is the Skeleton Velocispider skin, which reflects the
      appearance Velocispider takes on when he loses all his HP in his original iOS
      title. While it is purely cosmetic, enjoy hitting your foes with this spooky
      skin just in time for Halloween!

    review: "This skin is op on online man. When you spawn in all other fighter can't\
      \ move because they are too spooked about skeleton on the map. Heck your too\
      \ spooked to make a move making the round endless so everyone will be spooked\
      \ forever. \n\n10/10 would buy again"
