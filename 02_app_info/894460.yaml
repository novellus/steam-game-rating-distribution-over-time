      the conspiracy that forced her to kill in self-defense, but now she needs to
      adjust to normal college life.<br><br>All Lizzie wants is to act like a normal

      isn''t enough to stabilize her, and she finds herself spending a lot of time
      with her knives.<br><br>This visual novels plunges you into the mind of a deeply
      unstable young woman, viewed entirely from her skewed perspective. Your task
      is to find a way for her to be a normal student, a supportive partner, and not
      a serial killer. This is a short visual novel with an emphasis on unreliable
      narration and subtle consequences of the player''s actions.'
