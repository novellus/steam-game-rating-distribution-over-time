    review: 'Generic overpriced mobile port that doesn''t handle well with keyboard
      and mouse over simply tapping the screen. Two different game modes available:
      Tower Defemse and Endless Runner. The first has you lobbing watermelons and
      other hazards like bubbles and explosive snowmen at enemies that approach your
      tent, the other casts you as a mushroom in a standard running scenaerio to grab
      coins. Each zone of each level is broken down into stages you need to earn stars
      to fully complete by meeting objectives that aren''t specified in the TD approach,
      but the ER rerquirementd are standard and include the coins.


      They even include a "Get it on the Google Play store" icon on the lower right
      of thr screen, and it''s probably free. If it is, just get it there. Nothing
      astounding, just surprising frustration from having to click weapons with your
      mouse instead of easily tapping them with your finger. Both modes have been
      better, and both done to death as well.'
