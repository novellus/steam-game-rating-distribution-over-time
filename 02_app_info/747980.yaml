    review: "Innovative block-pushing game.\n\nInstead of pushing as a \"person\"\
      , like in sokuban, \nin this game you click the outsides of the level's \"arena\"\
      , \nwhich pushes all the cubes in that/those row(s) or column(s) at once.\n\n\
      How many rows/columns at once is according to the size of that level's moves\
      \ available, \nwhich you see at the top-middle of the level's screen (in order),\
      \ denoted by how many dots.\nThe goal of each level is to cover all the star-squares\
      \ simultaneously, with blocks.\n\nSmooth controls & rotation available as desired,\
      \ etc.\nDiamond at top-left is to show the in-game/in-level menu."
