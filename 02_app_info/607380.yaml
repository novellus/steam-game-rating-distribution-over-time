      can also be dragged anywhere on the desktop, snapped to the sides, spread across
      multiple pages, or even rolled up with the click of a mouse.<br><br>If you stream
      or create video content, instantly make your desktop viewer friendly by activating
      Fences to eliminate all icons in an easy double-click. Ready to bring them back
