I must say I preferred the first (Pantheon); this has a slightly more generic, forgettable story line and characters. It's also pretty forgettable. I only played it through yesterday, and already I can't separate it out from most of the other HoGs I've played. I do remember it was time spent in an enjoyable way, though, and that once again the variety of the minigames/HoPs was unusually diverse.","timestamp_created":1590574118,"timestamp_updated":1590574118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx97mqvICdKTKigI="}
