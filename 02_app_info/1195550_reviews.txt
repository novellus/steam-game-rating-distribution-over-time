This is literal trash on Steam store. I usually check the reviews before buying this game, but I've accidentally mistaken this game for Game Dev Tycoon which isn't the same thing...obviously. Anyways, this game has no tutorial, no main menu that you can even interact with and if you click anywhere you just go to the game. Weird design, weird gameplay. From what I could discern was that you need to take a look at the colours of the bubbles the dev is thinking about. Tie that with the order of the black board on the left hand side of the garage and you have yourself a winner. But the way it's right now I honestly can't recommend this. Stay well clear of this useless company and the games it develops.","timestamp_created":1608027951,"timestamp_updated":1608027951,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.603221118450164795","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+en7svYCdJ6zugI="}
