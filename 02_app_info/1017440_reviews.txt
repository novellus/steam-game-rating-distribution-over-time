Entertaining to play and ok to buy given the relatively low price, but it does have some annoying issues:\n\n- There are two special categories you can find on each search map, one is trash such as empty cans and bottles, the other are \"souvenirs\" that you see the silhouette of. These objectives often don't work right and are shown as not fulfilled when you finish the map despite them being fulfilled, or the wrong one shows as fulfilled. It also often says there still is trash when there isn't. \n\n- Sometimes you have glitches on the map when objects flicker in and out of the picture. Highly annoying because it disrupts focus. \n\n- The \"dialogues\" between maps sometimes are cut off mid sentence, or there only are a few words. \n\n- The game is extremely Americanised. Some search terms mean little to people who aren't from the US so you don't know what to look for. Same goes for some of the puzzles. \n\nAll in all, so far the game I enjoyed the least in these series.","timestamp_created":1603923969,"timestamp_updated":1603923969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537815093994140625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vrDUuPUCeMbdqgI="}
