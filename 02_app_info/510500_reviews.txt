I played through the tutorial and one custom game (got gobsmacked playing on Brutal). The dev has a great sense of humor and there are easter eggs that you can easily miss if you aren't paying attention. I can only imagine how amazing this game will be once they finish. There's a few things that make you remember it's early access but for the majority of the time, it feels like a finished game. Thanks to the dev for all their hard work.","timestamp_created":1609827517,"timestamp_updated":1609827517,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4pNDM6PYCdIrPwAI="}
