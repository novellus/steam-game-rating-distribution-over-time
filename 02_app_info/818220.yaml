    review: This game has the potential to be utterly Amazing, looks like the programmers
      have abandoned it and not really cared much about other peoples feedback which
      is a shame, yes iv'e reached world 3 first stage where all good things come
      to an abrupt end, its nearly impossible to beat, invincible rockets near the
      end of the stage that are so hard to avoid and when you reach the boss you have
      not got a chance against him with hardly any health left and to make things
      even harder you have basic weapons and can just about afford a floating orb
      to aid you and the end boss as unpredictable attack patterns, hope their fix
      this problem because its ruined the game for me, after saying all that the graphics
      are incredible and Awesome different weapons & charge beam, Amazing variety
      of enemies and super cool bosses, the real influence of this game came from
      R-Type and a shoot em up called Star Blaze which is very similar, please fix
      these small minor issues its not to much too ask, thanks :)
