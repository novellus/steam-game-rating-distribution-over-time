I will add to this review once i'm finished, \nbut this is how i feel at this point. \n\nI am pretty dissapointed in the game. Maybe i just dont get the writing, humor, characters, mechanics and partially artstyle, but it's a little sad to say this, as i really wanted to like this game. I'm playing it with my partner, who already gave up on it. What i really enjoyed tho, was some of the soundtrack (basic game music with miau singing on top) and some small details. \n\nI imagine that the only thing this project might have needed was a stronger hook at the beginning \n(on paper it is really strong, but it was hard to get invested at all) aswell as more choices, even if meaningless, to break up the passive reading every couple of minutes. \n\nSoo that is it for now, i hope that i will learn to like this game and have a great time :D\n\n","timestamp_created":1609305339,"timestamp_updated":1609305339,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x9aE2fYCd+PWvgI="}
