    review: Element Z is one of the lowest grade point and click game I have ever
      played. It's a shame, because although it has good graphics, a lot of things
      have not been fine tuned. It's a step backwards. Not to mention the broken English
      translation used throughout the game. I'd say from the outlook that it's still
      under construction.
