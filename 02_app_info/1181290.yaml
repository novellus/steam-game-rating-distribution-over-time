    about_the_game: 'Meet Aria, a sweet, vibrant, innocent, indecent girl who has
      just recently been dragged into adulthood kicking and screaming. She''s now
      out on her own, and wants a refund from life! She''s down on her luck, but also
      <i>in</i> luck! She''s ripe for the picking, and already has two pickers: Helena,
      her bestest online buddy, who''s trained in the art of fourth-wave feminism,
      and Jim, a man who just ran into her, could probably never love another person
      more than the sight of his own reflection! Over the course of the game, you''ll
      come to understand Aria (or at least try to), and learn what makes her heart
      soar straight into the sun... and what makes her rage. And maybe.. just maybe...
      if you''re lucky, you just might <i>get</i> lucky! All characters are 18+.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2><br>This game is a comedy, but also very NSFW visual
      novel, based off the Sweetest Feminist comic series. The gameplay is based on
      choices that the player makes, and making bad, good, or the best choices. The
      player will not want to make Aria too angry if they wish to progress, but it''s
      really fun to make her angry, though! The game features two modes, 68 choices,
      and 6 endings total. (Some endings are more difficult to access than others.)<h2

    short_description: A comedy, but very NSFW visual novel featuring Aria. She's
      a sweet, vibrant, innocent, indecent girl who is out on her own, but not for
      long! You can eat with her, talk to her, or just stare in awe of what just came
      out of her mouth.

    review: Well it's a dating simulator in which you choose either a male or female
      character and attempt to woo Aria with each person having 3 different endings.
      I got 5 of 6 (couldn't get one of the girls endings). It's okay-ish as a game,
      the good thing is you can skip all dialogue right to a choice dialogue screen
      so you can try for all the endings really quickly. I wasn't really a fan of
      the game but I've never read the Sweetest Feminist comic it's based on so maybe
      I'd be more into the animation and humour if I had been a fan of the comic.
