      better way to spend an evening than gathered around listening to a classic tale
      of a brave hero saving a princess from a sinister demon lord bent on ruling
      the world? Sure, it may be the same story you''ve heard time and time again,
      but don''t old stories get better with age? <br><br>So here we find our usual
      crew. A hero, a demon lord, and a princess all congregating to tell the story
      of the hero''s triumph and the defeat of a great evil. Everyone here know their
      role and exactly how to carry it out. But what happens when the story doesn''t
      go exactly as we know it? What if someone were to rewrite the story to something
      no one within it knows how to enact? Who''s responsibility is it to put the
      story back on its track and find the happy ending we all know and love? <br><br>...Wait,
      didn''t we do this once before? <br><br>Well, let''s do it again, and we''ll

      <br><br>This extended version of original Brave Hero Yuusha is Yuusha as you''ve
      never seen it before! Join the ragtag crew of the Yuusha, Demon Lord, and the
      Princess as they traverse the land to put the story of The Hero and the Demon
      back together and set the world right! Inspired by older console RPGs, Brave
      Hero Yuusha EX features a colorful visual style while keeping that classic adventure
      feel that you''ve come to love from RPGs of the 80s and 90s.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Features:

      AI, and a more satisfying challenge. <br>* Skippable encounters! If you are
      strong enough, flick those mean old random encounters away with the press of

    review: I was poking through games with the RPGmaker tag in the itch.io bundle
      for racial justice looking for something to scratch the Dragon Quest itch, decided
      to give this a shot cause it looked cute, and ended up liking it so much I bought
      it again. Not only is it a lovingly crafted tribute to the Dragon Quest series
      (specifically DQ 1 and 2, I feel) but it's a super fun and charming RPG in its
      own right. The combat is well balanced, you have a lot of tools to work with,
      and it's fast. My ideal JRPG combat is turn-based but still fast enough that
      it feels exciting, and this game nails it. You have the option to skip battles
      you're overleveled for by pressing a button right before the fight starts, and
      that's the way it's meant to be played. I skipped every optional battle and
      never felt underpowered or so overpowered that I didn't have to think about
      each encounter. It's a great mechanic, because players who would rather grind
      still can. It's the perfect length, about 8-10 hours to do everything. The game's
      full of fun surprises and rewards for exploring. I've seen complaints that the
      story is shallow, and sure, Brave Hero Yuusha Ex isn't literature (no video
      game is.) The quote-unquote "story" of a DQ game is always "party of heroes
      goes out to slay ultimate evil threatening the world", and BHYEx doesn't stray
      too far from this standard, but it has a couple fun twists on the usual formula,
      and a couple genuinely heartwarming moments. A DQ game is always about the little
      moments, the charming characters you meet, the weird goofy jokes, the small
      stories you play a part in. Sure, there's always the ultimate evil you have
      to slay to save the world, but it's a formality. It's really about discovering
      new places, making new friends, solving problems, and finding secrets. If that
      sounds like your jam, this game will be your jam.
