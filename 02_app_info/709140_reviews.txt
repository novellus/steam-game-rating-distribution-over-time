[spoiler]Aaron just give the dream back and that's it. [/spoiler]\n-The medals are hard to see, that wouldn't be a problem if some of the levels wouldn't be that fu***** huge for no reason.\n-The attempt at comedy is pretty meh.\n-The maps are randomly choosen, but once you played all of them it cripple the replay value a lot, it's the kind of game that would take advantage a lot of a procedural generation system.\n-The music is atrocious but you can turn it off.\n-Ennemies can cross and shoot trough walls.","timestamp_created":1599149967,"timestamp_updated":1599150378,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwcmyqvQCeLLHnwI="}
