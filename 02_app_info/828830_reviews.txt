He also deleted all the comments on his bad article about the K2 though I saved a screenshot of myself correcting him before he did so.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2126034055\n\nAfter I made a post pointing out that it is kind of rude to just post \"no\" and then lock the thread when a customer suggests something (I had suggested adding the T-34-85 to the game) he perma-banned me for \"spamming.\"\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2125956158\n\nA live-service is only as good as the people working for the company. You have been warned.\n\nUpdate 6/12/2020\n\nThe ban was removed... from Steam by someone working for Valve... but I am now banned from the AW Discord after I made the mistake of asking the mod \"Soren\" for help with the Steam ban. Soren is not even pretending to be decent as you can see. He even brazenly put \"Thanks for the feedback\" as the reason for the ban.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2127547497\n\nSo yeah, Steam is good but at least part of My.games is staffed by proud morons who treat their paying customers like dirt... sad to see a potentially good game in such hands.\n\nOld Review:\n\nThe Zhalo S is an 8-wheeled tank destroyer. It's basically a turret with a quick-firing 85mm gun mounted on a BTR-70 APC chassis. I like it though I don't particularly care for the paint job on this version.\n\nIf you use the Zhalo, you should hide behind MBTs on your team, advance cautiously, and provide fire support. You have a gun that can DPS very rapidly but you won't get many 1-hit kills and you won't survive many hits so be ready to shoot, back up, shoot, back up... rinse and repeat.","timestamp_created":1533697880,"timestamp_updated":1592091292,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlqaC2PICcJLppwE="}
