    about_the_game: "Elite Encounter (EE) is a simple VR shoot them up game. \_The\
      \ goal of the game is to shoot down enemy spaceships with a laser while avoiding\
      \ being hit by enemy laser. \_An unbreakable shield is given to the player to\
      \ block any incoming laser. \_Think of the shield as Captain America's shield.\
      \ \_With such a\_shield, any incoming attack is neutralized.\_<br><br>The game\
      \ play is very challenging in the sense that there are a lot of space ships\
      \ in the sky shooting at you from all angles. \_There is no telling where the\
      \ next shot is coming from. \_Plus, the AI of this game is specifically tuned\
      \ to be very aggressive.<br>\u200B<br>There are three levels of difficulties\
      \ to choose from, namely easy, medium and hard. \_Each level features different\
      \ sky and aggressiveness. \_Due to the different AI, most of the time, a player\
