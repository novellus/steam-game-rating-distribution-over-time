    about_the_game: "Retrovirus is a   six degrees of freedom   shooter which sends\
      \ players into the depths of a computer on a search and destroy mission against\
      \ an invasive virus.  Retrovirus is being created by Cadenza Interactive, the\
      \ indie studio behind the popular tower defense game   Sol Survivor. <br><br><br>Players\
      \ take command of an antivirus program, armed with the tools necessary to erase\
      \ the virus\u2019 very existence from the system.  Movement and exploration\
      \ are core to the gameplay, and players are encouraged to adapt to the demands\
      \ of a world where free flight is the norm.  Of course, the virus is armed to\
      \ fight back, and first person shooter combat features heavily as players test\
      \ their level of comfort with movement within the machine environment.  Each\
      \ player is able to customize their antivirus program with different plugins,\
      \ allowing for a variety of approaches to a given situation.<br><br><br>The\
      \ Retrovirus single player campaign focuses on the core story of the game, with\
      \ the player\u2019s goal being the eradication of the virus and the discovery\
      \ of its origins.  To defeat the virus, the player must solve puzzles, engage\
      \ in dogfight-style combat, and explore the depths of the virtual world.<br><br><br>Retrovirus\
      \ also features multi-player modes, designed to engage players\u2019 social\
      \ and competitive sides.  Co-operative multi-player allows players to complete\
      \ the campaign of the game with a friend, teaming up to restore the system to\
      \ working order.  Competitive multi-player will focus on the core of the six\
      \ degrees of freedom shooter, hearkening back to the action-oriented shooters\
      \ of the late 90\u2019s and early 00\u2019s.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul\

    review: 'nooooo you can''t just power through the whole game with only one weapon
      upgrade!!!!!


      haha dual miniguns go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr


      I should add though, there are great ideas in here. The Internet Browser being
      a train station was definitely my favorite of the areas, and I like the idea
      of the personifications of each of the different programs. The issue with this
      game is the execution. It''s very buggy, and the old engine doesn''t work well
      with newer hardware. The combat is really mindless unfortunately. There''s not
      much strategy to it at all.


      If you''re looking for a good Descent-like though, the devs of the original
      game recently made Overload. Which is a spiritual successor to the series. So
      I''d definitely recommend giving it a look.'
