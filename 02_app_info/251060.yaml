    review: "Eugen games are notorious for their toxic multiplayer.\nThis is the game\
      \ that was so horrible that I have not spent a minute in multiplayer since trying\
      \ this cancerous game.\nHow horrid is it?\nScreaming insults, getting cussed\
      \ at and booted when innocently trying to join an MP game, all the losers that\
      \ spend their life in MP only buy artillery and everyone shoots it all in the\
      \ first minute and then quit out. There is no game at all. Just artillery, shoot,\
      \ type up some cryptic profanity and quit out. I think Eugen are all sociopaths.\
      \ \n\nThis game has a bit oif playability in single player but the AI notoriously\
      \ cheats by spamming units freely while you struggle with very little so it\
      \ is not so fun. Eugen uses bad AI to force you to switch to multiplayer which\
      \ is toxic and cancerous.\n\nNever buy anything from Eugen cause they want to\
      \ sell you hate, frustration and cancer."
