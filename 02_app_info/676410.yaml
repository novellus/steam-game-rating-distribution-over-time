    review: 'This casual point-and-click adventure is barely playable and most gamers
      should avoid it.


      Firstly, the English translation is a total disaster. The grammar is almost
      always wrong, words are mistranslated, and even the English voice actors seem
      barely literate (one of them cannot pronounce the word "mineral" correctly,
      what?). The translation is sometimes comically bad, but the comedy quickly wears
      off.


      Secondly, the game engine is a clunky and buggy mess. It''s very hard to get
      things done in the game, and sometimes this even gets in the way of completing
      objectives.


      That said, there is a hidden gem underneath. Despite being a fairly short game,
      its world is beautifully realized and there is a deep background story, which
      is worthy of a much grander game.


      But let''s not get too excited even about that one bright point! The potential
      is squandered by bad storytelling. For example: an entire sequence involves
      you trying to make your uncle a cup of coffee just the way he likes it. This
      "quest" has nothing to do with the adventure, the story, or anything else, and
      is a good example of how this story is narrated.'
