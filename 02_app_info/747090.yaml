      since from robotization of Earth in 2052 world has never been same. Many question
      if artificial intelligence can really be considered an intelligence same as
      human one. Constant revolts calls for stop making robots smarter and smarter.

    review: "Pros: \n- Alice's voice is cute.\n- Feel the desolation of being stranded\
      \ in space.\n- Always cool to visit other planets.\n\nCons: \n- In just one\
      \ of the dialogue lines, Alice's voice will suddenly be replaced by a loud,\
      \ harsh sounding machine, unintentionally causing an audio jump scare. It would\
      \ be better to have no voice for that line, than to replace her voice with that\
      \ horrifying robot.\n\n- The first puzzle I did was intentionally designed in\
      \ such a way that it will randomly be unsolvable, forcing you to restart from\
      \ the beginning until you get lucky enough that it's in a solvable state at\
      \ the end. This is because [spoiler]sliding puzzles are not meant to have duplicate\
      \ pieces. There's no distinguishing between orange block #1 and orange block\
      \ #2.[/spoiler]\n\n- The second puzzle I did with the pillars and lights bugged\
      \ out and stopped functioning completely, forcing me to restart the entire game\
      \ from a new save file. Also, the audio hints had nothing to do with the puzzle,\
      \ and I had to look up a walkthrough to solve it.\n\nSo far it seems like the\
      \ game is just padding the playtime hours out with bugs and disrespect for the\
      \ player's time. Will update review next time I play.\n\nUpdate:\n\n- The third\
      \ puzzle was fun, but only because [spoiler] it was Minesweeper. I actually\
      \ had more fun with this Minesweeper variant than any other part of the game.[/spoiler]\n\
      \n- The fourth puzzle wasn't so bad, but then you have to do it five times in\
      \ a row without saving or quitting. No respect for the player's time.\n\n- The\
      \ fifth puzzle I did seemed designed to just take up time, not brainpower, to\
      \ solve.\n\n- The end of the game made me [spoiler]laugh[/spoiler].\n\n- I saw\
      \ that my playtime exceeded 2 hours, making a refund impossible. From this point\
      \ of view, the game is an overwhelming success. It was designed to take longer\
      \ than 2 hours to complete, and that was achieved. Well played, developer.\n\
      \nUpdate 2: \n\n6 months later, I've come back and changed my review to be marked\
      \ as recommended. The planets and puzzles in this game stuck in my memory. But\
      \ much more importantly, I can still hear the ship AI's gentle voice in my mind,\
      \ soothing me in my darkest moments. Her name was Alice..."
