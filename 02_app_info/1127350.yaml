    review: "While obviously a step forward, and with much better graphics, the game\
      \ still leaves too much than that it would be enjoyable:\n\n- There still is\
      \ no soundtrack\n- The world feels lifeless, as there is nothing than walls\
      \ and ground\n- There is no information or tooltips ingame\n- The UI is bad\n\
      - The tutorial is VERY basic\n- There is no story or campaign\n\n- Most important\
      \ of all: The battles are - very- boring: \nBoth players heal, silence and disable\
      \ their creatures all the time, so that the simplest of battles take forever.\n\
      To make things even worse, the available mana increases every turn, and players\
      \ cannot replace weak creatures on the board, so that an early advantage means\
      \ nothing, and it comes to stale boards with weak creatures very fast...\n\n\
      There still is good potential in the formula, but it obviously needs a lot of\
      \ polish and refinement to work..."
