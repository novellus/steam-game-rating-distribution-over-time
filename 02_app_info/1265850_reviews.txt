I was struggling a bit my first few minutes of playing, and someone was nice enough to help me get to level 5 and teach me some of the different game mechanics. I think having a group of friends playing this game like a chat based DND would be the best way to play it. If you are looking for a cheap but fun group game, this would definitely be a good one.","timestamp_created":1609624387,"timestamp_updated":1609624387,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ429/F4vYCc/nuvwI="}
