    review: '[b][u]Game Information[/u][/b]


      "Tales of Terror: Crimson Dawn" is a Hidden Object Puzzle Adventure game. The
      game was  developed by Deep Shadows and published by Big Fish Games Studio.


      "Crimson Dawn" is the first episode of "Tales of Terror."


      [b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]


      Game Visuals


      I want to mention that the visuals for the game are nicely done. The visuals
      can be adjusted in the game''s option menu.


      Game Audio


      I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio
      is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game''s
      option menu as well.


      Gameplay


      There are three different game difficulty modes to choose from: Casual; Expert
      and Professional.


      The notebook keeps track of the progression in the game. Such as story events
      and clues.


      There is an interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel
      between each location quickly. It also indicates that there are certain tasks
      that need to be completed at certain locations within the game. The interactive
      map is automatically given at the start of the game.


      There is no padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in
      place. The inventory panel is stationary.


      There are some interactive items in the game. Some of the interactive items
      may require extra components before they can be interacted with. All interactive
      items are marked with a symbol at one of the corners.


      The hidden object scenes consist of the following: Fragmented items; Shadow
      items; Find ''x'' amount; Traditional word lists. Some of these hidden object
      scenes may require little or no interaction. Most of the hidden object scenes
      can be replayed in the game''s extra feature section.


      There is an optional mini-game: Associated Pairs. It is only available during
      hidden object scenes.


      The puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of
      them. Most of the puzzles can be replayed in the game''s extra feature section
      as well.


      There is a collectible in the game: Scrolls. They are scattered throughout the
      game for the player to find.


      There are morphing objects (beyond objects) in the game. They are scattered
      throughout the game for the player to find as well.


      Miscellaneous


      Final thoughts; I have found the game enjoyable to certain extent. The replay
      value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game''s
      full price value.'
