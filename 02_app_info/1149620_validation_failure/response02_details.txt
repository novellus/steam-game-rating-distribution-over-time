Get rid of the broken furniture, fix up the walls, paint and decorate. Just don’t spend all your cash on the looks right away, you bought a gas station after all.

The truckers want a healthy meal and a shower while the Tesla driver wants a Latte while he waits for his car to charge up. Expand the range of services you offer by adding stations, buildings and appropriate equipment. Why not expand and build a shop area, build a car wash station or even a small motel?
