But this game is a buggy mess and constantly crashes, as of 2020 i would say look for something better.","timestamp_created":1421082967,"timestamp_updated":1579951370,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8ZWc7u8CevqfNQ=="}
