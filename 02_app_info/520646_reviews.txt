However, if you enjoy the game the story makes alot of sense and leaves you with some good topics of philosophical debate. I do not wish to bring in spoilers, therefore the review will be different from your normal review type. \n\nI really enjoy the depth the author brought in the reasoning, though in my opinion the scenario in itself is a bit simplistic and over the edge of utopiah (almost as bad as Star Treck). By reasoning I mean the author obviously put some serious thought behind each individual reply and gives you so much to think about that you can't just say this is a bad guy. Actually, I had a hard time, and still do, to pin the <<evil>> tag on the right donkey. \n\nThe end is open. I hope there will be a sequel.","timestamp_created":1539992227,"timestamp_updated":1539992227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.605068624019622803","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y5Gsx+YCd4D+rAE="}
