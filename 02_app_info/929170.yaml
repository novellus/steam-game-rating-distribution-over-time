    review: 'This game was a early adapter on phone VR experiences brought over to
      PC

      (Owned it on Mobile playing with Samsung Gear VR Note Edition originally)


      Its Very Much a story driven experience, but theres a bit more freedom to look
      around now on PC compare to mobile, but at the time this came out, mobile VR
      wasnt a very big market, and the VR rendering they did in it, is nice!!


      but if your used to reading your way though VN''s this is a kinetic novel but
      the story is good enough that it might make you shed some tears in your VR headset
      ^^


      over all, yes, its alot of Reading witht alittle VR sprinked in, but its a nice
      read, and credit is owed where credit is due for them being a early adapter
      in the Anime VR market =D'
