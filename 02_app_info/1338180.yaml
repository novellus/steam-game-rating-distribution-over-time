    detailed_description: "<h1>About the author</h1><p>Dungeon Scale is the creation\
      \ of me, Aaron, the sole indie game developer at Midnight Fair Games. I came\
      \ about the idea for this project whilst searching for fun four player games\
      \ to play with my wife and kids. We already really loved the competitiveness\
      \ of games like TowerFall and Tricky Towers, and I was so impressed with how\
      \ the mechanics of these games allowed for balanced game play whilst still making\
      \ it feel like the best player won the day. There seemed to be a big hole right\
      \ where the idea for Dungeon Scale would fit and I really wanted to see if I\
      \ could make something even half as fun as the other great games out there.\
      \ Hopefully I have managed what I set out to do and I hope my game will bring\
      \ some joy and happiness to your homes as it has with mine, it has been quite\
      \ the journey.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>Dungeon Scale is a couch multiplayer\

    review: Have to say this game is very fun to play with a few friends, while on
      my PC having 3 xbox controllers and using my Keyboard it has been a blast and
      lots of laughs.   Don't let the simple look put you off, this is old school
      classic game play that is not only fun but also fun with friends while sitting
      on the Couch.
