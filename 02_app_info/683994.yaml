    review: "\"Hey, want to try the Missions expansion?\"\n\"No.\"\n- [i]Every person\
      \ I've ever played with outside the App.[/i]\n\nI enjoy having it in matches\
      \ against the AI, but in more serious competitive scenarios it can become aggravating,\
      \ because:\n\n1) With one or two outliers, the missions themselves are incredibly\
      \ easy to complete, with the simpler ones being along the lines of [i]'play\
      \ a Trade Fed ship while you have a Trade Fed base in play'[/i]. Probably the\
      \ most difficult to complete IMO is 'activate ally abilities from two factions\
      \ in the same turn', but late game that becomes an inevitability if you've thinned\
      \ your deck appropriately (or are stacking dual-faction cards from the other\
      \ United expansions). To illustrate how easy this is: after getting the expansion,\
      \ I beat the hard AI something like 6 times in a row with missions victories.\n\
      \n2) Tying into the above, pulling off Missions victories feels strangely unsatisfying\
      \ when you're the one doing it; and insanely frustrating when it's being done\
      \ to you. I mean when someone is like 2 HP away from losing against an opponent\
      \ with 100 HP but then wins anyway because hey he had two outposts in play to\
      \ beat his third mission. ... Okay?\n\nI think the core concept is pretty interesting,\
      \ TBH. Getting rewards (typically 'draw a card', 'get 10 authority', 'acquire\
      \ 2 explorers for free' etc) from completing the missions can give you a nice\
      \ momentum boost and change a normal turn into a great turn. \n\nSometimes the\
      \ heart of the cards is very much stacked against you, though, and you'll have\
      \ multiple missions that push you in a certain direction. Getting a 3-draw of\
      \ 'play Blob base + blob ship in 1 turn\", 'play 3 ships of same faction in\
      \ same turn', and 'have two bases of same faction in play' would naturally lead\
      \ you to think: \"Well, I guess I should try to stack Blob as much as I can\
      \ in this game\"; but then you get one of those games where blob shows up so\
      \ very little that following this strategy would be suicide. Ah, RNG.\n\nI feel\
      \ that in a true tabletop setting, a variety of 'house rules' might improve\
      \ Missions:\n- Don't give victory on 3 completions, because most people hate\
      \ that.\n- Allow draft pick of Missions, helping you sort for a more cohesive\
      \ strategy\n- Try having fewer or more missions per player\n- Try having all\
      \ missions available to all players at all times; or, alternately, have a kind\
      \ of 'trade row' for missions where new ones become available once others are\
      \ completed. Heck, maybe even allow for Blob cards to scrap missions in said\
      \ trade row.\n\nSadly, none of these are possible in the App, because that's\
      \ how it is.\n\nNote 1: This is a plus in my book. I've noted that, while it\
      \ would be a distinct possibility in the physical card game, the App never actually\
      \ gives you more than 2 Missions of the 'play X ship while X base is in play'\
      \ variety, so as to overtly force you into doing a triple-faction deck.\n\n\
      Note 2: There are no additional promo ships or bases hidden away in this deck\
      \ AFAIK (something they did with Gambits, giving you the Merc Cruiser in set\
      \ 1 and Year-2 promo cards in set 2), and I've been playing with them activated\
      \ for a couple months now. You get the missions, as advertised, and that's it.\n\
      \nNote 3: Gambits, dual-faction cards and events can make some of these (even\
      \ more) trivially easy to complete. For example, there is a mission of 'Play\
      \ 7 ships in the same turn', which seems like it should be something you complete\
      \ once you have a few ships with the 'Draw 1' ability, right? Well, unless you\
      \ get that event on turn 1 that lets you draw two cards ... or you have the\
      \ gambit that lets you draw two cards ... then you just complete it immediately,\
      \ even if you haven't built your deck for it. Likewise (but actually kinda a\
      \ good thing?) the 'Secret Outpost' gambit becomes much better with Missions\
      \ enabled because it becomes a kind of synergistic wildcard that makes completing\
      \ one of the 'play X ship with X base in play' cards very easy to complete.\n\
      \nNote 4: Similar to secret outpost above, Warning Beacon becomes a much better\
      \ and more opportunistic card if you have the 'play a Machine Cult ship and\
      \ have a Machine Cult base out in play in the same turn' mission."
