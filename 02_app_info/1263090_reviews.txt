While it is aimed towards kids and young ones, it still pulled me in with the gameplay that makes you mix and choose the right colors to defeat enemies and progress. It is a fairly challenging, yet rewarding fun little game. It is aimed towards children which helps them learn about colors and thinking skills to defeat enemies. However, this sweet little gem pulled me in and I recommend it not only for children, but for people who like a fun little nostalgic game that reminds them of their future, while being fun.","timestamp_created":1604613510,"timestamp_updated":1604613510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt+KazfUCdJLHrAI="}
