      notes: Dawnshadow includes the optional ability to remove the underwear from
        the playable characters, presenting players with 8-bit, low-resolution nudity.
        No other nudity is included, so you will not encounter nudity of any sort
        unless you specifically go looking for it.

    review: Fun game done in a retro style, which is always a plus.  The only downside,
      is that it has no "turbo" feature to speed up the sluggish battles, and tends
      to bog down with farming and grinding.  Cheat engine speedhack won't even work;
      not that I've found anyways.  Still, interesting game.
