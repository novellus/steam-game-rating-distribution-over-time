    about_the_game: Do you often think of what is there, beneath the towns and the
      cities we live in? Sewer systems, bombshelters, scientific objects... <br>Are
      you ready to find yourself in a place on the edge of the reality plane you are
      used to? <br><br>That day promised nothing bad. But a usual walk with a girlfriend
      ended up in runnung for ones lives from bandits, which lead the main characters
      into strange catacombs, where the usual laws of the universe fail. You will
      have to pass tough tests and to overcome yourself. <br><br>The Agony is a visual
      novel from the authors of &quot;Sixtieth Kilometer&quot;. <br><br>The plot movement
      depends on the player's decisions, each leading to its own consequences. <br><strong>There
      are four different endings, based on the choices you make in the first part
      of the game.</strong><br><br>The novelet genre gravitates toward pseudo-scifi
      rather than unexplicable misticism.
