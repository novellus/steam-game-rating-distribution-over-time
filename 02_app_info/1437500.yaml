    review: 'First of all this one has the best hub and easily the most story and
      charachter, lotsa dialogues, we actually get to know what the first 2 games
      were hinting at.

      This collection also probably has some of the best games, however also some
      really boring ones.


      Bete Grise: Great but wouldn''t complete

      Bubbo: decent but the camera was beyond awful

      Chip''s Tips: As usual Torple Dook bringing us bangers

      Disparity of the Dead: Tried completing this game thrice and it bugs out and
      blackscreens near the end every time, but hey, if it wasn''t decent i wouldn''t
      have tried completing it thrice.

      Eden: Kinda boring, not hard and it works tho.

      Matter over Mind: It''s ok.

      Nice Screams: decent and great music

      Reactor: One of the best in this collection

      Sato Wonderland: same review as for Reactor

      Soul Waste: Controls pretty badly, no clue what the fuck''s happening, tried
      it a few times but never completed it.

      SpookWare: worse WarioWare

      Submission: Very good, both funny and creepy. Probably my favourite, i actually
      finished it twice.


      All in all, good thing you didn''t have to complete games in the collection
      otherwise i''d be missing 3 games with no idea what to do for 1 and bugs stopping
      me from beating the other 2.'
