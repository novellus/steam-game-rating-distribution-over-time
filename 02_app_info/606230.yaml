    review: "Thea is such a wonderful game to play. It has a calming and soothing\
      \ effect on me. Just being sucked in to the world of Thea is a joy in itself,\
      \ but the gathering, crafting and building are great too. \nAlso the card based\
      \ fights are cool, although I still have a lot to learn there.\nThe lore is\
      \ presented via beautiful drawings and well written stories. \nI did play the\
      \ first Thea and this is much the same in many aspects, just worked out better\
      \ in my opinion. \nOnce I get further in I might add to this review but the\
      \ game already is worth every cent I paid for it."
