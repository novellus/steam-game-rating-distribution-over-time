Instead, the otherwise deserted streets are populated only by grotesque monsters bearing a vague resemblance to the neighbours who, just days ago, saw Shaun off with a smile. Shaun’s plan is clear: get home as quickly as possible, save his wife and daughter and escape from the hellscape he once called home.
