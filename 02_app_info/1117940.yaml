    review: "What sold me on this DLC was realizing that it wasn't just new characters,\
      \ but enemy choice and placement in levels was also changed. Some level traps\
      \ were also slightly altered.\n\nAs a result, it's not just new character movements\
      \ and abilities, but whole levels to re-learn as well. Sadly, Kurona's levels\
      \ don't have as many changes as the other two, though there are still some subtle\
      \ ones. Ray and Copen however each have very different enemy placement compared\
      \ to the original game.\n\nAs for the characters themselves:\n\nRay:\nWith the\
      \ claw, and the aerial dash that damages enemies, gameplay is built on close\
      \ combat, which is just perfect for the game's scoring and combo system. It\
      \ is highly satisfying to move around and avoid enemy shots until you're close\
      \ enough and unleash the highly damaging claw attacks.\nDo yourself a favour\
      \ and forget that the \"bullet\" attack even exists and focus entirely on the\
      \ claw and the dashes. \nThough as a result, Ray's game system has very few\
      \ customization possible, since most of it is related to the \"bullet\" shots,\
      \ which in Ray's case, is better un-used.\nHowever, Ray is probably the one\
      \ with the most and best enemy placement changes, which really take his 2 main\
      \ moves into consideration: dash into several flying enemies in a row, then\
      \ land and claw the next enemy, and so on.\n\nKoruna: \nDo yourself a favour\
      \ and unlock the spear drop attack ASAP, which can be acquired once you're past\
      \ the intro stage. This attack defines Kurona's playstyle and without it, she\
      \ otherwise plays very much like Ekoro.\nThis sprear drop attack is just like\
      \ the pogo jump in the Duck Tales game series, and again, being a close combat\
      \ attack, is just perfect for the game's scoring and combo system. There is\
      \ a lot of freedom of movement with this move, and once you unlock the hovering\
      \ ability on top of it, you'll just be bouncing from enemy heads to enemy heads\
      \ constantly, and again the result is very satisfying.\n\nCopen:\nDue to helping\
      \ combat pod, he is the one with the most customization options. You can customize\
      \ both your own shots and the combat pods, meaning there are tons of different\
      \ possible combinations.\nCopen also has aerial dashes that can be performed\
      \ diagonally which gives him more air maneuveribility and overall speed than\
      \ any other character.\n\nSadly, there result of this is that for the most part\
      \ it's not too compatible with the game's combo system. Due to the faster pace\
      \ and the added pod attacks, it is very easy to accidentally hit enemies in\
      \ the distance as they spawn and therefore ruin your scoring streak. So for\
      \ the most part, I'd just use the \"Phalanx\" attack for the pod, which acts\
      \ like a shield.\n\nConclusion:\nI think I had more fun playing with Ray and\
      \ Kurona than with any of the original game characters.\nIn the original game\
      \ the scoring/combo system felt like it was added on top of the game to add\
      \ a challenge, even though most attacks risked ruining your combo.\nIn this\
      \ DLC, with Ray and Kurona being centered around close combat, the combo system\
      \ shines under a new light; and even if you don't care about the scoring, the\
      \ playstyle of all 3 characters is very different from those of the original\
      \ game, which, on top of the new enemy placements, warrant a playthrough.\n\n\
      P.S: I can't believe I'm the first non Japenese review for this DLC\nP.P.S:\
      \ I'd still pay for a PC port of Azure Striker Gunvolt 2, it's never too late\
      \ IC! Edit: well, there is one now on Steam!"
