      \ /><br><br><strong>Story</strong><br><br>The story is set in Momiji, a fictional\
      \ city with a high crime rate. It is not uncommon there to hear of deaths and\
      \ missing persons every morning in the news reports. But even among these issues\
      \ there is a figure, an urban legend, that stands above all, an assassin known\
      \ only by the nickname \u201CRED\u201D. His murders are most brutal and inexplicable,\
      \ with all of its victims being found with broken organs and bones, with their\
      \ insides reduced to a bloody pulp.  <br><br>The protagonist, Ichirou, is a\
      \ young man who has recently moved back to Momiji and reunites with an old childhood\
      \ friend, but also he meets a strange girl in school who has a clear crush on\
      \ him. As the story progresses new feelings will be born and he will have to\
      \ choose which girl he likes the most, which could lead to unexpected consequences.<br><br><strong>Features</strong>\
      \ <br><br>+ Over 100 000 words long story line.     <br>+ Includes a battle\
      \ mini-game to add more interaction to the game. <br>+ 2 different game routes,\
      \ one for each heroine.  <br>+ 4 endings per route, for a grand total of 8 \
      \ (counting bad endings).<br>+ 25 full screen CG's illustrate key moments in\
      \ the story.<br>+ Mystery, Romance, Action, supernatural."

    review: "otro fant\xE1stico juego de eternal night studios, cada juego que sacan\
      \ me gusta mas, cuanto mas tiempo jugaba  mas quer\xEDa jugarlo. no creo pero\
      \ espero que saquen otro igual o mejor que este aunque lo veo dif\xEDcil,los\
      \ combates son algo nuevo e innovador que a este juego le ha venido de perlas,yo\
      \ pondr\xEDa el ultimo combate en original mas f\xE1cil,mor\xED 23 veces contadas.voy\
      \ a echar de menos la historia de Tanaka muriendo a cada rato.Yo lo compre en\
      \ oferta por 2,50 euros, 12.50 me es un poco caro pero lo pagar\xEDa. lo recomiendo,\
      \ si intentas hacerlo todo tendr\xE1s unas 22h  de magnifica historia. Y me\
      \ gustar\xEDa que pudieran dejar poner los logros y el juego en los expositores\
      \ de tu perfil, para ponerlo junto a trick and treat"
