    review: I'm baffled by the fact that this, released just six months ago, is filled
      with egregious jpeg compression artifacts all over the table's textures when
      Pinball Arcade hasn't had that problem in years. Star Trek is a great game of
      pinball but the image quality issues are completely unacceptable, especially
      at a pretty premium price point. Get your act together and fix this, FarSight.
      I love you guys... but encountering issues like this, especially alongside the
      application itself being buggy, is not cool.
