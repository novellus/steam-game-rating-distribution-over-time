    review: 'I actually super enjoyed this game it was an absolute banger it took
      me forever how to figure out how to use the items because I''m dumb but had
      a ton of fun playing through it controls pretty well and cursive''s a bit hard
      to read for me I''m a bit out of practice it was an insanely short game but
      for 49 cents I feel like I got a good return on my money. my play through here:
