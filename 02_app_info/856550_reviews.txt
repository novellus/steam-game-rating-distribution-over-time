Good instructions and desciptions of the enemies, all easy to understand. Fun graphics and music while you play. As you level up you unlock different gamemodes with new enemies to defeat and new skins for Stabby (and bigger swords).\nThere is a practice mode well worth trying to get the hang of the game or just to relax. You want to have your battleplan ready to become king Stabby. I am still working on that one, it's very hard!\nUnique game I am enjoying immensely. Well worth the price for an already polished game in development. Impressive! Well done to the developers!\nNew enemies?  New strategies? New abilities? Can't wait for updates!","timestamp_created":1528402118,"timestamp_updated":1528402118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.421087652444839478","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw17D37eMCeMuuogE="}
