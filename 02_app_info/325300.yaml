    about_the_game: <strong>BEARZERKERS</strong> is a local multiplayer game of two
      halves, with a focus on indirect combat and avoidance. <strong>HUNT</strong>
      pits you and your friends against each other; where you don't need to run faster
      than the bear to survive, just faster than the person next to you. <strong>GAUNTLET</strong>
      is the ultimate game of moment to moment cooperation where every second counts
      and a single slip up can be the end for you and your team.<h2 class="bb_tag">Game
      Modes:</h2><br><strong>HUNT</strong> <br>Trap other players using rock walls,
      and activate your powerups at just the right moment on your way to killing the
      hell out of everyone. The end goal of HUNT is simple, be the last Critter left
      with the Bear. HUNT is a last man standing scenario with a variable number of
      bears, lives, and powerups, spread across a broad selection of open, twisting
      maps.<br><br><strong>GAUNTLET</strong> <br>The second mode however is about
      moment to moment cooperation through the chaos. In GAUNTLET players must work
      together and use their skills in tandem to reach the end of a deliriously dangerous
      death zone. Here, a single touch from any of the enemies within means death,
      though other players can save each other with a touch of their own. As you progress
      you level up and become more powerful, but with equal measure the challenge
      is raised. This mode is also playable alone for extra challenge.<h2 class="bb_tag">The
      Goods:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Painstakingly created beautiful 3D world with
      a lovely hand painted art style.<br></li><li>Powerups galore await you in Hunt
      to give you the edge, as well as totally different abilities and gameplay for
      your Critter pals in Gauntlet.<br></li><li>Inappropriately kickass soundtrack
      and sounds from musician Tommy Gough.</li></ul>

    review: "I first played this game in 2014 at Pax in Seattle. I eventually walked\
      \ away from the demo realizing I played one of the best party games I've ever\
      \ seen. I've tried to keep up with it's development, but life (and my own indie\
      \ studio) got in the way. A couple of us were reminiscing about Bearzerkers\
      \ today at our studio and I decided do check-in on it. AND THEN WE PLAYED FOR\
      \ THE NEXT TWO HOURS! \n\nI'm so excited for this game and the developers, as\
      \ I remember them in 2014, are great people. Please buy this game and share\
      \ it with your friends. =)\n\n*An actual review*\n\nThe game has simple mechanics...\
      \ you move, you kick up ground, and there are powerups. That's it. And it's\
      \ all you need. You run from bears, you kick up ground to block your friends\
      \ in hopes of them getting eaten, and you survive. The music is fine, the escalating\
      \ bears is exciting, and the party replayability is amazing. 9/10, WILL PLAY\
      \ AGAIN."
