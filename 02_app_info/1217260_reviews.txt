My BIGGEST complaint, and a potential deal breaker for those who get motion sickness easily; STOP TEARING OUR VIEW AWAY FROM US! There is little more jarring than being in the middle of a fight to have your view shoot to the side just for a cinematic shot of your partner running and jumping. \nAll that said, i do recommend this game, but on sale.","timestamp_created":1606419134,"timestamp_updated":1609201830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh+n51fYCfOnnsgI="}
