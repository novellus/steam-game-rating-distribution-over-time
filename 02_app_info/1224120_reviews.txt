This game is the prime example of a great concept but very poor execution. Duplicate character models just take you out of the immersion and just straight up ruin the entire experience. Sometimes you will have a student or the teacher catch you out of nowhere with no warning whatsoever. And those are just a few examples. I also wish there was more strategy to jerking off besides just spamming your keyboard, maybe you could stroke your cock with your mouse to change the speed and intensity. This could provide different strategy's that would help the game play loop. Maybe you would want to go slower to avoid detection, or you could go in hot to get the job done fast, the choice would be up to you. But those aren't even close to being the biggest problem with the game. My biggest issue is that it is completely unrealistic. In my experience it is usually a lot harder for people to catch you in the act while in class. In real life you can also use things such as your backpack or maybe even a sweater or hoodie to cover your junk from unsuspecting peers. This game has a lot of potential but honestly I don't have faith in the devs to deliver a worth while product. So at-least for now, save your money.","timestamp_created":1610009899,"timestamp_updated":1610009899,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/62E7vYCfOicwQI="}
