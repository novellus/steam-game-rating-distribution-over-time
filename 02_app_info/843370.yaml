    about_the_game: Putting the power of gravity in the player's hands, Gravity Well
      takes inspiration from the beloved puzzle/platformer genre to bring forth those
      elements alongside the ability to use the concept of the power of gravity to
      solve puzzles. <br><br>In Gravity Well, the player will have to utilize their
      wits as well the power of the prototype device, the &quot;Gravity Well&quot;
      or &quot;G-W&quot; for short, to solve puzzles and to complete their mission
      of acquiring two high value objects from a derelict space research station.
      Gravity Well features no direct combat, and instead focuses on the player's
      ability analyze and observe their surroundings and then find the solution to
      progress forward to unlock more of the station. Gravity Well's main gameplay
      will feature running, jumping, ducking, firing the Gravity Well to produce object
      manipulating singularities, as well as learning when to time their actions to
      progress, all to provide the player an enjoyable first-person, puzzle platformer
      experience. <br><br>They'll unlock upgrades that will add to the abilities of
      the device, as well as uncover a story revolved around the device itself and
      the power it represents, but the core focus of the game will lie in solving
      the game's puzzle rooms, all the way to the very end. <br><br><br><br> <h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><br>-<strong>Challenging
      Puzzles</strong> - Some puzzles will come quick; Some will see the player observing
      the room in it's entirety to figure out the solution. Never forget, the power
      of gravity is yours!<br><br>-<strong>Positive/Negative Singularities</strong>
      - The power to push and pull heavy objects at your command! Understanding when
      and where to push and pull objects to solve puzzles or create pathways will
      see the player progress!<br><br>-<strong>Singularity Tethers</strong> - Never
      question your singularity's influence! Singularities come with visible tethers
      so that you'll always know what can and can't be affected!<br><br>-<strong>Time
      Singularity</strong> - Time is on your side! Sometimes pushing and pulling just
      won't do, and a time singularity is the only thing preventing you from being
      crushed! Slow machinery and objects to make your own time, and get what you
      need to get done!<br><br>-<strong>Platforming</strong> - Be fit! This station
      isn't just going to hand you what you came for; you'll need to work those legs
      and put in some effort by jumping and ducking in tandem with your singularities
      to solve puzzles and go places!<br><br>-<strong>Story and Dialogue</strong>
      - Carpel Tunnel! There's a reason you're here, and by golly it better be a good
      one! Figure out why a lucrative but secret contract has you searching a space
      station on the fringes of space and two empires, as well as understand the purpose
      of the station itself and the power you wield in your hands...<br><br>-<strong>Fully
      voiced AI, data logs and contractor dialogue</strong> - Lend us your ears! Our
      game is entirely voiced by several of the team's developers as well as Twitch
      streamers, to provide another level of immersion to the game!<br><br>-<strong>24
      Puzzle Rooms</strong> Come for the visuals, stay for the puzzles! 24 different
      puzzles meant to introduce the player to the device, begin challenging the player
      to think of new ways to solve puzzles, and finally put players to the test to
      utilize all of their possible actions and make it off this station alive!<br><br>-<strong>And
      More!</strong> - Stuff!

    review: "When I heard one developer's post discussing the game's features, I finally\
      \ gave it a go at a nice price. After playing a couple of hours until the end,\
      \ I have to say this is pretty awesome game with a great concept of gravity/time\
      \ manipulation! If you like solving puzzles or mazes similar to Portal, this\
      \ is the game for you. \n\nPros:\n> Great animation and effects with controls\
      \ similar to most Valve games.\n> Challenging puzzles with satisfactory upgrades.\n\
      > Added story line to make your purpose at the test site more interesting.\n\
      \nCons:\n> Epilepsy warning! Your tool and certain obstacles will produce bright\
      \ (and sometimes sudden) colors.\n> Free falling speed varies between normal\
      \ running and sprinting, which could make maneuverability a bit tricky.\n> Setting\
      \ very high graphics may result in variable (but minor) game lag.\n\nConsiderations:\n\
      > Control adjustments should be in-game, not before the game starts.\n> Exploration\
      \ is key even if certain areas may need more guidance.\n> In-game voice acting\
      \ and audio are not the greatest, but doable for gameplay."
