Despite being packed with RPG elements, there's very little randomness involved and all battles are one-time only, so it's mostly about just being prepared and good at the battle QTEs.  Edges maybe a little too far in how much time you have to spend farming, but it does act as a low point to give the game's few really good jumpscares room to breathe.\n\nAround 3-4 hours to complete.","timestamp_created":1609715674,"timestamp_updated":1609715719,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tZOi5fYCeomdwAI="}
