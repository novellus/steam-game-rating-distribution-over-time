    about_the_game: "This game combines the beauty of meditative relaxation with a\
      \ playable video game experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou'll start off as a Deity\
      \ within the void, an area which exists outside of space and time. From within\
      \ this void you'll have access to a range of different worlds where you can\
      \ embody a unique creature in each.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn each world you'll\
      \ be able to explore the environment accompanied by a plethora of meditative\
      \ music. Once traveling to the final warp gate in each world you'll be sent\
      \ back to the void and allowed to enter a new world as another creature, until\
      \ of course you reach the final level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game most easily\
      \ fits into the genre of 'Walking Simulator'. If you mainly just love to enjoy\
      \ beautiful worlds, walking, flying, running, and just exploring to magical\
      \ music without the worry of solving puzzles or fighting, then this game is\
      \ for you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTotal play time is expected to be an average of\
      \ about 2 hours."
