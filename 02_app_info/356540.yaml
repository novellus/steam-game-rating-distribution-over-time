      Morita (name is changeable) was given a chance to try the latest virtual game
      attraction, East Tower. Within the game, players can transform into whatever
      they want to. Sakuya chose to transform into a man. She was excited at first,
      but then a sudden accident happened and she was trapped with four other men.
      Later, they decided to partner up and proceed to beat the game in pairs, hoping
      that it would be the way out.<br><br><br>Before Sakuya decided who she would
      pick, a pretty woman came and asked her to be her partner. Even though she appears
      to be a pretty woman, she should be a man in real life, since all the participants

    review: "This is the second game in the East Tower Series so I'm writing this\
      \ assuming you played the first and wondering if the second game is worth it\n\
      \nI like this game a lot more than the first game! Takashi is a lot more charming\
      \ of a partner character imo than the first volumes guy. I also really like\
      \ the chemistry of him and Sakuya and how they both struggle a bit with gender\
      \ identity. I feel like him and Sakuya have a history which makes it easier\
      \ for me to ship him with Sakuya and gets rid of the Romeo and Juliet syndrome\
      \ of falling in love with someone within a few hours. It felt like this game\
      \ gave a lot more insight into Sakuyas past and how she became the way she is.\
      \ I appreciated how Takashi reinforces that he loves Sakuya whether Sakuya identifies\
      \ as a guy or girl, saying he fell in love with Sakuya both when he thought\
      \ she was a guy and a girl. As a trans male myself seeing a character being\
      \ supportive of a person going through problems with gender identity and telling\
      \ them they love them regardless is something really powerful to see.  \n\n\
      If you played the first and liked it I view the second as pretty much nothing\
      \ but improvements. Considering some of the things Kuon says in this volume\
      \ were a little eyebrow raising so i'm personally looking forward to playing\
      \ the 3rd volume myself."
