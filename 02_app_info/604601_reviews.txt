On the other, it's the only way to get a 4th character in your party, thus making it a fairly big powerup. Also, the DLC characters are mutually exclusive, which is hilarious given that the only \"reasonable\" way to buy them is a pack with all of them.\n\nAnyway this stock art dude replicates your first-slot character, but starts 4 levels higher. Or like one fight's worth fairly quickly, so whatever. As a plus, Paladins can equip the double-attack gloves. As a minus, you can only spend 60000 gold for a sky-high attack bonus on one character, probably, and you start with a Paladin regardless.\n\nMeh.\n\n(Note that this review is copy-pasted exactly from Male #1's. This is because the character is exactly the same in every way. except with a dumber name and a cooler picture.)","timestamp_created":1500186327,"timestamp_updated":1500186327,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.619624018669128418","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/daEpd0Cd8GLgAE="}
