Playing this game once is really fun but its just not interesting anymore for playing it a second time then it gets boring. But it still has a funny gameplay and storyline so for that reason only a positive review but i dont think i will play this game again anytime soon. Its also really short but that's why the price is so cheap but i still think this game should have been for free. For a free game this game would have been really fun and nice to play but for a game that you have to pay even though it is really cheap not so much.","timestamp_created":1590186953,"timestamp_updated":1590528537,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mu64qfICf7nPiQI="}
