While some people will say that choices don't effect much to the story, and they will be right about that, the choices are flavour to the story. Devon (author) has already stated this issue, and i am completely fine with this. Not every game has to be multiple branch. and SoH would not be the same. The story itself is great alongside MC and supporting cast. One warning, do not mistake this story as \"hero always wins\". It doesn't (yet). The story has mature themes, and can get dark (Book 3), but do try it out. You will enjoy it.","timestamp_created":1602352649,"timestamp_updated":1602352649,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sqLqifUCdZOJpwI="}
