    short_description: We finish Rambo's knife and continue by creating a fade texture
      with the help of the MG 3D generator. After that we make use of another procedural
      texture that lets us create a digital camouflage effect. Both go fast and we
      continue to work on a hello kitty inspired version of our Kukri knife.
