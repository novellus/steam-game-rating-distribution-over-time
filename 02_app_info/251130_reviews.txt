Gave it a try on sale and glad I did!\n\nI wasn't into the Power Rangers, I was too old when they became popular.  I didn't understand the rules, like, why didn't they use the giant robot to start with?  Why did they risk bodily harm by fighting without their power suits on?  Why all unnecessary acrobatics?  This game provides answers to these and more, in a way.\n\nIt's a generic tactical game, where you can buy weapons and armor (I'd say armor is more crucial to keep upgraded, but each character should have a weapon as they provide an extra ability).  Battles take place on a square grid, you move your characters in turn-based fashion within range of your opponent and fight or use a skill.  Skills use cooldowns to recharge. \n\nGiant robot battles are 1-on-1 turn based affairs with a slight hand/eye coordination mini-game for attacks and defense, with a variety of interchangeable robot parts which provide additional stats and skills.\n\nMoney is earned based on how successfully you complete each episode and how much audience you gained (from attacking, acrobatics, and following director's instructions).  You can use the earnings to upgrade your studio, props (weapons and armor), or hire an advertising agency.  You can craft weapons, armor and robot parts with the right materials.  Crafting materials can be found by defeating foes or purchased in randomized boxes.\n\nI've only played through once, but there is replay value in the neat concept, as well as multiple game paths and choices in responding to fan email.  As I wrote at the beginning, this game was a pleasant surprise.  Still not into Power Rangers but def into Chroma Squad!","timestamp_created":1602095487,"timestamp_updated":1609862185,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gvDQ6fYCfKy7pgI="}
