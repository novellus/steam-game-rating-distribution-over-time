If not: sry). \nIt has no artificial progression system and no narrative. It's just brilliant in its mechanics, everything is thought through, it's strategic and in this not complex but deep. Simple rules, easy to play, but with more depth on a tactical and strategical level than almost every other game I know. It's perfect in what it wants to be and unlike any other game I've played so far. And I played a lot of different videogames in my life... \n\nTheres a good chance that this game is the best 2,49 you'll spend on games (or any hobby in general) so far if you buy this on sale. Is totally worth the ten bucks though. Clear recommendation.\n\nDidn't play it in coop so far though. \n\n\nEdit: Still didn't play coop, but got two #1 ladder spots, which feels nice :D","timestamp_created":1604262213,"timestamp_updated":1605736796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9uHX7vUCetvSqwI="}
