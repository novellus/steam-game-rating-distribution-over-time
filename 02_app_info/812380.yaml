    about_the_game: <strong>FLOCK OF DOGS</strong> is a wild 1- to 8-player co-op,
      crew adventure. From aboard a flying whale, launch into the sky on a flying
      dog to explore the skies. With your brother and sister dog-riders, use solar
      panels, harpoons, bows, lances, mops, umbrellas, trumpets, and more tools to
      engage in high-flying, twin-stick battles. The Flying Festival, where creatures
      of all kinds gather to celebrate with minigames and a great fireworks show,
      is merely weeks away. On your journey half way across the globe, you'll need
      to pilot skywhales, climb treehouses, camp on sky islands, navigate dark caves,
      pick apples, take naps, and mop dirty floors if the Flock is going to make it
      in time!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/812380/extras/parade_gif_v5_GIF.png?t=1587100925"
