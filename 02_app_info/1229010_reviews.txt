When I could here him it sounded like it was coming from the roof.\n\nThe ghost chick said something like \"shoot me with any spell\" but it would only progress if I shot her with the one that does damage.\n\nwhen you make it in to the dining room, its not obvious that you are meant to kill the little ankle biter.\n(It would be handy for an indicator noise of some sort of animation to make it a bit more obvious that you are suppose to deal with it)\n\nIm unaware if the game goes any further then the dining room. (couldn't figure out the painting puzzle)\n\nBriefly got stuck in an audio loop from the ghost girl.\n\nThroughout my 45 minutes playing I had No crashes and NO frame rate issues.\n\nTLDR: The game is looking good so far just needs a bit of polishing. A few small things to make it a little more user friendly would be appreciated.","timestamp_created":1590912536,"timestamp_updated":1590912536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541284441947937012","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw3NnxtPICfOqsiwI="}
