    review: 'Maybe I have too much money or this is just not worth any, why am I buying
      something that can be found on YouTube...?


      This lesson in nutshell: Take softbrush, make something up, not the stuff you
      should know (magic), make hard edges, little adjustments (magic), the end. I
      feel like Napoleon of painting now.'
