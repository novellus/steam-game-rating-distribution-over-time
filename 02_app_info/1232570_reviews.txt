The low-poly graphics are almost abstract, yet well-lit enough and with good enough ambient sound support to feel convincing and provide immersion.  Lighting and sky effects are remarkably good, with dawn/sunset fx and thunderstorms over a vast desert landscape.  Water doesn't really try to be realistic, yet is remarkably wet and believable.  Occasional \"special\" items in the landscape cause instant teleportation to nearby spots.  It's a world of constant discoveries.  My initial experience was a delightful sense of disorientation and wonder, like walking into a strange but enjoyable dream.\n\nThe fantastic Dada-esque animals are the essential feature though, and they're simply wonderful:  clearly related to familiar creatures like wolves, horses, elk, jellyfish, crabs and so on, yet weirdly different and all apparently made of paper.  Though their forms are abstract and surreal, their body language and sounds are strangely lifelike and affecting.  They convey wariness, alarm, weariness, thirst, busy purpose, confusion, a whole spectrum of moods and emotions.\n\nBest of all, (so far) I have encountered no creature that can harm me or shows any intention of harming me.  Instead, they go about their natural business and my task is to help them, sometimes rescue them, other times gently manipulate them into modifying the environment to assist my forward progress.  This increases the gentle and dreamlike quality of the gameplay;  eventually I start to feel a kinship with these creatures large and small.  I enjoy watching them and trying to figure out what they're doing.  I feel pity and sorrow and a real sense of urgency when they're in distress, and genuine satisfaction when I can rescue them.\n\nI have no idea what the overall campaign is;  so far, I've progressed slowly, savouring every moment.  I know I'll be sorry when this game is over, so I'm in no hurry.  The animal NPCs seem to have their own AI logic and respond interactively to each other and to my movements and actions;  there are no canned dialogues.  Even though I can't help noticing that I'm being herded or guided on a defined path through the scenery, the fresh and interesting behaviours of the animals make each new puzzle area entertaining.\n\nThe puzzles are not terribly difficult, at least so far.  You have to learn to think in the game's logic, which is to perturb the ecosystem around you just enough to get the animals' natural behaviour to work to your advantage (think Joel Salatin of Polyface Farm explaining the \"pigness of the pig\" and the \"chicken-ness of the chicken\").  I won't say more than that because this game is too beautifully realised to spoil for any new player.  Like some of the great literature of childhood, the first \"reading\" (playthrough) is a truly magical experience that would be spoilt by foreknowledge.\n\nHighly recommended for animal lovers, explorers, puzzle solvers, amateur or professional naturalists, and those with a taste for the unusual and creative in game design.  So far, I would say this game is suitable for most ages, certainly 12 and up.  It might be a little scary for very young players.  (Note:  the opening sequence or intro is really weird and not representative of the rest of the game!).  I look forward to spending a few more hours in this fantastic (literally) world and know it will be over too soon...  Huge props to the developers who have achieved something very fine here, an original work of art and not \"just another VR game.\"\n\n","timestamp_created":1610068480,"timestamp_updated":1610068480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgOrj7/YCdKC2wQI="}
