You play missions (there's an open end mode too) and have to achieve goals in them. To achieve these missions, you need to build certain structures while keeping in mind rules for logistics among the different building types.\n\nYou need, for example, a specific minimum amount of workers to man your buildings. Workers live in houses, which need to be in a two field radius around a farm. Clay pits and mines need one or more building to refine their goods, so roads need to be build between all of these and the buildings that use them. And so on and so forth.\n\nOften you'll find yourself scrapping buildings or roads that you either don't need anymore, or to correct an error you made. Most tiles or building can yield additional harvest using a clicker mechanic, allowing you to restart broken logistics cycles after you fixed it, removing harsh penalties and allowing for experimentation.","timestamp_created":1609788084,"timestamp_updated":1609788084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8pm25/YCdti9wAI="}
