Seriously, \"Get Good\" already.\n\nIn reality - it doesn't prevent players infiltrating other corporations ... but it does expose players to real world hacks.  In game players are required by player corps to submit \"support tickets\" to Spellbound so the player corps can authenticate their accounts, which is then forwarded to in game players.\n\nTo do this, Spellbound provides tech-support for player corporations to perform these account validation checks, (even for Steam players) .  Hopefully, it won't continue in this way and become even more toxic - like it did in Eve Online.","timestamp_created":1485827159,"timestamp_updated":1490311296,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.485848546028137207","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwLbe/toCe7HzcA=="}
