I made the mistake of buying standard expecting it to be able to play Blu Ray Disks but was met with nagging upgrade boxes when trying to play em. \n\nStandard only Plays DvD Disks and they are too lazy to note that anyware in the description for the product on the steam page. the only way to find this out is to buy it by mistake and refund or to be funneled to their naggy site constantlly prompting buying the \"Best\" Version of the software and giving random \"Deals\" if you idle on the site long enough. Kind of shady if you ask me...\n\nDon't get it!","timestamp_created":1515540224,"timestamp_updated":1543108802,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":73,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.86234736442565918","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3facpOcCeYPOlQE="}
