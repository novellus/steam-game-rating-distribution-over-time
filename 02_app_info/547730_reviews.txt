I beat this game. I have all the achievements. It's bad. Very bad. Can I just talk about how this game is 1GB when the official touhou games are around 500mb? How do you have a game that uncompressed? The music is actual ear cancer and uses the free sound fonts given to you in any trial version of FL Studio. It's the kind of music I'd make at 3am when I just want to goof around in FL for a couple minutes. \n\n[b]So, the gameplay:[/b]\nIt's a bad touhou ripoff. The HUD is very cluttered for a bullet hell game. It takes up more than half of the screen and fills it full of useless information which is ridiculous.\nProjectiles that fly out from the HUD? Yep.\nUnavoidable spell cards? Yep.\nLack of hit sounds so you don't know if you're dealing damage? Yep.\nBombs that don't function properly? Yep.\nMy own projectiles targeting off screen, making power-ups unobtainable? Yep.\nBackgrounds that have so much noise that the projectiles blend into it? Yep.\nBugs? Yeah, they're there. I killed a boss and I got killed in the results screen. Very cool.\n\n[b]The story:[/b]\nCute hand puppet thing that throws me back to old school deviantart. Not good by any means, but nostalgic I guess. Story blows but I was curious in a \"it's so bad I can't look away\" thing. Writing is atrocious and using text emoticons is not cute. Anyway, I went to the creator's website as I was curious how deep this story goes. Found a .pdf \"art book\" that I started reading. The art style and the way the creator role-plays as the characters gives me big Chris-Chan vibes. I found some pretty alarming things in the pdf as well. There were references to guro and pedophilia which the creator tries to justify as a normal thing.\n[quote=Studio JAW] 2/1/2016: 小児性愛 (Shouniseiai - Pedophilia)\nTime for a tough topic. This one is pretty cliché and controversial (I apparently can’t type in\nfrench). But it’s about pedophilia in Japan. On the light side of it, as a positive explanation for\nit, it’s parents wanting what’s best for their children. [/quote]\n\n[quote=Studio JAW] 3/19/2016: ゴア (Goa - Gore)\nYou ever wonder sometimes if these horror movies ever get it right? How much blood\ncan possibly spray out of someones neck if their head is chopped off?[/quote]\n\nPretty alarming things. I'll leave a link [url=https://idb.studiojaw.com/StoryHiresPC.pdf]here[/url] as well.\n\nAll in all, not a good game by a game studio that has an open pedo in it. Refunded. Those achievements stain my profile forever.\n\n❤ Audience ❤\n☐ Beginner\n☑ Casual Gamer\n☐ Normal Gamer\n☐ Expert\n\n☼ Graphics ☼\n☑ CWC\n☐ Alright\n☐ Good\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Fantastic\n\n♬ Music ♬\n☑ Bad\n☐ Alright\n☐ Good\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Fantastic\n\n☠ Difficulty ☠\n☐ Easy\n☐ Average\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Hard\n☑ Unfair\n\n§ Bugs §\n☐ Bugs destroy the game\n☐ Lots of bugs\n☑ Few Bugs\n☐ You can use them for speedrun\n☐ Nothing encountered\n\n☯ Story ☯\n☑ Sonichu\n☐ Bad\n☐ Alright\n☐ Good\n☐ Fantastic\n\n⚔ Gameplay ⚔\n☐ Frustrating\n☑ Sleepy\n☑ Boring\n☐ Fun\n☐ Challenging\n\n۞ Game time / Length ۞\n☑ Really short (0 - 3 hours)\n☐ Short (4 - 8 hours)\n☐ Few hours (10 - 20 hours)\n☐ Long (40-60 hours)\n☐ Very Long (61-100 hours)\n☐ Extremely Long (101+ hours)\n\n$ Price / Quality $\n☐ Full price\n☐ Wait for Sale\n☐ Don't buy\n☑ Refund it if you can","timestamp_created":1579856967,"timestamp_updated":1579856967,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546398460865020752","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1587847948,"developer_response":"Thank you for your honest criticism, I wish someone had said this stuff while it was still in development.
