Currently though it is irritating, though the ui and screens are wonderful, it looks nice.\n\nThe daily challenges at the is a cool little walk through, as far as i have gotten.Which isn't far since 2 of the challenges play for 5 days and use the search option under the season screen can't be completed. I went through 10 days with the play 5 days challenge up and it never updated, and then like the other user who commented capmjh I could not find the search option.\n\nThe players themselves are very striped down, each has 4 attributes and then their level in each is conveyed by the color of the box. Each time you open a players menu you have to close it to get to the next player, an option the would let you move to the next player would be helpful. Since without opening a players menu you can only see their name, position, current salary and current stats.\n\nMinor league team has some issues, first its not actually a farm system in the normal sense of the word. Unless you demote players to it, there wont be any players on the team. It seems to be a resource generating aspect of the game, except there are 3 resources, its not explained (possible in the challenges which can't be advanced) how to generate them, you start getting popularity as you win games, which you spend to make your minor league stadium better which then generates more popularity.\n\nAgain as the other reviewer said the games play to fast, you can't pause them to change the pitcher before the inning is over. If you go to settings there is an option to slow it down, only you can't click it, there's also a option to change difficulty which you can't select. These could be place holders, or they could not be but if they are not working they shouldn't be on the screen. \n\nThe number of available players in free agency is low, and again to learn about them besides that free agent dh wants 25 million a year you have to go into their menu then close out to get to the next one.\n\nI could sadly keep nitpicking things about this game, but it feels unfinished for a pc game, should of been released as a early access game, as there does seem to be some good stuff here for a striped down, less intensive GM sports management game. Sadly i don't know if we will ever see it fulfilled as looking at the website it appears this game is actually meant for mobile devices. So in the end.\n\nDon't buy this unless its updated big time, and knowing that its supposed to be a mobile game those minor league resources are probably supposed to be micro transactions.","timestamp_created":1564668900,"timestamp_updated":1564669011,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498414516448974609","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w8zipuwCcpnFzwE="}
