    review: "If you've enjoyed similar titles outside of VR then you will love Sep's\
      \ Diner. I was most apprehensive about the movement controls as my play area\
      \ is limited. I was glad to find out that you can customise the movement controls\
      \ in-game, which allowed me to stand in one position & still be able to interact\
      \ with all the games elements. \n\nVisually the game looks great; the colours\
      \ are vibrant & sharp, there are a variety of NPC's, the overall ambience is\
      \ perfect. The difficulty curve provides a tailored experience by forgiving\
      \ casuals & challenging the Pro Chef's. \n\nOut of all the VR titles I've been\
      \ hording these past few weeks, Sep's Diner has been an absolute steal. Whether\
      \ you're chasing the nostalgia from your glory days in fast-food or want to\
      \ experience the hustle of working in a kitchen, Sep's Diner is a great title\
      \ to pick up!"
