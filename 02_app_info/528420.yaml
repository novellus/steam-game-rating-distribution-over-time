      \ /><br><br>Fortunately for humanity, Dr. Klaus von Hammersphere has discovered\
      \ the rare element AntiOrbium which sends the Evil Orbs back to whence they\
      \ came (wherever that is) and he has invented a device that he affectionately\
      \ calls the \u201CElementary Evil Orb Disposal Device 2000\u201D (EEODD 2000\
      \ for short) which can be used to shoot and deflect balls of AntiOrbium at the\
      \ Orbs.  He is recruiting you to wield this device and save humanity.  What\

      \ /><br><br><strong>CONTROLS</strong><br><br>Use your mouse to control the EEODD\
      \ 2000 and fire balls of AntiOrbium at the Evil Orbs.  Because AntiOrbium is\
      \ a very rare element, there is only so much to go around.   Fortunately, you\
      \ can also use the EEODD to control the balls after you have fired them at the\
      \ orbs and try to knock the balls back at remaining Orbs to maximize the amount\
      \ of Orbs popped per each AntiOrbium ball fired.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/528420/extras/eo_st_desc_04.png?t=1574129403\"\

      \ /><br><br><br>As in any armed conflict between humans and mysterious Orb-like\
      \ entities, Dr. Hammersphere is hard at work inventing special powerups for\
      \ your EEODD 2000 to win the arms race with the Evil Orbs.  Utilize these powerups\

      \ celebrating, for you must save all 132 cities around the world in order to\
