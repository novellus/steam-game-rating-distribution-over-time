I do recommend this game too if like me, you remember your teenage time playing Shufflepuck Cafe on Atari... good times. Now, I would not recommend this game just like that, because it is not that great. It is fine. Very repetitive (that's air hockey... better in real life with real friends), very grindy (win 15 times against him - good, now beat him 8 times without loosing - good, now you can duel the new opponent... who tells you to beat the previous one 10 times...), and the table is a TAD too small (actually, there is too much camera inclination), BUT the gameplay is really smooth, the different opponents moves are nice though as too simple as the original game, so, yeah, overall it is enough to pass the time if you buy it on sale.\n\nMy [b][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/36483989/]other Reviews[/url][/b].
