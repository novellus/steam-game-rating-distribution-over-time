The development team is one of the best i've ever encountered when it comes to content addition and overall involvement in the community at large.  \n\nI totally recommend this game if you're technically minded and looking for a fun challenge, though at times can be a bit grindy when it comes to mining (though there are solutions there).\n\nYou can control things with programmable ic chips, or good ole fashioned buttons, and your level of automation is entirely up to you.","timestamp_created":1610064874,"timestamp_updated":1610064874,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwoYnW7/YCf+q0wQI="}
