Looks slick, sounds slick, and plays at a slower pace that manages to avoid being frustrating and is actually really fun.  I'm not saying its a masterpeice, but its definitely worth the $10 risk to find out if you like it. It's atleast worth that to someone who's meh on it. I know I don't have much time on it, but the game is a small experience that just gets harder.","timestamp_created":1598314373,"timestamp_updated":1598314373,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517133951187133789","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+Lu9kfQCeLDKnQI="}
