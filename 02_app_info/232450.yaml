    review: 'I''ve pre-purshased this game waiting for something diferent from other
      grinding and donating online CCG. And now I''m completely dissapointed. There
      is still no story game. No tournaments. No Android version for my Kindle Fire.
      This game is unplayble due to its pay2win strategy, legendary cards are so unbalanced.
      They just smash you in the face. Deleted after month of trying. Give me my money
      and time back!

      BTW Richard Garfield, shame on you.'
