I love 800 North's games, they always put alot of effort and thought into them. This one is great so far even in early access. I 100% reccomend this game to anyone who plays FPS games. Right now it's not that popular, but it has the potential to be. Give this game and Dino D day a try, I think you'll change your mind.\n\nUpdate 3/22/2020: Development and online servers have ceased. Quite a shame since it could've had huge potential. If it was ever ported to VR, it would definitely be hit.","timestamp_created":1487032037,"timestamp_updated":1584909420,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498974502086639404","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw3tD9gfECcqaNcg=="}
