    review: "This game should have been put in early access a long time ago and stayed!\
      \ I really wanted this game to succeed. I know my time with this game is short\
      \ but you don't need long to find out you just bought a game that has a lot\
      \ to fix. First match in the game, I played just a random match and I got hit\
      \ into the stage and was stuck with no way out. Then, I played another and actually\
      \ got to move around a little and it was really slow. It's kind of hard to figure\
      \ out the hit boxes and motion of the characters. It's really odd. I didn't\
      \ understand what was going on. I figured, Why not let the computers fight it\
      \ out and see what this game can do? I set a match with the computer fighting\
      \ each other and set the levels to the max. Wow, was I amazed on how funny that\
      \ match was. One of the character just stood there didn't move at all just swinging\
      \ away. There was some points in the match where two characters would team up\
      \ on one character just simply ignoring each other. I thought that was pretty\
      \ clever or just bad coding. Then one character got knocked on the ground and\
      \ just laid there the rest of the match and didn't get up at all. When the match\
      \ was left with just two, the one on the ground just laid there and the other\
      \ character didn't know how to attack him. The match would have gone on forever.\
      \ It was funny to watch but I was mostly upset. This game can be a seriously\
      \ great competitive fighting game. Not at this state though. \n\nAnyway, This\
      \ game needs help. The DEVS just need to hit the reset button and listen to\
      \ the people. In my opinion, I think they should either put this in some type\
      \ of early access if they can or do a MASSIVE update patch that completely changes\
      \ the gameplay. The changes I would focus on first is the speed of the game.\
      \ I think it needs to be quiet a bit faster. Everything seems really \"Floaty\"\
      . We got to have much tighter attacks, moves, and combos. The moves and attacks\
      \ are super choppy. Some of the characters attacks are almost pointless. Last\
      \ but not least, the hit boxes.  I shouldn't have to kiss someone if I want\
      \ to punch them.\n\nI'm not a pro and by no means do I know what it takes to\
      \ makes these changes. I'm sure these changes I suggest will take A LOT of coding\
      \ and man hours but I would argue to sell this game at its current state was\
      \ a bad decision. There are so many ways to put your product out and listen\
      \ to what the community has to say. I'm not giving up on this game. I just cant\
      \ give a thumbs up right now. I will change my recommendation if they decide\
      \ to change almost everything about this game as far as gameplay. The art style\
      \ isn't bad. I kind of wish they kept the original art of every character. That\
      \ would have been pretty bad a$$. Well hope this helps everyone's decision when\
      \ purchasing. I also hope the devs read this willing to make some changes. Best\
      \ of wishes to the team. Great idea that needs a lot of help."
