Basically, they should have simply named it the Troll DLC because these things travel in packs (always at least three) and are guaranteed to kill all but the most advanced parties. Simply put, lindwurms are the quickest way to ruin a quest when they show up. I really hope that the paid DLCs are actually enjoyable.","timestamp_created":1609816093,"timestamp_updated":1609816093,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lIah6PYCfvzKwAI="}
