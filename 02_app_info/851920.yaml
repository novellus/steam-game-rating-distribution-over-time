    review: "Mediocre shmup. \nNo bosses, no power-ups (well, the gun is updated the\
      \ more you shoot, but it only improves shooting speed), only 12 levels. \nOdd\
      \ system with the fuel - you have to shoot red areas to get red clouds with\
      \ fuel. Just another distracting factor.\nUI looks weird. The is a story, but\
      \ why."
