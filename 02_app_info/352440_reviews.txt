Don't get me wrong, you can play this through once or twice, but if you are looking for the old-school nostalgia from the classical Fighting Fantasy books, nothing ever really came close to those. \"Those were the days\" - Damn, I'm becoming a boomer...\n\nTechnically, this is the 5th book from the \"series\", but there isn't anything in particular connecting the total 12 books.\n\nThe writer is Andrew Wright, the author of Beyond the Pit (an Advanced Fighting Fantasy title, in the world of Titan).\n\nGenerally, I'm thankful for these books (the writers, the publishers) to try to keep alive the tradition in a world where younglings would never bother with something like this. However, the Golden Age of these books is arguably gone.","timestamp_created":1598475590,"timestamp_updated":1598475590,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwl7uklvQCeYH6nQI="}
