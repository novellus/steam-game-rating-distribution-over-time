It's football as it was in the old games, and pure arcade fun.\n\nHowever, In the short time I played it I already encountered a few bugs:\n 1) A goal that wasn't counted (It said goal kick)\n 2) Having the wrong coach (Arg vs Ita with boths coaches being the same)\n 3) Losing the world cup and the world cup menu being corrupted\n 4) A similar thing when winning the world cup\n 5) When purcahsing an item, it doesn't appear as purchased unless you exit and re-enter the menu\n 6) Slowdowns when in menus\n 7) Even though the power-ups are quite self-explanatory, a proper explanation would have been nice. I am unsure exactly how they work.\n\nIt is a really fun game so it is a shame that some of these bugs are popping up.","timestamp_created":1609031115,"timestamp_updated":1609031115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j8zu0PYCfZfKvQI="}
