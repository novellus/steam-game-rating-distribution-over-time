It's a shame because a simple tweak of the game's statistics (i.e making the upgrades more expensive or the bombs not as easily detectable) combined with the game's randomized maps and permadeath feature could have made this game a challenge. Instead though the only redeeming quality about this game is broken down into a simple science, making this just another game in your collection for you to beat and then forget about.","timestamp_created":1511856431,"timestamp_updated":1574411320,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.708064377307891846","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrMeOye4Cdd62kAE="}
