      \ visuals, world design, and storytelling.\u201D<br>90 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.pcinvasion.com/someday-youll-return-review/\"\

      \ You'll Return is an immersive game with stunning visuals, excellent storytelling\
      \ and rich gameplay. And what I like most: the developers didn't try to reinvent\
      \ the wheel. But instead took all the best parts from the genre and actually\
      \ created something new. I\u2019d go so far as to call it one of the best horror\
      \ games from the last year.\u201D<br>90 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.keengamer.com/articles/reviews/pc-reviews/someday-youll-return-review-fathers-and-sons-pc/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Keen Gamer</a><br><br>\u201CSomeday You\u2019\
      ll Return is much more than a psychological horror game, it\u2019s an immersive\
      \ adventure which you\u2019ll never forget. Although initially looking for your\
      \ daughter, you\u2019ll soon find yourself helping others and discovering secrets\
      \ about yourself and the past, things which you forgot a long time ago.\u201D\

    review: "Someday You'll Return is a great psychological horror adventure. What\
      \ separates it from others in the genre, some would\ncall it the walking simulator,\
      \ is a semi-open world environment as well as many more mechanics. This game\
      \ does not rely\non cheap jump scare moments, but methodically builds the atmosphere\
      \ and plot of the story which will give your shivers.\n\nAs you progress, in\
      \ the game you will be able to craft various tools and make potions using recipes.\n\
      Herbalism is well implemented and if you are of an exploratory spirit, you can\
      \ learn a lot about the story.\nThere are a couple of stealth sections, but\
      \ don\u2019t be put off by this, because they\u2019re done differently than\
      \ you\u2019re used to, there\u2019s also a way to be totally bypassed if you\
      \ don\u2019t like stealth.\nIt should be noted that the game will not indicate\
      \ on the map where to go and what to do.\nFor some, this will be repulsive,\
      \ i didn't mind.\nIn addition to the main story, which is dark and serious but\
      \ nicely structured, it is possible to do side tasks and discover secrets of\
      \ the forest by solving puzzles. I won't talk about story details because you\
      \ should experience it without spoilers.\n\nYou will quickly notice the effort\
      \ and passion that these two developers have invested in the plot and the world\
      \ of the game.\nCollecting badges, fairy tales, QR codes and other collectibles,\
      \ although optional, was never boring or pointless to me, because there is a\
      \ story behind it, and it is not set just to artificially prolong the game.\n\
      \nNothing in this game is by accident, there is a story behind everything and\
      \ everything is done with great attention to detail.\nA big recommendation to\
      \ all fans of psychological horror adventures as well as to all who love a good\
      \ story."
