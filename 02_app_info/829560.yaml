    review: "I\u2019m going to make my case for Katie, because I really enjoyed it.\
      \ It\u2019s a walking sim first person kinda game, but it has little space exploration\
      \ like yer Gone Homes and Firewatches. And it is a game about relationships\
      \ where u don\u2019t get to talk or choose lines or even\u2026 see an actual\
      \ conversation between two characters, that goes back and forth. And at first\
      \ my instinct was to keep my guard up about that, because these are genres I\
      \ really like and its best traits were kinda\u2026 taken away. But a wise man\
      \ named Davey once told me to see games for what they are, instead of what they\
      \ aren\u2019t, and here\u2019s what it is.\n\tKatie is a game that takes place\
      \ in a town where people go to run away from something. A painful lost, an ugly\
      \ fight, and so on so forth. It\u2019s filled with interactive citizens, that\
      \ will talk to u a little. And when I say a little I mean a couple new phrase\
      \ every day. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s bad per say, since I didn\u2019\
      t walk in expecting a fallout game, where I can hang talking to Easy Pete and\
      \ ask about how scavenger life is. They fill in the universe in a nice enough\
      \ way, and I did learn to appreciate their company, even if for short periods\
      \ of time each. But the name of the game is Katie, and she\u2019s the one you\
      \ get to hang out with. She\u2019s this game\u2019s Chloe, if you may. \n\t\
      As I said before, your character doesn\u2019t have lines. Or a name. So Katie\
      \ is essentially monologuing. Which I\u2019m typically against in games, I don\u2019\
      t like this Battlefield Story mode like thing where your character, your gateway\
      \ to that universe, is an empty shell that everyone likes for some mysterious\
      \ reason. It\u2019s done so the player can put itself on the character\u2019\
      s shoes and increase immersion or something, but it feels like a shortcut for\
      \ relatability, which serves the same purpose but works better. But here, I\
      \ actually liked it. This game is\u2026 about Katie. Not about you, and you\
      \ might as well be an imaginary friend, a coping mechanism or just a quiet person.\
      \ But\u2026 this game talks about how important it is to be there for others,\
      \ and when Katie is the one taking the brunt of relatability (after all, she\
      \ is the one we relate to) it feels nice to\u2026 be there for her and listen.\
      \ \n\tThis is the main thing, in the end. This game feels nice. It feels intimate,\
      \ like a rant of its creator that we get to listen to.  It has this comfortable\
      \ atmosphere, because this town is comfortable. Avoiding yer shit is comfortable.\
      \ Dealing with it is the messy part. And you see all these people walking around\
      \ and soaking in the comfortability of it all and\u2026 You understand. I\u2019\
      d be walking around there all day too. Because dealing with stuff is\u2026 hard.\
      \ But it\u2019s easier if you have someone there to listen to you, and hold\
      \ your hand through it. And I don\u2019t know how personal this game is to its\
      \ creators, and how much they relate to what Katie is going through. But I\u2019\
      m\u2026 really glad that they moved on, if they did. And I hope they had someone\
      \ to listen to them too. I\u2026 was glad I was there for Katie, and hoped she\
      \ was okay once she left. And that made me forget that she didn\u2019t even\
      \ exist hahaha. At least not her as in *her*. But if you caught yourself so\
      \ empathic towards a character, it\u2019s a good character. And if a character\
      \ focused game has a great written character, that\u2019s a great game. That\u2019\
      s what I think anyway. I\u2019m glad it was made, and that I got to play it.\
      \ \n       So thank you, for sharing. I\u2019m glad I got to stop and listen.\
      \ Looking forward to more by Lonely Frontier. I hope y\u2019all find what you\
      \ are looking for.  \n"
