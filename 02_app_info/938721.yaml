    review: Despite some of the in-game soundtracks from Visage being absent in this
      collection, this is still a collection of beautiful and chilling tunes that
      are true works of art! The variety of instruments is good and the very careful
      balance between synth and regular instruments pays off. The tracks also, despite
      often using the same instruments, never sound too similar to each other to the
      point that the tracks feel samey. I would definitely recommend buying this to
      support the composer! He worked hard to inject as much life into Visage as he
      could and it shows!
