      notes: This game contains content unsuitable for children or easily offended
        adults.  There is frequent strong language, brief pixellated male and female
        nudity, and themes including euthanasia, conspiracy theories, radical politics,
        and atheism.  Jokes about social issues are made throughout.  There is occasional
        comic violence.

    review: Novel idea and thoroughly enjoyable experience. Short playtime, but I'm
      really hoping for more content. Right now I think there's a good balance between
      humor and dystopian lore, but I hope there's more of a push towards the latter
      in the future, personally.
