Absolutely beginner friendly. But unfortunately doesn't seem to have keyboard support. Not a big problem for me at my current level, but something others may be concerned about. I upgraded to ultimate, and find both programs useful for my specific needs, as I don't adhere to simply one genre of music. \n\nI highly recommend this if you want to make some chiptune for your own personal projects. Or just want to have some fun without an overwhelmingly complex program. \n\nTL;DR: Very good beginner app and for people who just want to make something simple for a project, if you are an expert and looking for high production software this isn't it.","timestamp_created":1608610427,"timestamp_updated":1608610427,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h+apxPYCefyLvAI="}
