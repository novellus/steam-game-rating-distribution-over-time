      of the vertex coloring problem:<br><br>1) Making Schedule or Time Table: Suppose
      we want to make am exam schedule for a university. We have list different subjects
      and students enrolled in every subject. Many subjects would have common students
      (of same batch, some backlog students, etc). How do we schedule the exam so
      that no two exams with a common student are scheduled at same time? How many
      minimum time slots are needed to schedule all exams? This problem can be represented
      as a graph where every vertex is a subject and an edge between two vertices
      mean there is a common student. So this is a graph coloring problem where minimum
      number of time slots is equal to the chromatic number of the graph.<br><br>2)
      Mobile Radio Frequency Assignment: When frequencies are assigned to towers,
      frequencies assigned to all towers at the same location must be different. How
      to assign frequencies with this constraint? What is the minimum number of frequencies
      needed? This problem is also an instance of graph coloring problem where every
      tower represents a vertex and an edge between two towers represents that they
      are in range of each other.<br><br>3) Sudoku: Sudoku is also a variation of
      Graph coloring problem where every cell represents a vertex. There is an edge
      between two vertices if they are in same row or same column or same block.<br><br>4)
      Map Coloring: Geographical maps of countries or states where no two adjacent
      cities cannot be assigned same color. Four colors are sufficient to color any
      map.<br><br>Source: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-coloring-applications/"

    short_description: In the world, there are some problems that cannot be solved
      by today's computers. Being necessary the use of artificial intelligence to
      get a good and fast solution. In the Npc Problems series, these problems are
      posed for you to solve. Can you overcome this challenge?

    review: Nice but a little short, more puzzles with higher difficulty would make
      it more enticing. A workshop where players could share puzzles would also be
      pretty neat.
