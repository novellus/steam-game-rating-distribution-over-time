Took me 2.8 hours to finish all 50 puzzles.\n\nWhile I did resort to the \"guess and see if it works out\" tactic a couple of times, I eventually came to better recognize patterns and clues, and I was able to logically reason out all the late-stage (level 40 and up) puzzles.  Like all good logic puzzles, it is very satisfying to see the puzzle practically solve itself once you recognize the clues.  If you are into number puzzles, then CrossCells is worth checking out.\n\nOne complaint: this game seriously needs an undo button.  Or a \"save/restore state\" button.  If you realize you have made a logic error and taken a wrong turn somewhere, unless you have a great memory and can retrace your steps perfectly, you have to start all over.  Maybe this was a deliberate design decision to discourage \"guess and see if it works out\" strategy, but I thought it was just annoying.\n\nAll in all, this was a great brain teaser, and I wish there will be a sequel with more puzzles.","timestamp_created":1610046356,"timestamp_updated":1610046356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJworeP7/YCcMCswQI="}
