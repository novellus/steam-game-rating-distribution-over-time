And season passes for this game still not only cost more than the base game, but they also are literally one season of a year.\n I wish I worked at the modeling/texturing departament at koei tecmo, and under my control there was no such a shameless content rehash with zero quality control. And also I would bring back core values. Just look at that awful texture on her hip! IT IS CURRENT F****NG YEAR, KOEI TECMO, THESE TEXTURES ARE HALF-LIFE 2! This does NOT represent or highlight the quality of textures and models that your engine can show not in a musou but in a FIGHTING GAME where there are only TWO high quality characters on the screen at the same time.\n Honestly this and many other character costume packs need a massive rework and quality control, and not only they look very dated but they are generally ugly and tasteless.\n I wanted to purchase this game's full DLC list but watching how this looks up close and how other unoriginal, uninspired, tasteless, rehashed and straight up copied character costumes look, I don't want to support this game and it's developer/distributor with any money. Unfortunately I already payed a ton. Ah who am I kidding, I will probably spend more.\n\n Ah yes, they say that \"this game's content might be inappropriate for some ages blah blah blah\", well WHERE IS INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT? This game has red flags and security guards with assault rifles standing all around the perimeter of it's steam store page warning my mom that this game has sexual content, and I am too young to play this game, and yet when I'm finally alone and I sneak to computer, take out the battery cell from motherboard to override the BIOS password and start the game to breath heavy while staring at the screen, there is nothing to see!","timestamp_created":1583958462,"timestamp_updated":1583958832,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578503668308258057","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuLbT5fACedq/9wE="}
