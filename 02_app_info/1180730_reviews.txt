(hype!!)\n\nCon\n- nope\n\nNow making a character: (well using my existing players sheets) \n\nPro\n- O wow, the health, willpower are auto calculated!\n- Neat, small help pup-ups  for scrolling the generation.\n- Great you can drag and drop disciplines.\n- Were are my discipline powers? aha, in the library (needed to do some searching)\n- Ooh sweet! Frenzy, rouse and mend are a nice button and rouse increase hunger when fail. \n\nCon\n- can't resize the character sheet? (don't now why but had the urge to try)\n- (rouse is a bit bigger written in Unity?) = fixed\n- What? I need to type the clan bane? No drag and drop here?\n- the SPCS have at notes a handy details blok (looks and birth date and more) while the player characters have a big box. \n\n\n(test is done in Unity and classic)\n\n\nUpdate:\nAfter playing/ hosting:\n\n\nPro\n- The easy add map works perfect in images. Just drag and drop. \n\nCon\n- There is no party sheet...\n- No easy relationships map.\n- The abbreviated SPCs don't work in the combat tracker = fixed\n- While crating an encounter the menu says NPC instead of SPCs (yes i know it't the same thing, but would like the same name)\n- Some random script errors (did forget to copy them was running a game...) = Had no more since\n\nOverall conclusion:\nHad a great time hosting a game and think my players liked it as well. (not sure they sounded stressed... ;P)\n\n(play was in Classic)","timestamp_created":1586253978,"timestamp_updated":1595447489,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":25,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.774011313915252686","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4npaFvPMCds3u/gE="}
