    review: 'Very similar mechanics to those of the base game, but it adds a new one
      that makes it a lot more challenging. Whether it makes it more enjoyable or
      tedious, that''s up to you to decide.


      In my case, it made the first 2-3 levels interesting, but at the end it got
      boring, as you had to keep ordering stuff all the time in order to grow and
      support your already existing city. If there had been an "auto-buy" function
      it would have probably made things easier.'
