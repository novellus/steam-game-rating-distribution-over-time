    review: 'Was smart, when I saw the reviews, I waited to buy this ''til a sale
      selling for $0.50. So it''s not like I paid much. Still not great.


      I would say this is a very condensed version of Runescape as a single player,
      except that the game is unfinished. I had to watch a walkthrough to find out
      how to heal myself because although a lot was ripped from Runescape, cooked
      food healing you isn''t one of them. Interface is simple, only a few keys actually
      do anything and I''ve done three quests and can''t find any indication there
      are more. I seem to have explored all the areas, The Forest, The Bandits, Cleverville
      and one other section I can''t remember the name of. The tutorial doesn''t really
      explain how to do everything and good luck getting help when you get stuck.


      Oh, and although I don''t pay much attention to the storyboards, the misspellings
      and grammatical errors are prolific enough I noticed.


      It''d be a fun game...if it were actually finished. It just doesn''t go very
      far.'
