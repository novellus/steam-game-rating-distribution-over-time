      \ in this exciting party brawler!<br />\r\n <br />\r\nGoing out to dinner as\
      \ a kid was an exercise of patience, determination, and ever wavering &quot;table\
      \ manners&quot;. How does a kid with no smartphone pass the time between appetizer\
      \ and entr\xE9e? Through nothing more than the items on the table and an overactive\
      \ imagination, K'nife Fight was born. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nK'nife Fight has you\
      \ fight across multiple exotic eateries with an ever-growing selection of utensils\
      \ to fight with. Launch your friends into oblivion as a steadfast spoon or impale\
      \ your enemies as a sharpened butter knife. We're also pretty sure you're going\
      \ to fight some utensils you've never heard of, we certainly hadn't until we\
      \ made the game!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFully integrated Online, LAN, and Local,\
      \ so you can play with your food, together. Up to four players can fight in\
      \ a massive free for all brawl.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nK'nife Fight came from the\
      \ basic idea that a game should be fun first, before all else. We're confident\
      \ you'll have a blast destroying your friends, and you will continue to see\
      \ new characters, levels, and features added on a regular basis, free of charge\
      \ with the full game. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nK'nife Fight was started\
      \ before the outbreak of COVID-19, before the pandemic changed all of our lives,\
      \ we had reached out to several local restaurants to feature them as levels\
      \ to promote them as awesome places to visit both in and out of game. All of\
      \ them are hurting because of this, and we want to make sure we can help them\
      \ as much as we can. The level from our demo is based on the amazing Columbia,\
      \ Maryland based brewery, Hysteria Brewing. We hope that when this is all over,\
      \ we'll be able to see all of you down there celebrating with us!<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDogwood Gaming takes a strong stance against pay to win\
      \ tactics and the exclusion of content that really should have been in a base\
      \ game to begin with. With full transparency, the only additional paid content\
      \ we plan to release is paid cosmetics released alongside the free updates to\
      \ support our developers and artists who keep the game going. The cosmetics\
      \ will come in packs, with one always free and obtainable in game. The cosmetics\
      \ won't make you any stronger, but we all know a good hat is the key to victory."
