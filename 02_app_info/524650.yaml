      \ fastest guns and the fastest on their feet can win!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nEach round of DANGEROUS DUELS begins with a tense wait for every player\
      \ to draw their weapon, but then a round can be over in seconds. Try to shoot\
      \ anyone in your line of fire, and stay out of other player's lines for as long\
      \ as you can. Be the fastest shooter or use slow bullets to control the play\
      \ area, but be careful not to fire too haphazardly - needing to reload could\
      \ be the end for you!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game features many options and\

      \ you're short on friends.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDANGEROUS DUELS works well at\
      \ events and game nights, and is well suited for parties or just playing with\
      \ friends on a couch."
