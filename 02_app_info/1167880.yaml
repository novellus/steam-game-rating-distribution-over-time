      notes: Mutant Football League and its addons features violence, blood and gore
        (including exploding body parts, comically horrific deaths, and blood splatters)
        and some strong language.

    review: "Okay, true story. I'm definitely not great at MFL. Love playing the game,\
      \ but I lose to the CPU every now and then. Last night, I entered hell mode.\n\
      \nDue to shoddy coaching and generally not caring about the score, the Full\
      \ Metal Mayhem (piloted badly by me) are down 21-14 with 1 second left in the\
      \ 4th quarter. Razors kickoff...one thing I do very well is kick returns. So\
      \ they kickoff...I return for a touchdown! Overtime, right? WRONG. Ref calls\
      \ a nonsense penalty on my team, rekick, run back for a TD! It's time for overtime\
      \ baby, but no, the [BLEEP]ING REF CALLS IT BACK. OK NOW DO AGAIN, KICK TO ME,\
      \ I SCORE AGAIN BUT WHAT'S THIS? ANOTHER [BLEEP]ING PENALTY.\n\nI tried to go\
      \ back and play Dirty Tricks>Kill the Ref but I can't find that option. I return\
      \ another [BLEEP]ing kickoff, then resign myself to fate and just get tackled.\
      \ \n\nIf it were any other game, there would be a hole in the wall because I\
      \ would throw my controller through the wall. But, it's the MFL and I'm sure\
      \ I'll find more interesting ways to fail.\n\nOh and DAT GUILLOTINE...well worth\
      \ the purchase."
