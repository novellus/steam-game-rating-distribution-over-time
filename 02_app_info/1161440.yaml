    review: 'A Valve Index user


      Short review because the game opens up on a black screen. That''s it. Tried
      to do every possible fix that steam allows (Like verifying the cache and so
      on) and none of the fixes worked. This game doesn''t even have Vive support!
      Every VR game at least has Vive support because it''s probably what most people
      have!


      The dev is pretty much inactive in the forums because he has NOTHING posted
      on the discussions and doesn''t respond to the comments there. So basically
      this game is dead on arrival.


      https://i.imgur.com/IsqPVti.png

      I think we can agree that this "positive" review is made by the dev himself
      who just made a second account because who has only ONE product in their library
      and isn''t even VERIFIED? Seems fishy right?...


      So don''t by any means buy this game. You''d be better off to just burn the
      8 bucks on a bonfire.

      Maybe you guys should give your thoughts in the comments.'
