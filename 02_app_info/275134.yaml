      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Southeastern Class 465 EMU Add-On</a>\
      \ before you will be able to use this add-on.<br><br>Built following the dawn\
      \ of sectorisation, as part of the ill-fated Networker program, the Class 465\
      \ was designed to revolutionise rail travel from Kent into London replacing\
      \ old 4EPB Mk1 EMU\u2019s to provide a faster and more stylish journey. The\
      \ Class 465 fleet was constructed by BREL and Metro-Cammell (now GEC Alsthom)\
      \ from 1991 to 1993 and by ABB Rail from 1993 to 1994. The Class 465 first entered\
      \ service under British Rail\u2019s Network SouthEast sector in 1992 and are\
      \ still a regular sight throughout Kent and South East London to this day.<br><br>The\
      \ Class 465 accompanied in a new era for suburban travel in Kent, being operated\
      \ particularly on the metro lines out of Charing Cross towards Dartford and\
      \ Victoria to Rochester. With a top speed of 75 mph, quick acceleration and\
      \ braking (including wheelslip protection), the Class 465 was without a doubt\
      \ the perfect addition to the aging infrastructure and even brought with them\
      \ many track and signalling upgrades to the lines they ran on.<br><br>Two major\
      \ variants of the Class 465 exist, those built by Metro-Cammell, the Class 465/2s,\
      \ differed in design from the BREL (465/0) and ABB (465/1) models. Despite the\
      \ differences between them they can interchange in operation resulting in quite\
      \ the orchestra of traction motor sounds when departing a station.<br><br>Since\
      \ entering service, the Class 465 has seen some modifications; all variants\
      \ featured a design change to the buffers as the original flat design proved\
      \ to be too popular with thrill seekers, trespassers would often stand on them\
      \ and hold onto the handrail or windscreen wipers. The new design is curved\
      \ which prevents people standing.<br><br>A number of Class 465/2s were sent\
      \ to be refurbished in 2005, these refurbished units would be better equipped\
      \ for longer haul services with First Class being the major change. These units\
      \ were reclassified as Class 465/9s.<br><br>Being a product of British Rail\
      \ that has survived to this day, the Class 465s have seen a number of livery\
      \ variations which have provided an interesting look to Kent and South East\
      \ London for many years. After the fall of British Rail and Network SouthEast\
      \ services were taken over by Connex, despite this many units were not re-painted\
      \ into a new livery, resulting in the \u2018toothpaste\u2019 colour scheme being\
      \ visible well into the early-to-mid-2000s. Even until recently there have been\
      \ odd variations in design, however most of the Class is now brandishing Southeastern\u2019\
      s Blue Stripe livery.<br><br>Today, the Class 465s are operated by Southeastern\
      \ across many of the more suburban lines out of South East London, namely the\
      \ North Kent Line into Dartford and Strood. They are also frequent traction\
      \ on the Chatham Main Line from Rochester and Gillingham into London Victoria.<h2\
