    review: 'I''m not sure how it got in my library, but, who knows.


      This game is a free-to-play game disguised as a steam paid game.


      The gameplay is basically this: You are a king, who must defend your queen in
      the castle at all costs. You can do this is many ways.

      The game has a skill tree for more towers (cats) and a large amount of gameplay.
      However, it is not worth the cost. It boils down to place towers, eventually
      die, upgrade, rinse, repeat.

      Therefore, I recommend it, but only if they reduce the price.'
