The multiplayer lobby even for this pretty Good map is often dead. You might get lucky and find other players if you wait in the lobby long enough but in any case the four multiplayer maps you get are useless and irrelevant in 2020. The \"Turned\" Zombie mode while being interesting in it's concept and approach follows the same fate as the aforementioned multiplayer maps.................... no one plays them. The player base for the game in general is small as it is. That being said, Die Rise is a very fun and in my opinion a very underrated map. \n\nDie Rise\n- Jump between two large decaying skyscrapers in a Chinese mega city. It's atmospheric, creative and there's a lot of things to do. Perks are in elevators that move randomly when you turn on the power but can also be summoned with a key. You can build things like a trampoline that throws zombies forward often killing them. (you can also use these to launch yourself between buildings) Every several rounds the special zombie wave will see you being attacked by these extremely bouncy and flippy grey zombies. The issue a lot of people have with Die Rise is that it's insanely easy to fall off the map and die..... don't fall and you'll be having a good time. \n\nNow is one Zombie map you're likely only going to be playing on solo worth $15? No of course not.
