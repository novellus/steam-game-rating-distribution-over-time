    review: "I play quite a lot of this HOG's. This one is a pretty good one actually.\
      \ Some of the features are:\n\n1. A map that shows where things aren't finished.\
      \ Automatic travel using the map cuts down on backtracking\n2. Clear and interesting\
      \ puzzles. Only about 2 or 3 of the minigames were difficult and that was mainly\
      \ due to the amount of work that needed to be done in order to finish them.\n\
      3. Collectible masks that also have interesting histories tied to them, once\
      \ you find them\n4. A bonus chapter that tells more about the mysterious assassin\n\
      5. Movies and wallpapers are available in the extras menu\n6. Multiple different\
      \ difficulty settings to suit everyone's chosen play styles\n7. An intriguing\
      \ villain with a good story\n8. Strategy guide\n9. Can replay minigames and\
      \ HOG's from the extras menu\n\nNegatives:\n1. Some of the voice acting was\
      \ just awful. It was painful to listen to at times.\n2. The few minigames that\
      \ were just super long to do. Skip is nice, but I prefer not to do it. I also\
      \ don't want to spend like 20 minutes of my life turning dials or moving panels\
      \ around.\n3. Achievements in game, but (like so many other HOG's) not on Steam.\
      \ So, your achievements are cool, but since they aren't displayed on Steam...\
      \ *shrug*\n4. A few of the objectives for puzzles were vague. Might've been\
      \ nice to have an \"info\" button that gave more information on what was expected\
      \ for puzzles.\n5. HOG's were pretty good, but some of the ones that required\
      \ you to combine objects weren't always clear on what needed to be done. \n\n\
      Otherwise, if you like hidden object games (HOG's), this is a pretty good one.\
      \ I don't regret playing it and genuinely enjoyed most of it. For the price,\
      \ it was good."
