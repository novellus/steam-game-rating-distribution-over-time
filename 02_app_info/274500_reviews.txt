It was originally released back in 2015 on early access & left it in 2016. The Up-Armored Edition was released in 2017. Players assume role of a Brigador; A mercenary working for a faction called Solo Nobre Concern.\n\nPros:\n+Plenty of drivable vehicles from mechs to agravs, tanks or even a weaponized rickshaw.\n+Great art design. Everything fits together and no asset feels out-of-place.\n+Fantastic soundtrack.\n+Good amount of content (Took myself 59 hours to 100% the game).\n+Rich lore.\n+Mod support.\n+Both vehicles & weapons feel beefy and good to use.\n\nCons:\n-Controls can feel a bit janky at first.\n-Not One Stone achievement.\n\nIf you've ever played Future Cop: LAPD or Battletech or just happen to enjoy vehicular combat then this game is definitely a must-have for you.  It's worth the full price and delivers everything it promises to.","timestamp_created":1609918718,"timestamp_updated":1609918718,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg8So6/YCeMf3wAI="}
