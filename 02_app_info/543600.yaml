    review: 'This captures the essence of Halloween in VR.  I''ve been to many haunted
      corn mazes and haunted houses, and playing this gave me the same thrill without
      the hassle of travelling, bad weather, ticket fees, etc.  I absolutely love
      the artwork and effects.  Great sound ambience and effects as well.  The locomotion
      movement wasn''t difficult to grasp and it feels good the faster you move (you
      can feel the air move).  Best played on a crisp cool autumn night with the windows
      open.  Love it!


      Played on HTC Vive Pro / GTX 1080 Ti'
