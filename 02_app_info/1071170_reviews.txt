I really hope you can do better.   \n\n----------------------\nFull review:   I really want to like it, as i love Monet and want to experience it in VR.  And i appreciate the work put in but this is sub par quality product compared all the good VR experiences out there (look at the IL DIVINO: Michelangelo's Sistine Ceiling experience or Nefertari: Journey to Eternityfor example, both of those are even free ! ) \n\nThe major problems are:\n1.  it won't even launch correctly,  when trying to open a strange vive link, which as I have no vive ( i am using index, which is supported according the store page) , it jumps to windows store page. you have to take off headset, or go to desktop mode to click it to open stupid windows store to get the app pass to starting screen.  This took me ten minutes to try and error to find out,  terrible experience.\n\n2.  the experience it self doesn't even support controller, try to use it on title screen will screw the language selection, you have to use gaze to select mode to select the language,    and through out the experience, there is no controller support.  even though the store page repeatedly told you it requires a controller to play, in reality it's useless in the game.\n\n3.   let's be honest, there is zero interaction throughout the experience, it's no different than watching a 3D video.   It is a VR film, don't call it experience,  there  are a lot good VR film,  such as Oculus story studio's work,  but this is much worse compare to those because of bad story telling and presentation (see below)\n\n4.  limited walking range,  due to the fact you cannot use controller to teleport, you can only walk to the edge of your play area, in some scenes, i want to walk closer to the shore or particular item that looks interesting,  i couldn't \n\n5.  the story telling is totally relying on the auditory narration,  with no single character was rendered visually, you have to guess what's happening by listening, don't get me wrong, the narrator did a good job, but with only one person playing two roles, not changing in tones or voice, you cannot even tell who is who in the dialog (which is not dialog, just letters between monet and friend been read out loud in reality), and the visual is virtually nothing linked to the story except showing the year and the ending scene.\n\n6. bad performance,  in the ending scene when there is some changes, the visual becomes choppy and frame rate drop to below 40 (i am on rtx 2080 super, it's not my pc, it's bad optimization)\n\nOverall, it wants to be something like oculus  story studio's dear angelica,  but becomes much worse version of it due to zero visual character and bad story telling.   it has so much potential but sadly falling short.","timestamp_created":1599167263,"timestamp_updated":1599226087,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45bDTrPQCfJnNnwI="}
