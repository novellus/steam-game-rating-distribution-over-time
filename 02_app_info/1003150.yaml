    review: "So I've played this game for about two hours straight, and that's all\
      \ it took to be able to see the entire \"content\" this game has to offer. I\
      \ will leave glitches and bugs out of this review as it is early access, and\
      \ believe me that's being generous since there are ample!\n\nStory: There is\
      \ none, no lore, no letters / tapes / npc's to talk to to gain any backstory\
      \ or relevance to a plot. No tutorial, no commentary, not even a short cutscene,\
      \ NOTHING. I guess we just pretend there is an epidemic.\n\nGameplay: Shockingly\
      \ bad! Glitches and bugs aside, you are places in a tiny map where you can drive\
      \ a truck and sometimes find cars with spare parts. You can put planks of wood\
      \ and metal rods in the back of your truck, offload your truck at a small outpost\
      \ and that is it! There is no crafting, no progression, no end game, and nothing\
      \ else to do. I have collected every resource in the game and offloaded it,\
      \ and nothing happens. \n\nGraphics: Uglier than a spade fetus.\n\nReplayability:\
      \ None whatsoever, seriously there are far better games out there for less.\n\
      \nAccuracy to the developers description: The developers said this game is \"\
      fully playable\" this is a straight up lie since you cannot end the game, progress,\
      \ build anything, craft upgrades, change vehicles, or anything worth your time.\
      \ Simply pick up wood and rods, put them in your truck, and offload them.\n\n\
      Value for money: Terrible, you should not buy this ever.\n\nStill don't believe\
      \ me? Go over to my Youtube channel Jack Dawleaf, or just type into the search\
      \ bar of Youtube Transit - Do not play this game! and you can see gameplay for\
      \ yourself.\n\n0/10 \n\nThis was either made to lure in people for a quick cash\
      \ grab, or the developer has released the early access of this far too soon.\
      \ Either way I can't believe they have the audacity to charge money for this.\
      \ It's not even suitable for demonstration purposes. I would be ashamed to release\
      \ this in its current state if this were my product, let alone ask for money.\n\
      \n\n\n\n"
