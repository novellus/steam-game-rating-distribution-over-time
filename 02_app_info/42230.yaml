    reviews: "\u201CThis puzzle adventure game would be great fun for a mother and\
      \ daughter to play together. While it has fewer plot twists than some of the\
      \ others in the series, it is still an excellent mystery to solve.\u201D<br\
      \ />\r\nUSAToday<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201CTrail of the Twister is still a solid\
      \ addition to the Nancy Drew series. The game features all of the interesting\
      \ characters, great production values, and challenging puzzles that fans have\
      \ grown to love, and wraps it up in a fresh new setting.\u201D<br />\r\nGamezebo<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201CIn short, Trail of the Twister is a worthy successor\
      \ to the previous twenty-one adventures which have sold a total of more than\
      \ eight million copies.\u201D<br />\r\nTechTalk for Families<br />\r\n"
