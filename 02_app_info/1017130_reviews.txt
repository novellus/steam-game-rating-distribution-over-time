Like a lot of small games, there's no options menu and trying to set windowed from Windows and Steam launch options doesn't work. I had to use DXWnd to force it to a window. Works okay once you set up all the options, but it looks like that prevents Steam from tracking in-game time.\n\nThere are some other smaller issues, but I still enjoyed the game. This is one of the few games where I didn't hate the [url=https://i.imgur.com/7jf8p7R.jpg]Helicopter[/url]-style controls. It feels like you have way more finesse than you usually do. Those sections are hard, but at least it's [b]not[/b] because the controls are awful.\n\nThe platforming parts are pretty fun too, I liked the moveset. And the aesthetic is great!","timestamp_created":1587839170,"timestamp_updated":1587839413,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sNWm2fECfN64gwI="}
