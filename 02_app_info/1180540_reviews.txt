The most impressive aspect of Puddle Knights, thanks to its creative theme, is how natural and intuitive the mechanics feel despite their relative complexity.\n\nNot only is the base game a great collection of satisfying puzzles but the two free expansions kept delivering more quality content. There were only a few puzzles that I had to stumble through due to the very large possibility space, but the vast majority of them required careful deliberation to find the insightful trick. If there are more expansions in the future, I will be playing them for sure.","timestamp_created":1609084100,"timestamp_updated":1609084100,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2tu40vYCdcPlvQI="}
