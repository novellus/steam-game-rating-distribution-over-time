    review: 'I''ve been waiting for this game to get an update, because I was excited
      for a VR dungeon crawl with archery mechanics, but it seems like it has been
      abandoned with the bare bones of both those categories... At least there are
      several movement options, and the archery mechanic feels good, but that''s all
      the positives I can think of.


      The dungeon is just rectangular connections and the enemies zigzag to rush you
      (even the huge minotaur ones) which doesn''t fit with what mass they should
      have. Even when firing directly where an enemy is running, after you release
      your arrow they can course correct and dodge it which is fine for a small goblin
      but an ogre shouldn''t have that dexterity. When playing stealthily and using
      the decoys it is super satisfying to land a sneak headshot because there is
      no aim assist or path tracing, but once you miss here we go time for QCQ trying
      to fling as many arrows as possible. There is no snap turning so when you get
      surrounded you have to physically spin around while flailing to draw arrows
      which there is a good chance of them dodging even at point blank. The campaign
      says "more levels coming soon!" of course...


      Skyrim VR is a much MUCH better version of exactly what this was trying to go
      for, but that game has so much more as well, so don''t waste your time on this.'
