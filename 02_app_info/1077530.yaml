    review: Such an amazing and detailed game! As a designer and fan of architecture,
      it's really cool to sit and just build like I did as a kid. It would be so awesome
      to have some sort of quest involved in the game, or story. Even something small.
      There's something so satisfying about building and watching it come to life
      in this way. It seems something like this might be implemented in the future?
      Don't get me wrong; the creative freedom is great, but it would also be cool
      to have some sort of objective or story. Anyway, awesome, awesome game! Great
      job.
