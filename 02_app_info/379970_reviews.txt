It has a good concept, but poor execution.\n\nThe first planet all makes sense (mostly). After that, very little makes any sense at all, so your stuck with trial and error, which leads to a massive amount of flying back and forth.\n\nHere are a couple of examples of what I mean.\n\nOne guy wants a \"metal cylinder\", I have a \"tin can\", so I try to give him that, doesn't work. I try to use that tin can for every thing I can think of, It won't hold water or dust, I can't smash it, and can't use it as ammo. I eventually read the one guide and find out it's used as the metal cylinder, but I have to place it some place, instead of giving it to him. :(\nEdit:(To be clear everyone else that wants an item just accepts the item, and there is no indication that it is what he wants, just not how he wants it)\n\nI can walk around a pitch black moon, and a pitch black cave, but I need help to walk through a pitch black segment of hallway.","timestamp_created":1487303136,"timestamp_updated":1487303813,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+OSNpdoCdOiscg=="}
