I quite enjoyed the puzzles, although the characters were pretty one-dimensional and the storyline could've been more original. After for instance Darkside Detective this was a more challenging treat. The world was interesting although it felt more like what people in the late 1980s might have imagined 2080s to look like... I paid 5 e for this and I think t was worth exactly that :)","timestamp_created":1609768979,"timestamp_updated":1609768979,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o6nt5vYCeemywAI="}
