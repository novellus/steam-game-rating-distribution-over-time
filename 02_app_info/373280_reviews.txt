They have a good base to start but as they build, its getting terrable. It used to be a one hit kill on a lot of monsters. but now it takes 2- 3 shots to kill them. and then monsters will comepletely spawn out of nowhere just to drain your health. the horses click - clacking will make you go nuts after 4 seconds, and I hate it when the horse TALKS! In the end. Save your change  for a GOOD game. Because you wont find it here.","timestamp_created":1440122712,"timestamp_updated":1468251131,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":43,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529323875904083252","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4x8ml7dUCeaqkQw=="}
