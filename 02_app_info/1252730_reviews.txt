This is a cool WWII card game that combines traditional CCG gameplay. All of this is fueled by good music, cartoon graphics and storyline. I give the game an 7/10 rating. Developers should work on the performance of the game.","timestamp_created":1595852063,"timestamp_updated":1595852063,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.589426159858703613","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kcCMyPMCcpvqlwI="}
