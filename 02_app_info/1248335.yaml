    review: "Contains:\n\nMy Hero Academia - Shoto Todoroki\nHunter X Hunter - Meruem\n\
      Yu Yu Hakusho - Hiei\nBleach - Yoruichi Shih\u014Din (Release date Early 2021\
      \ confirmed)\nJoJo's Bizzare Adventure - Giorno Giovanna (Release date expected\
      \ 2021)\n\nWished they added more characters than 5, but the choice of characters\
      \ is great. Personally would have preferred Yhwach (included on behalf of being\
      \ the overarching villain of Bleach), but Yoruichi's is a great alternative\
      \ representative. As far as the character pass goes, characters are modeled\
      \ and presented with all proper respect to their respective animes.\n\nFor a\
      \ review of the game itself, check out my review!\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/SteamWorksPower/recommended/816020?snr=1_5_9__402"
