    short_description: Suzukaze Aoba thought she was done with the villager project.
      However, Ahagon Umiko comes to her with some problems. The models she designed
      are filled with errors, and no one at her department told her about it. Umiko
      shows frustration toward Aoba, but more so toward her supervisor, Yagami Ko.
