    review: Holy crap, if you even slightly like the music in Starbound, buy this
      now.  For $1 you get just over 6 HOURS of really great game music.  No idea
      why they are charging so little for this soundtrack, but I'm not complaining.  It's
      easily worth a good bit more though and I would've happily paid $10 just as
      quickly, especially now that I know how much music is here.  10/10 for sure
      :)
