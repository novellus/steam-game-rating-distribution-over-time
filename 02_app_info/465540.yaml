    review: "I truly love this game.         It's very simple, and I'm not sure how\
      \ many hours it takes to finish.   I just keep restarting it, because it's easy\
      \ to miss content.    It's a simple game but it actually has some strategy.\
      \ \n\nThe things that happen if she loses are hilarious.          Also there\
      \ exists an uncensor patch out there somewhere on the net, which will give you\
      \ \"those\" kinds of bad outcomes if she loses."
