Awesome, well done and real fun. After playing my favorite DLC: the US Marines. I decided to give the US Pacific a try after playing its first mission. After playing the DLC, I have no idea how is it that I complete the objectives (both primary and secondary) AND I STILL FAIL THE MISSION?! I even eliminate all Japanese troops and capture or take the key points, eliminate key units like carriers and for some reason I still fail and have played the campaign up untill coral sea where after completing over 5 times and keep losing nearly every battle even after I do the objectives? I'm not a noob or don't know how to play since I've played the US Marines pack and others and Order of Battle is an amazingly awesome and superb game, but for some reason US Pacific has this problem.  If anyone could help, then thanks!","timestamp_created":1596229283,"timestamp_updated":1596229283,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y72r0/MCebvWmAI="}
