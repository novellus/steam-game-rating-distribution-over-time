In fact, it's probably better played on a mobile phone.  If this were a .99 cents game, I don't think I would rate negatively.  It's an okay puzzle game with some funny voice one-liners.  There is something funny about seeing an astronaut getting pummeled through puzzle obstacles.  \n\nBut at $14.99 it's just crazy for this type of 'puzzle game' if you can call it that.  It's more like angry birds.  Except the VR adds nothing, except clunky controls.  I got it on sale for $5.09 USD and that's way too much still.\n\nRating 3/10 content does not match prize, but it would be a pretty good .99 cents mobile game if it were that","timestamp_created":1512114228,"timestamp_updated":1512114228,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.607751131057739258","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsoHCiOACfbjskAE="}
