The premise is simple, you need to match up different coloured circular gems in order to get them off the board and to clear each level completely.\n\nThe physics are nice, the gems move well and their weight affects the gems surrounding them. There are a lot of very tricky puzzles where you have to try to get a perfect score by matching special gems, and there is a good problem-solving element to all levels. It's also very replayable as you struggle to get a perfect score n earlier levels which you initially just were thankful to complete in the first place.\n\nThere are also special gems which allow you to eliminate more gems as you go along, including 'bombs' which explode surrounding gems, ones which destroy a line, and others which destroy all of one colour.\n\nThe bottomless pit level is one which makes you come back again and again as you try to beat the achievement (haven't yet - so close!) and all in all it's a great casual game with a good deal of variety.\n\nOh and there's some sort of story about mermaids so forgettable that I simply can't remember it at all.","timestamp_created":1608226096,"timestamp_updated":1608226096,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuNjvuPYCft7+ugI="}
