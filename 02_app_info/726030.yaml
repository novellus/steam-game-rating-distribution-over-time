    review: 'Look, I like puzzle games but I can''t recommend this one. it''s boring
      and easy to complete in less than an hour. Go ahead if you want the achievements
      (which are easy to get).


      Minesweeper has 3 difficulties and each one has 3 parts and that''s it. You
      can customize your puzzle too. The thing is, it''s like there''s no UI: no tracking
      mines or minutes in the game. Did you finish the puzzle? Too bad you won''t
      know unless you''re playing it for the first time, since the achievement will
      appear once you complete it.


      Sudoku was hell for my eyes. No clear lines between the 3x3 boxes and once you
      finish it the "solved" line stays there until you quit the game.


      Catcher and Asteroids were a bit more fun.'
