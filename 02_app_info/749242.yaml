    review: 'The skins for the helicopters are crisp and clean, good for filling out
      a small JSDF helicopter squadron or giving the Russian choppers a clean white
      look. While they would be best suited to an arctic or snowey map, they should
      provide at least moderate camo in the desert.


      Not that it really matters since the player will have their name and helicopter
      icon hovering above them when inside spotting range, but it''s a nice little
      cosmetic option.


      As well as getting the different skins for the Huey, Cobra, Hind, and Hip, there
      are four helmate patches the player may use to customize their profile.


      At around $3.99 in USD or your regional equivilent, it''s a fair price for the
      pack. Obviously if you can catch it on a sale, you''ll want to get it at that
      point, but if you cannot wait then it''s still at a nice affordable price.'
