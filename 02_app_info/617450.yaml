    review: "Edited as of Jan 6, 2021 \n\n\"bugs\":\n- Ordering AI to attack in big\
      \ groups makes the ones not immediately attacking the enemy glitch out\n- Allow\
      \ us to \"call factions to war\" or something like that This would be depending\
      \ on how much they like us. (Decline or accept) \n- Allow us to create rally\
      \ points for villagers to go to when they're done\n- Black screen when exiting\
      \ from full screen.\n- Allow us to expand our tree mining border please!!\n\
      - More buildings Please. Gate, \n- Themed tiles (Desert, Mountain, Tundra)\n\
      -Villagers walk in place sometimes (Im not sure how this one happened)\n- Allow\
      \ us to give our villagers armour\n- More enemies Pleaseeeeeee\n- Allow us to\
      \ pick diffuculty (easy, normal, hard, ect) including a raid mode where the\
      \ enemies would raid you in waves.\n- Day/Night Cycle\n- Rain, maybe snow/seasons?\n\
      -Stockpile zone to drop off resourses\n- Far away wheat/hemp is unuseable even\
      \ if you own the land. (If it's far away from your town center)\n- You can build\
      \ inside the enemies land\n\nTLDR: Good game but needs work.\n\nOLD REVIEW:\
      \ \nBugs:\nPathfinding issues for villagers and traders (Mostly traders villager\
      \ pathfinding issues are rare)\nSometimes units glitch into trees.\nSometimes\
      \ units don't know how to go around trees.\nSometimes you cannot build on normal\
      \ land tiles due to an invisible object being there\n\n\nProblems: \nLack-luster\
      \ of content.\nNo steam achievements.\nAI has bugs and trader has problems trading.\n\
      \n\n\nSuggestions:\nStockpile building to increase village holding capacity\n\
      More enemies\nAble to build bridges\nAble to expand your village tree mining\
      \ zone.\nMore enemy AI\nUnits not being able to walk through river tiles (Some)\n"
