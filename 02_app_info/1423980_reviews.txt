I know this game has been in development since 2008 and oh boy does it show that. Everything from the map to the character models is expertly handcrafted to create this masterpiece. I was suprised to hear only one man made this. He will be up there with the greats of Notch and Scott Cawthon. Ignore any negative reviews this game is awesome. Also please buy the game to support the developer as I sense a lawsuits coming.\n\nTLDR; Loading screen from GTA San Andreas, built on an engine for platformers, with an awesome online mode and with graphics that rival that of Cyberpunk 2077 and Grand Theft Auto 5 what's not to love.","timestamp_created":1605631688,"timestamp_updated":1605632066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.385110735893249512","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnaDI6/UCdPD7rgI="}
