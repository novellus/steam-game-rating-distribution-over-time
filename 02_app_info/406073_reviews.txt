The walls and floors are fine, what is the issue are the objects. None of the objects in B or C are scaled correctly for VX Ace's engine. It isn't even meerly an alignment issue, to make any of the desks usable (so there isn't a massive invisible forcfield stopping characters from getting within several feet of them) I've had to mannually edit them in ClipStudio using a custom tile set template. This has taken many monotonous hours that shouldn't be nessicery for a \"finished\" product. I would expect this is this wasn't being advertised as an VX Ace product and therefore it could be optimisation issues between versions, but it is, and therefore the tile sets should work from import. \n\nNow I haven't asked for a refund because much like with the A sets, the painting and the actual artistry of the sprites is very good, much better than what I personally could acomplish not being a sprite artist, and have enabled me to begin testing of my idea, they're just not scaled or aligned correctly. Which is very frustrating, having to manually correct them, but more acomplishable than trying to recreate the tiles I wanted from scratch. \n\nIn conclusion, unless you're okay with spending Â£5 on something you will need to manually edit yourself before they're usable, then go ahead, if you are expecting to buy, plug in and play. Save yourselfs the disappointment and look elsewhere. Only would 100% say go for it if it was in a sale for a fraction of the price.","timestamp_created":1534933650,"timestamp_updated":1534933650,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.610566437244415283","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpZnLsOUCe8iDqQE="}
