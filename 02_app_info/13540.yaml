    review: "$ENTO - SNIPER REVIEW\n\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Vegas\n\n8/10\n\n\
      Rainbow Six: Vegas is a video game with one of the best single payer campaigns\
      \ for a sniper. Essentially Vegas is about a team of specialists like Delta\
      \ Force, SAS, GSG-9. The player controls two other A.I to breach rooms and other\
      \ areas of bad guys, in this case, terrorists who have taken over Las Vegas.\
      \ The game is split into three sections. The first, is a city in Mexico, the\
      \ second is Las Vegas (Majority of the game) and the third is Hoover dam. The\
      \ player can early on in the game choose a sniper rifle, and can use it for\
      \ 95 percent of the game. \n\nThe load out of gear for the sniper. Early on\
      \ in the game and during the game, the player will find a green box, which is\
      \ where the player can choose their load out. Equally important, after nearly\
      \ every mission, the rest of your team will pick the player up in a Black Hawk\
      \ helicopter, this is the other opportunity where the player can get their gear.\
      \ \n\nSniper rifles and scopes and other gear. In the game there is a total\
      \ of four sniper rifles. My favourite being the M40A1 (a classic USMC sniper\
      \ rifle). This sniper rifle is the most accurate with one shot kills. However,\
      \ it is not realistic, having a magazine (in reality it did not). It can come\
      \ with a variety of scopes. However, they are the same scopes for all the sniper\
      \ rifles. The best scope is the 12x scope (Which is not realistic, the cross\
      \ hairs sort of resemble the cross hairs of a Dragunov). The real M40A1 had\
      \ a Unertl 10x. For a sniper, a sidearm and grenades are essential, there are\
      \ a variety of both. For example for sidearms, the M9 Beretta or the Glock 18\
      \ and for grenades, the incendiary, smoke and stun. \n\nSo if you are a gamer\
      \ who loves to be a sniper, specifically in a hostage rescue single player campaign,\
      \ then this is the game for you."
