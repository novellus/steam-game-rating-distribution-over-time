I found Trinoline on VNDB by investigating all VN's with the highly animated sprites tag. Although there are moments when the story dragged out or got a little too serious about some \"deeper meaning\" nonsense, overall it was very entertaining.\n\nThe main focus is about memories defining \"who\" someone is, the meaning of life, death, and happiness, and the role of sentient AI. Yes it is a bit over the top with philosophy, but the characters are interesting enough to make that forgivable. If you liked SOMA and enjoy lengthy VN's, then you will probably find enough enjoyment to make this VN worthwhile.\n\nThe adult content is extremely vanilla and honestly skippable, but it is free on the publisher's web site.\n\nShirone best waifu. AI waifus for the win!","timestamp_created":1609473582,"timestamp_updated":1609473582,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwu7yG3vYCca2lvwI="}
