The documentary seams to tell the true story behind the long creative processes that took place several years before the game “For Honor” was released (and these same processes most likely need to be executed in order for any video game to be made...). \n\nIn this case it was one gentle giant of a man that had a desire and dream to play a specific type of game that hadn’t yet been created before this one. So you as a viewer are somewhat of a “fly on the wall” through the different stages of this gigantic, tedious and all consuming process. It mixes the highs with some lows and constantly the presence of the main creator who is a creative soul with a philosophers mindset. He also gets sadder and sadder the closer they get to the release date of the game. The depression seemingly brought on because the game will then be out of his hands for good, and go on to live a life of it’s very own. Well made documentary!","timestamp_created":1577663926,"timestamp_updated":1577663926,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566442668437957764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw76GGqu8Cc+6b6AE="}
