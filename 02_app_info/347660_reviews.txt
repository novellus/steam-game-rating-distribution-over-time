Caromble! has good sound and quite nice graphics, which are cell-shaded and three-dimensional. \n\nCaromble! looks quite sci-fi, but doesn't take itself that seriously, so you are up against a cartoonish city-destroying monster and it is your job to stop it. That's all the story you get and all you need.\n\nCaromble! is fun to play and challenging but also difficult and very frustrating until you get the hang of it. It tests your reflexes and aim as you demolish the scenery to score enough points to enter a portal to the next stage and ultimately defeat the boss on the final stage of each level. It is a 'just one more go' type of game that requires skill, determination and patience. \n\nThe best control method is the mouse and you may find the controller only takes you so far until you are forced to switch to using the mouse. The trick is to spin the ball and charge up your shots to score more points and collect power-ups which appear more frequently when you cause lots of destruction in a short space of time. Extra lives are particularly important. A number of the power-ups are detrimental, like the one which makes the paddle shrink, or the one which pixelates the screen.\n\nThe game has high score tables and badges with honours for completion, big points score and speed.","timestamp_created":1590360190,"timestamp_updated":1592085759,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.629193365573883057","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4wZjt1/ICfYWKigI="}
