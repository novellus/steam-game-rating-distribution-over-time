    review: "If you like auto chess, this is a must buy. If you like auto chess and\
      \ roguelikes, this is a must buy. If you like roguelikes but aren't keen on\
      \ the auto battler gameplay, I'd at least encourage you to read further, as\
      \ perhaps this game could succeed in swaying you more favorably to the genre,\
      \ as it is a single-player experience and allows you to play auto chess at your\
      \ own pace, while keeping its roguelike elements intact. I rarely post reviews,\
      \ but this game is so good I feel compelled to write a review on its current\
      \ progress. This game is absolutely amazing. I cannot give it enough praise.\
      \ The amount of effort turning an Auto Chess battler into a single player roguelike\
      \ must be daunting, and they've pulled it off well.\n\n     The auto battle\
      \ portion is as you'd expect if you've played other auto chess games. The roguelike\
      \ aspect though is what keeps me playing this game over the long term. Affix\
      \ modifiers that increase difficulty don't feel brutal, the difficulty is largely\
      \ up to you, and the rewards you unlock after each run all make this a silky\
      \ smooth progression curve. This game makes you want to keep pushing the edge\
      \ of your limits and there is a ton of build experimentation here. I realize\
      \ these are emotional appeals rather than technical praises, but to me that\
      \ just means they're making the game correctly. \n\n     That said, this is\
      \ not a finished product. The English isn't perfect, but it passes and is easy\
      \ to discern. Here are my critiques of the current progress:\n     - Summoners\
      \ are currently not fleshed out as much as most others. You can't even build\
      \ a full team of them yet, so I hope they have big plans for this game's future.\
      \ They can still be a nice pick in other ways as there are multiple ways to\
      \ synergize a team comp, but the same could be said for any character class.\n\
      \n     - I would like to see (small) character portraits on either side of the\
      \ board which allow you to target the unit when moused over, rather than having\
      \ to accurately cast a single-target spell during the battle chaos. This game\
      \ can have matches that are neck and neck, and players should not be punished\
      \ if they can't quite click on the desired unit correctly or on time. Portraits\
      \ would solve this and I believe it a necessary improvement, as close fights\
      \ are inevitable.\n     For now, this game is fantastic and I hope it does well;\
      \ it deserves it."
