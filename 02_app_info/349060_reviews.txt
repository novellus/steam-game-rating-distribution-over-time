The game was developed by Manifesto Game Studio and published by Strategy First.\n\nThis deluxe pack comes with two games: Fruit Inc. 1 and Fruit Inc. 2. They can be accessed through the game's folder in the Steam's Application folder. The game's desktop shortcut will launch Fruit Inc. 2\n\n[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]\n\nGame Visuals\n\nI want to mention that the visuals in the game are well done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGame Audio\n\nI want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are no difficulty game modes. Each of the levels has their own difficulty.\n\nThis is a strategy game, where careful planning is required, due to the limited amount of resources that are available.\n\nThere is a star rating system in the game: Three Stars (Gold;) Two Stars (Silver) and One Star (Bronze.) There is an opportunity to replay all the levels for better score and star rating.\n\nThere are twenty-six different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need to be completed before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game only.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nFinal thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.","timestamp_created":1431573149,"timestamp_updated":1601576208,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543033838272094727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6LDY8vQCeMesPA=="}
