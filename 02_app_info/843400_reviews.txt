At least use the informative review, instead of giving a vague description that hides very obvious problems. This is essentially a puzzle-platformer where you explore a small castle with several riddles. In order to see the controls you have to know to walk up to the screen on the wall, otherwise you would be completely lost.  Unfortunately, the instructions do not reflect the actual controls (-_-). Needless to say that game is not very optimized, pretty much all of the mechanics are very clunky. The objects are difficult to move and it is very hard to aim the dagger (it keeps going to the side). Want some icing on the cake? The save feature is not working properly. \n\nNow to be fair, I did not expect a good game. I try to keep an open mind because there are some decent \"so bad it's good\" titles. Distant Castle is basically a student project if you ever played one. The assets in this game are questionable, I recognize some of the generic sound effects that originated in other unique games. Regardless of the origin of those objects, the game is not exactly enjoyable visually, I am literally getting a headache just looking at it. During the night cycle the light effects make it nearly impossible to see. I honestly have a hard time finding one upside, the developer tried to give the character some interesting arm equipment, which is kind of cool but not exactly original.\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\n- clunky movement, not optimized\n- broken save feature\n- lack of settings\n- control instructions are wrong \n- cryptic goals\n- numerous glitches\n- light effects are just awful\n\n[b] Overall Thoughts 2/10 [/b]\n\nThe game is almost unplayable; trying to deal with its mechanics is a constant battle. There are some enjoyable bad games out there, I do not think that this is one of them. I can't even look at it without getting my eyes hurt from those awful light effects. I am not angry at the developer, but I don't think that this game deserves a recommendation on any level, especially if it is a very vague recommendation that hides what the game is.","timestamp_created":1526052849,"timestamp_updated":1526053325,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.650875389575958252","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jLn3p+MCc7CSoAE="}
