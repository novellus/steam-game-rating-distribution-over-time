    review: I rented this after watching this in the Burning Man Alt Space Event.
      It was great quality (and free) in Alt Space. On Steam, I payed actual money
      and the quality is egregious. Why can you only stream this.. I have great internet
      and this was unwatchable, Such an incredible work of digital art is rendered
      un-experienceable through Steam.
