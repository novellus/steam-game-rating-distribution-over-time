I know I don't have a lot of time played but Super ComboMan just doesn't feel good at all. There's just no feedback to any hits (given or received). The special moves don't really do anything. The movement is super stiff. The visuals and audio are super bland. Just give this one a pass, it's not worth it.","timestamp_created":1510637095,"timestamp_updated":1510637095,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56306004524230957","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hZm/3N8CdPqgiwE="}
