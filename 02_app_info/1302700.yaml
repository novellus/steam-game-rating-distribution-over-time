    review: This is an rpg that has some customization options...very limited customization
      options. And when I say this is an rpg, well, lets be honest...there really
      is no role to the role playing here. Perhaps I'm missing something here but
      you basically hit explore and go fight poorly drawn random enemies with absolutely
      no plot, no story, no substance to speak of. Then you eventually get money to
      buy new skills, equipment, and classes, I guess. That seems to be it. Perhaps
      there's more to it...I doubt it though. If this is really all there is, I am
      sorry to say I don't think this is even worth the relatively cheep $4.99 it
      is currently priced at, unless you just want something to waste your time on.
      Just endless grinding with nothing more at all. Its like a quarter finished
      game. Add a game world with active NPCS, quests, and interactivitiy, and this
      game could be salvaged...but yes, at present, do not bother with it is my advice.
      There are far better rpgs with real role playing out there.  Sorry if this review
      came out a bit harsh, but this is my honest take on this game.
