    review: After playing this and now using for creating some small scenes, I am
      absolutely thrilled by this software! The movement is so smooth! I can create
      scenes easily and get right inside of them, changing lighting and world elements.
      I am only 4 hours in, and this is now my go to! I will be creating some models
      to import in and try creating custom brushes, but for right now I have what
      I need. Also need to use video and see how that works out as well as painting
      with youtube. This is a Joy to use! :))))))
