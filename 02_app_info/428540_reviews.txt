I believe this is due to a couple of reasons:\n1. Game play, or lack thereof. I described the game above as a walking simulator, but it is not that really. It is more of a clicking on items simulator. All you do is click on an item in the scene, listen to some lines from one of the characters, and then repeat. That is it. There  isn't much room for exploration or anything really. Just look around, find what the game wants you to click on, and then listen to one of the characters. This really kept me from getting immersed in the world and made the whole experience feel more like a slideshow. \n2. Art style. The whole game has this desaturated/sepia tone look that makes it devoid of any colors at all. This makes all of the scenes in the game feel the same, regardless of the action within the scenes of if they are present day scenes or memories. Also all of the character models are low poly and without any details (specially facial details) or expressions. Which again, makes all of the scenes in the game feel the same.","timestamp_created":1609622293,"timestamp_updated":1609622293,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oOG94vYCct3tvwI="}
