This game is obviously retro, but not just in the graphics, animations and music. The TRUE retro aspect of this game is that, like many old games, you cannot change the difficulty, you don't get tutorials, you have to figure everything out for yourself and if you don't it's back to square one. I think this is the main thing that deters the gamers who play recent games because all the crutches you take for granted in modern games get swept from under you. I found the game very refreshing and I liked that I had to figure it out for myself. In the first 10 minutes, I didn't even know that you had to hit the chests and get better weapons. And I only realised you can jump more than once AFTER defeating Glutton (I was quite embarrassed tbh). Overall I think this game is a familiar face to players who enjoy a challenge every once in a while.
