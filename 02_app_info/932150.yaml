    review: 'well what can I say:

      1.the game is cool,I liked it

      2.the music is cool

      3.bosses are funny

      and now the disadvantages

      1.when I passed the crocodile and it passed I could not go further and I was
      killed by an invisible wall

      2.Bosses are few,the trailer was still shown the tiger,and in the game it was
      not

      3.bad graphics

      I will not return the money for this game, but I hope you do more bosses and
      make it even more difficult, and the monkey was very easy, just be updated or
      not?'
