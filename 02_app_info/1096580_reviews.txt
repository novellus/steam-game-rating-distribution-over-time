Im a hospital manager, im not suppose to be the one replacing them, its dumb as hell.\n\nIm also supposed to hunt for aliens, which means you have to look at your patients and spot when their cloaking device is glitching and then kick them out of the hospital. Again, im a manager, why cant i train people to spot them and throw them out. Or place traps. Or pretty much anything other than micromanagement of a constant influx of aliens.","timestamp_created":1607107047,"timestamp_updated":1607107455,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499320358037948608","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gbXEl/YCf9CntwI="}
