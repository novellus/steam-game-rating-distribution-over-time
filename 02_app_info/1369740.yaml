    review: "Another serviceable entry by the KEMCO team.  Dragon Lapis is a straight-foward\
      \ retro JRPG.  \n\nPros: The job system is well-implemented with growth plates\
      \ giving you real control over how each character develops, making progression\
      \ satisfying.  There are two sorts of in game currency, gold and lapis.  Lapis\
      \ gives you the option to purchase items that significantly increase your power,\
      \ if you so choose.\n\nCons: Other than the job system, there isn't a lot of\
      \ depth here, which is unfortunate because the job system would support it.\
      \  For example, monsters mostly lack strengths, weaknesses, or immunity.  There\
      \ are no found items outside treasure chests - which seemed like an obvious\
      \ mechanic for thieves and merchants.  No crafting to speak of.  The game is\
      \ also quite easy, even on hard mode.\n\nRecommendations:  Get it on sale. \
      \ Its plays well enough it can hook you, which says a lot more than many throw-back\
      \ JRPGs, so it is worth buying.  Play it on hard mode and stay out of the lapis\
      \ store if you want a meaningful challenge (doing this will force you to spend\
      \ skill points carefully as they're otherwise slow to earn).\n\nEdit:  Changing\
      \ to not recommend. \n\nThere is endgame content that makes lapis store purchases\
      \ effectively necessary for completion.  Lapis is earned in game, not purchased\
      \ so its not pay-to-win, at least not with real-world currency.  \n\nOverall,\
      \ this game just isn't balanced very well.  The main game is way too easy relative\
      \ to the progression system - the developers really need to start paying more\
      \ attention to this as it doesn't do justice to otherwise solid work.  Unfortunately,\
      \ this is EXE-Creates MO - they have some good ideas, but don't take the time\
      \ to flesh any of them out.  Would be curious to see what the team could do\
      \ if given the time to really complete one of their games.  This game has an\
      \ inspired job system, for a throw-back JRPG, that is begging for a more complete\
      \ game to be built around it.  But that's about it."
