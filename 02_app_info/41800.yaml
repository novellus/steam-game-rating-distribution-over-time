    short_description: Who needs backstory? Who needs resource-gathering? Diplomacy
      is so last year. Gratuitous Space Battles cuts right to the chase of sci-fi
      strategy games, and deals with large, completely unjustified space battles between
      huge opposing space fleets.

    review: 'All strategy, no tactics and no purpose.

      -----------------------------------------


      The store description is basically accurate, this skips everything that would
      normally be in a game and just gives you the space battles. If you like designing
      spreadsheets and broad strategy concepts, you might get some value out of this.


      Unfortunately for me it feels a lot like work and with very little to show for
      it. The entire "game" is the planning stage, pick and/or design some ship layouts,
      pick and/or design what ships will be in a formation and then just watch as
      the game shows you a predetermined outcome based on your choices.


      I won''t complain about the complexity level, there is a lot to learn and if
      this something you want you''ll get some value out of that complexity. But what
      you spend all of that effort to accomplish amounts to very little pay off. You
      could spend hours painstakingly pouring over every little detail of what ships
      to use and where to place them in formation and then it''s just a few minutes
      of watching ships shoot at each other (that you don''t control) and there''s
      no larger context or purpose beyond that since there''s no story or narrative
      elements.


      Oh, is the battle over? Better go design another formation of ships for another
      meaningless battle... why?
