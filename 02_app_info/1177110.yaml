    review: "[h1] The Sorrowvirus: A Faceless Short Story [/h1]\n\nUpdated Dec 22,\
      \ 2020\nYour son has terminal cancer; you can cure him, but first you have to\
      \ kill him.\n\nThe Sorrowvirus is an adventure game [b] meant to be played in\
      \ one sitting. [/b]. There is no save system, The devs have issued several updates\
      \ to the game addressing bugs and are moving on to their next game: Faceless\n\
      \nThis game hooked me the minute I saw it. I wanted something I could play relatively\
      \ quickly due to time constraints. In the notes the dev has estimated that gameplay\
      \ is 45-60 minutes. \n\nI have about three hours into it, and have no idea how\
      \ far in the game I am. I am a Point and Click/Adventure player; I look at [I]\
      \ everything [/i] twice, maybe three times. I look for hidden clues where there\
      \ are none at times.\n\nThere is so much to see in this game it would be a shame\
      \ to finish it that quickly. I am not a \u201Crun through a museum\u201D person,\
      \ I casually stroll and appreciate art.\n\n+Artwork/Graphics\n+Atmosphere. So\
      \ spooky\n+Music and sounds\n+Voice Actors\n+Story, though I cannot comment\
      \ on the ending yet.\n+Replay that is not repetitive. \n\nThe game begins by\
      \ plopping you directly into it; your nightmare journey begins now and it is\
      \ a spooky one!\n\nI refuse to give away the game lore, but it is there.\n\n\
      There are a couple of jump-scares that are easy on the brain; I actually enjoyed\
      \ them\n\nYou access settings via the escape key and adjust video quality, volume,\
      \ and keyboard controls.\n\nYou navigate with the usual WASD keys, or a controller\
      \ if you have one. You are given instructions along the way that teach you what\
      \ you need to know, no guessing required.\n\nYes, you can die. You will come\
      \ back....\n\nThe game does have higher system requirements so watch that. I\
      \ have a friend testing on a lower spec machine.\n\nI have had no glitches thus\
      \ far and it runs fine.\n\nAgain: There is no manual save option, buy it and\
      \ commit to playing it.\n\nFor the $5.00 and change it cost I\u2019m pleased\
      \ with it. When I have a free day I will sit down and finish it!"
