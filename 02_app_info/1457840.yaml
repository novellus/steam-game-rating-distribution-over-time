      \ />\r\nYou cast your hook into the ocean in order to harvest fish and treasure.\

      \ putting up a fight. As a wise man once said: &quot;The best defense is a lot\

      \ each level you have the opportunity to swell your coffers like a pufferfish,\
      \ by grabbing treasure and harvesting fish. But of course this must be considered\
      \ against the risk of damage that may be inherent to attacking these aquatic\
      \ adversaries and seeking these submurged shinies. Maybe it is best to battle\
      \ anemone for monetary reward. Or perhaps it is a difficult situation beyond\
      \ your equipment that you should not fall for: hook, line or sinker.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nAmong the underwater world are items for you to find and wield.\
      \ Some of them you will find offered up to you for free on a silver platter\
      \ as though you're not a fisherman but a nobleman in an esteemed restaurant.\
      \ Others will require payment, for there are some in this world who understand\
      \ that everything is worth some fee. As your skill waxes you will find ways\

      \ of power.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf your hook is slain, the voyage begins anew,\
      \ with nothing taken from one run to the next other than your own expertise\
      \ and knowledge. Your mind attunad to the ways of the game, learning how to\
      \ maximise your power and wealth via items, how to skate around the bullets\
      \ of the fish to stay unharmed. Different enemy patterns and items will appear\
      \ on each run, so your ability to improvise will be tried.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome of these items are simplistic such as shark blades\
      \ that grant you more damage, and a wrench that repairs your hook. Others are\
      \ more complex like a parasite that causes some fish to explode into homing\
      \ fisshiles, and a &quot;gun bender&quot; that causes fish to sometimes accidentally\
      \ shoot themselves. Most items will stack if you collect more than one, so hoarding\
      \ fifty knives will kill most fish in one hit, and fifty gun benders will almost\
      \ guarantee fish to self-shoot.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo start a run from death\

    review: "I saw a cod hold a gun like a mafioso. Jellyfish still as painful as\
      \ they are irl. Fish whose one arm is extremely buff, probably cause his wife\
      \ was fished. Can sell the fish to the black market. Communism. You can make\
      \ fish shoot themselves as if they lived in such a country. \n20/20 Game of\
      \ the Year."
