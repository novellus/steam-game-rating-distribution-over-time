      /><br>Beneath The Sapphire City, battle rages in the corridors and caverns of
      The Sightless Warren.  This nightmare underworld, once a network of Imperial
      bunkers and stockpiles, is now occupied by the Iron Warriors and their traitorous
      allies.  There can be no victory for the Imperial forces on Tallarn while the
      enemy remains entrenched in their concrete catacombs.  With the support of the
      Iron Hands and Imperial Fists Legions, they will venture once more into The
      Sightless Warren to drive out the Iron Warriors, or die trying.
