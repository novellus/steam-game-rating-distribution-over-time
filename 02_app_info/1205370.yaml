      And Profit!</h2><br>Test your knowledge of steam tags. Try out combinations
      to maximize your review score! Save money and bet it all on a game to make maximum
      ROI!<h2 class="bb_tag">Uses A Real Steam Game Tag Dataset (up to mid-2019)</h2><br>This
      game uses a dataset of tags of real Steam games. So the way the system scores
      you, is based totally on real-world data! It will test your gaming and game
      development knowledge!<h2 class="bb_tag">What Is This Game About?</h2><br>This
      game is about testing your steam and gaming knowledge! <br><br>You are told
      to make a game with 'X' tag which should receive a review score of Y% and a
      Return on Investment of Z%<br><br>You pick the required X tag, along with other
      tags that you feel go along well with the X tag. You then decide the development
      time. Your created game then receives a review score and a Return on Investment(ROI)
      score. You have to meet the goals set for every level to advance to the next
      one.<h2 class="bb_tag">How To Play?</h2><br>Your <strong>Review Score</strong>
      is dependent on how closely related or &quot;correlated&quot; the tags you select
      for the game are. Think of it this way. If you are making an FPS then there
      is a high probability that the game is also Violent. So those two tags have
      a high correlation. You have to populate a game with highly correlated tags
      to get higher review scores.<br><br>The <strong>Return on Investment</strong>
      is more complicated. It is dependent on the review score, the number of months
      the game has been in development, and the tags chosen for the game. So higher
      the review score and more the number of months the game has been in development,
      the better the return on investment. However, the tags are chosen also play
      a role here. Think of it this way. FPS and RPG are common genres. So it is easy
      to get a high ROI if you choose them and their corresponding tags. However,
      if you make a 4X Strategy game(which is a niche market) then you might get a
      lower ROI despite getting better review scores because the popularity of a tag
      plays a big role. So it is about balancing what tags you select.<br><br>So if
      you are down for the challenge, give this <i>light and breezy</i> game a try.<h2
