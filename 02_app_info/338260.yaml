    review: "I love this game.\n\nI owned the very first game on the C64. It was one\
      \ of my favourite games back then. Im glad to see it back again. \n\nIt stays\
      \ close to the feel and atmosphere of the original and is graphically better.\
      \ I love the additional combat moves.\n\nI do wish it was longer, however.\n\
      \nIf you liked the old version, pick it up, if not only for the nostalgia."
