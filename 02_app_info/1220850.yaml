    review: 'It''s so dumb, but in a good way. I built a wall (of towers), but I couldn''t
      make the zombies pay for it.


      I''m playing my first game while writing this (from about level 30 to 96).


      Pros: It''s got a Tower defense version of They are Billions kind of feel....
      but more casual.

      It''s kind of simple to play.

      Fun kind of quirky game to play for a night when you get it on discount.

      6 Levels of upgrades for towers and mines.

      20x speed play!!!

      Worth getting.


      Cons: I''ve been waiting for it to end since Day 20ish. There''s not a lot more
      to do. Everything''s maxxed out and things are getting horribly expensive.

      Two of the upgrades doesn''t seem to be accessible.

      There are little annoying bugs. Nothing too serious though.

      The user interface is horrible. Clunky would be an understatement. The 90''s
      called and want their UI back.

      It seems that there''s only 1 level.

      Doesn''t seem well balanced yet.

      Armor can drop where your player can''t get.

      Kind of annoying that "go fast mode" doesn''t pick up again in the next day.

      You spend too much time clicking to sell gear. (Sell/Delete all button would
      be nice)

      CPU usage is nuts high for a game like this. I''d expect to be able to run it
      on a toaster, or at least a fridge.

      Needs more Crystal mines.... and towers... and/or things to do with resources.
      Maybe more upgrade paths. More variety.

      Some design choices need rethinking... eg. tech to reduce enemies health by
      100%.


      I get that it looks like I''m taking a dump on the game. I''m really not. I
      love tower defense games. Despite all the downsides, it felt like it was a good
      start to a fun game. It felt like the developer tried to do something a little
      different. I''d like to see the developer continue to work on the game and see
      what comes of it and/or comes up with their next game.'
