But what I imagined was a combination of Sid Meter's Pirate and Sea Monsters. Worth trying a little bit to find out if you like it or not. But skirmish is too time-consuming. You need to wait for so long for AIs move. And ship maneuvering is so weak, even for a 'turn-based' game.","timestamp_created":1585850782,"timestamp_updated":1585850782,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1590670478,"developer_response":"Hey sibaniuzk, \nwe have been working on a new feature and changed the game to fully realtime.
