    review: 'This game is kind of mean. To be fair, I am kind of dense.


      It''s a puzzle game in which you move a little box around by tilting the screen.
      Gravity applies - try to avoid flying off into the void, it probably doesn''t
      have the same pretty rainbow colours as the levels.


      The concept is fairly simple, but there are 100 stages and every once in a while
      a new mechanic is introduced. You reach the 20s (it counts backwards from 100)
      and suddenly [spoiler]there''s portals[/spoiler]. Every new addition is explained
      in its own short level which could be considered a tutorial, but after that
      you just have to figure it out.

      XOB is quite colourful and while I like the visuals, due to to the colours also
      changing - when you fly off into the void, for instance - it is sometimes a
      bit difficult to see, but most of the time it''s fine. The music is calm and
      relaxing, and while the game does work well on PC I''ve actually been playing
      more of the mobile version so I can flip my phone upside down and go "Huh?"
      from a different perspective. (Hence the low playtime on Steam.)

      Some levels took me way longer than I like to admit, others were surprisingly
      easy and quick to solve. Even though I got frustrated at times I never felt
      like quitting; it''s quite engaging and can be played in short bursts anyway.


      There are words also but I am not good with words so I''m unsure whether the
      game is giving me life lessons or hitting on me. Possibly both.'
