    review: "If I never finished the game I would have gave it a positive review.\
      \ The game had many plot twist that I enjoyed a lot. I never saw them coming\
      \ either. But the ending is what ruined my whole experince for me. It was as\
      \ if someone had flicked a switch and said \"YOU LOOSE!\" \n\nThere were many\
      \ moments like this in the story. My character was all out of options and I\
      \ was certain it was going to be the end for them. Yet time and time again the\
      \ game would bypass these sticky situations, and let me continue with the plot.\
      \  Then the ending came. Just because I picked the wrong allies, or because\
      \ my \"Magic meter\" wasn't filled I lost.\n\nMy character didn't die, but they\
      \ might as well be dead. That is how unsatisfying the ending was. This game\
      \ also saves your progress at all times. If there was a manual save function\
      \ I may not be this upset. But it took 3 hours to finish the game. I don't want\
      \ to spend another 3 hours fussing over every little detail to make sure I win\
      \ in the end."
