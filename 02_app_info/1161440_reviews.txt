That's it. Tried to do every possible fix that steam allows (Like verifying the cache and so on) and none of the fixes worked. This game doesn't even have Vive support! Every VR game at least has Vive support because it's probably what most people have!\n\nThe dev is pretty much inactive in the forums because he has NOTHING posted on the discussions and doesn't respond to the comments there. So basically this game is dead on arrival.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/IsqPVti.png\nI think we can agree that this \"positive\" review is made by the dev himself who just made a second account because who has only ONE product in their library and isn't even VERIFIED? Seems fishy right?...\n\nSo don't by any means buy this game. You'd be better off to just burn the 8 bucks on a bonfire.\nMaybe you guys should give your thoughts in the comments.","timestamp_created":1575513713,"timestamp_updated":1575550982,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.647318899631500244","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw94KK6+4CcbqF4gE="}
