New Yankee 8 is way more easy - as a point of reference.\nThere are in-game achievements. Some of them are interesting and attached to a given level. The achievement's triggering can be seen only afterward in a dedicated screen. Nothing shows while playing.\nI'm at level 25 when I write this review - and 3 hours in. There are apparently 50 levels total.\n\nWhile there's nothing surprising or outstanding in this game, it still does what it advertises. It's a good way of killing some time.\n\nIt works fine on Win7 64bit","timestamp_created":1589564208,"timestamp_updated":1591975165,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xKfH1PICcIz3hwI="}
