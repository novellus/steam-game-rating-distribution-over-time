    review: "In this RPGMaker game, it appears that you are the son of one who stood\
      \ up to some Chaos Lords, and for which his bloodline and the lands around were\
      \ cursed to eternal damnation. You have been asked by your mother to track down\
      \ these Chaos Lords to break the curse. Sounds like fun\u2026\n\nPlot is engaging,\
      \ combat interesting, and the characters vibrant."
