Then this game might be for you!?\n\nThis game is not \"groundbreaking or a crazy RPG-game\" but a very good & kind of simple game with fun gameplay & exploration.\n\n\nAlrighty then, It took me just over 7 hours to complete the first episode/story of this isometric game while I was exploring all the zones, I really enjoyed it and want a episode two! :D\n\n\n___________________________________________\n+Graphics - I really like the medieval setting & art style in this game. \"Weather effects looks good\"\n\n+Gameplay - Is responsive and satisfying when you block/parry and counter attack. You need to eat or sleep to regain HP.\n\n+Sound - Good sound actually, really like the thunder!\n\n+Interface - Very clean and simplistic, I like that you have to read the dialog yourself, I get a old school \"nostalgia trip\" from it haha, oh I feel so old now..\n\n+Weapons/Armor - You can loot better gear from enemies or buy it from vendors. \"You can get gold from looting enemies or selling stuff to a vendor\"\n\n+World - The world have a pretty decent size with 11 different zones and 2 dungeons \"I believe it was\", one where I almost got killed & lost in because there was different ways to run but eventually I found my way out by dragging a table to an edge and jumped out. So the exploration is really fun in this game!\n\n+Story - The story was a little short but very interesting and I really enjoyed it, but now I wanna know what happens next! \"if there will be a episode two\" :)\n___________________________________________\n\n\n\n I actually like the game and are kind of impressed by the solo developer of this game that apparently have created the game & the engine by himself!\n\nI really recommend this game, It's totally worth the low price to support the solo-developer for future content!","timestamp_created":1502148942,"timestamp_updated":1502226234,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570601105690002441","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqafq4d0CdrGGggE="}
