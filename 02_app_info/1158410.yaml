    review: 'Every now and then, among the many, many games from the main industry
      bigwigs, the creative, innovative, and daring games from indie developers, among
      the lesser known gems, I stumble upon something that catches my eye, and when
      I decide to check it out, I find something that might not be as polished as
      the other games, might not gain too much traction either, and yet has its own
      charm to make me go: "Yeah, looks fun!"


      This right here is one of those games. A diamond in the rough.

      Beneath the rough graphics lies a short, yet quite fun puzzle game with 80 levels,
      some of which prove to be quite challenging once you get far enough. It''s been
      a nice experience for me, and I''m glad I got to play it. It''s the fruit of
      true, honest work, and I like it for what it is~'
