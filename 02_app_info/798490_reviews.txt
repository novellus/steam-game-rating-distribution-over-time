Beautiful female allies called Sisters, bizarre macabre enemies, metaphysical world representing emotions and thoughts, and voices in your ears the whole time. However, I dont know if that's coincidence, or if this a style of horror that's well known in Europe.\n Othercide is a fantastic turn-based game with solid initiative mechanics that are more akin to the Divinity RPGs or Darkest Dungeon rather than an X-com. It can be tough but like any enjoyable Git Gud game failure is not a full reset and milestone and unlocks can negate losses, making you stronger your next go.\nThe sacrifice mechanics can feel really mean and the grind from slow leveling can feel a bit much, but I enjoyed it and definitely have my fingers crossed for an Othercide 2","timestamp_created":1610085912,"timestamp_updated":1610085912,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3Kmm8PYCceq7wQI="}
