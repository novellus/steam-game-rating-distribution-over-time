Here I am just trying to call in some geese and rail a few flocks with the boys, but after sitting in a blind for an hour IRL both my ass cheeks in game and in real life started to hurt. I told myself maybe if I just waited 10 more minutes I would see just one goose. 30 minutes and 3 different spots later here I am, ♥♥♥♥ in hand bored out of my mind. DO NOT BUY THIS DLC, it is a waste of time, money, and sore ass cheeks. Just go to Layton Lake and shoot the 483,221 moose that you can find almost instantly... have a nice day and don't buy this pos dlc\n","timestamp_created":1609870389,"timestamp_updated":1609870389,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549779355525970459","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48JXw6fYCe5TjwAI="}
