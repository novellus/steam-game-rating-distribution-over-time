It is in the same style as Night Trap, but more challenging. The only thing I don't like is that it is impossible to follow the main events of the story without losing too many points or even getting a game over screen, since there is too many enemies coming all at once It would be nice to have an easy setting with less enemies to trap at once in order to enjoy more of the story and the funny characters, such as Lyle the Handyman, which is the best of the game.","timestamp_created":1603670682,"timestamp_updated":1603670682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521276593208312988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmZWOsfUCe/mTqgI="}
