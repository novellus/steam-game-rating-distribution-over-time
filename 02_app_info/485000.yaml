      \ table; with more than two players, place three available cards between each\
      \ pair of players.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nEach turn, you start with five cards\
      \ in hand, playing those cards in order to put locations into play, boost your\
      \ own sanity or reduce that of others, collect conjuring power to acquire new\
      \ cards, and remove cards from the game. You can use the power of your locations\
      \ once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and\
      \ all entities and artifacts that you played.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nIf you lose\

    reviews: "\u201CThe art in Cthulhu Realms is hilarious and beautifully done, somehow\
      \ complimenting the horror theme perfectly. The production value is top-notch.\u201D\
      <br />\r\nGameosity<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a surprisingly effective\
      \ package that delivers a great little deck builder with a low price tag. If\
      \ you can embrace the playful theme, you\u2019ll find a pleasant gem in Cthulhu\
      \ Realms.\u201D<br />\r\nGeek Ken<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201CIt certainly is not\
      \ just another deck-building game, but has original and fresh mechanics that\
      \ will challenge your brain.\u201D<br />\r\nBoard Game Maniac<br />\r\n"

    review: 'Save your money. Save your time. While I loved this game, the STEAM version
      just DOES NOT WORK online. You can have an experience playing against IA, but
      forget about challenging a mate, forget about challenging people online. Yeah,
      even if you paid for that.


      Interface gives headaches, with constanty moving in and out from the cards.
      There''s no alert when (if ever...) a game starts, if you manage to start a
      game it will disconnect a dozen times in a round.


      I don''t blame the obviously underpaid developers here. But honesty, these mistakes
      are expected from newbies.'
