I found the quotes and phrases I earned along the way to be genuinely encouraging and calming. As someone with anxiety and depression, it was nice to play through  a game that left me feeling so uplifted. I'd recommend playing Nebula Within after a long or stressful day to help you wind down, meditate, and center yourself.","timestamp_created":1604381619,"timestamp_updated":1604381702,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw976mxvUCer37qwI="}
