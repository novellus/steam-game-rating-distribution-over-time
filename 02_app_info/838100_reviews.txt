If you rarely play puzzle games this is a nice distraction when waiting for a short amount of time since the levels are compact and generaly do not take more than 5 minutes, similar to [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/266010/LYNE/]Lyne[/url]  or [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/265890/Hexcells/]Hexcells[/url]. If you are a hardcore-puzzler you will probably go through this in one short sitting. However for 80 cents it is well worthwile in my opinion.\n\nYour goal is traversing through a network of nodes and edges to the goal whilst reaching the exact point count shown on the goal node. You gain points by traversing through nodes which add 5 points or double your points, there are also nodes which subtract 5 points, teleport you or reset the map. There are a total of 50 levels.\n\nThe 80's asthetics are a nice touch, though I would have liked the design of the different nodes to be more distinctive. Everything that changes is the number of corners around a given node, and the game doesnt communicate what node does what, you have to find out by trial and error. This was a bit frustrating because some nodes do nothing but look different than the starting node which does nothing, yet also do nothing leaving me at first confused if I oversaw something. Also the teleport-nodes all look the same, so if you have multiple teleports you have to find out by trial and error where they go and memorize them. A bit of colourcoding really would have helped here.\n\nIn almost all levels the goal node corresponds to the maximum points you can reach, although in one level I managed to score 5 points more than the goal. Sadly that makes the game a little to predictive, since you for example always want to collect 5 points as soon as possible if they are in reach. It would be nice if some levels would require to lose some points on purpose to reach the goal, requiering more strategy.\n\nThough not as bad as in most puzzle games I played, this gmae suffers from introducing new concepts to early while not fully exploiting the allready existing mechanics to its fullest, in order to create an artificial sense of difficulty. A puzzle game which handles this nearly perfectly to my opinion is \n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/353540/Stephens_Sausage_Roll/] Stephen's Sausage Roll [/url], where the complexity grows exponentially with every new tool at your disposal, which rarerly happens in this game.\n\nAll in all I think this type of puzzle-game has a lot of potential and could be expanded upon by different number-modifiers, directed edges (Eulerian Path), and many well known concepts of graph theory.","timestamp_created":1597661961,"timestamp_updated":1597662833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4loWI/vMCfYmBnAI="}
