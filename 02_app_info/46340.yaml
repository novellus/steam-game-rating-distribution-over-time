    review: 'Not the most approachable RTS title or game series, these days, but there
      is still a lot of ''game'' in there.


      Runs somewhat sluggish on modern hardware (1440p@144Hz, Win10 64-bit). I advise
      to run as a single-core or dual-core game and use ''Vista'' compatibility and
      ''higher priority'' (Africa1943.bin file, not the exe). It is single-core performance
      heavy. Still hard to get 60FPS, no matter what CPU/GPU you have.


      It does scale well to higher resolutions and even 21:9.


      You can also run it in ''windowed mode'' if you think you still have issues
