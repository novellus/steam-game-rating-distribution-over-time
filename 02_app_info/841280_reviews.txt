It automates so much of the math and makes it much more new player friendly.  The Pact worlds is a great resource for the Golarion system and the plentary maps and details make it easy for me to bring them to life.","timestamp_created":1603496988,"timestamp_updated":1603565098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwbL7rfUCcZnbqQI="}
