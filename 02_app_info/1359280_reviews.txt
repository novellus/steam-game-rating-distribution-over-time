Bought it for shenanigans, but it's simply not worth it. This is 90%-off bargain bin material at best.\nInstructions poorly written.\nControls not optimised.\nWhen you do manage to get a handle of the controls, behaviours don't act properly to how they should.\nThe other reviewers were right. There is no support for this. It's clear that the developer doesn't want to be tracked down.\nIt's just not worth the effort, even if you get it for just lulz.\nI was successful in getting a refund. Voluntarily opted for Steam credit which was fulfilled without challenge.","timestamp_created":1606699753,"timestamp_updated":1606699753,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456431567668914795","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44pOxi/YCct3ItQI="}
