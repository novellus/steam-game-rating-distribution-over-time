There is the talk about the ways for a split soul. But this game doesn't give you any options. There is one part playing a depressed young man. But you don't play him. You can only confirm playing a useless game on his laptop or talk to a very few npc's. \nThe other is an old warrior with even less options. Oh, at last he can fight. But the fights are boring.\nThere is just not enough to do in this 'game'. Add that most npc's don't talk, that some conversations are not translated and\nthat the end is very very bad (with a hint that they want to sell the next part) and I can't recommend this 'game' even for the low price","timestamp_created":1518292520,"timestamp_updated":1518292520,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.630561947822570801","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1518428796,"developer_response":"Thank you for your review.\nWe are very sorry that our story seemed to you was boring and not interesting.\nIf you find an error, you can report it to our mail or group in a pair"}],"cursor":"AoJwxKnSwOECcILEmAE="}
