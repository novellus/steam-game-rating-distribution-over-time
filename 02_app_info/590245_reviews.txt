Very good songs too, what a voice! I only played the Lead and Rhytm parts for Guitar.\n\nThe songs  “Hold On”, “Gimme All Your Love”, and \"Always Alright\" are in E Standard. The song “Don’t Wanna Fight” is in E♭ (E‐flat).\n\nI think they have a nice modern blues, rock, funky sound that I really dig.\n\nHave to say that there is a little censoring in one  or two of the songs, that I feel a little cringy about. But saying that is more ment as an signal to the developers than that it should hold you back buying this.","timestamp_created":1545955242,"timestamp_updated":1545955489,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zpaI+ecCdarTtgE="}
