I think the art style really suits the game, the music is pretty relaxing. This game can be pretty relaxing when you are flying high in the sky and looking down on the village below. I wasn't a fan of some of the voice acting but I can see the love that went into the story writing through the dialogue so that was cool. There is a pretty good attention to detail in populated areas of the map. The bird player model is really well made and thought out- the bird's feathers actually act aerodynamically and mimic real bird flight. I thought that was pretty cool. \n\nCons: I kept trying to give this game chances and kept being disappointed. I spent about 30 minutes trying to fix a graphical bug that was tied to the render distance in the game  (the most pivotal part of the game play). This game is poorly optimized (I have a pretty hefty pc that can handle pretty much anything) and had lag. There were bugs with the waterfalls and the controls are horrific. I switched to a controller and still had issues. Your bird pulls wherever it wants at times; this made focusing on the game a little hard as it changed from a story based experience to surgeon simulator with wings. \n\nOverall: I don't agree with this game being released with such game mechanic breaking bugs (the render distance glitch i had). BUT I do think this game is worth the money I spent on it (I got it on sale for less than 2 dollars). I wanted to like it so much more. I think if this game was fixed and a bit more polished, they could've expanded on it a lot and made something compelling and powerful. This game has such a unique way of presenting information to the consumer; but it feels half finished- especially at the end.","timestamp_created":1607909912,"timestamp_updated":1607910042,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528985500335693359","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmYW6r/YCdf7/uQI="}
