I can't see any of the icons, and that is the primary reason I don't play the game.  I can't see the icons, and there is no explanation of what the UI DOES?  It's great to have great artwork, but in the end, the GUI is a communication tool.  Even though the icons are suitable artistic, they are uninformative, and with the absence of tooltips, and the fact that the icons for tech etc are too small, it renders the content essentially useless.  Great game, good art, interesting structure and gameplay, good ideas, even a good GUI.  The problem is that you can't see what is taking place in the icons, and that they are generally uninformative.\n\nTo summarize, either redesign the tech icons etc or add tooltips that say what the item is, but also what it does when you buy it.  Please heavily consider adding tooltips, possibly linking them with game encyclopedia, as in other modern strategy games.

I really appreciate the constructive feedback and I'm sorry that you're having trouble playing Medieval Kingdom Wars due to the poor UI choices. \n\nThis is a major complaint that we have heard from our players. Clearly our UI is not effective if our players cannot understand or use the icons. We're looking to revise this in the near future and currently have testers providing us feedback on this exact problem. \n\nI can't guarantee that the UI will be revised right away -- we're a small studio of only 3 developers so sometimes it takes us a while to develop updates. However I guarantee that this will be changed in the future. I'll let you know when we've done some updates and made some improvements. I would hate to lose a player because of something like this! \n\nThanks again for your valuable input. Feel free to message me whenever with more feedback/comments!\n"}],"cursor":"AoJ4uYKi8PYCd8K7wQI="}
