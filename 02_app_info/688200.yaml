    review: "I don't think I would recommend this game even if I got it for free.\n\
      \nThe main character's naive personality is anything but charming (rather, she\
      \ was irritating through and through), and the side characters are so boring\
      \ and unclear. \n\nI had a hard time following the flow of the story because\
      \ the opening scene didn't put a foundation of what the story would be about,\
      \ it's not enough to be dependent on a summary from steam to get what the game\
      \ is supposed to be about. Normally, it should be easy visualizing the branching\
      \ of the visual novel as you play along but it was not something so clear. I\
      \ felt like the combat system is what draggged down the experience for me. The\
      \ dialogue would also be hard to read because of the colors, the font size is\
      \ good but the contrast with the dialogue box was not enough. \n\nThe only positive\
      \ thing about the game is how art style of the background and the characters\
      \ compliment each other. It's just that the sprites were so inconsistent with\
      \ proportions and angles that makes the art not able to save the flat writing."
