    developer_response: Thank you for you detailed review. I will work to improve
      the game as much as I can to make your investment worth. I have no plan in changing
      the game price. I defined it based on the planned 70 levels.

    review: 'Full Play through here: https://youtu.be/IZp6sTjJvXg


      For now I''m not recommending it until I see the full release the game is extremely
      short. This prologue is not worth 1.99$ or 1.69 which is what I got it for on
      sale. There''s no benefit to doing combos no sense of accomplishment when you
      get a huge line up or a multi combo since it all does about the same damage
      exactly. The fights are tedious cause you''re basically just matching them as
      fast as possible without combos. The line up is RNG so you''re not really improving
      you just take advantage of what it drops you. The enemies have no powers nothing
      the fights just get longer. You can get puzzle and dragons for free and it has
      so much more to it on your mobile device. I like the concept but there''s not
      barely ANY story at all which could set this game apart. Hopefully the creators
      will improve this I''m not sure if the full release will cost money on top of
      paying for this version BUT I WOULD NOT BUY THIS ONE until changes are made.
      I probably forgot somethings but I''m sure I mentioned them in my video.'
