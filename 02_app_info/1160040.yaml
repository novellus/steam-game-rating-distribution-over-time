    review: "Human Factory has so much potential that it was able to keep me hooked\
      \ despite bugs that would normally cause me to instantly abandon E.A. I play\
      \ a ton of simulation games, and I sincerely hope this one doesn't get abandoned\
      \ (the dev's fast response on the discussion board suggests otherwise). \n\n\
      Pros:\nEasy to understand process with fairly optimized factory production.\
      \ I wasn't able to find anything that was too over or underpowered: the numbers\
      \ felt just right. \n\nSolid music, a must have if a simulation game is to keep\
      \ you hooked\n\nAttempt at humor is hit or miss, but I find the whole idea of\
      \ the game hilarious. Some funny dialogues too. I hope the dialogues get expanded\
      \ as they become repetitive after a few hours. \n\nGreat progression sequence.\
      \ I felt like each step was difficult and rewarding, causing me to rethink my\
      \ strategies in order to optimize production.\n\nThe research tree is well optimized.\
      \ I felt like I was struggling to get to the next research and when I finally\
      \ did, it completely changed how I was able to play. I constantly found myself\
      \ reimaging my factory and thinking of how the information i just got will affect\
      \ my next steps. This is the core of a good simulation game and the reason that\
      \ I was able to look over a definitely-concerning amount of bugs.\n\nThe breeding\
      \ sequence looks really cool, although I wasn't able to get that far. I like\
      \ how the game pushes you to stratify between your humans to find the highest\
      \ quality ones and use them for different purpose to your low quality ones,\
      \ which you basically immideately harvest after they run on the treadmill for\
      \ a little white. I think it will be awesome once you can raise kids from children!!\n\
      \nThe path forward for the game is clear and well established. There are a ton\
      \ of options for the dev and the community through modding to expand the game\
      \ and offer new features. So long as the numbers match up (and that seems fairly\
      \ easy to do), there could be an insane ammount of content. And the building\
      \ system, once fixed, will make building to scale fairly easy such that you\
      \ can incorporate all sorts of new features. \n\n\nHere are a few of the nearly\
      \ game-breaking glitches that made me want to quit (although, again, the pros\
      \ made me stay). \n\nCons: Bugs, bugs, bugs. \n\nBuilding can be a little annoying\
      \ for a few reasons. A) The delete key sometimes sticks (although this problem\
      \ went away after I started holding down the delete key and playing for an hour\
      \ or so). B) Directions of the belts can get a little wonky. 3) Some buildings\
      \ can change height and others can't. There's no easy way to visually see what\
      \ you did or are doing as you build. 4) Some of the buildings won't work on\
      \ certain tiles, meaning you have to rearrange the entire factory for some odd\
      \ glitch. \n\nShit... Everywhere. \nFor some reason, toilets wouldn't work in\
      \ some rooms. I tried building extra toilets, moving the toilets, changing the\
      \ poop piping... They just kept shitting everywhere. Once they start shitting\
      \ everywhere, the mood goes down and they shit more. And then they throw it\
      \ ALL OVER THE FACTORY. Cleaning poop is annoying, as you have to pick up each\
      \ one at a time and put it in the incinerator. \n\nCopy and Paste\nThe building\
      \ copy and paste causes the most building glitches. While the poop was the most\
      \ annoying glitch, this is what made me have to stop. Sometimes, entire machines\
      \ would stop working and wouldn't work anywhere that a room was every copied.\
      \ There are so many irregulatirities that it's impossible to debug, as all of\
      \ the sudden folks are walking through walls.\n\nOverall, I'd say that simulation\
      \ lovers will likely enjoy this game, even for the steep price. Although for\
      \ $25 I am going to be very salty if there isn't major improvements to the game\
      \ before release. More casual players may want to wait for more updates or a\
      \ sale. \n"
