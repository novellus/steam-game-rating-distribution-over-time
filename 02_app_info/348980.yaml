      When I bought this game, it had no intelligible reviews, and it looked cool,
      so I figured I''d be the guinea pig.  Here were my impressions:


      [list]

      [*] [b]Level 1:[/b] I start out in a hallway with some platforms you can jump
      on.  The platforms lead nowhere.  I turn the corner and there is the level-exit.  Okay?


      [*] [b]Level 2:[/b] I''m in a room with a door in the middle.  There is semi-transparent
      wall surrounding it.  I walk to the other side and find a hole, and then walk
      through it to the exit.


      [*] [b]Level 3:[/b] I start in an empty hallway that leads nowhere.  I turn
      around and there''s a button.  I press the button, and a staircase opens, with
      the level exit at the bottom.


      [*] [b]Level 4:[/b] I''m in an empty room with a circle on the ground in the
      corner, and a button on the wall.  I press the button, and a ball falls from
      the ceiling.  Some text appears explaining I need to roll the ball onto the
      circle.  Doing so is difficult, because the controls are terrible.  I finally
      get it onto the circle, and the exit door appears.


      [*] [b]Level 5:[/b] I''m in a big empty red room.  No wait, there are platforms
      that can only be seen if there is red background behind them.  That''s cool!
      Unfortunately, rather than making a cool puzzle out of this, they decided to
      make a mindless platformer.  I need to hop from one invisible platform to the
      next to reach the exit.  It takes a long time because the jumping is clunky
      and the landings are slippery.


      [*] [b]Level 6:[/b] This level is much bigger.  It looks like it could actually
      be a puzzle.  No wait, it''s just more invisible platforming with bad controls.  Great.


      [*] [b]Level 7:[/b] Very long and precise invisible platforming. I fall for
      the 10th time, and exit the game.

      [/list]


      This game is utterly terrible.  The UI is so bad I accidentally deleted my save-game
      while writing this review.  The map designer was clearly in the process of learning
      how to make levels.  The entire game feels like a college project.  It deserves
      an ''A'', but definitely should not be sold as an actual product for people
      to buy.


      I can''t think of any way the developers could salvage this game.  Just avoid
      it.'
