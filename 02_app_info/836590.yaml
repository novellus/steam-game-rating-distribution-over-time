    review: "Some series don't  get the credit they deserve, and for a long time Yoshihisa\
      \ Kishimoto's Kunio Kun franchise was one of them.  Despite inventing the multi-directional\
      \ street beat-em-up, the series has stayed relatively unknown, up until 2019,\
      \ when Wayforward's River City Girls became a hit and got far more people's\
      \ attention.  The time was ripe to make more Kunio games, and better yet, ARC\
      \ managed to re-enlist the aid of series creator Yoshihisa Kishimoto.  This\
      \ game could and should have been great, but for every good decision they made\
      \ with it, there's several more that had me wondering, why?!\n\nFor example,\
      \ it starts with the strangest character creation feature I've ever seen.  Pick\
      \ your character's name, whether male or female, whether romantically linked\
      \ to Kobayashi or just a friend, and three items the character finds significant--then\
      \ wait, as the character is just someone captured that Kobayashi needs to rescue,\
      \ and won't show up again until the end of the game.\n\nThat's a good segue\
      \ to this game's doozy of a plot.  A gang from the future has invaded River\
      \ City, they've brought killer robots, someone else from the future called Mizoguchi\
      \ follows them back in order to assist you, also some ghosts that Mizoguchi\
      \ can vaporize with his laser beam, a robot cat shows up to help save your game,\
      \ sometimes flying saucers attack, and sometimes you all hop into other flying\
      \ saucers and you dogfight with your enemies.  At worst, a plot like that should\
      \ be hilariously stupid, but this game takes it dead-seriously.  Of course,\
      \ a good story is not what most people play beat-em-ups for, but the real problem\
      \ here is the amount of dialogue.  Constantly, you'll encounter characters who\
      \ freeze the action while they talk...a lot.  It's not funny, it's not interesting,\
      \ it's rarely ever useful to playing the game, it occasionally gets pretentiously\
      \ philosophical about the utility of emotions, and it has no fast-skip option.\
      \  For once in beat-em-up history, I was mashing the attack button for something\
      \ other than attacking.\n\nBetween those annoying conversations, you do actually\
      \ get to play a beat-em-up, but it's simultaneously the most defiantly literal\
      \ interpretation of the term and really different from what you expect.  Beating\
      \ people (and robots, and flying saucers) up is almost ALL you do in this game.\
      \  There are a number of regions to wander around and advancing to a new one\
      \ can trigger character encounters, but there's no specific place you're supposed\
      \ to reach in this game; your objective is to defeat all of four gangs of enemies\
      \ of a specific color, after which a corresponding boss appears, and after you\
      \ defeat all of the bosses you fight the final boss.  \n\nWith fighting being\
      \ the only real objective here, it really better be good.  While its a mixed\
      \ bag, it's indeed the highlight of the game--but you wouldn't know it at first.\
      \  That's because each character's individual moveset is pretty simple compared\
      \ to most games in this series.  You have only one normal attack button, what\
      \ attacks you do will be determined by context and certain directional inputs,\
      \ and there's no blocking or weapons.  Seems a downgrade from literally every\
      \ other Kunio game available here on Steam, but this game also brings in a nifty\
      \ team system leagues ahead of its predecessors.  Kobayashi has two steady allies,\
      \ the series' core protagonist, Kunio, and this game's new hero, Mizoguchi.\
      \  Only one can be out and assisting Kobayashi at any given time, but you can\
      \ swap between them at any time you like.  Better yet, you can choose whom you're\
      \ controlling at the push of a button; the other characters becoming controlled\
      \ by AI.  \n\nIn retrospect, it's odd that River City Girls didn't have something\
      \ like this, considering that both characters were clearly supposed to be out\
      \ at the same time due to their constantly talking to each other.  In fact,\
      \ this game's team system is the real meat of its combat and learning to use\
      \ it well is key to winning.  Kobayashi, Kunio and Mizoguchi all have their\
      \ own movesets, with Kunio being the stronger ally but Mizoguchi having a projectile\
      \ weapon and able to dispense power-ups to the team once a meter is charged,\
      \ so despite the individual characters' relative lack of depth, cycling through\
      \ them to utilize their unique abilities keeps things from getting mindless.\
      \  To go a bit further, one of Mizoguchi's power-ups will summon the Dragon\
      \ Twins (the second-to-last bosses of River City Ransom) to come join in your\
      \ rampage, so you can actually have a total of four (out of five) teammates\
      \ in battle at once.  \n\nSo though this fighting system isn't likely what you\
      \ wanted from the Kunio brand, overall it's not bad at all.  There's just one\
      \ part of the combat that is as bizarre as choices this game makes elsewhere,\
      \ and that's the special attacks.  Each character has their own; some up to\
      \ three, and given that normal attacks vary based on what direction one is pushing\
      \ along with the normal attack button, it would be easy to assume the same was\
      \ true with special attacks.  It's not.  For whatever reason, to get different\
      \ special attacks you hold the special attack button, causing an aura to encircle\
      \ your character; this aura changes color at various times, different colors\
      \ mean different special attacks, so you release the button when it's on the\
      \ color you want.  Hope you can memorize which are which.  This doesn't wreck\
      \ the combat, and to be fair, some of the special attacks themselves are neat,\
      \ but it's still a very strange choice I'd prefer not to repeat.  \n\nTo help\
      \ you through the solid-but-one-note gameplay, the game does live up to the\
      \ Kunio pedigree in one regard: It has some fantastic music.  Not all of the\
      \ tracks are memorable, but the one you'll be hearing throughout most of the\
      \ game is an awesome upbeat bit of blues rock, much in the vein of the original\
      \ River City Ransom.  As solid as Meghan McDuffie's score for River City Girls\
      \ was, most tracks only ran on a very short time before looping, not composed\
      \ to be much longer since more individual areas had their own music.  This song,\
      \ like the original RCR theme, wails on long and varied, as different instruments\
      \ come in and take solos, and its tragic that it won't likely be remembered\
      \ as one of the top musical themes in the series.\n\nBecause unfortunately,\
      \ while it's original team system keeps this game interesting for a while, the\
      \ lack of variety or interesting worldbuilding dooms further replay value--that,\
      \ and the negative difficulty curve.  In series tradition, this game does have\
      \ some sort of RPG mechanics, initially tucked so far away that one may not\
      \ even realize.  After beating the game, points are earned which can be used\
      \ to improve characters.  However, though they get stronger, there isn't much\
      \ customization, and instead of having some extra content to test these improved\
      \ characters against, they invite you to play through the same quest again,\
      \ maybe with different character creation choices, and these, combined with\
      \ how quickly you beat the game, will affect what events occur and what ending\
      \ you get.  However, none of that really amounts to anything but different conversations,\
      \ and with this game's dialogue and story as dull as they are, not worth it.\
      \ Plus, do you really want to keep beating enemies who aren't a match for you\
      \ anymore just to see how fast you can do it?  The moment this game's deeper\
      \ mechanics are no longer needed to win, it becomes much more like the worst\
      \ beat-em-ups.\n\nAll things considered, this is little but some good music\
      \ and mechanics buried in a game that otherwise, is mediocre at best.  It's\
      \ definitely not worth its original asking price, cheap as that was, and don't\
      \ bother getting all possible endings.  If marked down, it might be worth a\
      \ look--and listen--but don't expect Kobayashi-San to stay cool for very long."
