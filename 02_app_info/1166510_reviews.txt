When you start off, you are thrown into what claims to be a procedural universe with no direction whatsoever. I have found no evidence that the game even works as intended. You have a series of abilities in your inventory, all with no explanation, with no indication of how to acquire more of these materials. Of all of them Antigravity is most important, as I have found no other way to leave a planet once you've landed on it. These are limited resources, by the way, so once you are out of antigrav you're fucked.\n\nPlayed for a total of 33 mins over 2 sessions, in all that time I encountered neither enemies nor minerals, every planet looks the same, and the overall look of the game as a whole looks like a bad acid trip. Needless to say I am refunding this piece of shit.","timestamp_created":1574653959,"timestamp_updated":1574653959,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.667993366718292236","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tZOs0O4CeOrB3AE="}
