    review: 'Right so I used to have a good review on this game, but I have deleted
      my old one to remake it into a Negitive one. Been fooling around with the possibility
      of making a video Review on this but this seems a bit easier to do for now.


      Virtual Warfighter is one of the coolest tactical shooters on the market, it''s
      terrible! Now how does that make sense? Well it''s mainly because it''s dead
      and have no players ever as well as no bots. The devs are working on bots, but
      they''ve been working on bots for the past 3 years so you know...probably not
      gonna happen until i''m married or something.


      Now the weapon handling, gunplay, everything about how this game feels is great!
      The teamwork you can have with players, nades around corners, even doing simple
      things like planting a bomb is extreamly solid feeling. Not sure how defusing
      the bomb works because i''ve never gotten the chance to do it with the 2 times
      I got to play with someone else.


      The maps are amazing as well, you can tell a lot of love and care went into
      these, with the lighting, the background noise. There is a police station that''s
      amazing for CQC, and a desert map that can go to extream ranges, so you have
      something for every kind of gun build. Oh yeah the customization is also really
      good, you can put almost anything you want in the armory on the firearms you
      have as long as it has a rail. It''s all great and maybe the most disheartening
      thing ever at the same time. I can only say good things about this game because...well
      yeah it''s GOOD! It''s really good, but it''s just dead and overshadowed by
      other games like Pavlov or Onward. It''s a real shame too, I could see this
      easily taking over both of them.


      All in all, i''d keep my eye on it but...don''t get your hopes up. Last update
      was in 2017, but they are active on there discord and ARE working on the game.
      They can just only do it part time, the game isn''t profitable and they have
      to make a living outside of it somehow. If you have a large group of friends
      though, I''d pick it up 100%, pretty much it''ll be you and your friends own
      private video game. If it''s just you though....Ehhhhhhh, give it a pass unless
      you find it for really cheap.'
