      Terroir is incredibly rewarding, largely because of the sheer challenge of conquering\
      \ its innate randomness. The satisfaction of figuring out how to create the\
      \ perfect bottle of wine, the pride of being named the best wine of the year,\
      \ watching your prestige grow and your territory expand, and the cautious necessity\
      \ of keeping plenty of cash in your coffers becomes all the more potent because\
      \ you know that, any given year, fate could turn against you and you could very\
      \ well lose it all.\u201D<br>75 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamingtrend.com/feature/reviews/learning-to-appreciate-a-good-bottle-of-wine-terroir-a-winemaking-tycoon-game/\"\
