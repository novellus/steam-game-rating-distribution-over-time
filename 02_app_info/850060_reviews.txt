Though this time you got a new meter resource instead of Mana, which is called Thanatos. When used it powers up your abilities to have different properties and such. Overall I would recommend the first game over this one, but if you've already played that one then this still worth buying.\n\nAs with the previous game, if you have ~200 FPS or more, the mouse sensitivity might be too low even on the fastest settings, as it was for me, but I solved it by limiting the frame rate of the game to 150.","timestamp_created":1601639064,"timestamp_updated":1601639064,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513797640800476074","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnJTI9PQCcMKwpQI="}
