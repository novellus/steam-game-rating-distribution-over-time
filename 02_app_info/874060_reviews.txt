With a very interesting and relatable main character the game also includes some genuinely tough moral choices throughout the game. Some interesting discussions about morals and ethics that are not often seen in games. The different endings might be a little arbritrary but this mature game is still highly recommended!\n\nFull review:\nhttps://adventuregamespodcast.com/podcast/2020/12/4/episode-92-reviews-of-enypnion-zniw-adventure-bleeding-moons-the-last-show-of-mr-chardish-amp-five-dates","timestamp_created":1608217105,"timestamp_updated":1608217105,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4prLNuPYCddj6ugI="}
