    review: 'I wish I could give a 2.5/5 rating to this, but seeing that it''s got
      so many positive reviews so I am going to give the thumbs down just to balance
      it out.


      If you have played the game well past Atropos Station in which you will gain
      access to flip flops and research net, these dlc puzzles will feel very tedious
      because you will have half a reactor space to work with and will need to grab
      atoms one by one, and each needs to be teleported to the other side of the reactor.
      For assembling complex molecules, this feels like a chore and one step back.  The
      teleport mechanic adds new contraints while taking away the flip flop mechanic,
      which I have pretty much gotten so used to having finished the base game and
      completed more than a couple dozens of research net puzzle.


      I think the dlc is not that bad given the price. I bought it on sale to get
      the last achievement. Only buy this if you really like spacechem.'
