First of all, there is no plot at all and the gameplay mostly revolves around our character wandering around hellish maze-like dungeon solving puzzles that do not make any sense either. There are hardly any elements that instill horrors and the overall concept isn't that mind blowing either.","timestamp_created":1608207310,"timestamp_updated":1608207310,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwy4OouPYCcMr2ugI="}
