      Game Tengoku debut!<h2 class="bb_tag">Contents</h2>The Super Fighter works differently
      to the other ships in Game Tengoku. Firstly, it comes equipped with 3 weapons;
      Power Shot, Tatsujin Beam, Thunder Laser and the Tatsujin bomb. You can switch
      between them by collecting the appropriate coloured &quot;P&quot; item. The
      options appear when the ship is powered up rather than via items.<br><br>The
      Super Fighter can be used in Arcade Mode + and scores can be recorded in the
      on-line leaderboards.<br>The DLC also adds a new page to the Data Mode HD library
      where you can look at flyers, screenshots and other documents related to the
      game while listening to commentary by the game''s characters.<br>It also comes
      with two music tracks; the original stage 1 theme by Masahiro Yuge and a remix
