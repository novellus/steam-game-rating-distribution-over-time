    review: 'This DLC is right up the alley of anyone looking to cover homes and houses,
      it offers a great deal of options though it should be noted that the technology
      the textures represent is something of a mashup of the things from early 1800''s
      Europe homes in cities to late 1800 styled furniture you''d find in those aforementiond
      homes.


      I think the only thing I was hoping to see more of was wooden floor textures
      as it only has one color which kinda limits you since the other floors have
      cracks and holes, so designing a house is kinda static floor wise. That and
      some odd bits like the 2 doors that are present don''t quite cover the door
      frames in the game very well but you can resize those without any trouble. I
      also noticed that the textures for the walls had no real options for a home
      that would have been well cared for and had clean walls (I used what would have
      been white walls but it was covered in dirt).


      My complains are super minor though and I love this DLC for all that it adds
      to home building for my games! :D'
