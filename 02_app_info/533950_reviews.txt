However, I think it could go for just a tiny little bit more polish than how it is at this very moment. Bee stings are hard to avoid, controller support seems a bit unfinished, and while the game does look good on its own I kinda feel as if the game itself is locked at 30fps despite my Steam layout showing 60fps on-screen. But nitpicks aside, this game is actually kinda fun, it's almost like a Zelda-type game where you can do whatever the hell you want. If you like those kinda games, go ahead and give this one a try.","timestamp_created":1610069639,"timestamp_updated":1610069639,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49Z/o7/YCftO2wQI="}
