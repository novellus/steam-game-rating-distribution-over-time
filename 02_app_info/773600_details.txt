This expansion adds a new board piece to the main Talisman board, ready to be explored.

Paths determine how your character will experience the Woodland Region and what happens at the Meeting with Destiny space. When you reach your Meeting with Destiny, you must resolve the Destiny affect on your Path Card. After you do, you must emerge from the Woodland and move to the Forest space. <br><br><strong>Light and Dark Fate<\/strong><br>“The fae have emerged from their mysterious, forested homeland and altered the course of fate forever.”<br>The Woodland Expansion introduces new rules for fate which replace the classic rules found in the Talisman base game. You will now be able to use Light and Dark Fate. At the start of the game you’re able to split your fate into Light and Dark as you please, and so on as you gain fate throughout the game.<br><br>Dark Fate allows you to sabotage other players by re-rolling their die. If you’re in a battle with another player and they roll an attack score which will defeat you, you can use a Dark Fate token to make them re-roll their die. Light Fate works the same as Fate has previously in Talisman. <br><br>Characters within the Woodland Expansion have special abilities which require specific tokens. If a character is killed any tokens they have left on the board are removed. <br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/773600\/extras\/TDE_TheWoodland_Banner02_Characters.png?t=1594894999\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ancient Oak<\/h2>Living for thousands of years has taught the Ancient Oak many secrets.

As one of the few skilled Craft workers that have learned how to harness the power of Ley Lines, you’ll be able to create and use portals to travel along them. When you play as the Leywalker:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You being the game with 3 Portal tokens on your character card. <br><\/li><li>Whenever a character not in the Inner Region casts a Spell you may place a portal token from your character onto their space. <br><\/li><li>Instead of your normal move, you may teleport to any space with one of your Portal tokens. After moving this way, you will regain your portal token. <br><\/li><li>Whenever you land on the Runes and\/or on a space with one of your portal tokens, you may gain1 Spell if your craft allows it. <br><\/li><li>When you're about to engage in battle, you may discard a Spell to use your Craft instead of your Strength during battle.<\/li><\/ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Spider Queen<\/h2>Trapped in the Cursed Glade for most of her life, the Spider Queen has become spiteful towards others. Leaving webs and your spiders across the land to hinder your enemies, you’ll weave your way to the Crown of Command. When you play as the Spider Queen:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>You begin the game with 6 spider tokens. <br><\/li><li>At the start of your turn you may place a Spider token from your character card onto any space with a character with its Web side faceup. <br><\/li><li>When you enter a space with a Web token you may immediately end your movement. <br><\/li><li>When another character enters a space with a Web token they must immediately end their movement.

Other characters cannot encounter cards with Hidden Path token on them. They still count as faceup cards in that space. If a card with a Hidden Path token is removed from its space, return that token to your character card. <br><\/li><li>When you roll the die for movement, you may add 1 to the result. <br><\/li><li>You need not roll the die in the Chasm, Crags, or Forest unless you wish to.

The sheer power the Crown holds needs to be controlled by someone of good judgement and nature. Once a player has reached the Crown of Command, all characters within the Inner Region will be teleported to the Portal of Power and no character can enter into the Inner Region for the rest of the game. Each character must then roll 1 die to see what their judgement is. The last character alive is the true ruler and wins the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Wanderlust<\/h2>The path to the Crown of Command is filled with dangerous and difficult challenges. Before approaching the Crown you must first resolve three Path Card’s in the Eyrie, Town Square or Meeting with Destiny spaces.

To relinquish their power one of them must be defeated. Players place their Fate down on the ending card which Oberon and Titania draw their strength from. All players are teleported to the Forest and have to work their way to the Meeting with Destiny space before they can challenge Oberon or Titania. Oberon fights using Strength with every Dark Fate token placed adding +1 to his Strength, Titania fights with Craft with every Light Fate token placed adding +1 to her Craft. The battle will be hard so make sure you’re ready for a mighty showdown. Whoever defeats either Oberon or Titania first wins the game. <br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/773600\/extras\/TDE_TheWoodland_Banner04_Expansion.png?t=1594894999\" \/><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>103 Woodland Cards<br><\/li><li>20 Path Cards<br><\/li><li>14 Destiny Cards<br><\/li><li>3 Alternative Endings<br><\/li><li>5 New Characters<\/li><\/ul>","about_the_game":"<i>“Surrounding the land of Talisman are four great kingdoms known as Regions.
