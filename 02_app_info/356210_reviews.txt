When you figure out a puzzle it's not a heureka! moment but rather \"what the hell...?\" kind of. So I think some parts of the game have not been designed and scripted well, or done so in a hurry.\nHowever, the story is intriguing and you want to know what happens next so you keep trying.\nIt's gotten lot of negative reviews since it's release but I find myself coming back to this game time and time again.\nIt's a forgotten game from the 90's, haven't aged too well maybe but anyone who loves PnC genre and classic LucasArts style should play it. I just wish, there was a way to play the second game \"Rake's progress\".\nAbout the Steam release:\nThere seems to be a problem with ScummVM games on Steam because you can't access program settings, those have been automatically adjusted for user(how kind!) and the program is not kept up to date. So this causes problems(bugs and crashes) and I'm not the only one experiencing it. Given that people give money for these products Steam really should get program settings up to date since this is not the first ScummVM game people have problems with.","timestamp_created":1608753182,"timestamp_updated":1608753182,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw067KyPYCfs/IvAI="}
