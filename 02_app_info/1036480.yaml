    review: The only strong negative I can say about this DLC would be the length
      of it. I got it on sale for $5.99, so for $6 I feel like the length of the DLC
      is good, but I would be disappointed if I had paid the full $10 for it. I really
      enjoyed the mixing drinks aspect of work because it allowed for a bit more of
      a time management decision from the player and it was fun to memorize the ingredients.
      I do wish, however, that the 3 date system was explained a bit more thoroughly.
      I knew I could only meet the person 3 times, but I didn't know it would be a
      brief interaction with no personal input, and that they would be judging me
      strictly on items and clothing I had bought or gifts I brought for them. Overall
      I still really enjoyed the DLC, and I'd recommend it to anyone who really enjoys
      the base game.
