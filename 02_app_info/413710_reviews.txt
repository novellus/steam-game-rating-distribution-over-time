My biggest problem is that once you lose health in ANY encounter, you are now a slave and must break out. You lose all equipment, all money, and in general the game fucks you so hard you may as well just start over. The missions in town are fun, and doing jobs for the suspicious stranger is a cool idea, but the game will gladly just tell you \"Nope!\" and insta-kill you and rob you of everything at a moments notice. Ship Combat is also just kinda buggy and floaty, with terrible graphics and a terrible feel to it all. I commend the effort, but it's just plain not fun and feels worse than the average mod of Mount and Blade.","timestamp_created":1609466600,"timestamp_updated":1609466600,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514705896377563477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpOvr3fYCd86ivwI="}
