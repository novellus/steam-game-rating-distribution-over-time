    review: The story (in my opinion) is a little better than the other games from
      the series but I don't recommend buying it for the full price. There are a lot
      of games with better art style and story that are just a little more expensive.
      If You had an extra 4$ to spend You'd find a lot better games than this. I know
      that these game series feature the same characters but it makes most of the
      work being copy pasted games with a poor story. The story is so short that if
      You were to complete it fast enough You could even get all the endings and refund
      the game. Story isn't the best here but if You were to play one game from this
      series I'd recommend this one. And it's also easy to max achievements. So I
      just recommend getting it on sale for easy achievements or anime backgrounds.
