I was never really a fan of the games where your only option was to run around in circles and hide in the closet till the scary monster went away.\n\nThis game, is literally exactly what I always wanted, and I hope it gets bigger over time.","timestamp_created":1608942463,"timestamp_updated":1609485840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50199204683303833","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw6J213vYCeoScvQI="}
