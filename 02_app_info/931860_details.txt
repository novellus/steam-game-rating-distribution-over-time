What players get is a charming, funny, and challenging platform game that feels like a combination between an Indiana Jones like adventure mixed with elements of exploration and Mega Man like gameplay, minus the blaster. It’s a title I absolutely loved digging into and I feel anyone that’s a fan of retro games definitely deserves to check this one out.
