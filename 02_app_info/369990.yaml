    about_the_game: "<img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/369990/extras/SteamStore05.png?t=1606466341\"\
      \ /><br>This is an intense strategy board game in a steampunk world of corrupt\
      \ capitalist gremlins who compete for money, political power and prestige. Save\
      \ and invest, steal and extort, arrest and get arrested \u2013 in single-player\
      \ and multiplayer, with ranks and ladders, team mode and spectator mode. Featuring\
      \ seasonal content updates, regular tournaments, item drops, full support of\
      \ Steam Community Market \u2013 and more!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>HOW DO\
      \ YOU PLAY THIS GAME?</strong></h2><br>Gremlins, Inc. is designed for up to\
      \ 6 players, in <u>multiplayer</u> or in <u>single-player</u> mode (with AI\
      \ bots). Each player has 6 cards on their hand (replenished from the same deck)\
      \ and uses them either to move around the playing field or to perform different\
      \ game actions. There is a lot of interaction with other players, and duels\
      \ are significantly different from 3-player or 4-player games. You can play\
      \ until a certain score limit, or until agreed number of rounds, or for time\
      \ limit. The game offers both <u>custom</u> and <u>ranked</u> sessions (with\
      \ matchmaking by rating).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CAN YOU PLAY IN TEAMS\
      \ OR JUST WATCH?</strong></h2><br>Yes, you can! In addition to <u>custom sessions</u>\
      \ (where you define the parameters of the session and may optionally set filters\
      \ for those who can join you) and password-protected <u>private sessions</u>\
      \ (so that you and your friends can play undisturbed), the game offers <u>team\
      \ mode</u> (2x2, 3x3, or 2x2x2) with teams of human players and/or AI bots.\
      \ Gremlins, Inc. also supports a built-in <u>spectator mode</u>, which allows\
      \ you to watch sessions of other players right from inside of the game, sharing\
      \ your emotions with players and other spectators through messages and emoticons.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CAN YOU PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE?</strong></h2><br>Certainly!\
      \ When you buy this game, you get 2 products in your Steam Library: <u><strong>Gremlins,\
      \ Inc.</strong></u> \u2013 the edition that is playable online in single-player\
      \ and multiplayer modes, with full support of item drops and Steam Workshop;\
      \ and <u><strong>Gremlins vs Automatons</strong></u> \u2013 the edition that\
      \ is playable offline in single-player mode, without any connection to our server\
      \ whatsoever.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PLAY ONE\
      \ SESSION?</strong></h2><br>The game offers different session settings to make\
      \ them fit your available time, and single-player mode offers automatic <u>SAVE\
      \ / LOAD</u> function at every turn so that you can take a break whenever you\
      \ want (while multiplayer mode offers re-connect functionality as long as the\
      \ session is still in progress). A quick duel for 20 score points with a fast\
      \ timer can finish in under 20 minutes, while a 4-player session for 60 rounds\
      \ can last for 2 hours or more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM\
      \ STRATEGIES?</strong></h2><br>There are different types of cards in the game\
      \ (permanent, regular, secret and criminal) and as each card can be used either\
      \ to move or for action, you will develop both <u>short-term</u> and <u>long-term</u>\
      \ strategies for making the most out of where you are, and what you currently\
      \ have in your hand. Normally, you spend half of your game time accumulating\
      \ resources and building the foundation for the end-game, and the other half\
      \ trying to control the progress of your opponents (stealing, arresting, initiating\
      \ player conflicts, and so on). The more you play, the more new strategies you\
      \ will discover \u2013 especially when combining the effects of several cards\
      \ played in a combination.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/369990/extras/StorePage07.png?t=1606466341\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MAKE DECISIONS, PLAN YOUR MOVES</strong></h2><br><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li>This is an intense <u>strategy game</u>: make decisions\
      \ at every round! Plan your moves, then adjust to the actions of the other players\
      \ and new cards drawn.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The design of the playing\
      \ field and the multiple layers of optional features (that you can turn on or\
      \ off, as you wish) allow for a variety of strategies. The more you play, the\
      \ more roads to victory you discover, using a combination of features based\
      \ on the particular setup of the session.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The\
      \ game offers a <u>diverse resource system</u> that allows for many comeback\
      \ chances even after you're robbed or arrested (or both). With score, money,\
      \ votes, malice, income and bribes, the tension often remains until the very\
      \ last round.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The multilayer mode of the game\
      \ features a system of <u>ratings</u>, <u>ladders</u> and <u>ranked sessions</u>:\
      \ compete in a specific league, and take part in the regularly organised tournaments\
      \ with over 1 000 participants. A system of anonymous masks allows everyone\
      \ to compete on equal terms in a ranked session.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"\
      ><li>Every season since its release in 2016, the game receives <u>FREE content\
      \ and feature updates</u> (balancing changes, new cards, new in-game items,\
      \ new music). We are committed to continue developing this product \u2013\_\
      based on player feedback!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Additionally, the\
      \ game offers over 10 <u>single-player challenges</u> plus the option to create\
      \ <u>custom single-player sessions</u> with different settings and a different\
      \ mix of AI bots.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Finally, there's the <u>team\
      \ mode</u> where victory is determined not only by strategic skill, but also\
      \ by communication and coordination of each team, which is an entirely different\
      \ layer of game mechanics.</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/369990/extras/SteamStore15.png?t=1606466341\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FACTS &amp; FIGURES</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"\
      bb_ul\"><li><u>201 cards in the main deck</u> (171 of them \u2013\_unique):\
      \ permanent, regular, secret and criminal, each with a hand-drawn steampunk\
      \ illustration; with each Season update, we keep adding several new cards to\
      \ the deck.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>40 events in the Misfortune\
      \ deck</u>: these are the special events triggered at certain moments in the\
      \ game, and may affect the current standing of all players to a significant\
      \ degree, especially when used on a specific opponent.</li></ul><ul class=\"\
      bb_ul\"><li><u>6 special Chaos Cards</u>: this is an optional set of cards available\
      \ to every player in the game; turn them on or off to change the dynamics of\
      \ the session.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>12 sets of Character Abilities</u>:\
      \ another optional feature that brings to the game special game mechanics unique\
      \ to each character type; playing with these makes different competing strategies\
      \ even more pronounced.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>11 original locations</u>:\
      \ the Office, the Plant, the Dump, the Marketplace, the Inferno, the Jail, the\
      \ Casino, the Court, the Treasure, the Bank and the Astral Plane; and <u>7 original\
      \ spot types</u>: Risk, Gamble, Police, Income, Bribe, Misfortune and Tribune.</li></ul><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>2 distinctly different playing fields</u>: The Clockwork\
      \ Town and The Clockwork Colony, each offering strategic challenges of their\
      \ own.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Finally, the game took us <strong>three\
      \ years</strong> to develop from concept to full release, and we're still committed\
      \ to continue supporting the community through development of new content. There\
      \ are currently <strong>over 150 000 players</strong> of Gremlins, Inc. on Steam\
      \ from all over the world, including USA, Russia, China, Japan, UK and France.\

      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FINALLY, WHO ARE THE GREMLINS?</strong></h2><br>You\
      \ think that\u2019s just a pocket watch in your hand, a watch that\u2019s a\
      \ bit late because you keep forgetting to wind it up? No, no and no \u2013 you\
      \ couldn\u2019t be further from the truth! What you carry around is a whole\
      \ gremlin town packed into this tiny mechanism: a town with its own bank, its\
      \ own casino\u2026 and even its own jail! Gremlins are the microscopic creatures\
      \ that inhabit any mechanism that they can possibly infiltrate. If a watch or\
      \ a telescope malfunctions, then it\u2019s probably due to gremlins who took\
      \ up a residence there.<br><br>More than anything in life, gremlins value <strong>money</strong>,\
      \ <strong>political power</strong> and <strong>prestige</strong>: prestige that\
      \ one can claim after completing some sort of a grandiose engineering project.\
      \ Aside from working on their own projects, gremlins mostly spend their time\
      \ preventing other gremlins from building something even more grandiose. This\
      \ they achieve through bribing officials and lying to the electorate, as well\
      \ through stealing from their competitors - and outright arresting them.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A DISCLAIMER (JUST IN CASE)</strong></h2><br>We felt\
      \ it important to note that Gremlins, Inc. is not a free-to-play game. Also,\
      \ this is not a CCG or TCG: you do not need to buy boosters or packs; in every\
      \ session the game offers the same deck to every player, and everyone's chances\
      \ are equal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>OUR DLC POLICY</strong></h2><br>We\
      \ released Gremlins, Inc. on Steam in Early Access at the end of 2015. Since\
      \ then, we released over 100 game updates as we continue to add more content\
      \ and more features as well as improve the overall player experience.<br><br>This\
      \ is what we typically add to the game with the regular free updates of the\
      \ game:<br><br>* new features and new mechanics<br>* new cards and new Misfortunes<br>*\
      \ new music tracks and new game themes (for special occasions such as Lunar\
      \ New Year)<br><br>These seasonal updates are available to every owner of the\
      \ game for FREE, regardless of DLC ownership.<br><br>And this is what we release\
      \ as paid DLC:<br><br>* new character portraits and player tokens<br>* new music\
      \ tracks and new game themes<br>* new trails, frames and emoticons<br>* new\
      \ single-player content<br><br>If you enjoy Gremlins, Inc., you can support\
      \ our development efforts by purchasing its DLC. However, there is absolutely\
      \ no pressure to own any of the extra content in order to play the game or compete\
      \ in the tournaments.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>STEAM COMMUNITY MARKET, CRAFTING\
      \ AND ITEM STORE</strong></h2><br>Gremlins, Inc. features <u>in-game items</u>\
      \ and fully supports <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/search?appid=369990\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Steam Community Market</a>. While playing\
      \ the game, certain actions will trigger random chest drops with items of varying\
      \ rarity: it could be a new emoticon, a new profile background, a new music\
      \ track, or one of the dozens of other cosmetic items. These items are FREE,\
      \ yours to use or trade on <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/search?appid=369990\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Steam Community Market</a>. We, the\
      \ developer, do not engage in the direct sales of any drop items; only players\
      \ can trade them.<br><br>The game also supports <u>crafting</u>: once you find\
      \ a blueprint of a specific item, you can create as many such items as you wish,\
      \ as long as you have the required number of charges (you get charges when you\
      \ convert other in-game items that you do not want, or have multiple copies\
      \ of). Finally, the game has its own <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/itemstore/369990/browse/?filter=all\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Steam Item Store</a> where we sell\
      \ a very small number of unique items that influence the item meta-game (but\
      \ they have no effect on the game mechanics).<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/369990/extras/SteamStore21.png?t=1606466341\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>ONLINE &amp; OFFLINE VERSIONS</strong></h2><br>Gremlins,\
      \ Inc. was designed as a digital board game with the multiplayer mode at its\
      \ heart. However, this is not to say that we don't like single-player \u2013\
      \_we do, and there's a separate section with the single-player challenges as\
      \ well as the mode where you can create any custom single-player session that\
      \ you like! One of the products that you receive with this game, <strong><u>Gremlins,\
      \ Inc.</u></strong>, features both single-player and multiplayer modes, and\
      \ requires that your game client is connected to both Steam and the game's server\
      \ at all times \u2013\_in order to support item drops, Steam Community Market\
      \ and Steam Workshop. The other product that is included with the game, <strong><u>Gremlins\
      \ vs Automatons</u></strong>, features single-player mode and is designed specifically\
      \ to be played offline."

      \ new music). We are committed to continue developing this product \u2013\_\
      based on player feedback!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Additionally, the\
      \ game offers over 10 <u>single-player challenges</u> plus the option to create\
      \ <u>custom single-player sessions</u> with different settings and a different\
      \ mix of AI bots.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Finally, there's the <u>team\
      \ mode</u> where victory is determined not only by strategic skill, but also\
      \ by communication and coordination of each team, which is an entirely different\
      \ layer of game mechanics.</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/369990/extras/SteamStore15.png?t=1606466341\"\

      \ permanent, regular, secret and criminal, each with a hand-drawn steampunk\
      \ illustration; with each Season update, we keep adding several new cards to\
      \ the deck.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>40 events in the Misfortune\
      \ deck</u>: these are the special events triggered at certain moments in the\
      \ game, and may affect the current standing of all players to a significant\
      \ degree, especially when used on a specific opponent.</li></ul><ul class=\"\
      bb_ul\"><li><u>6 special Chaos Cards</u>: this is an optional set of cards available\

      \ the session.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>12 sets of Character Abilities</u>:\
      \ another optional feature that brings to the game special game mechanics unique\
      \ to each character type; playing with these makes different competing strategies\
      \ even more pronounced.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>11 original locations</u>:\
      \ the Office, the Plant, the Dump, the Marketplace, the Inferno, the Jail, the\

      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FINALLY, WHO ARE THE GREMLINS?</strong></h2><br>You\
      \ think that\u2019s just a pocket watch in your hand, a watch that\u2019s a\
      \ bit late because you keep forgetting to wind it up? No, no and no \u2013 you\
      \ couldn\u2019t be further from the truth! What you carry around is a whole\
      \ gremlin town packed into this tiny mechanism: a town with its own bank, its\
      \ own casino\u2026 and even its own jail! Gremlins are the microscopic creatures\
      \ that inhabit any mechanism that they can possibly infiltrate. If a watch or\
      \ a telescope malfunctions, then it\u2019s probably due to gremlins who took\
      \ up a residence there.<br><br>More than anything in life, gremlins value <strong>money</strong>,\
      \ <strong>political power</strong> and <strong>prestige</strong>: prestige that\
      \ one can claim after completing some sort of a grandiose engineering project.\
      \ Aside from working on their own projects, gremlins mostly spend their time\
      \ preventing other gremlins from building something even more grandiose. This\
      \ they achieve through bribing officials and lying to the electorate, as well\
      \ through stealing from their competitors - and outright arresting them.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A DISCLAIMER (JUST IN CASE)</strong></h2><br>We felt\
      \ it important to note that Gremlins, Inc. is not a free-to-play game. Also,\
      \ this is not a CCG or TCG: you do not need to buy boosters or packs; in every\
      \ session the game offers the same deck to every player, and everyone's chances\
      \ are equal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>OUR DLC POLICY</strong></h2><br>We\
      \ released Gremlins, Inc. on Steam in Early Access at the end of 2015. Since\
      \ then, we released over 100 game updates as we continue to add more content\
      \ and more features as well as improve the overall player experience.<br><br>This\
      \ is what we typically add to the game with the regular free updates of the\
      \ game:<br><br>* new features and new mechanics<br>* new cards and new Misfortunes<br>*\
      \ new music tracks and new game themes (for special occasions such as Lunar\
      \ New Year)<br><br>These seasonal updates are available to every owner of the\
      \ game for FREE, regardless of DLC ownership.<br><br>And this is what we release\
      \ as paid DLC:<br><br>* new character portraits and player tokens<br>* new music\
      \ tracks and new game themes<br>* new trails, frames and emoticons<br>* new\
      \ single-player content<br><br>If you enjoy Gremlins, Inc., you can support\
      \ our development efforts by purchasing its DLC. However, there is absolutely\
      \ no pressure to own any of the extra content in order to play the game or compete\
      \ in the tournaments.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>STEAM COMMUNITY MARKET, CRAFTING\
      \ AND ITEM STORE</strong></h2><br>Gremlins, Inc. features <u>in-game items</u>\
      \ and fully supports <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/search?appid=369990\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Steam Community Market</a>. While playing\
      \ the game, certain actions will trigger random chest drops with items of varying\
      \ rarity: it could be a new emoticon, a new profile background, a new music\
      \ track, or one of the dozens of other cosmetic items. These items are FREE,\
      \ yours to use or trade on <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/search?appid=369990\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Steam Community Market</a>. We, the\
      \ developer, do not engage in the direct sales of any drop items; only players\
      \ can trade them.<br><br>The game also supports <u>crafting</u>: once you find\
      \ a blueprint of a specific item, you can create as many such items as you wish,\
      \ as long as you have the required number of charges (you get charges when you\
      \ convert other in-game items that you do not want, or have multiple copies\
      \ of). Finally, the game has its own <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/itemstore/369990/browse/?filter=all\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Steam Item Store</a> where we sell\
      \ a very small number of unique items that influence the item meta-game (but\
      \ they have no effect on the game mechanics).<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/369990/extras/SteamStore21.png?t=1606466341\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>ONLINE &amp; OFFLINE VERSIONS</strong></h2><br>Gremlins,\
      \ Inc. was designed as a digital board game with the multiplayer mode at its\
      \ heart. However, this is not to say that we don't like single-player \u2013\
      \_we do, and there's a separate section with the single-player challenges as\
      \ well as the mode where you can create any custom single-player session that\
      \ you like! One of the products that you receive with this game, <strong><u>Gremlins,\
      \ Inc.</u></strong>, features both single-player and multiplayer modes, and\
      \ requires that your game client is connected to both Steam and the game's server\
      \ at all times \u2013\_in order to support item drops, Steam Community Market\
      \ and Steam Workshop. The other product that is included with the game, <strong><u>Gremlins\
      \ vs Automatons</u></strong>, features single-player mode and is designed specifically\
      \ to be played offline."
