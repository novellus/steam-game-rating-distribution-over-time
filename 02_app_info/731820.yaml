      is a cross-platform twin-stick shooter and bullet hellish game. It's designed
      as a pickup game you can play in 5-10 minutes when you just wanna shoot a lot

      a few power-ups along the way (.. ahem... you'll need them). Enemies increase
      in number and difficulty as waves progress. They're worth more points each wave.

    short_description: A cross-platform twin-stick shooter and bullet hellish game.
      It's designed as a pickup game you can play in 5-10 minutes when you just wanna
      shoot a lot of bullets and dodge just as many. Survive as many waves as possible
      and pickup a few power-ups along the way (.. ahem... you'll need them).
