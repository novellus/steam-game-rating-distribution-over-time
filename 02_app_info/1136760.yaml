      \ the struggle to bring back lost memories, set in a future where humans live\
      \ alongside androids.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1136760/extras/0771303f65bdf13fcf22ecb559be0698_original[1].png?t=1598066272\"\
      \ /><br><br><strong>Story</strong><br><br>The story takes place in the near\
      \ future, where scientists and innovators have created near-perfect androids\
      \ to help humans with their daily necessities. At first, they were only produced\
      \ to help people in their homes, but then slowly began to penetrate the industrial\
      \ sector as workers. Soon, they were replacing humans. Many were satisfied,\
      \ but many were not. People began protesting against the use of androids in\
      \ the industrial sector, resulting in a destructive revolt against androids\
      \ by humans.<br><br>This led to severe damage in the industrial market. For\
      \ the first time in widespread human history, human rights won over deeply corrupt\
      \ leaders and governments, as there was nothing those in power could do to suppress\
      \ the protests of the people, who had nothing to lose from the androids having\
      \ taken their livelihood. <br>Today, androids are limited to performing housework\
      \ or helping elderly people, focusing only on serving humans. Even though laws\
      \ were passed prohibiting the use of androids beyond certain situations, there\
      \ remains a black market for people who attempt to use broken androids for activities\
      \ like manufacturing weapons, illegal dealings, and other shady activities.\
      \ Thus, the world still is not truly at peace.<br><br>After Inazuma Kazuya lost\
      \ his mother for unknown reasons, his father,  a renowned scientist, took Kazuya\
      \ to another city. But before Kazuya left, he promised to play with his friend\
      \ Kotobuki Risu for the last time, only to find her killed in a car accident\
      \ right in front of his eyes. Losing both his mother and his friend brought\
      \ Kazuya trauma, which he blamed himself for.<br>Years passed, and Kazuya decided\
      \ to move back to Ringo City and enroll in a private high school, Kiyoku High\
      \ School. He determined that he was going to find peace for himself at last,\
      \ thinking that he couldn\u2019t live with such guilt forever. He lives in a\
      \ mixed dorm with his new friends: Asami Mao, an energetic yet caring girl;\
      \ and a mysterious girl with a penchant for music, Kamome Saaya. <br><br>For\
      \ a time, Kazuya\u2019s life went smoothly. Slowly but surely, he began to come\
      \ to terms with all that had happened in his past and started to make peace\
      \ with himself. But things turn upside down suddenly when Kazuya sees his once\
      \ dead childhood friend. His hand suddenly shivers and his face turns white.\
      \ All the memories about his childhood friend, accompanied by the guilt, sweep\
      \ over him like a torrent in a deep sea. Kazuya then approaches the girl and\
      \ abruptly asks her about everything he can. Much to Kazuya\u2019s surprise,\
      \ the girl doesn\u2019t seem to know him. She only introduces herself as Kotobuki\
      \ Risu. Her voice, her crimson-red eyes, her gesture, and everything else is\
      \ just the same. Kazuya is positive that she is Risu herself. But why doesn\u2019\
      t she remember him? <br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"\
