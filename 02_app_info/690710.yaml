    about_the_game: "This software is a compilation that includes the arcade version\
      \ of Heiankyo Alien which was a big hit in 1980, and two other arranged versions.<br><br>Contents\
      \ of the compilation are as follows.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">1. Arcade version</h2>It\
      \ is a ported version of the original arcade version of Heiankyo Alien.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">2. Heiankyo Alien 3671</h2>This is the first arranged version of Heiankyo\
      \ alien which added a significant change in the gameplay. You have infinite\
      \ lives before time runs out, as this game is 5 minute long score attack (With\
      \ up to 90 seconds time extention depending on the items you dig).<br><br>By\
      \ killing a certain number of aliens earn items that give you advantages. There\
      \ is also a diamond buried somewhere in the field which doubles the score. On\
      \ top of that, recover all buried items for special bonus. <br>In addition to\
      \ explosive score growth and psychedelic graphics, game effects reflect game\
      \ development and give you different sense of exhilaration.<br><br>The arcade\
      \ version was more of a game to &quot;defend&quot;, but this version has more\
      \ emphasis on &quot;attack&quot;.<br>Music is composed by Wing\u2606, who admires\
      \ Yuzo Koshiro as his master, and Ibojima, a Swedish Techno/Trance unit. Gorgeous\
      \ music will produce the sense of exhilaration in game play.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >3. Glitch Encore Alien</h2>In Heiankyo Alien 3671, I implemented a feature\
      \ that existed in TK-80BS version, but not in the arcade due to hardware limitations.\
      \ Later a bug was discovered that will let you score explosively. This bug was\
      \ fixed and 3671 was released, but since this bug has no other negative effect\
      \ other than scoring, I decided to include this bug as part of the specification\
      \ to make it as a separate version.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">4. Idle version</h2>A\
      \ Collaboration version with Guildoll, &quot;2.5 dimension figure idols who\
      \ want to be loved&quot;, a goal is set at each level for you to advance. With\
      \ a theme song, each member of the group has a different scenario and the game\
      \ play is also completely differently arranged from &quot;Heiankyo Alien 3671&quot;.<br><br>In\
      \ the following update, there will be five members at the end. (Every member\
      \ will have a different scenario / mission.) This version is planned to implement\
      \ the full voice acting of each member."

    reviews: "\u201CHeiankyo Alien 3671, with its unique blend of high intensity action\
      \ and devious problem solving, is the most engrossing game you will play all\
      \ year. 2017 has seen a slew of excellent releases, but it's this title that\
      \ will keep you coming back to it again and again. Many a sleepless night will\
      \ be spent chasing high scores. Adjusting to the controls and scoring mechanics\
      \ will take time, but the results are well worth the effort.\u201D<br>9/10 \u2013\

    review: 'Heiankyo Alien is a 1980 arcade game that was a smash hit in Japan but
      may not have made it to US arcades-the premise involves running around and digging
      holes to trap aliens, then filling the holes to eliminate them. It''s a very
      tricky game, especially at first as you are trying to learn the controls and
      how to play.

      This compilation includes that original but also includes a psychedelic-style
      remake that includes a special version containing a high-scoring-enabling bug
      that was originally removed, and an "idol version" that has to be somehow unlocked.

      While the original is hard at first, the alternate version, which is a timed
      game, is a great addition and an ideal place to start. There are several graphics
      tweaks available to make it less or more funky, a couple of different control
      options and more, plus powerups and hidden items to add to the fun. This is
      also where you find an option for fullscreen play so go here first.

      While it seems a little pricey for a 1980 game, the fact that it''s actually
      a compilation adds additional value and makes it more worth it. If you''re a
      retro/arcade game collector this is a must-buy because this was one of the first
      arcade hits in Japan and remains a unique challenge to this day. The more-accessible
      alternate versions still make this worth a try as they are a lot of fun.'
