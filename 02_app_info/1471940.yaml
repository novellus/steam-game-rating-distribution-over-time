    review: "I'm giving Bahamian Rhapsody a thumbs up, because it's not a bad game.\
      \ It is a good game. The problem with Bahamian Rhapsody is it's only a good\
      \ game. \n\nBahamian Rhapsody isn't memorable and doesn't stand out in any way,\
      \ shape, or form. There is some brilliant stuff here, but it's brought down\
      \ by the other parts that are just good, or passable. I quite liked the jokes\
      \ in the beginning and humor throughout. The craziest thing you've ever done\
      \ section near the end was especially entertaining. However, I wish this scene\
      \ happened much earlier in the story, as it's the one that really let's players\
      \ get to know the girls. I do feel that these stories along with Yellow Watergate\
      \ should be scenes that have their own unique art like the ending and love scene\
      \ and should be something the player plays through given their critical importance.\
      \ This would also make them have a far greater impact.\n\nThe romance at the\
      \ end felt like it didn't have a proper build up to it and just sort of happened.\
      \ I think this could have been fixed if the developer didn't yadda, yadda, yadda\
      \ over all the scenes where the girls would be bonding prior to that moment,\
      \ such as going jet skiing and to the music concert. I found it frustrating\
      \ that there was build up to these moments and then when you'd transition to\
      \ them what you got was a scene of the girls talking immediately after the big\
      \ event was over depriving me of that moments significance and impact. It felt\
      \ like showing up for a movie only to have missed it and arrived while everyone\
      \ else is walking out of the show talking about how great it was. These scenes\
      \ need to be in the game with special art like we got for the ending scene and\
      \ love scene and accompanied by dialogue and narrative that further characterizes\
      \ these ladies and brings them and the reader closer together.\n\nMore choices\
      \ would have also helped flesh out the romance and narrative, as well as give\
      \ the player more control. As it stands the paltry few choices I could make\
      \ during the story didn't feel like they had any meaning or impact. I felt more\
      \ like I was playing a kinetic visual novel than a normal visual novel and I\
      \ was just along for the ride. \n\nMore art would have also helped. There are\
      \ like six background images and three different expressions for each character.\
      \ I felt like I was seeing the same thing over and over while playing through\
      \ the game. This monotony led to boredom halfway through.\n\nDespite these criticisms,\
      \ everything that is present in this game is done in a competent manner. Nothing\
      \ is outright bad. There are some scenes and instances that are great. The rest\
      \ is just good. I was happy with the ending I got and it did feel very natural\
      \ to arrive at given how the story went. Bahamian Rhapsody is a good game. It's\
      \ just feels like the developer isn't living up to their full potential, which\
      \ is such a shame in light of the many instances where the developer shows it\
      \ could do and be more."
