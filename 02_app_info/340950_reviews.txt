Your trees must provide cover for mushrooms on the ground, while at the same time avoid blocking sunlight for all the flowers. It's aimed predominantly for children and adults to play together. Problem is that there really isn't much on offer here and you will probably be bored with it within an hour or so. This isn't to say it isn't enjoyable to play, it is, but there isn't really anything challenging here.\n\nThe hand painted art is very stylish and the sounds of children laughing and the gorgeous accompanying music will often inspire a smile. There is a number of animated birds and butterflies which also help you become at peace as they brighten up your tree and make it come to life with all their fluttering’s and noises.\n\n34 levels, but they all follow practically the same principle, after you have done the first couple you can literally jump to the last level and pass it easily. You will then be given a key to open a door and credits roll, the end. This game is like another one I have played and if you enjoy this, then you would definitely enjoy 'Reach for the Sun' also available on Steam but has a bit more to offer in the way of a challenge than it does content. Because of the lack of playability on offer here I would honestly recommend to wait for a sale. Normal price seems way overpriced simply on the basis that there are a LOT of better games on offer that go rather cheap on Steam.\n\nTips for developer...\n* You like to make informative games (your web page says) but there isn't anything informative here other than flowers like sunlight and mushrooms like shade. Maybe add a section where you unlock an information card with each tree you successfully grow as it would encourage the gamers to try each tree.\n* Steam achievements would be a plus even for an easy game like this.\n* It would have been interesting if the tree had to attend to the wildlife as well. Rebuild nests. Feed. Water.\n* Seasonal mechanics would have been an interesting way to teach children as well such as rain, snow, and intense heat, autumn.\n* Trading Cards, would really like some backgrounds for my steam profile of this game as the pictures are so relaxing to look at.\n\nIn final a game all about making a connection, but due to its simplicity you may wish for a summer sale...\n\nBelow is me playing the game first few levels, then showing you the last one...\nhttps://youtu.be/wJJCvwC3WBg\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review feel free to subscribe to my curator page.
