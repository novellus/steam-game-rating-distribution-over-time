    review: I originally got the game because it seemed cute, short and sweet, and
      that's mostly what it was. The overall atmosphere was sort of surreal, had a
      VHS feel to it, but was very slow (in a good way). A main mechanic in the game
      is waiting, which is a pain for an impatient person like me, but I still enjoyed
      all of it--yes even the numerous deaths. Luckily there are check points, so
      if you're bad at platforming games like me, you'll still be able to beat the
      game. Overall just a lovely little experience I was glad to be a part of. :)
