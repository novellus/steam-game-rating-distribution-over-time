Though not only it has new elements and 8 puzzles, it also bring a new mine background theme in. Which is good. And bad, because it doesn't have any music, at all. Quite strange.\n\nAnd hey, at least puzzles were nice this time, they even all had bonus objectives and nice info. And I sure can see potential of user-made labs there too.","timestamp_created":1432396945,"timestamp_updated":1432396945,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516762018203735352","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45trgwM0Cder0PA=="}
