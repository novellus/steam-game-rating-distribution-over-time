      agility. Fight against merciless demons, while dashing and jumping to dodge
      evil traps through carefully designed levels.<h2 class="bb_tag">Infinite ammunition
      always</h2>The focus of <i>Humanless</i> is on the fun of shooting and platforming.
      You don''t need to save the ammo of your favorite weapon: pull the trigger as
      much as you wish and have fun watching low resolution demons being shattered
      to pieces.<h2 class="bb_tag">Fast and responsive movements on the controller
      that suits you best</h2>Enemies shooting with a real intention to kill and pits
      of acid waiting to be jumped through will require of you a lot of dexterity.
      For this reason, <i>Humanless </i>allows you to play both on the joystick or
      using the keyboard and mouse.<h2 class="bb_tag">Carefully designed levels</h2>Each
      level was carefully designed and tested to be unique, fun and challenging yet
      fair. Checkpoints after each section ensure that your progress will never be
      lost.<h2 class="bb_tag">20 Levels distributed in three episodes</h2>Start in
      a <strong>devastated city</strong>, enter questionable <strong>military research
      labs</strong>, and attempt to finish your journey going down to the <strong>hell
      itself</strong>.<h2 class="bb_tag">An elegant action platformer</h2><strong>No</strong>
      walls of text of story. <strong>No</strong> infinite repetitions of the same
      section of a level. In <i>Humanless</i>, each level is unique and brings something
      new, providing an experience that stays fresh throughout the whole game.'
