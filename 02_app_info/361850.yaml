    review: 'Lovely little game this one might see a bug here and there in my case
      only one showed up at the skulls puzzle so I don''t mind I just hit on the skip
      button and moved on.

      Not the best graphics but not bad either with all HO scenes clear so you can
      spot objects.

      Took me roughly 4 hours of pure gameplay to complete and around 7 hours on a
      very relaxed mode which included taking breaks for snacks coffee and other stuff
      :P

      If you get it on an offer go for it.'
