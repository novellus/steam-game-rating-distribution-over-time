For $10 i expected a lot more. Just not sure how this is a finished product.\n\nI had this game wishlisted and was very excited to see more reviews and improvements. But after the news they were removing due to receiving more reviews than activation's ?? So I pulled the trigger even though I was on the fence based off the 2 reviews I could see for the price. \n\n I tried to be patient with it but ultimately its not very nice experience. I often glitched into the world where objects disappear leaving open white space due to what seems going out of boundaries. Then had to reload a save point because I was stuck inside a rock, a tree, the ground ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. Sometimes I could jump frantically toward the path and make it out. \n\nThe controls and dialogue seemed slow in responsiveness. There are a lot of delays both when moving and choosing dialogue that don't seem to make sense for the game. Meaning, doesn't seem like it should be part of the experience. You also have to left click your text option, or the arrow to acknowledge it and progress. So with 4 monitors my mouse cursor  moving outside of the game window was troublesome, and broke any immersion I managed to build up. \n\nGraphically there are parts so dark and blurry that its frustrating at best to try and navigate. Primarily at the start of the game but also night in the woods. \nThe start was a complete nightmare to navigate. First several times I tried it seemed there were no options except wait and then run, hurry!! It was like blackness and blurs with blinding snowflakes. Trying to determine where the smoke was to follow, or even where the trees stopped was impossible. You can't run through the trees and you can get stuck on them so a lot of, 'hey you were caught'...again! Then the falling snowflakes were blinding in addition to the screen blurs that were happening when panning around this dark mess. \nAfter 40 minutes or so of this looping madness I was just standing there and went to esc the game, but hey! yes controls do exist! The delay of dialogue at the start was just THAT slow when you initially start. So by reducing a few of the options I could actually see there was snow and trees not to run into, as well as the smoke you are meant to follow. \n\nI wouldn't mind giving to this/these developers if it were $3 or less. But doesn't make sense to me to pay $10 for this experience although s/he will make some bank taking advantage of removed game collectors to say the least.","timestamp_created":1569515708,"timestamp_updated":1569515708,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.674421131610870361","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5qObt+0CeJr10gE="}
