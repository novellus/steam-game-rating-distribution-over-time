    review: 'Edit: changing recommendation to No. There are a couple missions in this
      DLC, but they are not repeatable. The only DLCs I''d recommend are Maelstrom
      of Carnage and City of Suffering, both of which have a repeatable mission.


      Desperate Crusade has a couple of missions that you can only play once. Completing
      the missions unlocks the unique Tarot card "Martyrdom" Minor Arcana.


      Martyrdom, at card level 1 of 5:

      Reward: "All Reward Bonus: +50%"

      Reward: "Influence Reward Bonus: +50%"

      Hazard: "Randomized restrictions and penalties to dying"'
