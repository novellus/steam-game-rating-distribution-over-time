This is a graphic designer's nightmare.\n\nHowler: yeah, there's a reason why you've never heard of it.\n\nFirst of all, the program has no official manual outside of poorly-recorded and terribly-constructed 'tutorial' videos on its official Youtube channel. The same can be said for trying to understand Dogwaffle from the written 'tutorials' on the official website; they're written like third-party guides by someone who doesn't fully understand the program, yet seemingly they created it. Nothing is ever fully explained, and worse yet, most of the creations and examples look horrible outside of a few cool terrain maps.\n\nSecond of all, this program isn't even remotely similar to Photoshop, and likely isn't even trying to contend. I was a little misled by reviews claiming it was anything like Photoshop, but I'm pretty sure these were just planted by the dev's themselves. Every tool and toy contained here just kind of marches to the beat of its own kazoo; nothing makes actual sense and produces nothing but otherworldly results. It's a true hands-off approach to generating heaps of garbage with a few clicks.\n\nI have plenty of other gripes, too. Brushes don't seem to go past 100 pixels, the undo button will oftentimes reverse 3 steps in one, and most of the unique 'toys' and 'tools' Howler has to offer will instantly crash the program once you attempt to actually use them. Some of the most experimental and 'cool' looking tools don't even get a preview off the ground before crashing Howler, even though some of them look very interesting.\n\nTrying to pull off animation with Howler is a shitshow as well; attempting to create a timeline of more than 199 frames typically fails (or far less, depending on what Howler decides you're doing with it today), and typically spits out the same 1+ GB size file regardless of compression amount and algorithm - pick one, they all do it. What this means is that you can get a fraction of the quality for the same exact file size - whoever made that mistake and never checked to see if it worked probably designed 99% of Howler's other features, too.\n\nThe keyframe feature works decent-enough for basic automation, but the problem is that most of the filters actually have lackluster features (read as: missing entirely) as opposed to how they appear in the actual filter window; so if you thought you were going to get a 'twirl more' or 'random seed' effect in your timeline, nope. Howler decides yet again what you can do with its own features, even though they existed in the general menu. What kind of oversight is this?\n\nI almost didn't want to include the layering issue, but here goes: the layers are a complete and total clusterfuck. Oftentimes attempting to affect one layer puts god-awful effects on top of everything globally and sometimes even trying to undo this process lands you with a black screen when you started off with a white layer (which the program somehow equates with transparent). Even the worst photoshop clone can get this right; why can't Dogwaffle Howler?\n\nHonestly, Howler could be redeemed if it would just stop crashing. I could see it not as an alternative to Photoshop, but a compliment to any traditional graphic design tool for the sake of generating lots of really alien texture maps and terrains. Sadly, it falls short in everything it even tries to do, and just ends up being another moderately-priced piece of garbage to uninstall.","timestamp_created":1558819922,"timestamp_updated":1602706266,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":17,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.687952101230621338","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+ZqvlPUCc9/6wQE="}
