Cute game though.. got it in the sale and not gonna lie it's gotten me through the covid anxiety that has been UK Lockdown 3.0 \nDoesn't take much space, games don't take long and has a cool AI battle mode with sweet wee story infos about your \"opponent\" \n\nDefinitely recommend it. glad I found it tbh.","timestamp_created":1609882644,"timestamp_updated":1609882644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4vWe6vYCeerpwAI="}
