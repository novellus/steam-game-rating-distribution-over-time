    review: 'The music is really good and catchy, it pushes you to stay in movement
      as the game is fast-paced.

      The difficulty, different class builds and the arcade mode add to the replayability.


      Out of the 3 classes, the gameplay of the Demon (calling him the Necromancer
      would maybe fit more) is the most original by not damaging the enemy HP but
      by killing them with fear. Also his power is multiplied when the enemy is weaken
      by the other allied mercenaries, it really adds something fresh to the genre.



      The strength of the game is found in its whole bunch of spells and power-ups
      and the many ways to launch creative and powerful spell combos! The behavior
      of the enemies is meant to be predictable (as described in "the book" in-game).
      A spell on its own won''t do much but by playing with the allies, the enemy
      HP, fear meter, and positioning I was able to wipe out the entire screen. And
      it''s satisfying.'
