    review: 'I was sceptical when I first set eyes on Way Down but after watching
      the trailer it looked like a lot of fun and it is.

      The graphics are not great but the gameplay is and the attention to detail is
      awesome.

      Bullet cases fly out of your gun, empty magazines are left strewn all over the
      floor as you reload, lights smash, barrels explode and your enemies are cut
      to ribbons are you battle your way to the next level.


      On the way you can choose to recruit or rescue any captives you find. Recruiting
      them brings them into your squad and they follow you throuigh the game fighting
      the enemy with you.

      They also each have a special skill.


      The levels themselves are procedurally generated and although not very varied
      are fairly challenging.

      Each level has a boss towards the end, the ones I''ve faced so far haven''t
      been that tough.


      Once you die, you return to your base where you can upgrade skills, recruits
      and craft weapons with the money you''ve found playing the game.


      The game does have a couple of bugs, If you leave the home level with a UI window
      open it stays open on the main game and you can''t shoot until you close it.

      I also managed to crash the game by accidently entering the first dungeon with
      the bank UI open but I''m, sure the developer will look into these minor bugs.


      All in all, a fun game only really brought down by the graphics. 8/10. well
      worth the price.'
