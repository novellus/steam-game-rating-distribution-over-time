The combat was smooth like butter, responsive, and only got better once you got the hang of it. It's simply outrageous that the horrid \"Cyberpunk 2077\" game is even trying to profit off of this game's popularity.","timestamp_created":1604540267,"timestamp_updated":1604684922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":9,"weighted_vote_score":"0.616987347602844238","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyZerz/UCeuWurAI="}
