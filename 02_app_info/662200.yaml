      [b]swim out[/b] is what you get if you equip a female agent 47 from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/dohi64/recommended/427820]hitman
      go[/url] with a beach ball and throw her into a pool. same gameplay, but instead
      of avoiding guards and dogs and the occasional assassination, you''re dodging
      obnoxious swimmers and doing other fun(?) summer stuff I assume people do, but
      the main goal is to get out of the pool, you fool!


      the swimming areas are essentially grids to traverse turn by turn with the arrow
      keys (wasd doesn''t work) or by holding and moving the mouse to advance a tile.
      once you move, everybody else moves and you gotta make sure not to collide with
      anyone. there are [b]12 types of human ''enemies''[/b], some just in the way,
      others go back and forth every turn or every other turn, throw boomerangs or
      fishing lines into the water, and so on. even kayakers make an appearance, how''s
      that allowed? (though you get to use one as well, so fair enough.) most pool
      occupants get along fine, others obliterate whoever they bump into, not just
      the player. further obstacles include gusts of icy wind (or something) every
      few turns, freezing whoever''s in the way for a bit, and representatives of
      wildlife, such as jellyfish or crabs crabbing around.


      [b]various items can be used to your advantage[/b], or disadvantage, as the
      case may be with ''attachments'' that make you take up multiple tiles as soon
      as they''re picked up. took a while to get used to moving with them. some other
      things are activated or have to be used immediately as well (e.g. the lifebelt),
      while others can be picked up and used whenever with space or by clicking them.
      it''s worth noting that items block most enemy movement, so choosing the right
      time to grab them can be the key to success, and don''t be afraid to touch the
      fishermen''s bait (not a euphemism).


      [b]inventory space is limited[/b] and attempting to grab an extra item will
      make it disappear, but [b]using an object doesn''t count as a turn[/b]. throwable
      items need a target within range, and hurling stuff around is not only necessary
      but also fun. who wouldn''t want to stun people by throwing a beach ball at
      them? not something to try in real life, they might drown if they lose consciousness,
      but it''s fine here. other items let you skip a turn or move two tiles at once,
      as long as it doesn''t involve turning a corner, and so on.


      [b]100 levels[/b] in 7 chapters, often spanning multiple screens, and [b]all
      of them are unlocked from the start[/b]. as much as being able to jump around
      within a chapter is always a plus instead of getting stuck on that one level,
      it''s obviously wiser to go more or less in order and not swim too far ahead.
      [b]multi-part levels have to be done in one go[/b], which is a problem in my
      opinion, mostly because the way it''s handled here. moving from one pool to
      another acts as a checkpoint, so [b]failing a screen only resets to the beginning
      of that section[/b], but pressing ''r'' to restart puts you back to the very
      beginning, same as quitting a level. reset happens immediately after a mistake
      and [b]there''s no undo either, making things unnecessarily frustrating[/b],
      especially on busier levels with a lot going on. re-doing a dozen or so moves
      there involves a lot of waiting around.


      besides [b]the titular goal of swimming out[/b] (taking as long as you want,
      both in terms of time and turns), there are often [b]other things to thrive
      for[/b], like getting all the stars from hard-to-reach places, completing the
      level within a certain number of turns, not getting caught by elemental forces,
      avoiding item use, etc. in case of an optional turn limit a move counter will
      appear in the corner. [b]goals don''t all have to be fulfilled during a single
      attempt[/b], but stars and items are consumed by some of the other swimmers
      if they get to them before you.


      the number of objectives are denoted by dots on the level selection screen,
      one representing the main goal, others the optional tasks, but unfortunately
      their nature is only revealed while playing a level, and not even automatically
      at the beginning, gotta click the dots in the lower right corner or press ''o''
      (esc doesn''t close this window, only another click or pressing ''o'' again).
      [b]not only does the level select screen lack crucial information, but none
      of the goal stuff or hotkeys (besides space) are mentioned anywhere in the game.[/b]
      and while space works for level selection, enter doesn''t.


      on the upside, [b]the presentation is simply fantastic[/b]. clean, great-looking
      50s-style graphics (might be the 60s, what do I know?) with very brief but nicely
      done cutscenes between levels, some soft background music and a variety of sound
      effects for ambience. windowed mode only with a fix-sized window, sound on/off
      and music on/off, no volume settings, so there''s room for improvement here
      as well.


      the puzzles are solid and get really tough down the road if you go for the bonus
      goals, providing many hours of challenging gameplay. [b]it''s an excellent game
      at a good price, but not without issues[/b], so it''s not as strong a recommendation
      as it could be. still, it''s worth taking a dip, the water''s lovely, and [b]there''s
      a demo[/b] to try if you need further convincing.'
