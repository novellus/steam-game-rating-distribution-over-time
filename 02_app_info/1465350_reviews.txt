This is not true city builder game. So when purchasing this game expect it to be very casual. For what you get out of this it pretty good. It runs very smoothly and I like watching the building upgrade. It is worth a try if you like city building games. My only complaint is the price of the game. I find it a tad too high for what you get out of it. \n\nReview at:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWILmr5h5do","timestamp_created":1605012970,"timestamp_updated":1605012970,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwocuO2fUCfvzErQI="}
