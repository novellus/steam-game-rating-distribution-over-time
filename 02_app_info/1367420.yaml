    about_the_game: '<h2 class="bb_tag">One Line Coloring is a vibrant puzzle game
      about creating lively shapes that compose and fold into beautiful, themed dioramas.

      /><br><br>Inspired by classic, pen-and-paper game of connecting dots, One Line
      Coloring gives players an impression of actually drawing the full object, line
      by line. Some objects are easily recognizable as our everyday items, others
      need to be completed to reveal their true form. <br><br>Each level offers a
      lined shape of an object, that players need to fill with colors by connecting
      different sections of the shape. Every model is handcrafted to showcase an abstract
      set of dots, that eventually come to life as impressive, colorful models. Each
      model is part of a bigger picture - a rich, detailed diorama that represents
      a continuous scene. The ultimate goal is to uncover all colorful shapes and
      complete every diorama.<br><br>Once solved, the object is beautifully animated
      and saved as a part of themed dioramas. One Line Coloring offers a diverse set
      of dioramas, such as an island, coral reef, forest or space. Every set has its
      own distinctive collection of picked models, based around everyday items, gadgets,
      fauna &amp; flora, architecture etc.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1367420/extras/steam_banner_02.png?t=1607085971"
