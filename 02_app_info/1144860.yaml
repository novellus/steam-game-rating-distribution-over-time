    review: 'Alright, so this is just one more of those casual games where you can
      get to play without having to worry about situations that could be considered
      borderline stressful.


      That said, there''s not really a story to follow, as you just control this guy
      flowing over his sword as if he was Silver Surfer, and your goal is to collect
      as many stones as you can in order to reach the highest score; and that''s pretty
      much it.


      The graphics aren''t bad, the sound effects and music are ok, I suppose. The
      gameplay can be a bit confusing at the start, but I''m sure that it won''t take
      long for you to figure out how to maneuver the guy around the screen.

      As mentioned previously, your goal is to collect stones; there''re the white
      ones and the red ones, which offer more points, but are more rare and are usually
      located in dangerous places.


      Furthermore, if you''re looking for an excuse to actually try getting a good
      score, there''re at least 6 different achievements to get, and guess what: I''ve
      got them all in less than 10 minutes of gameplay. So, if you''re a completionist
      kind of gamer, this could be an interesting choice to add to your library.

      Anyhow, not everything is perfect, since there''s also a 10 minutes time-limit
      for each run that you take and that could be a bit annoying while you''re chasing
      after these, but it''s not really much of a big deal, in the end.


      Overall, the price is often affordable, the game is kinda fun and you can get
      easy achievements, so why not give it try?'
