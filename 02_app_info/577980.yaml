    short_description: Bob is an angel ordered by God himself to go and clean up the
      putrid world of the future. He has been given the power of possession so that
      he can sneak up on any person, animal or genetically engineered being and leap
      right into their souls! The rules are up to you - enjoy the freedom.

    review: Could not beat the final boss because the game kept crashing, but aside
      from that this is an OK game. It has a very original concept for its time, and
      boy is it violent in so many ways possible, I would recommend it only if they
      fix it, so other players don't have to make manual adjustments like downloading
      a patched executable in order to play the game.
