The new artwork with the vampires and the towering Frankenstein is cool.  I'm glad the great voice work is back paired with the awesome colored DMD.   The ambient sounds are spooky and add to the table theme.  I hope that the rest of the tables are given this great Deluxe treatment.  Must buy! 5/5!","timestamp_created":1583010276,"timestamp_updated":1583010276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.627188324928283691","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqvywyfACf/2t9QE="}
