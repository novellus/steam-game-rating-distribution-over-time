Still, if you have any problems after that point, or in the arena-only mode, it gives you an option to instantly win them.\n\nAlso, for some reason this comes with two ero-pictures of characters who I'm pretty sure aren't even in this game. They're pretty DeviantArt-tier, so I wouldn't recommend considering them, just considering if you want a bonus character and two auto-win buttons. If so, recommended. If not, you're not really missing much.","timestamp_created":1600810518,"timestamp_updated":1600810807,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550297737121582031","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47c3w2/QCcqG4owI="}
