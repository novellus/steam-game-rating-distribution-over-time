      \n[b]This is a very satisfying and solid boss rush, but it isn't without a few\
      \ missteps here and there.[/b]\n\nThe best part is obviously the bosses, and\
      \ how they feel - the developers of ITTA did a great job with a lot of them\
      \ and how they jump, how they look, etc. I'm not sure how to describe it with\
      \ how they jump up close to the screen like an artistic fourth-wall-breaking,\
      \ but it's very very cool and like nothing I've seen before. I never felt like\
      \ a boss was impossible once I got comfortable with the controls, but I also\
      \ never felt like it was too easy or repetitive. The story is good, the visuals\
      \ are good, but where this game really shines is it's gameplay.\n\n[b]The music\
      \ and sound effects are what threw me off the most though.[/b] Whenever you'd\
      \ die to a boss, it almost felt like the music didn't realize you were dead\
      \ yet and kept going, and then would come to an abrupt stop when you came back\
      \ to life. Sound effects also sounded very glitchy sometimes, especially when\
      \ bosses started spinning and hit a wall, stuff like that made a grinding noise\
      \ that didn't go away for a while. \n\nOverall, of course I recommend this.\
      \ It's not a perfect game, but it doesn't have to be one. I waited somewhere\
      \ around a year for this game's release and I was not disappointed. That's all\
      \ I needed."
