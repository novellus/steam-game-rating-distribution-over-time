It was moderately fun to the point that i'm not bored to tears and had a bit of fun with in-game explanations. Earn money by winning rounds, buy upgrades, rinse, repeat. Half of the achievements unlocked weren't awarded properly, i.e. at all. \n\nI was doing well until a bug occurred and my balloon is now as sluggish as a... well, slug. Feels like the balloon upgrades were removed at once. Can't win any rounds, therefore can't finish the game. Happened before and i solved that by upgrading the balloon thread again; but now i'm at max level, so, cannot upgrade. Seems like i'm stuck with this and have to give up the game rather close to the end. \n\nMy piece of advice would probably be that if you buy the game, make sure you've finished it in one sitting. Opening/shutting down the game seems to fiddle with its delicate balance, though it slowly gains you some coins.","timestamp_created":1575062237,"timestamp_updated":1575062237,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49M3B3O4CdbzV3wE="}
