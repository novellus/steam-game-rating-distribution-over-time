    review: I was hoping the soundtrack would tack on proper endings to the tracks
      because otherwise I would have just exported the audio files from the game,
      I was most hopeful for the boss 1 theme which doesn't end properly in the game
      file version. however the edited version just restarts the the loop with a fadeout
      to silent. This also applies to other songs although not as jarringly. Also
      I don't know what they did with the mixing for the soundtrack it seems worse
      than the files played directly out of the game directory. They have more depth
      but they sound a little off as in a little softer than the game files. I'd just
      recommend just format shifting the music from within the game files with audacity
      or the audio editor of your choice. these criticisms mostly surround boss theme
      1 although it was the one I was most excited about having a high fidelity version,
      although some some songs are improved with the extra fidelity. I guess that
      comes down to personal taste but I would only suggest purchasing this soundtrack
      on the merits of supporting the devs and given this was my favorite game of
      the year I am in not salty about spending 5 extra bucks on what was a great
      value of a game.
