I started out playing guitar, and my interest in traditional Turkish music eventually got me into playing fretless guitar. In those days, I did a lot of live stage performances, playing with a bunch of different bands and artists. After a certain point, though, I realized I was more excited by the prospect of composing music. For years now I’ve been writing scores to various films, TV shows, and plays.

In practice, it feels a lot like film scoring: you have to incorporate the dynamism, rhythm, and spontaneity of a visual medium. It’s not so much about evoking images as it is about reflecting or counterpointing them. Overfall was especially fun to do because <strong>its world required a diverse approach<\/strong>, with music reflecting individual races and locations. It’s hard to describe how fun it is to compose for something like that.<br><br>In a sense, it’s a less personal experience than making music for the stage, because in the theater you’re connecting with a person who’s directly in front of you. There’s a sort of shared energy that you don’t get when the music isn’t being performed live. But there’s a different kind of excitement to composing for someone you don’t know or don’t see. You have to imagine their reaction as you compose, and I find that to be a more engaging challenge.<br><br><strong>How did you get involved with Overfall? What attracted you to the project?<\/strong><br><br>Well, I was a gamer before I became a musician. It’s a part of my life I would never consider giving up. What struck me about Overfall was the art style, especially the painted backgrounds - the textures, the color palettes, and the general feel. The game’s settings usually take place in natural environments like caves, hills, and shorelines, and I tried to reflect that in my choice of acoustic instruments.<br><br><strong>What will the music in Overfall be like?<\/strong><br><br>Overfall has a lot of different scenes and narrative beats. Sometimes it’s a pulse-pounding action scene, sometimes it’s more of a gradual journey. I worked to reflect that in the music I wrote. Something you’ll also notice is that <strong>every type of island has its own melody and instrumentation.<\/strong> I simply loved the idea of that. But my favorite bit of work has to be the main theme. I’m curious to see what people think of it. Again, I made use of acoustic instruments, and I tried to get across the atmosphere of the world of Dys, where the game is set. If I had to describe it in three words, they would be melancholy, mystery, and excitement.","about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">An Interview with Ali Saran, Composer for Overfall<\/h2><br><strong>Tell us about your background in music.<\/strong><br><br>I’ve loved music since I was a kid.
