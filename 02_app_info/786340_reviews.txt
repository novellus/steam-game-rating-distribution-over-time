A wonderful stress free game of imaginative puzzles. Kudos to the developer. A constant stream of relaxing music makes game play enjoyable even with the volume up a few decibels. Some of the  puzzles are relatively simple while others require some extreme planning. Teddy bear collection has been a challenge in few rooms so far. Definitely a must for a gamer who wants puzzles and not a story line. \n","timestamp_created":1584815221,"timestamp_updated":1584815221,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kKWW//ACfqDr+QE="}
