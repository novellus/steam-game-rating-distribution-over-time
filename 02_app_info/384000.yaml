    about_the_game: <strong>Cross of the Dutchman</strong> is an action adventure
      game based on the true story of the folk legend 'Pier Gerlofs Donia'. <br><br>The
      story takes place in <strong>medieval Western Europe</strong>, in the province
      of Frisia, near the turn of the 16th century. Though Pier and his family lived
      in peace, the world around them was changing for the worse. Saxon legions were
      invading nearby villages, making the lives of the native people next to impossible.
      On one fateful day, Pier got involved with the Saxon oppressors, escalating
      the situation for the worse. The events portrayed in this great adventure caused
      Pier to gather a band of farmers and form a front against the oppressors. The
      acts that followed made Pier into the legend he is known for, the <strong>Cross
      of the Dutchman</strong>.
