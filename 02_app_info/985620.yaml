      class="bb_tag">Explore a Strange Alien World</h2><br>Playing as Captain McCallery,
      you will travel through white cliffs and purple swamps, and delve into mysterious
      ancient ruins.  Pay attention to your surroundings, as danger lurks behind every
      corner. This world is full of hidden paths and secrets to reward exploration.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Consume Alien Plants</h2><br>The Captain needs to eat to survive!  Be
      on the lookout for plants which you can consume to regain your energy.  Food
      items can have a variety of other effects, ranging from restoring health and
      increasing your dash length, to hallucinations.  Explore your environment to
      find rare and beneficial items!<h2 class="bb_tag">Battle Alien Monsters</h2><br>The
      game features fast-paced lock-on combat.  Dash around your foes, dodging their
      attacks.  Use your trusty laser gun to blast away at your enemies, or conserve
      your ammo by punching and throwing rocks.  You'll be up against a variety of
      alien beings, including multiple boss fights.<h2 class="bb_tag">Survival Mode</h2><br>For
      those who want an extra challenge, there's Survival Mode.  Survival Mode removes
      checkpoints from the game, and also removes enemy and item respawning.  This
      mode requires caution and careful item-use in order to make it through.
