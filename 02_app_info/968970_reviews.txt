Economy sucks .\nİ realized steam library asked to review and from there i did a mistake i thought it released. game still in early access . anyway still playing and had 2-3 total crash . game economy sucks its really hard to make money . to pay your depth and buy new toys for your self .... played like 45 hours and have 30k . and have to pay 250k just to complete a quest. after that quest i can buy planting equipment. \nİ still recomend the game its really fun to play with good environment very cool side quests can be add. holding RMB is a pain ( Special View ) . developers must do some on - off for that.","timestamp_created":1609584672,"timestamp_updated":1609829039,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4ubfS6PYCc47YvwI="}
