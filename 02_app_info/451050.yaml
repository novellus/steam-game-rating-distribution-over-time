    review: "L'hiver \xE9tait une p\xE9riode cataclysmique qui faisait tourner les\
      \ civilisations au ralenti. Avec cette extension, le joueur a non seulement\
      \ des moyens d'en diminuer l'impact, mais \xE9galement une nouvelle ressource\
      \ hivernale donnant acc\xE8s \xE0 des b\xE2timents et \xE9quipements puissants\
      \ et vari\xE9s, multipliant ainsi les possibilit\xE9s.\n\nComme toujours, la\
      \ nouvelle civilisation exploite mieux que n'importe quelle autre ces nouvelles\
      \ m\xE9caniques et s'av\xE8re pour \xEAtre en phase avec Auriga.\n\nSi vous\
      \ ne devez prendre qu'une seule extension de Endless Legend, c'est celle-ci."
