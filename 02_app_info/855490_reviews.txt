Two are simply re-skins of the other two. As you move up from one car to the next there is an increase in performance over the previous ones. However, this will depend on you using your winnings to purchase upgrades. Your damage is reflected in a health bar, but doesn't alter the way your car looks.\n\nUPGRADES\nThere are three upgrade paths. Speed, Controls, and Armor. My first impression was that this game controls poorly, but you will see an improvement as you upgrade Controls. \n\nCOURSES\nQuite disappointing. There are only 3 and the designs are rather bland. Only the first track is available at first. You unlock subsequent tracks by using your funds from your winnings.\n\nCONTROLS\nThis is the most  frustrating aspect of this game for me, as there is no controller support. You must use a keyboard. Left and Right arrow keys for steering, up arrow is for acceleration, and the down arrow is reverse. \n\nWEAPONS\nYou can fit weapons such as guided missiles to your car (Q key to fire), or you can rely on your side-mounted guns. They fire automatically once you are in range of an enemy.\n\nA.I.\nActually quite good. The enemy cars don't just focus all of their attention on you, but the other racers as well. When you start a race you never know how many laps there will be. Could be 1, 2, or 3.\n\nGRAPHICS\nPerhaps acceptable for the Saturn, but not the Dreamcast (not actually released for either console). When you launch the game you can select windowed or full screen, and choose the resolution of your choice.\n\nMUSIC\nAcceptable I guess, but no variety.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS\n24. I've earned 21. Earning them all within an hour would be doable for a better player. Actually, I could do it in that time as well if this game had controller support.\n\nCONCLUSION\nMarginal recommendation. It depends on how much the game is going for at the time of purchase and how good you are at driving with a keyboard, and if the number of cars (4) and tracks (3) is enough to satisfy you.","timestamp_created":1602142179,"timestamp_updated":1602214336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.613347351551055908","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4NLahfUCdN/HpgI="}
