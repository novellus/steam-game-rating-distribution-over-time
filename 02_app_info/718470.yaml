    review: "[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers [/h1]\n\n\
      I am surprised that I'm the first person to review this game, especially since\
      \ it's been out since December 2017. This is a hidden gem. If you want to support\
      \ devs for making interesting / unique VR games, this one is a fine one to do\
      \ it. I paid $2.39 for this game during the Steam Summer Sale 2018 and think\
      \ it's a good deal even at normal price.\n\nI haven't experienced a game quite\
      \ like this one in VR. It's a simple concept but it's well executed and it's\
      \ quite the challenge, especially after the first few levels. In fact, I'm stuck\
      \ on the 12th/13th puzzle. Basically, this is reverse Jenga. You are building\
      \ rock structures up to the designated height areas which turn into green circles\
      \ once you've reached them. Get all the circles green to advance to the next\
      \ level. You get more stars for finishing quickly [spoiler] TWSS [/spoiler].\
      \ \n\nHowever, certain circles have X marked on them. You cannot let a rock\
      \ touch those areas. The limited amount of rocks come in all shapes and colors.\
      \ It's quite the challenge to solve some of these puzzles. This is not mindless\
      \ stacking of rocks (after the first few levels). These are actual puzzles to\
      \ solve. \n\nThere is only 1 environment, but it's a very beautiful environment\
      \ that makes the puzzle area nice and serene. There's also music on a loop.\
      \ I did like the music, but I can see it becoming annoying if you have to listen\
      \ to it for an extended period of time. \n\nThe game has 30 levels with 3 stars\
      \ possible for each level (although I have no idea how to get 3 stars on the\
      \ 1st level). You automatically have 4 photos taken when you solve a puzzle.\
      \ You have to select one to proceed to the next level. Warning though: you do\
      \ need full roomscale for this game as you'll often be picking up rocks from\
      \ the ground. You may even want to kneel down on the ground. Rocks are pretty\
      \ spread out as well. The game says it has leaderboards, but I only saw my scores\
      \ (I'm not sure if that means I'm the one and only player!)\n\nRate 7/10."
