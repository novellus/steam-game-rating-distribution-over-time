You can even choose between two graphic options, the new and old (pretty much the original)! You can even customize the game itself with the starting lives, at what score you get extra lives, adjust the display, etc, etc. The game also contains the original soundtrack that can bring nostalgia to many people.","timestamp_created":1610159649,"timestamp_updated":1610159649,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4js6/8vYCeY7ZwQI="}
