If you're interested but unsure, definitely go for it on sale. The $20 CAD I paid was a good deal imo. (I'd personally value this game at around $40, maybe $50)\n\nTHINGS TO NOTE: The game is slow. It's close to Harvest Moon in pacing out chores. A lot of the reviewers that are complaining about the 'grind' on here are people that I suspect didn't bother learning the game patterns and chore allocating. You can't explore the entire island AND help your cafe, especially early game, so make sure you're planning out your days and where you want to go. Check on the cafe during busy times (12:00 and 7:00pm respectively), then run out and do your gathering. You can teleport right back to the cafe if the staff need help. And if you need hints on how to speed the story along, just check the 'story' tab and it tells you what you need to do to progress.\n\nIssues I wish I could fix: character controls are wack. I adapted pretty quickly, but it can still be annoying when you're trying turn a certain way and end up falling off a rock lol. Only being able to gather things 1 at a time makes the game feel sluggish. Cafe wise, It's hard to tell when a customer is about to leave during a rush, I still haven't figured that one out. And NPCs will occasionally push me out of the way when I'm trying to serve dishes. You gotta get outta their way, cuz they ain't altering their path for you lol.\n\nThere's valid gripes with this game, and I share quite a few of them, but I'm still pretty obsessed and having a great time, so I'd say the issues are forgivable. If you like fantasy settings, pet raising, and farm/exploration elements, consider trying this game. The characters are all pretty lovable (and with surprisingly poignant storylines??). It's rewarding to watch your little dragon grow, too. At the time of writing this I just reached the young adult dragon stage and being able to ride around and travel the world freely is so great. The NPC designs are real cute and the writing is really good! I want more games like this!","timestamp_created":1609990144,"timestamp_updated":1609990144,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgIC57fYCf/CWwQI="}
