      \ Medic class has received a massive update in this patch. We heard the community\u2019\
      s feedback loud and clear, and have made the syringe a standalone gadget.<br><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Medics now equip the syringe as a standalone gadget to\

      \ their way to objectives by reviving dead teammates and leveraging the spawn\

      \ the Gunner class.<br></li><li>The standalone M203 gadget cannot be equipped\
      \ if a player\u2018s primary weapon has an integrated grenade launcher.<br></li><li>The\
      \ M4/203 and F90(G) were removed from the Gunner class.<br></li><li>The Gunner\
      \ class only carries 1 RPG.<br></li><li>The Gunner class now has 3 frag grenades\
      \ (down from 6) and 2 flashbangs (down from 5).<br></li><li>We will be keeping\
      \ a close eye on 40mm grenade utilization now that it is exclusive to the Assault\

        \ they tend to be large. Blood does not splatter onto walls. \r\n\r\nMild\
