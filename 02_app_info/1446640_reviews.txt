There was a bug right at release that prevented non-Vive controllers from working correctly, though that should be fixed now, so I'm not quite sure what would be causing this problem for you. \n\nIf you have the time, I'd appreciate if you could make a post in the discussion board with your setup details and I'll see if we can get to the bottom of the problems you're having.\n\nCheers,\nJordan"}],"cursor":"AoJ4uaSp3/UCdP6BrgI="}
