I was sceptical about it, especially about the claim to be a \"Mount and Blade in space\". But it actually is pretty much like old Mount&Blade... only in space. In spots it even looks unexpetedly great (some planets, very atmospheric!), though mostly the graphics are simple. The space combat is intense, feels really good. Various ships offer different experience. They also benefit from installable modules and upgrades. The characters's levelling up boosts up ships' performance in combat. Nice! The status of the game with me is \"very good\" close to \"great\". There are some minor bugs, but c'mon, the game was developed by just ONE guy! For a single person this is absolutely a great job, an awesome feat. Lots of thought, labour and soul poured into this project - and it shows every minute of the game, if only you take an effort to notice.","timestamp_created":1610146132,"timestamp_updated":1610146132,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgoaM8vYCcZfUwQI="}
