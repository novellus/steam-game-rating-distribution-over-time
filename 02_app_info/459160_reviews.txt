I quit since about a year though. Loved the more mature content, the Soviet Russian atmosphere (Empire) and the character models with animations that were all properly done in motion capture. I quit playing over a couple reasons, that can probably be applied to most MMOs:\n- Time consuming\n- Low population and toxic end-game community (much worse on EU server)\n- Must join guild or miss content\n- High monetary cost to stay competitive (especially in PvP)\n- Daily quests that compel one to keep playing\n- EU/EN version is several months behind the RU updates\n\nIn conclusion, this is a nice polished free game to pass some time, so long one doesn't push to become competitive. Overall it looks like World of Warcraft (mostly the UI), but skill system, art design, story and atmosphere couldn't be more different. Recommended for casuals that don't mind dated cartoony graphics, and adult content.","timestamp_created":1486925845,"timestamp_updated":1526546776,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482879191637039185","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/OfRtuMCcfv9cQ=="}
