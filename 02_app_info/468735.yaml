    review: 'Very enjoyable game.


      The rules are a lot easier than they seem at first, with a lot of optional rules
      you can add later once you''ve learnt how to play. The rules are quite simple
      actually and easy to learn, with a lot of strategy and some randomness mixed
      in. Players who are good with probability will be able to plan around the randomess
      of the game, which I find adds extra depth to the strategy.


      All in all, a great and easy to learn game to play with some friends.'
