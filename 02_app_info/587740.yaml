      /><br><br>The year is 1781. The British have taken control of Savannah and Charles
      Town, scattering the American Continental in the area army. The rest of the
      American forces chase the Native Americans out of the Tennessee area (western
      NC). A large force of British regulars and Hessian units, commanded by Cornwallis
      sweep through Virginia waiting on commands to take York (Yorktown). Marquis
      de Lafayette and his French soldiers are aiding the Americans gather force in
      Virginia to try to pin down the British and wait for the French fleets to arrive
      to contest the seas.
