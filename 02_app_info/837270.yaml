    about_the_game: Do you have what it takes to beat the Tharn? Players will take
      on the role of Dan, a loving and law abiding citizen. After some disturbances
      in his neighborhood, Dan went to his local community's T.H.A.R.N. Facility (Tactical
      Human Assisted Research Network) to file a complaint. After being in a waiting
      room for hours, Dan decides to try to leave, but must face the labyrinth of
      the T.H.A.R.N. to do so. Players must try their best to solve puzzles, crack
      combinations, unlock doors, smash things, and even hack a computer system all
      in an attempt to escape the facility.

    developer_response: Hi Staves, I'm sorry if you didn't enjoy the game. I make
      games as a hobby, balancing time between that, a job, and having a life is hard.
      If you really did not like the experience, go ahead and refund it. While you
      are at it, how about you take the time to learn to make your own video game
      that meets all of your personal standards and expectations...

    review: 'Charging money for this game is a fucking crime. The whole game takes
      about 15 minutes to play through. There is no story, there are no puzzles. The
      game blatantly copied the basic gimmick of the Stanley Parable but with absolutely
      no effort put in from anyone involved or any of the things that made that game
      interesting. There is nothing good about this game. I am very dissapointed in
      Valve for allowing the creators of this game to charge for it and will be refunding
      the game.


      In response to developer feedback:

      @Mwester I understand you aren''t some AAA game studio. I think this game has
      some promise, you should definitely continue working on games, but as you said.
      This is a hobby. Its great that you are following something you enjoy, but I
      personally would advise you not to charge for your games at this point. Having
      your content available to all would allow you to get more of an audience, and
      also, to be frank, this game is not worth money. I am sorry for my harsh review,
      but as long as you are charging money for your games I think people should know
      what they are buying, because I feel it is not apparant from your store page
      exactly what this game is.'
