As a Game Dev Tycoon fan who recently got a VR headset, I was excited until I finished the game in less than half an hour. There really isn't much to do after those 20 or so minutes of playing the game other than play the drums (the game's best feature, by far). I understand this is one of the dev's first projects but when it's been over a year since it released and it only has this much content... I really can't recommend this.","timestamp_created":1606493407,"timestamp_updated":1606493407,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48YCehfYCf4XZswI="}
