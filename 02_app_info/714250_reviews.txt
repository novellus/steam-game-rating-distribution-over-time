I have a controller but do not like to use it for MMO/RPG style games, but this game forces you to. \n\nControlling the character with WASD, Mouse, and keyboard is simply not allowed. You MUST use your controller, then you must know what buttons like RB, and others that aren't the normal 4 mean. (Sorry, I don't. I'm not a Nintendo gamer. I'm used to playing WASD, keys, and mouse for RPGs and MMOs and such like Skyrim, World of Warcraft, etc.. I typically only use controllers for shoot 'em up/arcader games). \n\nI would change this review if this game had the option to change movement to keyboard in the game options but it doesn't. No options to use anything but a controller at all, and very user unfriendly. \n\nIF you know what all the button signals it gives for the controller mean you should have no problems with this game.","timestamp_created":1609575313,"timestamp_updated":1609575431,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480769246816635132","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tf+K4fYCf5bUvwI="}
