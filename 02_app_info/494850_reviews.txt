I have W7 x64 Ultimate. i5 4670K OC @ 4.4ghz. GTX 1070 FTW. 16GB RAM. 500GB Samsung SSD. No problems with any VR games with my VIVE.\n\nWhen you try to play against AI, the game bugs out. Framerate drops. Nonstop stuttering. Flashes of white across the screen. And the blank SteamVR background, chaperone, and VIVE controller will randomly appear and disappear during play.\n\nWhen you switch it to practice mode, the game runs smooth as silk. \n\nTo top it off, it seems the developer isn't around so expect seldom updates if any.","timestamp_created":1489019589,"timestamp_updated":1489019589,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.617248356342315674","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4mPqe2NoCffb7cw=="}
