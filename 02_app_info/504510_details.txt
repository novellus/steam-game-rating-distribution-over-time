The soundtrack currently features 24 tracks with more tracks being added as the game expands.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOur soundtrack is composed by a group of amazing musicians among UBISOFT’s experienced music supervisor Christian Pacaud from Canada, talented composer Shayne Johnson from Australia and composing enthusiast Philipp Fuhrmann from Germany. Being a small group of dedicated students with no money to spend on music, we have been blown away by quality and love all composers put into their work for the project. It has been an amazing journey and we are happy to finally to share some of that with you today.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe are excited to offer the music of Divinia Chronicles as a standalone soundtrack, we hope you enjoy it wherever you are or travel. While the soundtrack will include many tracks which are not included in the game (yet), it is not required to play the game whatsoever. Instead, it is supposed to be a way of “giving back” to our longtime followers and offers new players the chance to “buy us a coffee” as well (if you do like to do so) :-)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAs of January 2020 the soundtrack is converted to the official STEAM &quot;Soundtrack&quot; format and will appear in your &quot;Soundtrack&quot; library.","about_the_game":"This is the Original Soundtrack of Divinia Chronicles: Relics of Gan-Ti!
