    review: "I don't really think this game is bad as some people make it seem in\
      \ the reviews. I'm not saying it's good, it's just meh. There are many things\
      \ wrong with this game but mostly it just seems to have no direction. They type\
      \ of game seems to change randomly in each chapter making it feel like some\
      \ sort of miss matched story pieces strung together with little continuing gameplay.\
      \ There are a few bugs such as being unable to holster your gun and firing it\
      \ every time you try to do something as well as one make which is so open you\
      \ get lost even though the rest of the game is linear. That and some of the\
      \ most annoying \"spooky\" I've ever hear. Man I don't need to hear a gasp from\
      \ behind me every five seconds especially when you never use it to hint the\
      \ monster is near. \nMy main problem with this game however is the way that\
      \ it made me feel when it was over. I have a thought that the writer of this\
      \ game took a real life tragedy and made it into a stupid \"It was satanists\
      \ and monsters!\" story. It gave me a gross feeling and though I have found\
      \ no major evidence that they are using a real life story to make a dumb tasteless\
      \ horror game, I can't get it out of the pit of my stomach that there is something\
      \ deeply wrong there.\nI say pass this one guys, it's not worth it."
