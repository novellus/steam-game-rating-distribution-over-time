If you expect hours of playtime, don't buy this game. But if you want to play something different and go back to an old school arcade vibe for a bit, this game is definitely worth your money.\n\nIf you want a challenge, try to beat all of the developer's high scores. If you want even more of a challenge, try to do so in less than my play time ;)","timestamp_created":1594302875,"timestamp_updated":1594302875,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41+j2mfMCeZWHlAI="}
