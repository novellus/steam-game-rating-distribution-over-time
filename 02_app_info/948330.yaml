    developer_response: Hey there ahu2mama, sorry to hear about the bad experience.
      We're actually upping the speed and adding a sprint ability in the next content
      update so that should take care of the movement issues. As far as bugs go, would
      be willing to send us a list of the bugs you experienced? Most people email
      them to support@seacreaturesandwich.com, but you can feel free to post here
      as well. Once we know what bugs you're having we can address them ASAP. Thanks
      in advance for your time. :)
