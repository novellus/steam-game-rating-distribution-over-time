    about_the_game: This is the free QuiVr Alpha test! It is intended to give players
      the chance to experience gameplay mechanics in a very early state (before it
      even seems reasonable to ask for <i>any</i> money for early access).<br><br>It
      will be updated regularly until the Early Access phase for the game begins,
      at which point the Alpha will remain available for an undetermined amount of
      time, though without updates. Eventually, the Alpha will either be transitioned
      into a Demo or closed entirely.<br><br> But until then, happy shooting!

      game mechanics at an earlier state of development than any request for payment
