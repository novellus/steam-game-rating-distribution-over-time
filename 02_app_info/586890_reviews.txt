One controller is the racket, the other controller some device that doesn't do anything at all? I could never get it to work in any of the different game modes.\nAt the beach, I couldn't start any of the games.  In the other two locations it worked. I suspect this game is aimed at children, but the physics aren't so good (hitting a balloon doesn't feel real and sometimes the balloon goes through the racket). Balloons float down very slowly so there's no real excitement, maybe for 3-4 year olds? Balloons that fall on your head just pass through your body, which totally kills immersion. You play in a tiny, almost invisible glass cube and the balloons can't leave the cube, so you don't have to move at all.  I have a 6-year old daughter but this is not going to be able to hold her attention for longer than 60 seconds max, and then probably never again. Too bad, I wish there were more quality VR games for children.","timestamp_created":1490370806,"timestamp_updated":1490370806,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48231971263885498","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwj7jBgNsCdtaRdQ=="}
