    review: Valve Index Controllers do not work with this game. The "grip" button
      used to zoom in that is illustrated in the tutorial on the Vive controller does
      not exist on the Index controller and there is no way to configure the Index
      buttons or grip sensors. Cannot get out of the tutorial. It was something fun
      for the kids to do but it just gets stuck. Will look for updates but for now
      shelf-ware.
