The screen was completely black and the game told me to run but it was no use. I STILL DIED.\n\nI was sad because this was the last game my dying father bought for me and it's an insult to his memory. My ancestors have abandoned me from heaven and left me to fend for myself in this cruel cruel world.\n\nThanks game developer, 10/10 would play again","timestamp_created":1591936334,"timestamp_updated":1591936334,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487425148487091064","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi5ez0/ICeM/FjQI="}
