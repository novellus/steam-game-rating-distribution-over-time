I don't often come across these shameless ripoffs. I have put every problem I have in this game on a list:\n\n1. It's a rip off. The game, \"The Binding of YOU\" is a sad copy of \"The Binding of Isaac\", which I've personally played. The game shares many similar aspects with The Binding of Isaac, that being the Title, Character selection, the rogue-like structure... It's just horrendous. \n\n2. The Visuals. The visuals are poor. They seem like a whole bunch of sprites just copied and pasted from Unity's asset store. Nothing seems to fit, and you are left confused as to what in the hell you are playing. Some visuals are lazily added, (The controller support buttons displayed for example).\n\n3. The Audio. This game is wayyy to loud. The damage noise is ear piercingly loud, and there is poor audio controls. (That being 5 selections of 0,25,50,75,100 and master volume being 50, and 100.) It's very obnoxious.\n\n4. Mechanics (Manly speed). The characters just blaze through the levels, and are often very hard to control due to their acceleration. I easily slip past my destination and straight into enemies. \n\n5. Immunity Frames. The one thing this game needs. You get stuck between 2 enemies, and they just collide into you without immunity frames. You go from max health to zero in a matter of seconds. It is very upsetting, and should probably be fixed.\n\n6. The chest. The chest contain items that are either really good, or really bad. They only seem to hold weapons, sometimes one chest will have a very bad weapon, and other times good. They also appear way to often. (Like 2-3 chest in one room)\n\n7. The story. The story makes no sense. There is no lore, no \"meat\" to the game. Just a book that opens up every time you play, that flips through the pages too fast. \n\nIn conclusion, this game is really bad. It's a shameful ripoff of a good game, that aims to ride on the fame of its target. There is no clear objective, just shooting, getting hit without immunity frames etc. The only good thing I can say about this game is that it's playable. And when I say that, I mean barely. Also, the game was like 60 cents, so I didn't really lose a lot. I will say that it does state \"Poor man's Binding of Isaac\", to give credibility where it's due however. I am not by any means denoting the developer, I am rating the game based on how I see it. \n\nAll I can say is this: It's definitely not ready for a full-fledged release. There are still many mechanics that can be changed if the developer puts more time into his project. I admire game developers for their creativity and the integrity they put into their games. 2/10","timestamp_created":1597031098,"timestamp_updated":1597031098,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56204378604888916","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6ZSe6/MCf5DDmgI="}
