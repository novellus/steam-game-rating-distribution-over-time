    review: Well, This game has some real potential to be an awesome horror game,
      i really got scared with those jumpscares. Effort can be seen in the game made
      by developers but they need to fix some bugs and dropping frames especially
      in the forest and sometimes the character cant climb a slope, he gets stuck
      lol. Overall I enjoyed the game but price of this game could have been lower
      as the game looks still in development. Heres my gameplay for this game.
