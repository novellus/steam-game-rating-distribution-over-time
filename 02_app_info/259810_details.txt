Basic puzzle mechanics stay throughout (only by stepping on the button can you open the door) but the flow of the puzzles doesn’t repeat. Like Braid and Portal before it, there’s a desire to always present the player with new challenges, and it works. One moment you might be evading a giant boulder, only to be grabbing parachutes mid-air the next.”<br>9\/10 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.thunderboltgames.com\/review\/home-sheep-home-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Thunderbolt Games (for HSH2)<\/a><br><br>“It looks like many of you really looked forward to this title on the forums, and I can say that it's taken all the concepts from the first game and made them bigger and better, and it doesn't disappoint in its execution.”<br>4\/5 – <a href=\"http:\/\/toucharcade.com\/2011\/12\/23\/home-sheep-home-2-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Touch Arcade (for HSH2)<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/259810\/header.jpg?t=1571415187","website":"https:\/\/homesheephomegame.com\/","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 10: 32 or 64-bit<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Core 2 Duo (1.8GHz - although we have tested back to a Pentium 4 and it was playable)<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 1 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> It will work on all forms of GPU via the software rendering fallback (including Intel GMA and other on-board variants).<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 700 MB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Mac OSX 10.6 &quot;Snow Leopard&quot; or later<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 2 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 300 MB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> The Mac version is a native desktop application and runs in full screen mode with beautiful high-definition visuals.<\/li><\/ul>"},"linux_requirements":[],"legal_notice":"Copright © 2019 Aardman Animations Ltd. and StudioCanal SAS.
