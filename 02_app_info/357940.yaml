    review: 'If you love Fire Emblem, you will probably love this.  If you hate Fire
      Emblem, you will probably hate this.


      The design decisions that are likely to be controversial are

      * permadeath

      * durability

      * grinding is (almost) impossible

      * simplistic leveling


      Fire Emblem makes most of the same controversial design decisions.


      You can turn off permadeath by selecting "Casual Mode" when starting the game,
      just like in recent Fire Emblem games.  This acknowledges that nobody actually
      plays Fire Emblem with permadeath.  The games are too long for such setbacks
      to be acceptable, so you always retry the battle until all your characters survive.  Choosing
      "Casual Mode" (thankfully) does not make the combat easier.


      You (unfortunately) cannot turn off durability.  There is nothing so anticlimactic
      as having your equipment fail mid-battle so that the character equipped with
      it is useless.  Finite money with limited access to vendors makes this worse.


      The number of battles are finite, just like in Fire Emblem.  I enjoy not being
      required to grind.  People who like fighting easy battles over and over so that
      they can win battles that were intentionally imbalanced to pad play time may
      object (these people exist).


      The simplistic leveling cannot be excused by the Fire Emblem ancestry.  Fire
      Emblem allows characters to be customized.  This should probably be improved,
      but you can command a large number of characters at once and there are a large
      number of classes, which helps to reduce the perception that characters are
      generic.


      Some people are complaining about the graphics.  The portraits are static, but
      that is not unusual.  Appearances are reused, but that is not unusual.  Most
      of it looks like typical western animation style.  The graphics will impress
      no one but are not offensive to me.


      Some people are complaining about the user interface.  Movements and attacks
      are communicated with colored tiles and icons, as is typical in turn-based tactical
      role-playing games.  Most icon choices are reasonable, and they all have helpful
      tooltips.  I am not seeing the problem, or even the difference from the norm,
      here.


      I agree with the reviews that mention the music is good.  The style is what
      you would expect in a fantasy setting, but it is well above average.


      What I have seen of the plot is average to above average.  Daughters on a quest
      to rescue their father is a pleasant diversion from all the teenage boys on
      quests to rescue women.


      The text is far too small in the user interface and conversation dialogs, and
      it is not possible to adjust.  This is likely to be an accessibility problem
      for almost everyone middle aged or older and a significant portion of youth.


      That you cannot save at will is a legitimate complaint.


      Combat that is won via reasoning ability instead of who ambushes who first,
      stat bloat, build hard counters, or luck is a very nice thing to see in a genre
      that is often dumbed-down in those ways.  I also love the ability to (de)construct
      the battlefield and move opponents.


      I look forward to the author''s engine improvements and future games.
