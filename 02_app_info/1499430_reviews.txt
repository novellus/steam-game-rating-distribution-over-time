The price is to high for what content you get out of this game. I do enjoy the premise at the beginning of the game and I love the pixels! But, again after 10 minutes this game is boring and repetitive.\n\nReview at:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f6D941ZqZI","timestamp_created":1609354022,"timestamp_updated":1609354022,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx7G+2vYCdYHuvgI="}
