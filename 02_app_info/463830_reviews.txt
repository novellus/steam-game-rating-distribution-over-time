Glitchy hit detection (if you decide to play this game, make sure to always attack your enemies from below or from the right side, you hit much more often then). Some platforms just kill you if you step on them... sometimes. Sometimes you don't get to jump, sometimes you get stuck on invisible platforms in the air. You can't always get off ladders by going up. Sometimes you have to jump down the ladders and start over.\n\nThis is one of two games I own that I regret buying. Don't play it.\n\nEdit: And what you should do, if you for some reason decide to play the game, grind up max health and weapons on the first few levels. It will help a bit in the beginning. Not so much towards the end though, because then everything will be insta-kill. Spikes, arrows, chains.","timestamp_created":1468924828,"timestamp_updated":1468925060,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542992770671844482","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwurSwgdYCfO2MXQ=="}
