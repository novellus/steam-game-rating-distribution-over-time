    about_the_game: "Create your own convict and attempt to survive in a prison where\
      \ every sentence threatens to be a &quot;death&quot; sentence! Rub shoulders\
      \ with up to 100 fellow inmates in a sprawling facility of 12 unique areas,\
      \ each filled with fully interactive furniture and props. Plus a life beyond\
      \ the gates populated by real civilians, with wardens enforcing dozens of different\
      \ laws to keep you as far away from it as possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStaying\
      \ sane is just as important as staying alive, as you balance mental health with\
      \ physical health to get through each day in real-time. Develop unique relationships\
      \ with every other character - from friendships and romances to rivalries and\
      \ gangs - and live long enough to see them change over time, with a constant\
      \ turnover of new faces.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis special desktop release is\
      \ fully unlocked as standard, allowing you to save your changes to all characters\
      \ to make the world your own. Extensive controller support even opens up multiplayer\
      \ opportunities - where a fellow human can take control of someone else on the\
      \ scene to help or hinder the star player!"
