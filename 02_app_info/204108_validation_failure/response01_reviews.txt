Also, and more importantly, available are skins from Max Payne 2 - Max Payne, Mona Sax & Vladimir Lem. A way of paying homage to fans of the series but the big problem is that it is multiplayer only. Same goes for the included weapons - Hammerhead shotgun, G9 grenade launcher and Molotov Cocktail. These are not bad but should have been part of multiplayer to begin with. On top of that hardly anyone even plays multiplayer nowadays. This DLC is part of the Rockstar Pass so you could get it there with the rest of the DLCs. However, there is little reason to get it at all...\n\n[b]P.S.:[/b] To activate the DLC, after installing it, you have to start the game go to 'Store' in the main menu and redeem the code there.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this DLC review you can find more in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]","timestamp_created":1603882362,"timestamp_updated":1603882362,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.579439222812652588","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwydS1t/UCeIvPqgI="}
