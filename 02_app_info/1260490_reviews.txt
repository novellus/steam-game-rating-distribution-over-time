I got it running on Linux using Proton 5.0-9 and a launch argument of  \"PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 %command%\"\n\nIt plays fine with a mouse, but definitely try this with a controller to see it really shine.  I was able to stream it to my Android phone using the Steam Link app.  I could actually see that being the mode where I eventually finish the game.  The bite sized levels make it great for a quick distraction between tasks.","timestamp_created":1604167498,"timestamp_updated":1604167498,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwka/1v/UCdbKuqwI="}
