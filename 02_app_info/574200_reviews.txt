It is grindy, but fun flying around shooting bugs and dodging incoming fire.\n\nI bought this game priced off at roughly 2 euro's and for that price it is a steal and a fun thing to play once in a while to quickly dive into and shoot some bugs, full price it might be a bit too short to warrant the full price.\n\nAlso make sure if you get this game that you install via the store the training missions free dlc to get some extra bang for your buck.","timestamp_created":1608807450,"timestamp_updated":1608811203,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m9mnyvYCdNvevAI="}
