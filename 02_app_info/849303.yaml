    review: 'While the base game is somewhat amazing:

      I really, simply dislike these cash-grab DLC''s.

      Extra outfits or weapons are simply useless.

      Modders can create much better mods too.

      The difference is: They don''t charge money.

      You can''t get additional playtime out of this.

      It is a great addition to the definitive edition.

      But it''s a bad DLC on its own, that''s for sure.

      I do really recommend the definitive edition.

      But this dlc gets a negative review from me.

      I like stuff that increases the playtime value.

      This thing really isn''t worth your paychecks.'
