I'm a 4x addict and played most of them out there. Its a shame it feels so abandoned with a few game breaking bugs left to fix.\n\nIt plays very similar to MOO2 (and that is referenced in the game a few times, i mean, the kulrathi?).\nIts a very hard game to finish, the AI constantly cheats on higher difficult levels but that's ok (you want easy, play easy!)\nMenu transition is speedy and turn times are pleasantly short.\nShipbuilding is almost as good as Polaris Sector.\nBattles are on real time and fun, you don't have much control over ship systems and big fleets are micromanage nightmare but you can pause the game and it helps out.\nLeaders are similar to moo but some of them even have side missions (although they seem kinda unfinished)\nAs for the bugs, you can go around them by editing savegame files that are simple text and easy to interpret (i know, most folks out there aren't as nerd as i am). And that is essential to get rid of the spying altogether since it ruins the game, constant notifications, no defense possible and no diplomatic penalty for using them.\nThe files seem really so easy to edit that i'm surprised no one dared to fix the bugs with a mod or made a scenario editor.\nOverall i must recommend the game, after all i've delved 200+ hours on it. It has a lot of wasted potential and i regret that are no DLCs or further development in progress. MOO4 is still the king of moo2 clones but this one is not short of a prince.","timestamp_created":1609621475,"timestamp_updated":1609635483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ414nw4vYCdqDtvwI="}
