I liked it at first but with every new level it was becoming increasingly unfair to the point where I had to stop playing it at the final room.\n\nI enjoy throwing in VR as it is one of the gameplay mechanics that are unique to this media. And it's pretty good and challenging in Orb Labs with no assist to projectile speed, as far as I can tell. But the game requires way too much precision with far away throws at later stages and punishes you with instant death even on small mistakes. Add to this big open rooms where sometimes you can't even see where all the enemy turrets are located(since everytime you try to look around the corner you get killed) and the result is extremely frustrating 'trial and error' core gameplay. Final room was the worst example of that: I died few dozen times before giving up without exploring even a half of it.\n\nVisuals are decent and lighting is pretty good, but the levels themselves look all the same with a lot of boring corridors with nothing but crates, lockers and pits.\n \n[strike]Also there is a consistent visual bug that makes parts of the level look pitch black until you get close to them.[/strike] The bug was fixed","timestamp_created":1596144755,"timestamp_updated":1597594910,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533456146717071533","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1597589010,"developer_response":"Thanks for the feedback, and especially for pointing out that bug where part of the level appears to be black.\nThis bug apparently crept in in the last update, and affected the occlusion culling behind doors, that did not properly update in some levels (so the area behind the door remained culled until you moved through it). I have fixed the issue and will push an update later today.\n\n"}],"cursor":"AoJw0/eE/PMCcdvAmAI="}
