It is recommended for the person who is patient in playing rpg maker game.\nAs for the price, it is better to grab one when on Sale.","timestamp_created":1609395423,"timestamp_updated":1609755402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530201315879821777","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8cO55vYCc66CvwI="}
