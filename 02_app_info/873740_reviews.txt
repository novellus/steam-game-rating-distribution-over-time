Now imagine NOTHING on this landscape asset except for some free spinning gold coins that you can collect as you run your astronaut asset endlessly across the surface.  There's nothing to do with the coins and ZERO actual content as well as ZERO fun to be had!\n\nI mean some might find the fact they can run around endlessly on a map of the actual moon landscape around the Apollo 11 landing site cool, but trust me when I say that this is about the most boring thing I've ever experienced!\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED.  The developer of this is NOT a developer at all.  They simply smashed together a huge lunar map with an Astronaut asset with a jet pack as well as scattered a few random spinning coins around the massive map and then uploaded the unpacked 35 GB mess here to Steam to try and charge $10 for it.","timestamp_created":1563546996,"timestamp_updated":1563585868,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.59305417537689209","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1563818376,"developer_response":"As painful as it was to read this, it was not unfair.\n\nFirst, I wish to thank you for trying the program, spending a fair amount of time running around the world and then comprising a long, thoughtful and fair review. I truly appreciate your comments and feedback. I apologize that this was not the experience that you were expecting.\n\nSecondly, I would like to address several points that you brought up:\n\t\n    Yes. This is a massive play area, and, as you stated, is more of a Lunar \n    Exploration Simulator. This version is called “Explorer” because it is meant for us \n    Moon-geeks and explorers to wander and explore this open-world lunar \n    environment. It is primarily focused upon the terrain and landscape of the Moon. I \n    understand that this may not be considered “fun” by most. I will review the store \n    page and update to better communicate this going forward.\n\n    Again, this is a massive play area, which accounts for the large file size. 17,000 \n    square kilometers is a lot of area, which accounts for the 35 GB of space needed \n    to install.\n\n    I am working on the glitch. There will be an update.\n\nAgain, I thank you for the thoughtful review. I, clearly, have some things to work on…\n"}],"cursor":"AoJwjt6+huwCd/3WzgE="}
