Happy to see nonbinary gender options and various sexualities for the main player. Compared to other games though - especially the other \"rise to fame\" game SLAMMED! (a pro wrestling choose your own adventure game) - it's really short and not as in depth. There was a good variety of options for how you approach your music, though!\n\nOverall, too short, but worth a playthrough.","timestamp_created":1601749903,"timestamp_updated":1601750018,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/bTv9/QCd6HVpQI="}
