There's nothing here. You can get a good score by simply standing in one spot and allowing the tacos the smack you in the face in time trial mode. In survival mode it's bit harder, but that's mainly to do with crappy Minecraft like graphics. Another review noted this is a good party game. It's not. If you use this game to show others a VR experience, they more than likely will never try VR again. Not recommended.","timestamp_created":1488137855,"timestamp_updated":1488137855,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559071719646453857","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gbT7vdoCfqKccw=="}
