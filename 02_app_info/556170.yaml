    review: "Fantastic! I never played drums and I had a blast! 25 minutes of just\
      \ playing first time!\n\nThe music is in sync from what I can see and hear!\
      \ \nthe fun starts right away! The music was new to me and liked it! \nYou can\
      \ adjust the drums in all dimensions on the move it's lots of fun! Highly recommend!\n\
      \nThink of guitar hero! Colored Orbs that matches the drums Colors come down\
      \ towards the drums, in the distance! \n\nAfter a few minutes you will be drumming\
      \ away waiting for those orbs to fall so that you can  hit that beat!\n\ndifferent\
      \ setting from beginner to expert!  Many songs to choose from plus you get a\
      \ score board to keep up!\n\nThank you for this game!"
