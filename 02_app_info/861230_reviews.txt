It's unlike any hidden object game I've ever seen, not only because it uses first-person perspective, but also because the objects aren't hidden in the traditional sense.  There are no scenes of jumbled objects requiring you to find a list of specific items.\n\nWhat you have, instead, is a group of 8 areas, and in each area, you need to collect certain objects, usually 10 qty each of 3 to 6 items.  Most of these items are in plain sight, but some are \"hidden\" in boxes, barrels, and bags.  You simply click on the box, barrel, or bag to open it and see what's inside.  Once you collect the required items, you are shown a picture which leads you to another area or directs you on what to do next, sometimes requiring you to find additional items.  As is typical in hidden adventure games, in most cases, you cannot pick up these additional items until you \"know\" you need them (when you see the picture); prior to that, the icon does not change to a hand and you cannot pick up the additional items.\n\nBeside the \"hidden object\" part of the game, there are also some adventure elements, such as finding planks of wood to allow you to cross a gap, and a few simple mini-games.\n\nAll-in-all, I'd recommend this to casual gamers who like hidden object / adventure games.  While it doesn't follow the traditional formula for that type of game, I did find it enjoyable.  The only part I found overly frustrating was that the \"hint\" button (which shows the outline of items needed, allowing you to determine the general location of those items) can be used only once every seven minutes.  It would be much better if that recharge time were reduced to one or two minutes.","timestamp_created":1567041091,"timestamp_updated":1567041091,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557046949863433838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ426677ewCf7uk0QE="}
