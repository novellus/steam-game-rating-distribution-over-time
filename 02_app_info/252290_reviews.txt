Not at all.  That's no slam against Dejobaan at all.  but it's not a game.\n\nIt's a writer's tool, a software toy, or what have you, but it's not a game.\n\nAs a writer, this is indispensable - I've used it a few times to clear mental writing blocks and to look at how others handle the constraints (in free form mode, with a max of 1000 words to be able to work with, yeah, there are constraints).  But that's to be expected.\n\nI also wish there were more than just three worlds; after you're done with them, you're pretty much done with it, if you look at this as a game.  Maybe in the future, Dejobaan will consider creating other worlds?  In any case, this cries out for expansion.\n\nBut it's not a game at all.  Regardless, it's got my upvote and my enthusiastic suggestion to try it out.","timestamp_created":1604794369,"timestamp_updated":1604794369,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vtjM0vUCeLqDrQI="}
