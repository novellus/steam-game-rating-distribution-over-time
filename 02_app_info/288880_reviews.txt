Although the gameplay can be considered repetitive to some, I don't quite agree, the house is constantly changing and you have to find something different every day, this only helps to heighten the atmosphere of the game. \n\nI don't often get uneasy at horror games but this one certainly did a goodjob, the sound design is top tier especially. \n\nMy only complaint is in the later end of the game you have a lot of the house to look around for the specific item of that day and it can take a long time, however your character does eventually say \"I heard something in the bathroom\" for example and this gives you a clue as to where to go, but this can take quite a while to trigger.","timestamp_created":1609260104,"timestamp_updated":1609260104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514925360679626465","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlI/Y1/YCfpe/vgI="}
