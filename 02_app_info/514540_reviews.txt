As I started playing it, I realized it was optimized for mobile as well, so that made more sense as to where all the reviews may have went.  That aside... the game is actually: GREAT!  Yeah!  It made me feel like a really good RPG player lol.  The tutorial teaches you only one button (Hah!  For PC).  Easiest tutorial ever!  There is even an MP3 player function in this game to listen to some fun tunes!!!  \"Survive the Night\"  was my favorite!  It was a must listen to everywhere the characters went.  So you know that OST/Music are fun to listen to.\n\nThe characters are appealing.  All of them.  Every NPC has their own dialogue as you explore more and more areas.  Gameplay is turn based, with no need to put points into stats (phew!) and skills come at certain levels.  It all may seem odd at first, until you get used to it.  Enemies DO level with you, but eventually you will see the strategy behind everything.  The bank feature is a nice touch!  You can also level your gear and weapons and you are going to need that generous bank feature.\n\nAs you progress, the enemies have extremely high HP bars.  I thought I was doing something wrong, but then I figured out that DOT damage is VERY important.  :)  Thanks to that I was able to beat the last boss!  That boss was tricky and gives an image of impossibility... until you actually try and succeed!  Nice touch!\n\nNo game is perfect by all means and that's good.  I really like the bug that actually ends your battle early, even thought you just cast one spell.  Also, the starting spell of \"Professor\" reads:  \"Hits two random enemies\".  It hits one enemy twice.  Sometimes the enemies manage to attack through \"stun\", so I am guessing they have a halved resistance to it?  Oh well. \n Those aren't big at all and you will still have plenty of fun figuring out what the spells do and how they should be used.  Apart from everything else as well.\n\nOverall lots of fun and amusement was had.  I am really glad I got to play this game.  Thank you for making it... for us to enjoy!!! :D =) :>\n\nP.S.  There isn't a long story, but you will feel like you did a really good thing for making everything and everyone feel good at the end.","timestamp_created":1592625686,"timestamp_updated":1592625686,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531125247478485107","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3+z45/ICe46IjwI="}
