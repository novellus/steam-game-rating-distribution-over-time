    review: "A fascinating unofficial \"companion piece\" of sorts to Indie Game:\
      \ The Movie (which I've cited more than once as the greatest video game documentary\
      \ ever made). Not least of all because it features a few familiar faces from\
      \ that seminal doco and its multitude of extras (e.g. Edmund McMillen has a\
      \ brief cameo, and Jason Rohrer is featured prominently).\n\n   A bit less of\
      \ a \"Journey\" on this one, despite the game of the same name being prominently\
      \ featured: more of a straight-down-the-line TV-style doco, with largely unrelated\
      \ segments covering the development of different games. But close enough to\
      \ a must-see for all aspiring indie devs, just the same. And the price is certainly\
      \ nothing to scoff at.\n\n   So what are you waiting for? Buy it now! (Or rent,\
      \ if you really must; though why anyone would bother is frankly beyond me, given\
      \ it's more than half the price of buying it outright.)\n\n   Verdict: 8.5/10.\n\
      \n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages:\
