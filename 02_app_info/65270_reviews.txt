If I had played this before I had played Demolish & Build 2018 then I probably would have given it a better review, but honestly Demolish & Build is a superior game. Only took 9 hrs to get through all of the missions. Graphics are ok, but not fantastic. I just felt like there was something missing. Maybe the jobs should have been more involved or something. I can say that the sound effects are really good and the dynamite works really well, but the physics and general feel of the game felt kind of off, especially when operating most of the machinery.","timestamp_created":1609518940,"timestamp_updated":1609518940,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9r+z3/YCcYi5vwI="}
