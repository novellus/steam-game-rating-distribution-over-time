    review: This game just hit early access, but so far it's looking pretty good.
      This is a pretty standard RPG but with a cool cyberpunk theme. Just keep in
      mind, though, that it is still early access, so the game is incomplete and there
      are a few bugs that you're bound to run into. Having said that, it'll provide
      you with a interesting story and fun battle mechanics that are a bit of a throwback
      to years past.
