    short_description: one day, a portal opened for appearantly no reason, evils poured
      in - the devil who wants to rule the world, slime princess that's acutally kinda
      cute, blood-thirsting succubus, fox of mystery and sexy mermaids. I was enslaved
      by those beautiful monstresses and drilled day by day.
