    review: "I gave this game all the chances I could, and I don't even remember why\
      \ I bought it, but it's way overpriced for quality.\nI wouldn't mind if it were\
      \ linear, I wasn't even entirely against the timing aspect of the abilities\
      \ and weapons.  I can see how to win and not have much trouble.\n\nBut it doesn't\
      \ save choices except at the end of fights, and never saves settings.  This\
      \ means I have to fix the volume EVERY TIME I open it, and if I change my weapon\
      \ loadout, I need to change it EVERY TIME I go into a battle if I don't win\
      \ with that loadout.  \n\nI'm all for supporting the little guy, but they need\
      \ to pay attention to details."
