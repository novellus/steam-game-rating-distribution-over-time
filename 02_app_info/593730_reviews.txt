Clunky, convoluted controls. Even once you figure out how to read the note, which is amazingly awkward to do, it's too dark to read them (with brightness cranked up). Your warning about sanity is valid.. if I forced myself to suffer through more of this horrible execution, I would go nuts.\n\nTo be constructive, these aspects can easily be fixed; games like Penumbra have a similar feel, and somehow they manage to be usable.\n\nHope this helps to make version 1.0 actually playable.","timestamp_created":1550553457,"timestamp_updated":1550553457,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4loSMgukCfoqkuwE="}
