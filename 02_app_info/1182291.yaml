    review: "this is an excellent game/simulation, i am now at approx. 200 hours in\
      \ on NI alone, playing through it again now, \nscenarios range from an hour\
      \ or two to several days of game play, \nvery educational as well and a good\
      \ way to breakout of the WW2 genre into more modern warfare, it is completely\
      \ different with all the new weapons and tactics! \nNI is a good intermediate\
      \ step to the modern systems of the the 2000's as shown in other Command scenario's\n\
      \nhere is my review from 3 years ago when originally released as a standalone;\n\
      \n\nThis was a great idea by the CMANO PEOPLE. I didn't want to drop 90 bucks\
      \ on the full game, 20 bucks is much less of a risk and allows you to try the\
      \ whole game engine in only 15 scenarios. i now have 130 hours in and am only\
      \ on #10. lots more gaming to do, i consider this a steal. It has a very high\
      \ learning curve but if you spend time on the tutorials, do them several times,\
      \ it all will click in. Modern battle systems are much more complex than i realized\
      \ and this simulation has definately taught me a ton about modern warfare in\
      \ the electronic age. This is not a button smasher game, but there are times\
      \ when you have to play at real time to get things done because alot is going\
      \ on. Download the picture mod for the data base and game on, two thumbs up,\
      \ i now know i will buy the larger complete CMANO once i survive this battle\
      \ simulation first!"
