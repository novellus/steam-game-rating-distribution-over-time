    review: 'Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation - Gauntlet DLC, its the last of
      the Ashes DLC I have to "review" Ive got to say I fell like its another one
      of those DLC that is really heavily multiplayer focused as the bulk of it seems
      like multiplayer maps. At the same time however it has a pretty good Scenario,
      Gauntlet. I would recommend it if you enjoy Ashes a lot.'
