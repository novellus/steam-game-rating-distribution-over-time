    review: "Bought all three games and pretty happy with them. Very impressed that\
      \ this is a single dev game too.\n\nHere's the bad up front. There isn't a huge\
      \ amount of depth to the game. You have fighters, guilds, a few weapons, and\
      \ arena combat. There's not really a story line, and Death League doesn't have\
      \ the random events of that AOG: Rome 2 has to keep you on your toes. Oh...\
      \ and the RNG is suspect (but RNGs are REALLY hard to do well, so that is a\
      \ bit forgivable). Also, the AI makes some really odd choices for match ups\
      \ and load outs, but it is what it is.\n\nOkay... not a lot of depth. Got it?\
      \ Good. What AOG: DL sets out to do, i.e. plant you in a galactic fight league,\
      \ let you struggle A LOT in the early game, and then rack up a fortune in credits\
      \ after you build your stable of fighters, it does very well. In other words,\
      \ it is GM-mode for whatever EA sports game you fire up when you are totally\
      \ bored. And... it does a pretty decent job too.\n\nThere is enough nuance to\
      \ the game to make your stats matter to the outcome of your matches. Want to\
      \ build a slow axe-wielding tank that will soak up damage? You can do that.\
      \ Need a speedy twerp with a vibroblade to tickle the other gladiators to death?\
      \ You can do that too. Prefer to take on the enemy at range? Go for it. \n\n\
      You may find that in the early game melee >>> ranged almost every match. But\
      \ keeping your guys with your trainers lets you train your shooters so that\
      \ the phrase \"never bring a knife to a plasma carbine fight\" has some real\
      \ meaning.\n\nAlso, make sure that you train more that three dudes... why? Playoffs.\
      \ Don't worry, you'll find out.\n\nSo, after buying this on sale, I've had a\
      \ good time with it. Not sure how much replayability there is yet due to the\
      \ depth, but it is a solid game for what the dev set out to do with with it.\
      \ I'll buy the next one as a result."
