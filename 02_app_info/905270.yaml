    about_the_game: Have you ever wanted to play magic football? Now you will have
      the opportunity. In this game you have to control the flight of magic balls
      and score them into the goal, simultaneously destroying the monsters that protect
      them. The balls are of various kinds. Some of them can be launched only once,
      and some do not succumb to spells, so you have to use the other balls to move
      them from their place.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/905270/extras/MerlinSoccer.jpg?t=1533296358"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Many levels<br></li><li>Suitable
      for children<br></li><li>Nice graphics<br></li><li>Has many Steam achievements<br></li><li>Compatible
      with Windows, Mac and Linux</li></ul><br>This game is just what you need if
      you want to play something original. After all, here in front of you is a real
      arcade magic football! Of course, this is not a team game. Here everything is
      controlled by a single magician, that is you. But your power is not unlimited.
      To win you will need to defeat the evil Troll and decide how to move some swords
      from their place. It sometimes looks like a puzzle, so you will not be bored!
      In addition, the game is quite exciting and contains many levels. Pass the levels
      themselves are not too difficult, but to do it with the maximum rating - that
      is, destroying all the monsters - can be a real problem. The game is well developed
      various skills and will be very useful for children.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/905270/extras/os.png?t=1533296358"
