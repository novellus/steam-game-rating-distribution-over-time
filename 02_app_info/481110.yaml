    review: "This is the first FMV game from Wales Interactive that I will be trying\
      \ to review, I am going through it as they were released.\n\nThe Bunker is a\
      \ much more cinematic take on FMV games than I have seen in many years (mainly\
      \ because the last major one I can think of was a Tex Murphy game). In it you\
      \ play as John, portrayed by Adam Brown, who was born and raised in the titular\
      \ Fallout Bunker and after the death of his mother must survive as the systems\
      \ designed to keep him alive begin to fail. Gameplay is rather simple with a\
      \ cursor and highlighted points, a la Telltale adventure games, with the occasional\
      \ multi-click or drag button to interact with. \n\nMy 1 run through took me\
      \ a little over 2 hours, which I don't think is necessarily a bad thing, at\
      \ least if your like me and purchased it on sale. The plays more like a interactive\
      \ movie than a game and it was nice to play something that didn't require a\
      \ huge time commitment from me. Overall I would recommend this game, just don't\
      \ expect to be playing it over and over again."
