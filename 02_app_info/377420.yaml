    review: 'Definitely might have missed the boat on this one since Yai is currently
      working on Close Your Eyes Anniversary Remake, which from what I can tell will
      have all of the bonus content included in this and then some, but I consider
      the two bucks this costs to be a way to fund further content from them. For
      two bucks you get access to the game''s soundtrack and a whole boatload of artwork
      from the game, as well as the bonus side game "Girl''s Graveyard."


      You play as Kiki in an arcade type experience where you must dodge ghosts and
      bats on narrowly designed maps to get pieces of candy. There isn''t much of
      a story at first, but patient players will be rewarded (and trust me when I
      say you gotta be patient- these sections can be infuriating, so infuriating
      that it took me several years to come back and beat this part). This seems to
      expand the universe of Close Your Eyes in some pretty interesting ways, and
      if I''m not mistaken, it ties into one of Yai''s upcoming titles pretty directly.
      Either way, it has everything that makes the base game great as well as some
      insanely frustrating arcade sections.


      Support Yai Gameworks and download this pack even if you already own the anniversary
      remake.'
