No special power ups to buy, and no real grind as you get lots of wild cards as you go along to use. There is 3 different solitaire play styles you can chose from and you can mix and match play styles at any time. Solving the levels leads you to clues as to who did the dirty deed. A nice, different approach to a solitaire game. Also for the price I can honestly say I got my moneys worth for the hours I put into it.","timestamp_created":1567311932,"timestamp_updated":1567311932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.618896484375","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpsXE9ewCc+680QE="}
