If you get lucky past the title screen then the game either freezes up or doesn't respond to any inputs. It's a true shame that developers are lazy and release broken games like this one. \n\nIt's unfortunate because I was looking forward to playing this; have some fond memories of this game from the PS1 era.","timestamp_created":1608263168,"timestamp_updated":1608263168,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgI79ufYCeJqMuwI="}
