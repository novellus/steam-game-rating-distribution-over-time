    review: "As a former snowboarder and a sucker for snowboarding games, here are\
      \ my thoughts:\n\nPros:\nSuperb snowboard-feeling in all aspects: spinning,\
      \ flipping, grabbing, tweaking, jumping/landing, carving both in prepped and\
      \ backcountry terrain.\n\nCons:\nTedious and inconsistent designed mission-system\
      \ to unlock new mountains. Also somewhat lacking in mountain-design.  \n \n\n\
      I've been a fan of Snowboard games since the 90's but \"The snowboard game\"\
      \ is the first one that does the sport justice. The snowboard game excels in\
      \ core gameplay: the riding. The controls are spot on and with realistic bodymovement.\
      \ The thumbsticks controls flip and spins sepatately enabling almost full trick-freedom\
      \ e.g. flips, flatspins, corks, rodeos as well as the speed of the rotation/flip.Those\
      \ little details reveals the developers apparent love for the game and maybe(?)\
      \ own experience from riding. Playing the game is fun and relaxing at the same\
      \ time, you get hooked on giving it just one more try to get perfect run.\n\n\
      The only minor complain I've got about the riding-mechanics, is the HALFpipe\
      \ riding.\nStrangely enough, the QUARTERpipe (atleast the QP in the first mountain\
      \ Viking pass east) has good mechanics. Ive spent hours and hours on the trick\
      \ course\nfinishing off the run with the quarterpipe at the bottom, doing all\
      \ kinds of tricks (backside, frontside and alley-ops spins/rodeos/corks. But\
      \ the first halfpipe in the game (Viking Pass Village) the mechanics are way\
      \ off, especially the timing of taking off and initiating spins/flips off the\
      \ lip of the pipe-wall, and often you drift in the pipe and land in the flat\
      \ bottom of the pipe, even though its more or less against the law of physics.\
      \ On top of that, the landings feels strange, and doing a regular backside method\
      \ takes more skill then doing a quad cork.\n\n The Snowboard games biggest flaw\
      \ (and probably a dealbreaker for some) is the progression system (missions/challenges)\
      \ to unlock mountains. Some/most are fairly well designed - e.g. \"get 7000\
      \ points in a single run down the mountain\". This means you can\ncombine whatever\
      \ tricks you want. I have nothing against these types of missions/challenges.\n\
      \nWhat I do have a problem with, are nit-picky missions that require you to\
      \ do combination of certain tricks in one go, e.g. \"Spin 180 Bluntside, Spin\
      \ 360 Nosegrind\". These typ of missions frustrates me due to the randomness\
      \ involved. There are very small margins doing railslides, so its more a game\
      \ of trying over and over again until you accidently get it. What makes matters\
      \ worse, you have to complete all (in this case both) tricks in the same try\
      \ to complete the mission. In comparison, the \"regular\" point-based missions\
      \ (get 7000 point in a run) are extremely easy compared to the nit-picky missions.\n\
      \nThe snowboard games second biggest flaw is the poor mountain design which\
      \ runs hand in hand with tedious unlocking. The game starts out strong: the\
      \ first part of the first mountain \"Viking Pass East\" are fun, with both trick\
      \ courses and free-riding. After grinding and unlocking new parts of the mountain\
      \ \"Viking Pass Backcountry\" and \"Home\" I almost gave up on the game, due\
      \ to bad mountain design. Things picked up again with Viking Pass Village and\
      \ Alaska so I kept on playing.\n\nSadly, efter 75 hours of gameplay, I have\
      \ not unlocked 2 full mountains, and I have no idea what Im missing out on.\
      \ I just cant muster the will to grind through the nit-picky missions. I rather\
      \ just ride and enjoy myself.\n\nI still recommend this game because its made\
      \ with love, and got the best core gameplay in the genre (except for the halfpipe-riding),\
      \ that more than compensates for the\nbadly designed progression system.  \n\
      \nThese flawes are easily corrected: change the halfpipe mechanics to the same\
      \ as quarterpipes mechanics and pretty pretty please, delete those nit-picky\
      \ missions so I can unlock all mountains. Hopefully the devs gets this right\
      \ on the upcoming snowboard game \"Shredders\"."
