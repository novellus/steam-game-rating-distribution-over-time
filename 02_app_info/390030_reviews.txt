I made as much progress as I could, (about 1/5 through the game) got brick-walled, spent a half hour trying to get past just a single fight, and now I can't refund it anymore. Unless you are GODLY at first person shooters, this game is not for you. Yeah... I know... I love the aesthetics and presentation too. :(","timestamp_created":1609805482,"timestamp_updated":1609805482,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgcn45/YCdcnGwAI="}
