Vivid colours, easily customised controls, reasonable difficulty levels and not too long of a game.\n\nA couple of things here:\n\n1) Sometimes when I want to move to the next map, you know when it says \"press any key to continue.\" Sometimes when I press a key it does not load the next map until like 3-5 seconds later. In some cases it did not load the map at all and I have to restart the game.\n\n2) Hitting space sometimes does not register. I guess this may be a design decision when you are at the edge of a certain ground?\n\nOther than that, I enjoyed this game overall and would recommend it for other people if they are a platformer junkie/retro type of gamers.\n\nYou can see more of the review here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VnOj2tBsww&feature=youtu.be","timestamp_created":1571796953,"timestamp_updated":1571796953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1571867174,"developer_response":"Hi Nisha, thanks for the review.
