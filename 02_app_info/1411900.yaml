      \ video game ever created by a Mexican-American studio, and it is the first\
      \ video game completely based on Mesoamerican history and culture. With our\
      \ game, we want to provide players with a challenging and engaging story, but\

      \ /><br>At the core of our project is a varied and rich world where history\
      \ meets fantasy. One of our main goals was to recreate with great accuracy the\
      \ architecture and iconography of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures, drawing\
      \ evidence from textual descriptions and material remains, all wrapped up in\
      \ a fantasy setting. Mictlan\u2019s stunning environments, architectural elements,\
      \ objects and characters are designed using real-life references, locations\
      \ and archeological sites, providing players with a truly immersive experience,\

      \ history. 2021 marks the 500th anniversary of Mexico\u2019s independence. Valuing\
