Locomotive looks realy good, only thing that isn't realistic is that it's too mat and not metalic.\nSounds are amazing. I was standing right next to SÅ½ 363 in real life and it sounded just like in game. I didn't experienced any bugs, for now :). I think that physics are realy good, but I don't realy know because I didn't drive it in real life. And there aren't any pixelated textures anymore. I recomend it to beginners and also professional drivers. I realy like it, because it's fun to drive and it's only Slovenian Locomotive in Train Simulator (for now).\n\n(These are only my opinions and my experiences. Don't hate on me if yours aren't going to be the same)","timestamp_created":1601039693,"timestamp_updated":1601039693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zN7Z4vQCeaD6owI="}
