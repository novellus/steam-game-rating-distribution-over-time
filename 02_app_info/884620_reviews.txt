It's much 'tighter' than most Total War games, for example there are no agents, but for me this makes for a much more streamlined experience, not necessarily a lesser one. If you like the era (Vikings, Saxons, etc) and can get this game for under Â£15, I think it's an absolute steal.","timestamp_created":1608749774,"timestamp_updated":1608749882,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48625791072845459","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqeO9yPYCfoDHvAI="}
