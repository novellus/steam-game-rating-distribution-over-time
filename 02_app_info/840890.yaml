    about_the_game: In a world where nothing you do seems to work. And all paths lead
      to anger. Rocket Rush will... make it worse. In this minimalist hard platformer
      you will attempt to traverse a seemingly endless world filled with traps, fire
      and a bunch of other doo-dads designed and positioned specifically to upset
      you. Sounds fun, right! For the low low price listed you too can join the others
      who made a questionable decision and eventually wound up hating themselves.
