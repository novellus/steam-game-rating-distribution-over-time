In order to be relatively biased (cause I'm like that), this lil gem suffers from the same fate as all great point n click/moon logic strat puzzle games we all enjoy; once you've played through it once, you will remember all the fun and frustration you had before.  That out of the way, I loved the programmer's music, puzzle solving, and story-telling.  I was engaged in the totality of the adventure.  Granted, the infamous bonus chapter-door puzzle code was infuriating, but for anyone looking to lose a day or a solid afternoon with a great lil adventure, I highly recommend it.  You may want to wait until it's on sale, but that only adds to your appreciation of this solid lil thing.  Well done, Goblinz!!","timestamp_created":1609876637,"timestamp_updated":1609876637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41ICI6vYCctXmwAI="}
