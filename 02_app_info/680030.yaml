    review: Im giving this game a thumps up cause im havin fun while playing it but
      im going to give an honest review hoping that the devs will see it. The game
      is actually a mele Isaac clone with better graphics and music BUT it lacks in
      relics big time (i know its still in early access) and you never get these "overpowered"
      runs you would get in Isaac.. It also lacks in enemies and you find the same
      ones (6-7 types of enemies) again and again.The bosses are actually fun and
      interesting.The events need a bit balance cause many times you get in rooms
      full of enemies and with the events together its super sure that you ll get
      damaged..The drops need a bit balance too cause there are many runs that you
      cant even find enough shields..The main character is fun with nice skills but
      the rest two characters are 99% unplayable.The second character needs to never
      get dmg or find extremely many shields (and this happens 1 in 50 runs) and the
      third character has the slowest attack in the history of videogames and if you
      miss it you get dmg so its unplayable too.. i feel that these 2 characters need
      a huge rework..A ranged character would be fun i think (i know that there are
      ranged weapons but still its not sure if you ll find one or not).. The game
      is nice and the whole idea too but the game needs balancing and reworks to be
      a super great game.. I hope we see more relics and more unique ones in the next
      updates so every runs is different than the last one. 7/10
