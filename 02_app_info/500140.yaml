    review: "A very basic shooting game, a limited selection of guns and you shoot\
      \ 1 of 3 wildlife at a time as they run around on a pre-scripted route. Scoring\
      \ is very basic, 1 point per kill and it doesn't track accuracy or have any\
      \ goals. There is a Can shooting mini game, but again no real scoring or accuracy\
      \ recorded. Just shoot some cans until you get bored. \nNeeds a lot more added\
      \ to it until it becomes a game or something at least enjoyable to spend some\
      \ time in it."
