If the game starts with an error they will give you a quick fix.\n\nThe game is relatively simple. You choose your start amount, look through some stocks conveniently named in similar fashion to real companies and read the scrolling news as you \"end your turn\" and continue to buy and sell accordingly. No tutorial so navigating the beginning portions may take a 5-10 minutes to look through all the options. With only 20 mins played I haven't gotten into the subtleties just yet. However I was very impressed by the customer service!","timestamp_created":1576161731,"timestamp_updated":1576161731,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.375521570444107056","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m+yj/e4Cetzl4wE="}
