I'm 6 feet tall and have decent arm length, but when I tried the tatami poles I found that I wasn't able to cut the poles by swinging my arm without taking a full step towards the pole when the poles can appear all around you which gets frustrating. then there's the fruit. granted the fruit are thrown towards you which makes reach a non-issue, but when I cut one fruit and then the edge of my blade bounces the second and third fruits across the room, and I haven't slowed my swing down, I'm going to get frustrated.\n\nto anyone who reads this review: the game isn't worth your time. there's only a small amount of content and what the game does have is poorly designed and buggy. the only reason you might buy this game is if you buy it solely for the aesthetics, which are the games only redeeming quality, but if you want a game and not art then go buy something like fruit ninja vr. heck even if you want art you can easily find better than this on the steam store.","timestamp_created":1609649952,"timestamp_updated":1609649952,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw0KKn4/YCfa77vwI="}
