    review: 'This game looks beautiful and some work went into it. The majority of
      the puzzles were hard and I had to cheat for one of them. The hidden object
      games are challenging and this is actually worth a couple of bucks. Some of
      the games were actually weird for a hidden object game, like bejewelled and
      clicking on objects. It was definitely unique.

      Took me just over 4hrs.'
