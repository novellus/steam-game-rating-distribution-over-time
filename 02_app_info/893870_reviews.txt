Buying this game as it is would be similar to a donation.\nIt had promise but it seemed like the people developing it had conflicting interests in how to implement even simple features like the inventory.\n\nI started out by testing the dragon which is why I was interested in the first place, it was awful but I knew it would be since the humans were more complete, so I moved onto them, it was retarded, I go into a fist fighting stance, pull out a torch, am still in fist fighting stance, the torch clips with my head, I burn to death. No idea how this was still a bug. I remember running for hours as a dragon finally finding what looked to be a huge settlement and then died due to heat next to some furnace, so people had to have made that settlement without dying like a retard from heat damage via torch, but how?","timestamp_created":1601753578,"timestamp_updated":1601753578,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwof/89/QCfNDWpQI="}
