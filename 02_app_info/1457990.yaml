    review: I played one full run through and really enjoyed it. The art is beautiful,
      the characters are fun and I'm really curious how the other playthroughs go.
      I did not get a happy ending! I love the theme and setting and it's really refreshing
      to play a game that is not trying to be all epic and grand and world changing.
      This one is short, sweet, and hits the right spot for me in terms of length
      (for a single playthrough).
