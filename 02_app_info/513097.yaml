    about_the_game: "Charles Collett 1871-1952 succeeded G.J\_Churchward\_as Chief\
      \ Mechanical Engineer of the GWR in 1922. Collett has been accredited more with\
      \ the implementation of the locomotives designed and planned by his predecessor\
      \ than of his own original works. However, Collett made huge improvements on\
      \ the manufacturing processes, design improvements and standardisation within\
      \ the GWR. This can perhaps be best appreciated on his design of the coaches\
      \ of the GWR. His Collett coaches were produced as a follow on of stringent\
      \ testing and standardisation of the best bogie designs, to ensure the carriages\
      \ offered the best in ride and comfort. To replace ageing &quot;Dreadnought&quot;\
      \ and &quot;Concertina&quot; express coaches, mainly 70ft, Collett set about\
      \ a new design of smaller windowed, shorter coaches generally known as High\
      \ Waisters. These were produced in various diagrams and proved to be succesful,\
      \ apart from rather dark interiors, due to dark wood and the small windows.\
      \ Collett would later modify the designs to bring about the Large Window Colletts\
      \ to improve lighting. The &quot;Excursion&quot; diagrams were nicknamed &quot;Sunshine&quot;\
      \ stock due to these improvements.<br><br>GWR High Waist Collett Coaches Pack\
      \ 02 for TS Marketplace includes the following coach types in GWR Chocolate\
      \ and Cream, BR Crimson and Cream and BR Maroon livery:<br><br><ul class=\"\
      bb_ul\"><li>Corridor Composite<br></li><li>Full Brake<br></li><li>Brake Third\
