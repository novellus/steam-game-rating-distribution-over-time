Well worth the $10 to have a little fun running a viking town.\n\nIdeas/Suggestions\n\nMOBS:\n Add Mobs: Farmable mobs like chickens, cows, pigs, etc...\nAdd Aggressive Mobs: Rival Vikings, Pirates, ets...\nAdd Useful Mobs: Horses, Donkeys, Bees, Birds, Deer, snakes, etc...\n\nFarming Depth:\nCreating a fenced in area and dropping a person in it is pretty simple for sure. Spice it up a little bit and maybe give us the ability to pick what we grow. This would make having multiple farms/farmers worth while, as well as add another element to farming.\n\nFishing Depth:\nI like the fishing dock but why not add more to it? Maybe fishing boats, nets, etc for the vikings to use. Maybe give us the ability to build boats for fishing/fighting.\n\nReally we are lacking weapons and war. I am sure many people would love at least something simple to fight... just don't make it something crazy although I would not be opposed to dragons. ;-)","timestamp_created":1521266165,"timestamp_updated":1608706871,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.466804981231689453","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ47dmZx/YCcMrxmwE="}
