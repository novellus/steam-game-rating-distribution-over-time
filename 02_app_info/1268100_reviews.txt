The graphics are pretty and have a storybook quality.  The controls were largely good, although playing as Jonathan (the character with the crossbow), I noted that there are moments in the game where I was trying to aim and having some difficulty getting the shots to register.  The worst offender here is the dragonfly ring, which you need to be very close to to shoot and which the mage player told me he had limited control over using his psychic ability, which meant the dragonfly kept wiggling.  Given that Jonathan cannot aim above his head past a certain point, it was marginally frustrating to have to keep backing up to try to get a lock on the dragonfly ring while the dragonfly was moving erratically.\n\nSpeaking of the dragonfly, as mentioned, there are times Jonathan has to grapple on to its ring and then be moved around in flight to shoot things.  This is a fun mechanic, but it also started making me a bit motion sick.  Your mileage may vary.\n\nAs for combat, all of the enemies are highlighted in white when you scroll over them.  This continues even after they are dead.  Given that you have to fight clumps of enemies at a time, I found this confusing at times and periodically caught myself shooting dead enemies.  I would prefer it if the white highlight disappeared upon enemy death to make it clearer which enemies are still alive given how chaotic combat against large groups can get.\n\nJonathan's crossbow does not have any weight to it.  The sound it makes when firing is rather soft and weak, and there is no feeling of recoil.  I often found myself wondering if my shots were landing or doing anything outside of the few moments where he would comment on it with a voice line such as, \"bulls eye!\"\n\nAll of the puzzles have numbered signs indicating the order in which to solve them.  I feel this does the experience a great disservice and deprives the players of the opportunity to solve the puzzles themselves.  There was no problem solving required at all as we dutifully went from sign to sign.  I strongly recommend the devs reconsider this approach and allow players to work through puzzles together without the hand-holding. \n\nThe subtitles (in English, anyway) had some typos and strange punctuation in places, but I'm sure that will be ironed out before release.\n\nThe guy playing Sersi, the bear, had a great time and had zero complaints.  It did feel as if he and I were more useful than Almika overall, and the guy playing Almika did stop to complain at one point that we were doing almost everything and all he did was mind control a few snails and dragonflies.  I hope this will be more balanced at some point.\n\nOverall, we had a great time. I look forward to the finished release!","timestamp_created":1609266390,"timestamp_updated":1609369939,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4w4372vYCfvPCvgI="}
