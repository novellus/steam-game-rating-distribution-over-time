It's easy to understand, easy to pick up and great for new players. The shots have great flow and you find yourself discovering modes by not specifically aiming for things. The table does a great job of guiding you through. Kickbacks are easy to light resulting in very long play sessions. Great for a chilled afternoon where you want to relax and play some Pinball!\n\nParanormal - This is a really unique table. The modes are confusing and hard to access but after a while of playing you'll figure out what this table wants from you. My only gripe is there's not many modes. Yes there is a lot to do, but when you've seen the wizard mode you've more or less exhausted all their is to see. Love the vertical playfield though. Definitely worth a look. Lots of people seem to like it, so there's clearly something right.\n\nEarth Defense - This is my personal favourite in the pack. I wasn't quite sure what was going on when I first played it and couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do. There's no \"mission\" hole as such, although the drop targets under the robot kind of act as one. Start racking up combos and exploring the table and you'll start seeing modes unlock and appear. There's some really intense multiball in here and some really really nice flow to the layout. I love this pin, it's one of my favourite Zen original tables.\n\nGet this pack on offer for sure. It drops below 50% quite frequently. They're all very high quality pins if you like pinball, and Zen definitely deserve supporting. Sure these are old tables, but they play really nicely!","timestamp_created":1608763214,"timestamp_updated":1608763214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi9HwyPYCeL/NvAI="}
