    review: 'Apocalypse is not a bad expansion. It''s actually really good. The ''mixed''
      review score you see is primarily because, when this expansion was released,
      vast changes to Stellaris''s gameplay were added.


      See, pre-Apocalypse (or, pre-2.0 update) borders, fleet composition, resource
      management--quite a lot of things--were entirely different. Apocalypse formalized
      Stellaris as a more hard-coded strategy game where proper planning, management,
      and skill is necessary (whereas previously you could pool all of your minerals
      into building one huge ass fleet to steamroll anything in your path).


      Apocalypse, aside from the change it brought with the corresponding 2.0 update,
      adds a new ship class: the Titan, with the borderline game-breaking Colossus
      which is overkill, but extremely well executed. I don''t care if its overpowered
      or underpowered or expensive or cheap--having multiple planet-killing weapons
      (or even planet-sterilizing weapons, which is an option) is just flatly cool.


      Additionally, the Unity ambitions allow for Unity (a resource that eventually
      becomes useless once all tradition trees have been gone through) to be useful
      in the late game.


      Apocalypse isn''t my favorite expansion, but it certainly isn''t bad.'
