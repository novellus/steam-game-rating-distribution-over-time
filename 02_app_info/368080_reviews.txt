The gameworld is a two dimensional setting, which the player can explore. Six surrounding continents must be visited to forge an alliance against his brother-in-law. Combat is in real-time, like a brawler. The game puts emphasis on making combos to defeat enemies. The player character Enzo can summon [i]Aurion[/i], an ancient energy, which can be used in Aurionic modes, allowing for powerful abilities. The player can unlock greater abilities and increase their power as he develops and continues on his journey to defeat his brother-in law, save his Kingdom Zama and become one with the Kori-Odan.\n\nThe game feels like a throw back to games that we loved as kids. I told one of my good friends after putting 9 hours into it, I wish we had this 30 years ago when I played Nintendo, back in the 80's. It is comparable to [i]Tales of Destiny, Dust:An Elysian Tail,[/i] with combat that is reminiscent to Street Fighter and Double Dragon. The story is great, albeit I do think they should hire an editor to make a few updates on the dialogue so it can flow smoother. There are quite a bit of typos, but the writers are Cameroonian so I understand. I still think the story is awesome. \n\n[u]About the protagonists[/u]\nEnzo is naive at first, ala Luke Skywalker. Not understanding his potential. His teacher is dark and reminds me a lot of Mace Windu, a female version that can balance her mind and do what is necessary for the Kori-Odan; even if it means putting down the people of Zama who interfere with her protection of Enzo. Then there is the Queen, Erine. She is loyal and persuasive, everything you want in a woman, if you are a King of course.  \n\n[u]This is what we need in the future of gaming[/u]\nImagine a 3D world, where the fantasy setting is structured like Africa. For so long we have been programmed to embrace European and Asian fantasy where the protagonist is Caucasian and the antagonist is Black and most likely a coward. This is why Enzo is special. He is African and he is a hero, with nobility, pride and great skills. I personally would like to see this game expand and become bigger. It has great lore already and history that can be developed into something like Elder Scrolls or the Witcher. Elder Scrolls started off as 2d, something to consider. I went ahead and bought three copies and gifted it to two of my close friends. I hope more people support this project, so that we can see more Black faces in the fantasy genre.","timestamp_created":1609871690,"timestamp_updated":1609872378,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwieH36fYCdfnjwAI="}
