Imagine being in an intense shootout with your rival when suddenly a random NPC comes out and tries to mug you. Then a driveby rolls through and shoots at all of you at the same time. It's these random moments that bring humor to the game in the midst of chaotic explosions and steady streams of gunfire. Don't buy this game to play by yourself. If, on the other hand, you have one to three friends to play with, I'd definitely recommend picking it up. I'm hoping they add more maps and weapons in the future, but in the mean time there's enough content with three different game modes to keep you and your friends amused for a while.
