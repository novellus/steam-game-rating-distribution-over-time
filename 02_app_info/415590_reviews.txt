Would only recommend if its on sale because its nothing spectacular.. Although I do appreciate the sense of humor, they have a map called \"sunnyvale\" with an actual trailer park in it, plus theres a part on that same map where you run through the sewers and you\"ll come across a red balloon. Soo they get a thumbs up just for that alone lol...","timestamp_created":1609819118,"timestamp_updated":1609819118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm8us6PYCco/MwAI="}
