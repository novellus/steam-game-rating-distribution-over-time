There is very barely a plot going on in the background where people on the radio tell you stuff and you just sit there listening while shooting zombies and running around the map chasing down bubbles that protect you. It's dumb, not fun, and the voice acting is pretty awful.\n\n[b]Now why is this DLC sort of a scam?[/b] Because the main draw is going to be the bot mode, since there is very clearly no one playing this game. However, [b]you can do a bot match without owning the upgrade DLC[/b] by searching for a match for 2 minutes (when matchmaking finally gives up). It will then throw you into a bot match (you can tell they're all bots because on the scoreboard they have no ping and extremely dumb). \n\nSure, you can't choose the mode or level, but it saves you from paying for a hilariously overpriced $20 DLC that only really offers the ability to choose the map/mode, as well as a painfully boring and short wave-based mode.","timestamp_created":1566295622,"timestamp_updated":1574723486,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540634512901306152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk7C10u4Cd7bb0AE="}
