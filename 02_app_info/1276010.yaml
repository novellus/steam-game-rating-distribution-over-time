    about_the_game: "<strong>X-OUT is a game of strategic action, but yet very simple.</strong><br><br>You\
      \ must dodge all the Xs thrown your way in a matter of seconds, and if you intend\
      \ to survive the game, you must do this with great strategy, as those who don\u2019\
      t will be X-ED OUT and Game Over. <br><br>Climb your way up the pyramid, and\
      \ learn to dodge the Xs with great talent as you will need it to make it through\
      \ the game.<br><br>In X-OUT, they are three levels of gameplay to do this:<br><strong>A\
      \ Tutorial Level.</strong><br>This level is designed in black and white, with\
      \ colors out of the way of distraction, to get you used to the game by moving\
      \ the character using the arrow keys. <br><br>This is to assist your build-up\
      \ to the strategy needed to complete the game.<br><br><strong>The 2nd Level.\
      \ Full of Strategy.</strong><br>The 2nd level of the game is also in black and\
      \ white, and is also the last non-color level of the game. <br><br>This level\
      \ will use the mouse or trackpad to dodge the X-like enemies, thus be careful\
      \ where you move your character: one wrong move into an X and game over.<br><br><strong>Level\
      \ 3. Strategy Gone Mad.</strong><br>The 3rd level of X-OUT is the first color\
      \ level, and it's themed out in green. <br><br>With cross-obstacles and X-like\
      \ enemies gone wild all over, this is the hardest level to survive, but when\
      \ you've made it through, you've completed X-OUT and can do it all over again\
      \ to beat your score every time around."
