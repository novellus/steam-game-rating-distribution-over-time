    review: "Well... Where do we start here?\n\nI understand these are early tables,\
      \ I think they were ones released with Pinball FX2 back in the day (so not quite\
      \ as old as Excalibur or Earth Defense, but around that era) and the polish\
      \ isn't QUITE up to zens usual standard. There are 2 very good and fun tables\
      \ here, and 2 quirky and strange tables that could be either seen as challenging\
      \ or \"bad\" depending on your level of patience.\n\nEl Dorado:\nBest table\
      \ in this pack. Lots of multiball to have fun with here and a number of exciting\
      \ modes. Hidden sinkholes, and even a skeleton pops up for a short \"battle\"\
      \ at times too. If it wasn't for the totem pole this could easily be a real\
      \ table. El Dorado is challenging, but it rewards you for exploring all aspects\
      \ of the table.\n\nTesla:\nThis table seems to be fairly split in the community.\
      \ I for one love it. Its a beautiful table with a steampunk aesthetic. Starting\
      \ missions is challenging and the missions themselves can be downright mean.\
      \ Some of the shots are hard to find (The tesla coil ramp in particular is extremely\
      \ nasty to locate) but I find beating modes extremely satisfying because of\
      \ this. Be patient and you'll find yourself enjoying it.\n\nShaman:\nI'm in\
      \ two minds about this table. It looks horrible, and the soundtrack contains\
      \ recycled guitar samples from V12 (or vice versa, it's a chicken/egg situation).\
      \ At first glance it's difficult to figure out exactly what to do. But you have\
      \ to light \"element\" by hitting all the standups on the raised playfield.\
      \ This will then allow you to select an \"element\" to essentially massacre\
      \ a native tribe with... weird, right? Be it flooding them, burning them with\
      \ lava, scaring them with an earthquake or blowing them away with a tornado.\
      \ It's kinda messed up. However the inclusion of the 3 whirligigs creates for\
      \ some tense shots and difficult situations. Honestly, I'd probably rate this\
      \ table higher if the left hand scoop wasn't so difficult to hit. Doesn't matter\
      \ how much I play this table, I will ALWAYS struggle to hit that scoop, which\
      \ is required with every \"element\" mode. For all its faults though, Shaman\
      \ is definitely worth checking out.\n\nV12:\nNow here is my biggest issue with\
      \ this pack. I'm not sure why but the physics on this table seems absolutely\
      \ wacky. The flow is completely messed up. For some weird reason, if the ball\
      \ hits the top of the bumpers next to the flippers it will more or less stop\
      \ dead. It's really jarring and makes for an extremely odd play session where\
      \ you sort of never really know what the ball is going to do. It feels normal\
      \ on the flippers but almost like a soft ball when it's interacting with the\
      \ table as if it absorbs all impact. The table itself is interesting, there's\
      \ a lot to look at and a lot to discover. However, everything requires extremely\
      \ precise shots in extremely small time frames, so most situations are missed\
      \ opportunities. With new physics and ruleset/code this table could actually\
      \ be pretty damn fun. \n\nThis is definitely a \"sale\" purchase. Half price\
      \ it's definitely worth it. But at full? Nah. Not unless they fix a few things\
      \ on V12 and considering it's been around since Pinball FX2, I highly doubt\
      \ that they will."
