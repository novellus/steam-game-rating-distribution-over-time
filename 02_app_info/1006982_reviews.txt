You will NOT see anything in your DLC folder besides a EULA. I DON'T think this will overwrite anything, but I'm not sure.[/b]\n\nThe clothing in this pack is mostly what I would call fetish/hostess wear, with a couple of fancy bikinis thrown in. Now, if your game heavily involves such an environment, I would recommend this pack. If you just want to clothe a few background NPCs there are better options, though. \nBuy this only if you want a wide variety of that type of clothing, or if you're making a game where you want your main characters to be able to choose between a variety of outfits. If you're making a Life Sim or Eroge game this is a good choice. Otherwise.. check out one of the other packs that have more casual wear.","timestamp_created":1608919548,"timestamp_updated":1608919548,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhoDFzfYCc96PvQI="}
