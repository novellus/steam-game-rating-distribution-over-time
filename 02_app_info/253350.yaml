    review: 'Tiny Barbarian DX has a lot going for it, but it unfortunately suffers
      a lot from misconception of what really matters in a good platformer.


      On the plus side, the artistic direction is lovely. Landscapes and enemy sprites
      are gorgeous, and the game has a wide variety of settings for the player to
      enjoy. Most importantly, it has an amazing soundtrack. There''s lots of themes,
      drawing primarily from the 8-bit scene, and they''re just so good. It''s definitely
      a musical masterpiece. Also, props for managing to capture that well the spirit
      of Castlevania''s musical ambiance in Act 3.


      Now apart from the mostly ok level design, there are numerous major issues going
      on on the gameplay side. I did not mind regular enemies'' patterns as much as
      most bad reviews around. To me, the trick generally comes down to understanding
      the right timings for attacking and backing off. The real problem for me is
      the actual combat mechanics. 1) You devs seriously need to stop with combo attacks.
      If you can''t do it right, having only one regular attack will do just fine,
      and nobody''s gonna complain about it. 2) The sword lacks range, plain and simple.
      An extra bit of range would have avoided unnecessary frustration, as a lot of
      the time, when you land a hit on an enemy, you''re gonna get hit as well for
      ramming into its hurtbox, even though you had an attack timing that would be
      more than correct in a lot of platformers.


      The platforming also has a massive cheap punishment potential. The game requires
      a clear input from you to grab ladders and ledges, so 1) maintaining the up
      direction won''t work, resulting in a small time loss in both horizontal and
      vertical progress, which the sometimes really tight level design is going to
      punish hard. 2) it''s up for ladders and forward for ledges. Given the massive
      amount of stuff you need to grab in this game, this is inevitably leading to
      moments of confusion when you''ll be falling for a cheap reason. 3) You need
      to be prepared to miss an occasional grab, there again leading to a lot of frustration,
      due to both a sometimes overly demanding level design and a sometimes ridiculous
      number of consecutive grabs to pull off.

      Basically, this game manages to make an issue of something that should be intuitive
      and unnoticeable.


      Now when it comes to the bosses, it''s a fiasco. First, almost every single
      boss in the game has a ton of health. Not a problem in se, but given they''re
      always either very easy once you figured out their patterns, or still pretty
      hard, either because there''s a lot of RNG and stuff flying around at the same
      time, or they have a shield and let you attack once every blue moon, it''s just
      boring and unrewarding. Not to mention the fact that your character''s rather
      slow and has a teeny tiny range, which makes most boss fights tedious on its
      own. Also, most bosses have downright uninteresting patterns. Some of them are
      just not creative, and others overuse gimmicks that would belong in a shmup
      rather than a platformer (fighting a flying boss on moving platforms is fine
      [i]once in a while[/i]. It''s fun when it''s unexpected, but it''s not a clever
      pattern at all, especially when they''re moving fast in spiral-shaped rotations
      while a massive hurtbox in the middle of the stage keeps firing homing bullets
      at you. Yes, that''s the final boss, and it was a major letdown.)


      Despite a big yes on the audio side, I can''t recommend this game. It''s not
      a unique experience, only a mediocre platformer (and a damned overpriced one,
      on top of that.)'
