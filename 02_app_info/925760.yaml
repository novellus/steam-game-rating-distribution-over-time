    review: 'I went ahead and purchased this DLC. Mostly to help support the development
      of the game.


      It is nice to be able to pick the other races and have more options to customize
      the looks of my character as I get my devotion up.


      The good thing is that nothing actually helps your character in any way. So
      the game is not  pay to win.


      The bad though is that often other players will not even see what you look like
      because you are completly covered in armor a good majority of the time. This
      probalby limits the amount of players that would be willing purchase this strictly
      cosmetic DLC. But they say there will be other DLC in the future. So hopefully
      those will have more purchasing appeal.


      I would recomend the DLC for those that already play the game and have their
      devotion up. Since they will be able to enjoy the game more fully. However new
      players really have no need to purchase early on. They can just play and enjoy
      the game. Then later purchase if they find themselves wanting more customizations
      once they have their devotion up.
