    review: 'Really wish you could change the controls in this game. This game has
      a really awkward control scheme for me. It''s not a bad game, and I think that
      if you master the controls it would be a moderately enjoyable, albeit a little
      stiff, game. Enemies in this game aren''t hard, it is just hard to control yourself
      while fighting them off at times. The platform placement is good, but once again
      the controls are your worst enemy, and it is just frustrating to do. This thing
      was like $0.50 so what can be expected. I might come back to this, but dang.


      *Edit* - I''d recommend it if you want to show it to your friends as a joke
      or something(what I''ve been doing), but it still stands. I finished it and
      it would have taken even longer if I hadn''t accidentally stumbled across a...
      negative lives glitch? Idk if it is intentional or not, but I just stood in
      place for a while and it activated on me. Worth the amount I paid for it, but
      no more than that.'
