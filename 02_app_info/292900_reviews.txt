Troop customization is decent as well and another part I enjoy. The multiple ways of ending a session are rather impressive.\n\nNote: Missed that this was for one of the dlc","timestamp_created":1471477742,"timestamp_updated":1590145862,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.414818286895751953","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwl4mFnvICcOCmXw=="}
