Ludicrous Speed seems to have all of these attributes present. I love that the player environments react to whatever music I want to play. Keep in mind that this game is still in its early stages, yet is still at the top of its performance in this genre. \n\nDefinitely keep your eyes on this one. I can see some sweet advancements in the near future. Regardless of which, Ludicrous Speed will not fail in providing hours of challenging entertainment.\n\n-OG","timestamp_created":1551167448,"timestamp_updated":1552369169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556162536144256592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4praauOkCcYbsuwE="}
