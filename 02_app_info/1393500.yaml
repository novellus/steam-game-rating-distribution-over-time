      \ loot that will help you on this run or find meta currency and items which\
      \ are used to upgarde your heroes after the run.\n\nThese heroe upgrades are\
      \ the part where the game truly shines and are split into two parts. \nSkill\
      \ upgardes and Relics. \nThose upgrades range from boring like increased dmg\
      \ to exiting like my hero can to that now?\nWith both of themhowever you have\
      \ to choose which of you heroes gets this valubale item which then can no longer\
      \ be used. And so the tinkering which heroes gets what item and which skill\
      \ should be improved is quite interesting.\n\nOverall i would recommend this\
      \ game to anyone that likes the leveling and battling aspect of Jrpgs, and likes\
      \ discovering new and intersting heroes.\n\n"
