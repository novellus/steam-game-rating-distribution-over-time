    review: 'I kept shelving and retrying this game over like 5 years, always forgetting
      why I stopped playing it before digging it out of the rubble of my steam library
      a year later and then getting frustrated, deinstalling it and repeating the
      cycle. Now, I am leaving a review so I can actually lay this game to rest properly
      and remember just why I stopped playing it.


      Long story short: the RNG is unbearable and the AI is too unforgiving. This
      game essentially has you play a mix of solitaire and poker against an AI and,
      to spice things up a bit, you can use power cards as well to turn the tide.
      The problem is that the AI simply never ever lets you play any move that may
      be advantageous for you, as it constantly steals useful cards the moment it
      sees them. The reason this happens is that every "player" gets 3 moves in one
      turn, and thus the AI constantly ruins your plans the moment they seem to come
      to fruition.


      That combined with the card appearance RNG just makes the game very frustrating.
      You are essentially fighting a battle on two fronts; on one front, you hope
      for RNG to give you the right cards to make good combinations with and that
      you can securely tuck away in a combination before the AI can steal it; on the
      other front, you fight an AI that always goes for the best available combinations
      anyway while ruining your day. It is a battle only won with a lot of luck and
      patience, but sadly, it is not very fun. While the presentation of the game
      is intriguing, it is simply not worth going through the struggle.'
