      \ /><br><br>Signal Ops is a played in a first-person perspective, but when you're\
      \ playing a mission you actually simultaneously control multiple agents, each\
      \ with their own first-person view. You'll need to take advantage of the multiple\
      \ views to keep an eye on key areas, formulate strategies to complete your goals,\
      \ and solve puzzles that require you to be in more than one place at a time.\
      \ With the shoddy equipment and dubiously trained agents provided to you, you\u2019\

      \ /><br><br>Signal Ops blends elements of a tactical shooter, stealth, strategy,\
      \ and puzzle solving. Your squad can be customized each mission by selecting\
      \ from six agents with unique abilities and equipment. Some agents are geared\
      \ towards sneaky play, and others are more combat oriented. You'll usually find\
      \ yourself using a mix of both stealth and combat, and this can also vary depending\
      \ on the mission.<br><br>A lot of elements in Signal Ops have a hardcore, old-school\
      \ appeal to them. For example: you will often need to use your map to plan your\
      \ moves in open levels, and health does not magically regenerate. Don't worry\
      \ though, agents are a dime a dozen. As long as you still have an agent alive,\
      \ you can call in reinforcements to replace those unlucky ones that had too\
      \ much lead for breakfast.<br><br>The radio is where the signal in Signal Ops\
