Welp, game is not smart, so you had to \"Re-invite\" partners after one mission n another\n\n2) This game is kidda Underrated, so it can be hard to find people to play with\n\n*Conclusion? This game is fun with friends, if you want a Terminator top down shooter game, this is for you 7/10","timestamp_created":1583158381,"timestamp_updated":1607486183,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495867758989334106","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45ZLpovYCfPDZ9QE="}
