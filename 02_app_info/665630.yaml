    review: 'I''ve come to always expect great physics-based challenges from Polyart.
      This game is no different. It starts you off easy, makes you feel confident,
      and then the RNG gods rain down their hellfire on you. You will curse and scream
      and you will watch your retries skyrocket. But then, somehow, against all odds,
      you will win and you will feel like a true marble master. Then the next level
      comes. The later levels are not for the faint of heart. I would LOVE to see
      someone attempt to speed run this game at gdq.


      I''d love for there to be some way to gauge how much tougher (denser?) the opponent
      marbles are. While there are shadows, it''d be cool if there was always a shadow
      directly underneath your marble so if you are flying around in the air you know
      exactly where you will fall down.


      I recommend this game to anyone who loves a casual game that can become surprisingly
      challenging very quickly.'
