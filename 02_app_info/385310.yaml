    about_the_game: Imagine you're 8 years old and you have a little sister who's
      6. You wake up one morning to discover your bedroom has been transported to
      a strange world. Odd looking plants have grown through the floor while you slept
      and an unsettling fog surrounds you. Outside you see a complicated path, and
      massive creatures made of stone. A feeling strikes you, you have read about
      this place many times. You rush to your bookshelf and pull down a book called
      The Land Of Lamia. You quickly turn to the chapter that describes where you're
      at and start looking for clues about how to survive. <br><br>Each new level
      has a new picture and description of the world from the book of Lamia. Use the
      book to learn about the world and solve the puzzles. Control the characters
      Lily and Thomas using a unique control system. Learn about why you're there
      and what eerie presence may be watching you.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/385310/extras/PagePromo.jpg?t=1458954759"
      /><br><br>(Developers note, <br><br>The Land Of Lamia is a story driven puzzle
      adventure game. However, the story revolves around two characters (Lily and
      Thomas) who you'll be controlling simultaneously  with a unique mechanic. As
      expected, the players who like this mechanic, Love it! and would like it to
      be harder and emphasized, others find it colorfully frustrating. Eddy Games
      is very interested in constructive feedback both positive and negative but respectful.)
