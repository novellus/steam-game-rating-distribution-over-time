    about_the_game: You play a pre-historic caveman, your ultimate objective... to
      survive!   Explore a massive seamless open world, forage for food, hunt animals,
      and use the complex, realistic crafting system to build new, better and stronger
      items.  Work together with other players to form a community, form a village,
      and to cooperate and grow as a group!  Vantage is a game I have been working
      on for many years now, and it is the game I have always wanted to play.   Since
      it didn't exist, I decided to create it!  So I hope you enjoy playing it as
      much as I enjoy creating it!<br><br><strong>Some examples of what you can do
      in the game:</strong><br>- Craft a large number of objects to help you survive.  Everything
      from sharp stones, to campfires so you don't freeze at night, to primitive huts
      to live in!<br>- Find wild plants, take their seeds and plant crops to become
      more self-sustaining.<br>- Create some clothes to keep yourself warm and well
      protected by skinning dead animals and tanning the hides by going through a
      realistic primitive leather working process.<br>- And much, much more!<br><br><strong>Realistic
      and complex crafting system - </strong>Vantage has a in-depth, well researched
      crafting system using the actual items you need to craft items in the real world.  For
      example, if you wish to build a fire using a hand drill, you need to find the
      right stick to use as a spindle, create a piece of hearth wood, and forage for
      some tinder.  Then if you are skillful enough, you can make your fire!<br><br><strong>Hardcore
      survival / player customization - </strong>Make sure you forage for that food
      or grow some crops, for when you die, your character is gone!  But don't despair,
      when your characters die they earn &quot;player points&quot; you can use to
      re-customize you next character by buying starting items and boosting your starting
      skills so you can try anew!<br><br><strong>Skill-based character progression
      with many professions -</strong> You can try to specialize in one of the many
      professions, or try to master them all!  Some examples are hunting, fishing,
      leatherworking and farming.  You can also become a master bone, wood, or stone
      maker to help other people's professions along.  Work together with other players
      to make items faster and stronger.<br><br><strong>Interact with every item in
      the world - </strong>No more playing a game where trees and rocks are just fancy
      artwork!  You can harvest wood from every tree, and pick up every rock you see!<br><br><strong>Custom
      game engine creating massive seamless randomly generated worlds - </strong>The
      game uses a custom 3D game engine I created called VantEdit.  It generates and
      renders massively sized worlds of any size I choose, and you get to explore
      them.  Walk in a single direction and you will circumnavigate the globe with
      no loading screens.<br><br><strong><u>The game's current development state:</u></strong><br><br><strong>What
      is completed (of course these will be constantly improved and updated):</strong><br>-
      <u>The Game's engine:</u>( rendering/ seamless world mechanics etc ). I have
      refined the engine to be a great vessel in which to create the game. I have
      spent years on it and helps to give the game the feel it needed to have.<br>-
      <u>Game Play Mechanics:</u> The game play system is fully implemented as intended,
      has been tested and is fully playable. Again this only means that the core elements
      have been completed and I am of course working on improving all aspects of the
      game.  This includes UI framework, Crafting, Skills and Item design, etc...<br>-
      <u>Networking conversion:</u> This took many years, but I am proud to say that
      the online version of the game is fully stable.  The game now also supports
      offline servers (for playing single-player), and player hosted dedicated servers
      that can be publicly displayed to all players around the world.<br>- <u>The
      Game's Editor tools:</u>  Though this is not currently available to players
      yet, the game's editor is designed to add in new crafts, items and skills easily
      into the game, as I develop the game I add in new skills, new items, and new
      crafts into the game. Even though I call this a primitive survival game, I plan
      to continue to add new content to the game constantly! What does this mean?
      Well at a certain point I will add in archery, more complex farming mechanics,
      more building types etc... <br><br><strong>What will be added in the near future:</strong><br>-
      <u>PvP:</u> Once the game has been sufficiently tested, I will be finishing
      the PvP aspect of the game.<br>- <u>More server hosting options:</u> Players
      who wish to host servers will be able to customize their servers to more specific
      needs and preferences (making hardcore-only servers, etc...)<br>- <u>Access
      to VantEdit world editor:</u> Players will be able to host servers with their
      own procedural generated worlds.  They will have the ability to create nearly
      any size world with the ability to change temperatures, land and continent formations,
      and much more.  This functionality will be later in development, most likely
      after the full launch.<br><br><strong>What can be improved:</strong><br>- <u>Artwork:</u>
      Many of the graphics you see in game are my own &quot;programmer art&quot;,
      simple yet useful art I create in a short amount of time. There are works of
      art done by professionals in the industry as well however. One goal of hopefully
      getting the game into Early Access is to hire back some of these artists to
      get the artwork more professional.<br>- <u>Animation system and attachments:</u>
      Upgrading the animation system to have it so you can customize you character's
      physical attributes, actually see objects like shoes and hats being worn on
      a character etc.  As well as have more player models and customization.<br><br><br><br><strong><u>Future
      Plans for the Game</u></strong><br><br>The content I can continue to add will
      never stop! I will run out of primitive technologies and keep moving forward,
      one item, craft, or skill at a time. So how far can I go? Will the game's technology
      get to the Roman Era? Medieval? Industrial Era? Modern Era? The game is a constantly
      evolving, ever changing universe that you exist in. It just all depends on people
      like you who I hope like, support, and enjoy the idea behind this game.

    review: "I do recommend this game, but it is not for everyone! \nIt's more of\
      \ a survivor-simulator, and there is alot of grind. \nHaving said that, I have\
      \ never been so proud of crafting different objects in a game before, as I am\
      \ in this one. It's not hard really, it just takes abit of work setting everything\
      \ up, learning skills and raising stats. Played 9 hours and I've just completed\
      \ my first gear - a grass belt. \n\nAnd I'm very proud of that grass belt."
