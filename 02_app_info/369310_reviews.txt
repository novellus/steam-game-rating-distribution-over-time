This is styled very much like those games but there is no character progression, no army/party building, no skills, etc. TBS game maybe, rpg definitely not. \n\nThis is really a puzzle game using some mechanics from tactics style games. Think of it like playing challenge mode in chess games. There is a board setup and you basically have to figure out a strategy to solve it. \n\nGeneral graphics/audio: Very barebones, you basically get to toggle fullscreen, lighting & shadows (I have no idea why in the hell anybody would turn off lighting and shadows unless they were trying to run this on a rig from 20 years ago), music and sfx. The game is locked to 60fps but I'm not even sure 60 is necessary considering what is happening. \n\nStory: Somewhat amusing story which I did not expect at all. I don't mean an actual plot because there is barely a story, there aren't really characters and stuff but the overarching narrative basically makes fun of tactics style games. Every couple of centuries sky-people who aren't really sky people go into a world where everybody is getting along and just makes them all fight on these square floating islands for their amusement. It's accompanied with little bits of text at the start of every level that are somewhat amusing. \n\nGameplay: Very straightforward tactics-style mechanics thrown into a puzzle. Units move on a grid, they have basic stats and attack stuff, enemies have movement preferences and if you mouse over them it shows exactly where the enemy will go. Some boards have a very specific way to beat and is basically trial and error. Most of the time a wrong move will ruin everything and you gotta restart or hit the turn back button. One mechanic I'd definitely recommend turning off is the one where when enemies attack your units it pauses the game and you have to click for the attack to go through. Since you can't press the turn back button this serves no real purpose, units move  quickly and there's no actual need to see when the enemy attacks, if it does and you didn't know it was coming odds are you f*cked up. \n\nMy main complaint would be the weird difficulty curve(?). With most puzzle games you expect it to start easy and then slowly and consistently ramp up until it is ridiculously hard. With Monstro the difficulty goes up and down, every once in a while you hit a hard level but in between them are levels that are not only much easier but also don't require a specific way to solve (a lot of the easier ones just require you to gather your guys up and wait for the enemy to walk in and get slaughtered). \n\nOverall: Would recommend as a casual strategy/puzzle game. If you are looking for a new Tactics Ogre/Final Fantasy Tactics then this is definitely not for you unfortunately. There is decent enough value for the money, The first Human wing took me about an hour and there is a monster wing and a ++ wing for both races.","timestamp_created":1449242821,"timestamp_updated":1602110130,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":42,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.779235005378723145","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9ZDNgvUCeqGnSg=="}
