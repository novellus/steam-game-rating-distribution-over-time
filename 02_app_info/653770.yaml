    review: I am enjoying this game quite a lot and have noticed that there is only
      one review. While I have not finished this title (I am stuck at the moment)
      I have enjoyed it enough that I felt motivated to leave my thoughts on it here.
      While not a horror game per se it does have a creepy atmosphere that will allow
      you to get sucked in if you let it. The game-play is pretty standard rpg maker
      fare and reminds me a bit of Final Fantasy 4 in terms of interface outside of
      combat and early Dragon Quest games in combat.  However you are able to make
      literal life or death decisions that seem to have an impact on the story as
      a whole. There are puzzles aplenty in this game and a wrong decision can cause
      instant death. I would advise saving often to avoid frustration, As a whole
      though this is a good game that more people should give a try. My review is
      not complete  but merely a placeholder that I will leave here until I have completed
      my play through.
