    review: For a game that's a couple of bucks. This is not too bad. Sure, the level
      editor is very limited and you can complete the campaign in under a hour or
      less. You can easily dodge The Phantom if you just go around him when he gets
      close. This is like the only horror game where you can customize your surroundings.
      In other games, the developers just either make you have to code your own or
      they aren't targeting horror audiences. So, since this is the only game like
      that out there, It's definitely something to buy if you can't code or are looking
      for a time killer with just barely any replayability, which stinks but I guess
      no game can last forever
