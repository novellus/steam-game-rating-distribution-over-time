However, it becomes apparent that not everything is as it seems as Jake is soon caught in some kind of dark mystery.\n\n Pros:\n\tVery simple controls\n\tPuzzles to solve\n\tPuzzles range from easy to hard\n\tA mystery unfolds as you play\n\nCons:\n\tFairly linear\n\tFairly short game\n\tThe one and only ending was unsatisfactory\n\tYour choices don't really matter\n\nThe story is fairly solid although I have to acknowledge, I did deduce what was about to happen. With that said, I wasn't too surprised when it came time for the big reveal. However, some of the details I did overlook, which led me to not trust someone when I should have trusted them. Nevertheless, your choices don't really matter. The story is going to unfold in a very narrow field. \n\nSince this is a text adventure game, there is no real graphics to talk about, all the same, there are some impressionist drawing to give the player an idea of what they are looking at which is nice.\n\nI did enjoy this game, but I have to say the ending was very disappointing. I sat in front of my computer, shaking my head and muttering to myself, “Well, that sucks”.\n\nAt the time of this review, Shady Brook was selling for $2.99. It took me 12 hours to complete this game (including getting all of the achievements). 12 hours vs $2.99, this game is definitely worth it","timestamp_created":1608414638,"timestamp_updated":1608414638,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1608437517,"developer_response":"Thank you for your review, Andi!  Just to note for clarification that the story is not over.  This is part of an ongoing series of games with an overarching plot, and both the town of Shady Brook--and the ending to which you are referring--will be addressed in the future.  Without spoiling anything, let me just say that this end is not necessarily THE end. :-)"}],"cursor":"AoJw+/W+vvYCdPTEuwI="}
