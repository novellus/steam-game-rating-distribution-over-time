I do. There are some issues I have with the game. \nFirstly, I am not sure how well the game works on other devices but on the Oculus, the actual pointers for the remotes are too far up, and my remotes seem to be just fine.\nSecondly, the way you spin the cube is WAY too finicky. If you could possibly have some way of holding the cube while trying to move your hands without spinning it, like integrating the triggers on remotes, that would be nice.\nAlthough these issues are small, I would like to point out that this game costed [b]$9.00[/b]. This is a [b]great[/b] concept for a virtual reality puzzle game, but when two things that are essential to the gameplay are not working, I cannot in a truthful manner recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1552090417,"timestamp_updated":1552090417,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49ojzr+kCfsXOvAE="}
