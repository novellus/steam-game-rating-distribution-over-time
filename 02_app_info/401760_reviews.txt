The gameplay is very fun and I really liked the game. It's a strategy game with a very uncommon gameplay.\n\nAlthough I enjoyed playing the game there are multiple things which could have been better:\n* More balanced levels: Some are very easy and some are very hard\n* Less escort missions: There are far too many missions where some ships have to be defended\n* Move-Commands for the ships to escort: They simply stay in place although many ships are approaching it\n* More focus on the characters: Although there is a rather nice main story, the characters involved are not relevant or interesting at all\n* Replayability of some levels: After beating the game it would be nice to see if some level was skipped or to have the option to retry a specific level to try another tactic or to try it on the harder difficulty level\n* More distinctive ship-models: It's very hard to see if something is a mine-layer, a bomber, an artillery or just a simple fighter","timestamp_created":1609536527,"timestamp_updated":1609536719,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ian33/YCe9TCvwI="}
