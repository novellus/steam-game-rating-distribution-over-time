    about_the_game: <strong>AN EXCITING ACTION PACKED ADVENTURE WITH A DEEP AND DARK
      STORY...</strong><br><br>Following the story of the three main characters Theodore,
      Vander, and Evana, an airplane flight disaster causes them to teleport to an
      odd universe simply called the Island. The Island has been taken over by a rebellious
      phantom-like leader who has a major rivalry against the former Island leader.
      As the new comers and the last people to come, you must defeat the phantom known
      as Inevit. Although Inevit looks like your typical red-eyed ghost-like villain,
      he doesn't act like your typical enemy; Though he is smart and logical, going
      against his beliefs is something he will not tolerate... <br><br><strong>A MYSTERIOUS
      WORLD WITH AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE WAY OF LIFE</strong><br><br>Explore the humongous
      open-world, talk to characters (who may or may not hurt you), craft weapons,
      cook items, discover locations, and expand your army of colonists. Find mysterious
      relics and loot chests to receive items, and use your base to feed yourself
      and repair your equipment. Take head, a lack of logic and the absence of a resourceful
      strategy may be your greatest enemy.<br><br><strong>BATTLE YOUR ENEMIES WITH
      A STRATEGIC COMBAT SYSTEM OF RISKS, PREDICTION, AND RESOURCEFULNESS</strong><br><br>Change
      the flow of the story by fighting anyone you see as a threat, whether is be
      simple soldiers or a main character. Equip weapons to expand your attack options,
      then take turns between each ally and enemy until you claim victory or die trying.
      With many available strategies to win with, find what fighting style suits your
      party and capitalize on the necessary resource for triumph.<br><br><strong>
      THE SMALLEST CHOICES CAN CHANGE THE WHOLE OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME!</strong><br><br>Though
      you have little freedom of what you choose, the choices you DO make are huge!
      These choices could include the smallest to biggest things, from entering a
      house to beginning a genocide.<br><br>The biggest decision you make is your
      ideas of morals. Whether you actually believe in the in-game decisions or you're
      just role-playing, what is good and bad in this world is your decision. You
      could say doing drugs is wrong, but then declare to the world that you would
      kill someone just for stealing a simple jug of water. All your decisions will
      lead up to an ending that changes to an extreme level.<br><br>With fighting
      skills and smart thinking, the three heroes could succeed. Or you could, you
      know, cause the whole story to go completely wrong (if that is your desire).<br><br>However,
      in-game decisions are not the only decisions you make...<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>YOU
      CAN MAKE DECISIONS THAT CHANGES THE ENTIRE FUTURE OF THE GAME FOR EVERY PLAYER
      IN THE WORLD!</strong></h2><br>This game is all about the voice of the fans!
      If you have an idea for a great addition or change to the game, your wish may
      come true... From story ideas, custom character ideas, and game play ideas or
      improvements, we'll listen.<br><br>The first part of Night Spasm is complete.
      When we've heard the voices of the fans, we'll work on the next update, which
      will mostly include fan submitted ideas. Every idea submitted may be hand-crafted-programmed
      into the game! All ideas will make a difference to the future updates, most
      importantly the final update, so what you submit out of game will create a fan-crafted
      story that will be experienced by every other Night Spasm player in the world.
      Your voice will change the history of Night Spasm forever... make your choices
