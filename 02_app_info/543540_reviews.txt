The graphics seem like they could be very nice looking but can not be tweaked and were blurry. The game ran choppy at many intervals when my wife was playing as you will see in the video so the game needs more optimization or options to tweak grahics manually. If you like bow and arrow wave shooters/defense games than you will probably like this but I am giving it a thumbs down because of the horrible performance my wife was having.\n\nVideo below. Hd will be available after YouTube processes it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/9NxU7be--sY","timestamp_created":1483047044,"timestamp_updated":1483047044,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.326788395643234253","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwusCfptkCdZ3xbQ=="}
