What's shown in the video is what you get, but it is more challenging than it looks. Each level has its own music, and you receive points by completing each round in a level. Advanced levels are unlocked when you amass a certain number of points, so for example, you may choose to focus on getting to Round 5 in Level 1, or Round 3 in Level 3 to get the points necessary to unlock Level 5. A single game will probably take less than 5 minutes.\n\nThe proclaimed premise of using music as a game mechanic doesn't seem to take effect here, but I might be missing something. The soundtrack is nice though.","timestamp_created":1515801626,"timestamp_updated":1515801626,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568345367908477783","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2ai09uACcdTylQE="}
