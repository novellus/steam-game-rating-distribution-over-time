    review: 'The atmosphere built by the lore, music and visuals is pretty damn nice;
      However the gameplay and technical aspects are pretty damn bad.

      You may see many reviews mentioning that the game doesn''t start at all, that''s
      because license assigned for a game is not based on just purchase, but you need
      to at least try installing some f***ng demo beforehand, so it actually assigns
      correct license for your full game, so that''s a first I''ve seen.


      One thing this fix doesn''t solve is a headache of technical issues throughout,
      first is the nonexistent setings, just 3 resolutions to choose, the last one
      being completely broken, hiding subtitles, leaving you with some low res BS.
      Second is important videos that should play and give you clues - well, f**k
      you, if you have a newer PC, those just refuse to show visuals, and everyone
      is doing whisper speak, instead of speaking english.

      Then there is changing camera like in Resident Evil, but you move with mouse,
      meaning that you can click on a god damn chasm and die, making you repeat the
      act.

      Lastly there are bugs that softlock your progress, I for example couldn''t open
      the bookshelf in Act 2 at any point.


      Since it''s a point''n''click game, I watched some dude who played it on an
      old rig in 2011 with all videos actually showing, and I''d suggest anyone interested
      do the same. The setting is kinda weird, almost EYE Divine Cybermancy weird.
      Some citadel of grand masters of their chaos religion, operating in space and
      commanding slaves, when a force they call evil started striking them down, flipping
      the power dynamics on their head. Visuals are 2-tone, something like Fotonica
      or Music Machine (second also being a weird adventure game). Music is minimal
      and ominous, fits the setting. The story itself is not really amazing, the focus
      is mostly on lore and worldbuilding, the whole thing lasts like half an hour,
      if it''s not breaking for you of course.


      PS

      They mention "Sin City" in the visuals description, and list "Set up multiple
      player profiles" as a feature worthy of note XD'
