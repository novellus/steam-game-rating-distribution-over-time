    review: 'I played this game "A Lot" when it first came out, so it can''t be that
      bad ... however it does have it''s faults the largest being that it can''t be
      completed without some hex editing to get past a door very near the end of the
      game, the door is impossible to get through without editing your way past it.


      The next drawback is there is no ingame map, and seeing as everywhere looks
      pretty much the same you can be wandering around for many real life hours trying
      to find a particular place ... Next, camping in the outside game map is particulary
      hard as you are constantly woken up to fight yet another horde of bad guys,
      fatigue quickly sets in so you have to keep reloading a save in the hope that
      the game gives you a break and lets you sleep so that you can move on.


      The above is the worst parts of the game, in general it is fun earning money
      "Through  Fighting Mainly" to get better armour and equipment, and the inventory
      management is endless though satisfying.


      Botton line is you need to fight "A Lot" to make money to buy things like armour
      weapons and food ... Check your "Charactor Screen" after EVERY fight and save
      after every fight and even every action like before fights in Cities ... It
      is very randon and it''s easy to get wiped out in a fight!


      Daemongate is old school, the fights are brutal ... Main thing to remember is
      check your fatigue after every fight and if it''s a couple of points down eat
      some food and save, fatigue is your enemy if an an enemy flees on the battlefield,
      it will drain you very quickly ... You can control how many bad guys you want
      to fight if you are aware of exactly when a fight is going to happen by saving
      just before the battle and loading again if you are not happy with the number
      of enemys, it''s pointless fighting one enemy as there is no profit in it, keep
      loading until you get  a larger number.


      Always keep your armour to "Good" condition as just one piece that is in "Bad"
      or "Terrible" condition will get that party member killed!


      The way to win is throught rigid and O.C.D inventory management.


      Still playing it now, though i can''t remember how to do the hex editing, though
      i.m sure i will work it out


      There is a walkthrough on the net, you can''t miss it, it''s the only one ...
      Follow it to the letter, as the game is event driven, as in B won''t happen
      before you do A.'
