Although chapter one was about Kuranosuke, chapter 2 is about Yasube, it was really hard to believe in the beginning, but it was a very wonderful route, even if it had a few sad moments. The saddest moment was at the end when Yasube did not control me by the sword Muramasa because I die and disappear while she holds me in my arms crying. At that point I just wanted to delete the game because it was too sad, but I chose to continue playing it to see what is happening. Honestly, Chapter 3 was a bit strange since it was with Matsujou who changed his name to Chikara, because it was totally different from the first ones that he had ever noticed because of why he falls in love and begins to keep track of you. It was interesting that after I met Shinpachirou I had a choice between Chikara and this one. Although Shinpachiro loved me, she chose to kill me when I tried to go on her route because she was a member of the Uesugi family who had sent her to kill Kuranosuke and Yasube for Kira not to be killed. When I chose Chikara's route, it was nice that everything had become a bit more normal between them, and it was a pleasure that Kayano, who was in Chapter 3, was busy and understanding. I was really shocked and sad to see Kaiano killed, but even more shocking was the fact that on this route I found that Kira had a double. Chapter 3 was the one that made me come back to my world, but its way of getting rid of the punishment was like Kuranosuke's one that was sad.","timestamp_created":1563175030,"timestamp_updated":1563175030,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz8Gf+usCf6mzzgE="}
