    review: 'This game is CRIMINALLY underrated. It''s fun, short, has a lot of replayability,
      and the characters have such vivid personalities! For 5 bucks it''s absolutely
      worth it. I''ve never participated in a game jam (the max experience I have
      with programming is messing around in RPG maker), but I feel like I could connect
      to the characters and share their experiences nonetheless.

      The music is one of the most impressive things about this game. I love all of
      the tracks, and find myself listening to some of it with the game open in the
      background sometimes.

      Also! I was very surprised to see that Animator-Senpai MOVES? Like, I''ve never
      seen a sprite that involves constant animation, and that was great as it was
      reflecting on her specialty, well, animating. I simply adore this game and find
      myself coming back to it to replay and play through the different options.'
