        The game contains still images depicting blood and injury, as well as graphic
        textual descriptions of murder scenes. It also contains some sexual themes
        and heavy swears such as f*ck and sh*t.

    short_description: The evening is as ordinary as they come for London, England
      as the curtains close on the 19th century. Mist hangs thick, beclouding the
      radiance of the moon and modest glow of gas lamps. Upon the resounding chime
      of Big Ben, a new tale of love and adventure like no other begins!

    review: "I dearly enjoyed the game for what it was. The story is so well written..\n\
      \n((I cannot express how happy that made me, especially for the time the time\
      \ the story takes place and English being different in those times.))\n\n..and\
      \ though I do appreciate the additional voice of Lady Whitely, I found it to\
      \ be not suited for the MC. I imagined her to sound far different from what\
      \ she sounds in the game itself. \nRegardless of that voice option, I for the\
      \ most part liked her character. Sure, her naivity or plain stupidity can get\
      \ rather irritating, but what MC isn't an MC without either of those traits,\
      \ even just a little bit. (Lot aren't, I am sure.)\n\nThat aside, I love the\
      \ idea of mystery solving, and this game just did it for me in that aspect.\
      \ I have to admit that I liked going through the mysteries and cases that were\
      \ presented, more than I did going through the love interests' routes. As everyone\
      \ seems to agree, the one character we adore just so happens to be the one that\
      \ doesn't have a route.\n\nI do recommend this game, on sale if possible as\
      \ I did. I will welcome a sequel if it ever comes to that, with open arms. I\
      \ and others definitely need one."
