    about_the_game: "Need for Spirit: Off-Road Edition is the highly anticipated sequel\
      \ of Need for Spirit!<br />\r\nIt significantly ups the ante by offering far\
      \ crazier challenges. You probably thought that you\u2019ve seen it all, that\
      \ no drill can catch you by surprise, yet you\u2019ll still put that hard earned\
      \ experience to use once more. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTransporting contraband (the\
      \ good ol\u2019 booze and cigs) across difficult terrain, has never looked or\
      \ felt more captivating. Forget about rusty pickup trucks and jeeps. What better\
      \ way to deter the border patrol than transporting your high-risk wares with\
      \ a freaking tank?<br />\r\nAs expected from such a monumental task, the reward\
      \ is only for those daring enough to brave the uncharted dirt roads. You don\u2019\
      t want to end up stranded in such places as the night sets in, so you\u2019\
      ll have to adapt and overcome any obstacles along the way. No room for errors\
      \ or cowards.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs with the predecessor, roads alone shall\
      \ not be your only foe as consuming some of the goods you\u2019re supposed to\
      \ transport, shall deprive you of a clear sight and mindset. If you thought\
      \ that driving a car while inebriated is tough and dangerous, wait until you\
      \ try our armored vehicles! Mayhem may ensue, but we\u2019re certain you can\
      \ come to senses and never steer off-course.<br />\r\nWhat are you waiting for,\
      \ driver? Rev that engine, strap on your helmet, empty a few bottles and truly\
      \ put your skills to the test in a sequel to a parody which definitely doesn\u2019\
      t encourage such behavior in real life. Limit your reckless driving solely to\
      \ video games and that hangover will disappear faster than flipping the wheels\
      \ (or tank tracks) in this tongue-in-cheek simulation!<br />\r\n <br />\r\n\
      Key features:<br />\r\n- Three types of transport vehicles ranging from tanks\
      \ to custom off-road trucks.<br />\r\n- Three camera modes.<br />\r\n- The high\
      \ probability of experiencing drunk vision.<br />\r\n- Challenging driving highlighted\
      \ by obstacles and time limits."
