It's about Valn, a very edgy boy who just wants to do the big genocide, and his good friends.\n\nMechanically, it's not terrible, offering around a dozen stages with a plot branch fairly early on which changes the outcome of the remainder of the game. There's not too much advancement or upgrades, just the random stat growths, which are quicker at the start and then mostly absent later on due to the somewhat strange choice of making all enemies level 1, and your mage(s) getting a single new spell near the end of the game. There's some good room for tactics, though the late game features several annoying maps with defensive walls covered in \"siege archers\" or ballistas, both of which tend to outrange all your troops. In most of them, you even have to sweep the walls and kill all of them, not just run through, making it even more annoying.\n\nStory-wise, however, Sin; Vengeance truly stands out. Basically everyone in the entire game is a raging arsehat, or dies in order to make the raging arsehats even more angry and murderous. The writing is overblown as well, but in a somewhat amusing way - \"the silver platter of a satisfied vengeance\" is one of the more memorable bits, but it's quite often like that. In short: OW the EDGE.\n\nThis is a cautious recommendation - it really felt on par with a good free project, but it wasn't a complete waste of time. I'd pick it up on sale, or just wait for more and better SRPG Studio games to be made in English.","timestamp_created":1585192570,"timestamp_updated":1585192815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559305965900421143","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mdm2ivECevGO+wE="}
