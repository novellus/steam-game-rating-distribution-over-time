    review: "Well... yeah not a great game. \n\nThe bungee jump will make anyone feel\
      \ at least a little motion sick as it turns you upside down and no... not in\
      \ a good way, it doesn't feel at all realistic and to be honest is very boring.\n\
      \nThe climbing is kinda cool i guess but needs improvements as your view constantly\
      \ goes black as your head goes inside the wall in front of you and again it\
      \ isn't realistic and that breaks immersion.\n\nAlso, the 'movement' is dreadful\
      \ so people with small play areas will struggle to play as there is no teleport\
      \ or walk around functionality. \n\nThe hot air balloon feels pointless as all\
      \ it does is go up slowly to the same height as the Statue of Liberty. However,\
      \ the one good thing with this game is the art style, it is quite pleasant to\
      \ look at for a short period and then it gets boring, but the lighting is pretty.\n\
      \nAt the least the price isn't unreasonable, could still be cheaper for what\
      \ you get, perhaps they will improve the feel of the game a little and the climbing,\
      \ and then at least you can call this a pretty good VR 'experience' that you'll\
      \ play once or twice and then you'll show to your grandma or something.\nWish\
      \ them luck with this game."
