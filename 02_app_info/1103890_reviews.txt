You also need to look past some of the frustrations (character moves too slowly, gets stuck on furniture easily, slow dialogue,  frustrations of the character you're playing (why would he take the memo but not read it right away)). I got the game 75% off and felt that was a fair price. I wouldn't pay full price for it.","timestamp_created":1604261630,"timestamp_updated":1604261630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg7rcwvUCf7nSqwI="}
