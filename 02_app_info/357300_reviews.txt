If you're looking for a more casual puzzling experience, I would suggest getting the other game first, Snakebird Primer. I haven't played that one, but I assume it's the same except less brutal.\n\nIf you're looking for seriously difficult puzzle challenge of carefully moving snakes around in a way that does not kill or trap them, this game is definitely it.","timestamp_created":1609930609,"timestamp_updated":1609930609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lvLV6/YCd+z7wAI="}
