Top/Down Run & Gun Shooter (RGS) at it's indie finest.  I can't recommend this game enough.  I like what they did with this game.  My only complaint is that I can't use my XBOX controller I had to use a SEGA Genesis type pad.  I'd like a sequel but dunno if that'll happen.","timestamp_created":1608178287,"timestamp_updated":1608178287,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mai5t/YCcsftugI="}
