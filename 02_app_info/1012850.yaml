    review: could of been better, good points, I enjoyed the puzzles , story seems
      cut short and doesn't  seem finished so not worth the price at the min, graphics
      are also not to good so why someone else says they are i'm not sure, maybe a
      new quest 2 user, I play driving games in VR and dont get sick but the blurry
      graphics  tend to give me head ace and found I needed to take a break, also
      cant up the resolution through steam, has free movement and teleport, enjoyed
      what there was to the game just wish it looked better and had more puzzles and
      more to the story, I still give it a positive but in 2020 I expected a bit more.
      Performance could also of been a bit better for me. Playing on Rift S, Ryzen
      7 3800X , 5700XT, 64GB Ram 2400, Windows 10 64.
