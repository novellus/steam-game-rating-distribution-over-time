It is unbalanced, and dull to boot.\n\nEven if you start off with the moneybags code, you will still lose more than you make. Ingredients cost an arm and a leg, and your parents take so much money from you after that that you may as well start selling your kidneys too.\n\nIt really prevents you from enjoying the recipe creation at all, since you have to sweat over the cost of every single ingredient and usually have to default to the cheapest options possible. Which still isn't enough to help you scrape up enough to keep your head above water.\n\nThere's a dating sim aspect to the game, but you have no time to enjoy it in the struggle to just survive.\n\nI like cooking in games. I like dating sims. But this game fails at both.","timestamp_created":1608181285,"timestamp_updated":1608181285,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iODEt/YCfLTuugI="}
