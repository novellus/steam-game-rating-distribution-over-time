    review: '"We Won''t Be Alone" by Feint and Laura Brehm is one of my favorite DnB
      songs of all time. However, the fact that I paid $2 for a beatmap that isn''t
      even remotely a challenge on Expert+ WITH GHOST NOTES is just tragic. I bought
      this thinking it would be reminiscent of the Camellia album (which is free,
      mind you) where songs on hard are a fair challenge, expert are a good challenge,
      and expert+ are truly challenging. Instead, I got a song that I missed 10 notes
      on first try which really disappointed me. The song is so beautiful and has
      some great drops, but I feel it was all just ignored and made as a quick cash
      grab. Don''t buy this, download a different version of this song for free off
      of Beatsaver or something.'
