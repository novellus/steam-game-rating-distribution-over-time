The fighter game aspect makes for an interesting take on the VN/life management genre.  Stat-building, etc. in these kinds of games can get pretty montonous sometimes, but I think the wrestling matches in Honey do a good job of breaking it up enough so it doesn't feel that way.  The writing is engaging, well-developed, and funny.  And of course the beautiful hand-drawn animation is the icing on the cake.  You can tell a lot of love went into the development.  Definitely recommend this one!","timestamp_created":1504412381,"timestamp_updated":1504412381,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54787898063659668","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49OX9ot4CebOwhAE="}
