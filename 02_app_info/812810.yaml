    review: "I\u2019ve left a review for the dlc of this before, but I want to go\
      \ back and touch on this game again, because it really is a diamond in the ruff.\
      \ Missed messages is by far one of the most beautiful, touching, relatable and\
      \ amazing game I have ever played and owned. I saw this game thanks to Jacksepticeye,\
      \ and it has been one of the first games I have ever owned and played, and I\
      \ will never forget it. The artstyle is gorgeous, beautiful and incredibly smart,\
      \ mariachi g perfectly with the story and showing the darkness and lightness\
      \ with ease. The story and characters are incredibly heartfelting, in which\
      \ I mean you instantly fall in love and want to protect them. And as for the\
      \ story it is incredibly realistic and heart wrenching as it shows life realistically.\
      \ The gameplay also heavily helps this. So in the end, this game is a must get,\
      \ and I highly recommend you get the dlc as well as its incredibly worth it.\
      \ I will never forget this game"
