No matter what I do, the game does nothing. I had to kill it with Task Manager. \n\nI wrote in the game discussions on 31 October 2019 about this problem - today is 20 December 2019. More than a month. Zero response from devs or anyone who can actually help.\n\nNot only do I not recommend this game to anyone, I specifically recommend NOT buying it.","timestamp_created":1576837034,"timestamp_updated":1586436822,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv5rAr/ECcczA5QE="}
