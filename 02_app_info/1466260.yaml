    review: "This is such an awesome addicting and rewarding strategy game! It has\
      \ good old school 8 bit graphics, similar to fire emblem with a dungeons and\
      \ dragons feel at its core giving a more personal character experience. \n\n\
      My favorite aspect of the game is once you clear a level you can either pick\
      \ from three items that either give a stat bonus, new attacks, or fully heal.\
      \ This gives you the ability to make very diverse character builds, while also\
      \ adding an edge of difficulty since you cannot heal if you decide to improve\
      \ your characters build after each level. \n\nTwo Die rewards players that make\
      \ calculated decisions to defeat each enemy without taking damage. This can\
      \ be done with any class by either killing an enemy before it gets within range\
      \ (Mage Class), increasing armor/using block skills (Warrior), or attacking\
      \ and running out of range of an enemy (Rouge). \n\nI also like that once you\
      \ clear the \"last level\" you continue through levels that get progressively\
      \ harder without getting the option to heal or improve your character.  To conclude\
      \ this game is very addicting and offers lots of ways to play the game without\
      \ it ever feeling stale. This game is certainly worth your time and money. \n\
      \nIf you make it past level 22 let me know  <(^.^<)"
