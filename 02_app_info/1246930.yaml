    review: 'This is the latest version of the classic Hoyle Card Games that came
      out about 15 years ago.  I loved the original - particularly certain characters
      - and it is great that I can now install and play it under Steam.  Thanks for
      doing this!


      I only have a couple of minor critiques/suggestions:


      - The card art in the current version is a bit distracting.  I liked the more
      subdued version of the original a bit better.  Perhaps you could provide different
      card sets, and let the user choose to switch them out to the one they prefer?


      - I loved the game "Tarot" (actually French Tarot) in the original, and it is
      not available in this version.  Would you please bring back Tarot again?


      Otherwise, this is great!'
