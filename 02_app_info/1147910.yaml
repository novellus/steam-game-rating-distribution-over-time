    about_the_game: <strong>Origami Ninja Star</strong> is a chaotic hybrid of fast
      paced action and physics-based combat where YOU are the weapon. Slice into a
      colourful paper world where everyone is folded differently, and your destiny
      is to destroy everyone in your way. As the self-appointed protector of your
      village, use your unfolding technique to switch between a nimble paper ball
      and a deadly ninja star. Harness momentum as the Ball to traverse and ricochet
      through levels, then unleash it as the Star to strike enemies with precision.<br><br><img
