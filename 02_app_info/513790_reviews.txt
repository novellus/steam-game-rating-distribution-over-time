Go ahead and put this into your cart. It's simple, but polished. Wave shooting, it's a you probably never heard of but you need to get this while its on sale. I would say its as good or even better than titles similar ranging from 5-20$ on the VR steam store. It's similar to Tron but also Riddick. \n\nI suggest having haptic feedback in a pad and or vest, turn the music off, and this title will bring you into its simulation. \n\nI like it better than space pirate trainer, call me crazy, but I think when I tried space pirate trainer I was using an older setup occulus dev 2 now im using modified htc vives on super samplings game feels good.","timestamp_created":1580067812,"timestamp_updated":1580067812,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwqq7Y8e8Cd7an7gE="}
