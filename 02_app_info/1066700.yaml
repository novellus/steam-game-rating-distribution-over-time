    review: 'New Yankee 7: Deer Hunters is a classic time management game -> perform
      a series of action in an allotted time.

      This game includes levels of difficulties, where the hardest is really, really
      hard. New Yankee 8 is way more easy - as a point of reference.

      There are in-game achievements. Some of them are interesting and attached to
      a given level. The achievement''s triggering can be seen only afterward in a
      dedicated screen. Nothing shows while playing.

      I''m at level 25 when I write this review - and 3 hours in. There are apparently
      50 levels total.


      While there''s nothing surprising or outstanding in this game, it still does
      what it advertises. It''s a good way of killing some time.


      It works fine on Win7 64bit'
