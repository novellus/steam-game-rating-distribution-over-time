This game isn't bad for an rpg, I quite like it, but is ultimately a let down. \n\nThe lack of character interaction and story are disappointing. When you get to the end, you lose a character but you really don't, which makes it pointless. The ending is so, damn, lazy, you just see all of the characters in places you've been before. I honestly would've taken a romantic ending over that lazy ending, and that's saying something, it's so sudden and has no conclusion, and unless there will be some sort of sequel, then there should have been more to it. Like I said before, characters don't crack jokes, they don't relax ever, they barely ever talk together at all unless they're all arguing. They don't ever seem to become friends, they just seem like they're tired of each others faces.\n\nI do like this game, but cannot recommend it for multiple reasons, because even the fighting is messed up.\nWhen you get to the desert or desert temple get ready to be fucked up and told you have to get some level ups because god forbid you get in a fight with 2 of more enemies with Ancient Curse because if you do you'll probably be killed by them spamming it and making you fall asleep and giving you every negative status effect (besides a couple of course) so you die even faster.\nI cannot explain enough how poorly thought out that was.","timestamp_created":1592634011,"timestamp_updated":1592814030,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwy6nH7fICe5mKjwI="}
