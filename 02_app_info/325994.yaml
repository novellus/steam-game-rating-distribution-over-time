    about_the_game: "The diminutive DB BR 361 packs a punch when it comes to serious\
      \ pulling power, and is now available for shunting duties on Germany\u2019s\
      \ rail network in Train Simulator.<br><br>Built between 1956 and 1964, the BR\
      \ 361 (originally classified as V 60) is a diesel locomotive designed for shunting\
      \ duties and the occasional light goods train for Deutsche Bundesbahn. In total,\
      \ 942 of these shunters were produced, with several modifications through their\
      \ lifetime including new engines and remote control operation.<br><br>The first\
      \ prototype was designed in 1951 as DB had a shortage of small shunters; four\
      \ prototypes were built in 1955, each built by a different manufacturer - Krupp,\
      \ Mak, Henschel and Krauss-Maffei. Each featured different engines too, however\
      \ they still proved to be successful. DB opted for the Maybach GTO 6/GTO 6A\
      \ engines for their production models, which started to be delivered in 1956.<br><br>Even\
      \ in these early stages of the V 60\u2019s life, some models were modified with\
      \ stronger frames and a higher adhesive weight increase from 48.3 to 53 tons;\
      \ these heavier shunters were able to haul an extra six tons of ballast compared\
      \ to the unmodified variant.<br><br>Despite this difference, they were all still\
      \ classified as V 60s until all of DB\u2019s rolling stock was reclassified,\
      \ dividing the V 60s into BR 260s and 261s for light and heavy variants respectively.\
      \ By 1987, they were reclassified again as minor locomotives (Kleinlok), giving\
      \ them their BR 360/361 grouping as they are known today.<br><br>Despite being\
      \ built primarily as shunters, the V 60s were also used for transporting light\
      \ freight and passenger trains, and some even saw some departmental use. A plan\
      \ to replace the V 60 in the early 1980s never came to fruition, and DB set\
      \ about improving the 25 year old V 60s instead.<br><br>The V 60 has a maximum\
      \ speed of 60km/h (37mph), however the diesel motor needs to be pre-heated before\
      \ it can run; as a result, the earlier models had to have a small coke oven\
      \ and carry about 150kg of coke to heat the diesel motor, although newer V 60s\
      \ used oil burners instead.<br><br>Today, many of the 942 locomotives are still\
      \ in service, with around 400 in service for DB and other examples for various\
      \ private railways in Germany and beyond, including Turkey and Norway.<br><br>The\
      \ BR 361 for Train Simulator is available in DB Cargo Red livery and features\
      \ dynamic braking, combination throttle/brake, cab and instrument lighting,\
      \ in-cab signalling, PZB and SIFA safety systems. Also included are SGGRSS container\
      \ freight wagons.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving\
      \ you the freedom to drive the DB BR 361 on any Quick Drive enabled route for\
      \ Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are\
      \ scenarios specifically for the <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/325959\"\
