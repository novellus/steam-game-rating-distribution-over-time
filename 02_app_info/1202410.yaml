      \ /><br><br>Midjungard Multiplayer PvP  is set in an almost prehistoric misty\
      \ world, where strange creatures roam this fabled earth which later becomes\
      \ the Midgard of Viking mythology. This Midjungard by the way, is carried through\
      \ in the legendarium of JRR Tolkien's cosmology too.<br><br>6 players, formed\
      \ into 2 teams, are dropped into this ancient land of myth and magic. The teams\
      \ fight in a PvP mode and acquire points for each enemy kill. Respawning is\
      \ allowed. When the game timer expires, usually around 15 minutes, the team\
      \ with the highest points is the winner. <br><br>In the PvE mode, soon to be\
      \ delivered free as a DLC after the initial game release, 3 human players fight\
      \ against 3 AI bots<br><br>The focal point of the game is the central Altari,\
      \ a pedestal that holds the ultimate weapon UrHamar. <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1202410/extras/Altari.jpg?t=1608657894\"\
      \ /><br><br>Midjungard features three playable classes for the players to choose\
      \ from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Sverdur the Paladin is\
      \ clad in sturdy plate and armed with a sword and shield making him exceptional\
      \ at defence. Armed with a bow, and deadly accurate in ranged combat is Jaegra\
      \ the Huntress. Lastly, Smidur the man-beast capable of delivering a fatal blow\
      \ with his long axe in one swipe.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1202410/extras/All_Three_Avatars_in_Laketown.jpg?t=1608657894\"\

      \ Berserker avatar by two ways:<br>-By capturing the UrHamar mounted on a central\
      \ pedestal on the Altari.<br>-By looting in the level for the elusive magical\
      \ potion GladursBrugga.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1202410/extras/Berserker_on_Altari.jpg?t=1608657894\"\
      \ /><br><br>The level map is vast and varied. The Altari will spawn at different\
      \ locations for each game. A ring of fire, called as Myrcki, will also be spawned\
      \ around the Altari. Myrcki are fiery, flesh-eating insects. One cannot step\
      \ out of this Myrcki circle without being eaten alive.<br><br>A player will\
      \ respawn after death but will do so at the periphery. He/she will need to run\
      \ towards the action after the respawn but will lose all loot that was collected.<br><br>Soon\
      \ as the game starts, look for the sky-high beacon in the map that indicates\
      \ the location of the central Altari. This is where the final battle will probably\
      \ occur. Another valid approach is to play tactically by first looting for potions,\
      \ additional weapons and additional powerups. This will you them better prepared\
      \ for the final battle.<br><br>Engage your enemies from afar using missile weapons.\
      \ Use melee weapons at close range to finish the fight.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1202410/extras/Jaegra_Facing_Sverdur_on_Lakeshore.jpg?t=1608657894\"\

      \ heal damage and of course Galdursbrugga to morph into a Berserker.<br><br>The\
      \ Berserker's special ability is to throw Spheres of Entrapment to stun you.\

    developer_response: "Taco Truck,\n\nFirst of all thanks for buying Midjungard.\n\
      \nThe game is in EARLY ACCESS and thus some issues are to be expected.\n\nWe\
      \ are working almost nonstop to fix all the problems and make Midjungard an\
      \ exciting experience for the players.\n\nPerhaps you were not able to find\
      \ any players when you joined? This is to be expected as the player base is\
      \ still ramping up.\n\nHere is a deal. I will give you the Midjungard Discord\
      \ server ID and  we can agree on a time and place of your choosing. I will play\
      \ as many games as you would like and I am sure your opinion of Midjungard will\
      \ change.\n\nHere is the Discord server : https://discord.gg/8nVDk8b \n\nPing\
      \ me and let's meet in the Ur-forest.\n\n-Fred"
