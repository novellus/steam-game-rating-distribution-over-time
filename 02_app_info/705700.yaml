        the INTEL HD Integrated Graphics Requirement, the newer and higher end processor
        you have, the better. We've recently updated the game to have a lower resolution
        setting. When the low graphics setting is enabled, the system requirements
        drop drastically but some system my still have issues getting to 60 FPS. Lower
        specification systems may slow down the game speed. If this is your scenario,  we
        encourage you close all other applications and ensure your system is not running
        any unnecessary processes in the background. A lot of elbow grease was put
        into this in the hopes that more people can enjoy this game on a variety of

    reviews: "\u201CVerdict X-MiguFighters isn\u2019t the best 2D fighter I\u2019\
      ve played, but it\u2019s definitely not the worst either. Apart from the obvious\
      \ boobie appeal, the combat is surprisingly tight and the controls more responsive\
      \ than I expected. The rather brash script helps to increase the humorous appeal\
      \ of the game, too. If it had more variation in moves across the different characters\
      \ I\u2019d be more inclined to play it more often, but it\u2019s worth the low\
      \ price of admission even if only to experience what it has to offer once.\u201D\

      Instead of being a brawler, X-MiGuFighters: Stripper Anya 2 is a classic 1-on-1\
