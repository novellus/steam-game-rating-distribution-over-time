      has been remade and released as a commercial product with lots of new content,
      story, art, music, touches, game modes, secrets, and overall polished experience
      as Close Your Eyes -Anniversary Remake-. The original freeware version will
      stay here on Steam for people to download and play freely, but the remake will
      be getting all future support and I hope to make a surprising and superior experience.</p><br><h1>About

    review: 'Spooky Spooks! Puzzles and scares as you discover your true self, what
      lies deep within you, something you''d never let people know. Plenty of endings
      to find for great eye-gouging replayability!
