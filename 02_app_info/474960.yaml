    review: "Just NO. I bought this after enjoying another game form this developer\
      \ called Control. But this game is just terrible. The live action series is\
      \ decent and you are better off just watching that on YouTube but the \"game\"\
      \ is just unplayable. \n\n1. All the temporal visual effects just end up causing\
      \ a headache. It feels like your graphics card is failing and causing visual\
      \ artifacts. Just some cheap and distracting visual effects.\n2. The movement\
      \ and combat feels super laggy and unsatisfying. Because of the annoying visual\
      \ effects, I  feel better off not using my time powers. \n3. There is no save\
      \ system! So if you die towards the end of a chapter you have to do the whole\
      \ thing again, sitting through several minutes of forced dialogue, elevator\
      \ rides etc. again and again and again. \n4. There are sooo many bullet sponges\
      \ and you have to empty several magazines into them (even if you aim for the\
      \ head). Gunplay is just unsatisfying and you seem to be firing blanks instead\
      \ of actual bullets. \n5. Its not like Control where you have fun super powers.\
      \ The powers here are not very meaningful and actually a bit annoying to use."
