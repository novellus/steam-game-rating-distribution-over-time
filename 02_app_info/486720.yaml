    about_the_game: Justice has failed. The criminal, the deranged, the inconvenient,
      and the uncomfortable; all are cast across the sea to the greedy island of Lukatt,
      whose shores let nothing slip free. Whether sinner or saint, you are one of
      these outcasts, and it is there, in a dark cell on the cold shore of that island,
      where you will finally cut fate's throat and take control of your own future.
      <br><br>Gather a band of the criminal and the forgotten, forgive their transgressions
      or ostracize them, use them as workhorses or nurture their trust, slaughter
      your enemies or spare them, release the conquered or press them into service.
      Find a way to escape the inescapable, or find a way to bend it to your will.<br><strong><br>Bastard

    review: Beautiful game with great stories and lots of Bara characters. Remember
      to utilize the "shift" button to gain more attack turns and be mindful of your
      risk bar to get out of the tutorial. After that, worry about upkeep to expand
      your party.
