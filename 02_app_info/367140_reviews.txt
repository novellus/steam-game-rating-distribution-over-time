Cute and funny different characters to play, with different playstyles. Plus it's dirty cheap! It even has local co-op!\n\nReplayability is pretty high too. Although the game is a bit short, which is common for bullet hell games, each character has it's own story, bullet/bomb/skill and enemies behave a little bit differently, so you may want to beat the game several times.\n\nFor the current price I think it's a real bargain.","timestamp_created":1595334738,"timestamp_updated":1595334738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhYjXuPMCcYTZlgI="}
