What separates it from others in the genre, some would\ncall it the walking simulator, is a semi-open world environment as well as many more mechanics. This game does not rely\non cheap jump scare moments, but methodically builds the atmosphere and plot of the story which will give your shivers.\n\nAs you progress, in the game you will be able to craft various tools and make potions using recipes.\nHerbalism is well implemented and if you are of an exploratory spirit, you can learn a lot about the story.\nThere are a couple of stealth sections, but don’t be put off by this, because they’re done differently than you’re used to, there’s also a way to be totally bypassed if you don’t like stealth.\nIt should be noted that the game will not indicate on the map where to go and what to do.\nFor some, this will be repulsive, i didn't mind.\nIn addition to the main story, which is dark and serious but nicely structured, it is possible to do side tasks and discover secrets of the forest by solving puzzles. I won't talk about story details because you should experience it without spoilers.\n\nYou will quickly notice the effort and passion that these two developers have invested in the plot and the world of the game.\nCollecting badges, fairy tales, QR codes and other collectibles, although optional, was never boring or pointless to me, because there is a story behind it, and it is not set just to artificially prolong the game.\n\nNothing in this game is by accident, there is a story behind everything and everything is done with great attention to detail.\nA big recommendation to all fans of psychological horror adventures as well as to all who love a good story.","timestamp_created":1609969699,"timestamp_updated":1609969699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i4Hr7PYCeKWPwQI="}
