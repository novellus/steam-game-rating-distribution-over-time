    review: '[h1] DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review
      [/h1]


      Spirits of Metropolis is a game developed and published by Vertigo Gaming, the
      same person behind the Cook, Serve, Delicious series


      The game offers some really nice graphics and a nice yet simplistic aesthetic
      which is pleasant all the same and has some amazing attention to detail even
      though it is a little rough around the edges


      The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but
      a fun game nonetheless and ends just at the right time


      Spirits of Metropolis overall, however, is an okay game to play, yet sometimes
      repetitive and it does get boring if being played for a long time, but is an
      okay strategy game to play in short bursts!


      [h1] RECOMMENDED :) [/h1]
