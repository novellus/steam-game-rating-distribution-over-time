    review: Be extremely aware, this is a physics puzzler.  There are wacky physics
      situations so there will be plenty of minute controlling otherwise the ball
      will get launched.  However, its easier to "feel" the direction and weight and
      the end goals do have a very very small gravity pull so it's not rage inducing.  If
      you're looking for a short puzzler, this works, especially for the price tag.
