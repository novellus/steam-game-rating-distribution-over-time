    review: 'So when initially put on sale this was apparently from Valve, how on
      earth they got away with that one is beyond me as it has now been corrected.

      Well it suckered me into buying and what did I find?

      No, not HL3 in disguise but a very shoddy side scrolling shooter.

      I eventually found the keys:

      WASD NOPW

      Controller NOPE

      Curser Check

      Select?

      Enter NOPE

      Space NOPE

      Well it did say X to skip the intro, surely not? Yep X to select.

      Surely I can change the key bindings?

      Nope

      Graphic settings?

      You guessed it Nope

      Finally stumbled into the game through poorly desgined menus.

      And what do I find?

      A side scrolling shooter with tacked in cut scenes.

      This game seems to have forgot R-Type existed 20 years ago and did this a thousand
      times better.

      I have bought better for less than 50p on here.

      Redeeming features?

      It didn''t crash

      The sound didn''t make my ears bleed

      The graphics reminded me of better days on my MegaDrive...

      Nostalgia is great this isn''t.'
