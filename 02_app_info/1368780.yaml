    short_description: Wang Cheng-En escaped the Miaoli emperor's clutches with Pisuka.
      This time, they follow Mika to a holy city Taichung State. What awaits him?
      Will he eat lead, end up being buried as a bloated corpse in a ditch in the
      middle of Taiwan, or lead an ordinary daily life together with young girls?
