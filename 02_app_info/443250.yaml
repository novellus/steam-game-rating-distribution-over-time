    review: "Readers might find this odd to mention first and foremost, but I have\
      \ to start with praise for the music of Elder Star. Props to the composer for\
      \ writing something that's at once epic, spacey and robotic that evokes the\
      \ classic 8/16-bit legends. I'm particularly sensitive to music in video games,\
      \ and this one struck the nail on the head for me.\n\nThe gameplay is through\
      \ controling the protagonist as if he were a mouse cursor on the screen. Left\
      \ click is the classic gun, right click is a smash attack that turns your little\
      \ robot into a ball of death when you touch enemies. There are upgrades that\
      \ I assume come with each successful completion of the Story Mode. \n\nStory\
      \ Mode is five stages, and using about 12 continues (most on Stage 4), I managed\
      \ to beat the game in under 30 minutes. This is good because you about six weapons\
      \ to unlock, and you unlock one weapon per play-though (I am assuming). I unlocked\
      \ one new gun (left click), and a new play mode (Practice Mode, i.e. choose\
      \ any stage to play). \n\nMost of the game's worth is through replay value.\
      \ The story is simple, but well done. It's not the centerpiece of the experience,\
      \ that's learning how to survive. \n\nThe enemy attacks aren't very forgiving,\
      \ but they are fair. The stages ascend in difficulty at a correct rate, so that\
      \ I was learning from my mistakes quickly rather than being bombarded by a million\
      \ bullets from the get-go. The artwork, which emulates the Behemoth Games style\
      \ cartoon work, makes it easy to distinguish bullets trying to kill you, moving\
      \ enemies, and backgrounds. You should be able to recognize what kinds of attacks\
      \ are coming at you to move accordingly through the deeper circles of bullet\
      \ hell. \n\nIf I have one major complaint, it's that the final boss was one\
      \ of the easiest for me to defeat. I was expecting a THIS ISN'T MY FINAL FORM\
      \ sort of ordeal, but nope. I'll probably give this another couple playthroughs,\
      \ but I'm not likely to unlock everything. If you are looking for a quick bullet-hell\
      \ game, this is it."
