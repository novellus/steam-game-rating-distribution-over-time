Faulty automated speed controls.  \n\nGraphics: This line looks rather clunky.  There isn't that much detail on each side of the line and the stations just don't look well rendered.  It's okay, but it's not gonna amaze you.  \n\nTrain: The maglev is a fast train and that's about it.  The sound is not accurate, the train accelerates faster than its irl example, it has an automated drive feature that gives it too little time to slow down for speed limits.  It does have a reasonably nice passenger interior and the cab is alright, but it's ultimately let down by its functionality issues.  \n\nRoute: You largely go between Shanghai Pudong and Longyang Road.  Pudong does not look well-rendered, more like an eyesore than a large airport which is unfortunate.  The station at Pudong looks like it was hastily put together; there's very little detail there.  The train accelerates out of Pudong and continues along a line that really doesn't have much around it.  Running the same section over and over, expecting to see something new, feels like a waste of time.  Longyang Road is alright, but this line feels like a one-trick pony; it's a real novelty the first time you play it(especially that 400+ kph) and drudgery for every time thereafter(over and over and over).  \n\nScenarios: The scenarios are okay.  There aren't any gamebreaking issues with them.  They feature the line in different times and climates.  You may be tempted to run the train on automatic mode, but beware; this will cause the train to accelerate to 450 kph, making it impossible to slow down in time for the next speed limit and costing you points.","timestamp_created":1605741996,"timestamp_updated":1605741996,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/szr7vUCeLCarwI="}
