    review: 'I am going to recommend this game, but there are some caveats. The game
      works as advertised and it is fairly fun, but it works better with fewer players
      when using the default settings, as 6 players have too easy a time defending
      their goal and the game can go on forever under the default score settings (first
      to 10 points). You ca change quite a lot in the options though


      My main gripe with the game is the menu navigation. Basically, you can''t use
      the analog stick in the menus even though it''s what you use to move the paddle.
      On top of that I didn''t see an easy way to customize your paddle and its powers
      using the controller (you need a mouse for that), it''s a bit of a nitpick but
      if you are couch gaming you may want to have a wireless mouse.


      There are tons of settings you can change to make the game whatever you want
      it to be. I haven''t tried everything, but it seems comprehensive enough.


      All in all I had fun with the game and so I''ll recommend it, though this is
      definitely a little bare-bones and you may feel inclined to get it during a
      sale.'
