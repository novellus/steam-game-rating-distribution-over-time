A horde of Nether Realm Enemies line the path to the Valley of Fire and must be defeated before you can move forward. As you defeat an Enemy and move forward they’ll be replaced by another, so don’t expect someone else to clear the path for you. If you decide to retreat you won't have to encounter any of the Enemies on your way back to the Plain of Peril but you’ll be admitting defeat. The first person to clear the path and defeat the two Enemies on the Crown of Command wins the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Hunt<\/h2>The hunt is never easy but it’s always rewarding. The first person to defeat four Enemies from the Nether Deck and reach the Crown of Command wins.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Pandora’s Box<\/h2>You’ll need to ensure you’ve gained enough Lives, Strength and Craft before you or another player reaches the Crown of Command. Once a player reaches the Crown, they’ll unleash hell as they open Pandora’s Box. Drawing 6 Nether Cards, plus 6 more Nether Cards per player in the game, you'll need to get ready for a long battle. The player on the Crown of Command will use their Nether Deck against other players until either all other players have been killed or the Nether Deck is exhausted and all other players win.<br><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/267787\/extras\/TDE_NetherRealm_Banner03_Expansion.png?t=1594894987\" \/><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>3 Alternative Ending<br><\/li><li>36 Nether cards<\/li><\/ul><br><i>“Can you survive the Nether Realm?”<\/i>","about_the_game":"<i>“The Nether Realm, where the most terrible beasts of fairy tales and nightmares live, once threatened to swallow up the world of men.
