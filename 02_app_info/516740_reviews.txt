I play plants vs zombies a lot. I am good enough to beat PvZ 2. (a pay to win) 2 times without spending a dime. Battle Ranch which is harder than PvsZ is still easy for me. Not trying to brag just put things in perspective. I baught this game because I wanted a challenge and still can't beat this game. I got what I wanted and then some. If both games above are not super easy for you, this game will piss you off","timestamp_created":1526868390,"timestamp_updated":1526868390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541190981864929199","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh9acwOMCfJ7moAE="}
