IF DLC DOES NOT WORK, CONTACT TABLETOPIA TO SOLVE !!\n(there is no issue with the board game itself after they add it manually)\n\nPROBLEM: I bought The Isle of Cats DLC, but Tabletopia doesn't let me open a table, any setup, not even solo... a pop-up still says I need Premium and instead of opening a lobby, goes back to Home. Other users already reported this problem in their reviews.\n\nI already bought a bunch of Tabletopia DLC and they work perfectly, also playing in a browser: you just have to start Tabletopia on Steam after the purchase, so your account is updated and unlocked games appear in your Tabletopia library online.\n\nUPDATE: Apparently it's an issue in their billing system...\nSOLUTION: \"Please, forward your Tabletopia account ID and screenshot demonstrating your payment in Steam to support@tabletopia.com. We'll add it manually to your account.\"\n\nProblem solved \"manually\" by Tabletopia but I hope they find a better fix...","timestamp_created":1609452501,"timestamp_updated":1609857706,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566459774971008301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgeW/6fYCeeScvwI="}
