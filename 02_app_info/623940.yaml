      s not gonna be much help. You're going to have to get yourself out of this.\
      \ But where did they come from? How are you supposed to deal with this? Well,\

    short_description: A hand-drawn tribute to hilarious '90s adventure games (with
      none of the accompanying frustration). Play as Joey Claire, a puzzle-solving
      teen snatched out of her time (1994) and place (Earth) and stranded on a hostile
      alien planet on the brink of rebellion.
