Original review left below for reference[/h1][/b]\n\n[b]First, let me just say that most other reviews came from a while ago, and dont reflect recent changes, or don't mention the unstable alpha branch that has been updated. With that in mind, please continue.[/b]\n\nI'd like to mention something that has been gone over in other reviews. Yes, at the time, this game is not complete yet, and it has a ways to go. The official release branch has not been updated since February, and the devs were quiet for many months after that.\n\nHowever, the dev team has gotten their engine overhaul almost complete, and have begun an unstable alpha build that they've been releasing updates for on Steam quite regularly. With the updates that I'm sure will be soon added to the game, I'm confident this game will be worth the $20, [i]but if you expect a mostly feature complete game, do not play this yet[/i]. Buy it, hold on to it, and play it once it's closer to release.\n\nI'll make sure to update this review once sufficient changes are made.","timestamp_created":1411486086,"timestamp_updated":1609034132,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.721436858177185059","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwoo360PYCcbTGLg=="}
