I think it's fine for the price. It's about 1-2 hours long, but consider that real-life escape rooms cost a lot more.\n\nMy beef with the puzzles is that you can brute force a couple of them a little. But I hate brute forcing escape rooms, so I didn't. Admittedly, there was one I solved by accident before I was fully sure why I had solved it. I was well on the right track, but I think a good puzzle should only be solved right after a light bulb goes off in your head and you get that dopamine hit.\n\nMost of the puzzles did just that, though, so that was nice. Particularly the last one. That's the feeling I pay for.\n\nOverall, this was a fine medium-difficulty escape room. I also like that it's all in one room and can be done in roomscale if you have a large enough space.\n\nTip: A couple items get \"stuck\" to your hand on purpose. This is so that you can use them with the trigger. Just hit the grip to release them. Also, most items will respawn back where you originally found them if you accidentally clip them through a wall. (Try to be careful where you teleport if you're holding something, though.)\n\nMinor spoiler: Another reviewer felt some items were meant to be used but were left in the game even though they're not needed. Keep in mind escape rooms very often have red herrings.","timestamp_created":1575509943,"timestamp_updated":1575509943,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rbzt6e4CfZGE4gE="}
