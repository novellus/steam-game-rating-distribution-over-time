Its something thats fun and enjoyable to play, whether its to pass time or serious delve deep into the game and aim for the tough achievements and scores. I am excited to see what the developer brings out next, and how (if he makes a sequel) he expands the mythos and universe that this game starts.","timestamp_created":1563034450,"timestamp_updated":1563034450,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhZ+H9usCc6ekzgE="}
