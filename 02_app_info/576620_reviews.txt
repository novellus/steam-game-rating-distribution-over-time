I didn't even realise I could move until testing random buttons. To start the game, they put a big Start button behind you, in a VR game. Who thought that was a clever idea? Once pressed, you then get a console that appears that you need to pull a lever on, choose a level by using the slider and then put a helmet on to start it. This is all without any explanation nor guide.\n\nI get it's supposed to be a puzzle experience, but making it so obtuse to even get into the first puzzle room is just odd. There also appears to be no motion sickness reductions, so prepare to feel sick after playing.","timestamp_created":1608916138,"timestamp_updated":1609521755,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t56+3/YCfOmNvQI="}
