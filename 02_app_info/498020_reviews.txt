The soundtrack was definitely a major highlight of the game. Composed by Lyndon Holland and recorded by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, the soundtrack for [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/374030/Virginia/] Virginia [/url] captures the game's mysterious tone with really good ambient tracks. Some of the tracks, in a good way, remind me of Mark Snow's work on The X-Files, which also adds to the mysterious setting in the game. This DLC also includes the soundtracks from the game's trailers. Overall, the soundtrack for [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/374030/Virginia/] Virginia [/url] is just really good, and I'd recommend you purchase it if you liked it in the game enough.","timestamp_created":1596242314,"timestamp_updated":1596242314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsZjd0/MCftjZmAI="}
