    review: 'I played this game on Twitch.tv/UnknownErrorFilms


      I physically had to stop because I felt my brain begin to cease function (I
      genuinely needed help spelling cease right there) - This is like those arcade
      game that were made to take your quarters (more like dollars nowadays huh, amirite?
      Geez inflation has destroyed the arcade atmosphere)


      I digress.
