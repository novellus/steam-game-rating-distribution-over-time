And I've also spent time as a night security guard in a couple of creepy places - one of which was an abandoned prison which was haunted. And this game brings across the impression of both scenarios pretty well. The dubious backstories that you're investigating. The amateur level of both you and the other people who are doing this. The feeling of being by yourself in a creepy place at night and that sense that something MIGHT be going on near you, but it might not be. \n\nYou come to like that feeling, well I did anyway. And playing this makes me miss that time of my life TBH.\n\nThe Spook Inspectors doesn't make you over the top terrified like most horror games. It makes you feel uneasy. And to someone who has been there I can tell you that this feeling is far more realistic. Strong recommend here.","timestamp_created":1577063726,"timestamp_updated":1577063726,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwu9eUmO8CfIaf5gE="}
