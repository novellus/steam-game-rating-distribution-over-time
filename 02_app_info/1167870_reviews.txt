Â£7.19 is a big ask for two tables (not sure what it is in dollars? Probably around $8.99?). So these tables have to be good.\n\nI'm happy to say that they are absolutely astonishing. They are absolute classics, and if you spent any time in arcades back in the 90's you probably played one of these.\nLet's break them down.\n\nCreature From The Black Lagoon:\nSuper interesting table. The ramps are really striking that absolutely envelop the playfield. The main objective for big points is to spell out \"film\" by completing various targets across the table. (Spell \"love\", hit the standups in the middle to open the snack bar, spell \"paid\" by hitting the upper roll over targets near the bumpers, and shooting the \"slide\" ramp on the right) This will allow you to lock one of your balls and initiate a 2 ball multiball. 2 balls? I hear you say, is that all? Man, it's one of the hardest multiballs ever that has you searching for a damsel all over the playfield, and hitting the snack bar. The amount of juggling involved is tough, and you can go for riskier shots by hitting the film ramp on the left to build up a multiplier, that essentially permanently doubles your jackpot. Some of the scores you can get by hitting the super jackpots are absolutely absurd. \nExcellent table that has me coming back time and time again to try and keep in the top 10 spot. It's quality.\n\nMonster Bash:\nOh man is this table amazing. The most impressive thing about it is how everyone has their own strategy and approach. Personally, I like to try and light up everything to the point where it's one off activating, then cuing them all off one by one and locking them into frankenstein multiball. I've only ever managed to get all of them into frankenstein once, and it was intense. With some decent skill, you can keep multiball going for a really long time leading to huge points. Great music, great theme, great gameplay.\n\nI genuinely believe this to be one of the best packs Zen has released. If not the best williams pack. It's just such a shame they couldn't have lumped in one more table (Addams Family or Twilight Zone would have been right at home with these two.) But alas, here we are. \n\nIt's a lot of money for these two, but I guarantee if you saw these in an arcade you'd spend double on them anyway, so who cares? Go for it and own them forever in all of their glory!","timestamp_created":1607294599,"timestamp_updated":1607294599,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49aeOnfYCf/fttwI="}
