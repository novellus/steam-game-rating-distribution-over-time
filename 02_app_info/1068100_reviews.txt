It's got 50 levels, and they're all just the same but slightly harder, taking longer and eventually introducing a few new enemy varieties. Probably, at least, since I gave up after the sixth or seventh level and thus never saw if there were enemies introduced later.\n\nThe lack of much other than \"hope to be randomly given an overpowered weapon\" is annoying, as there's no special attacks and weapons don't last forever, so you can't stick with your favorite for very long, and there's basically nothing to do except avoid bullets, fly near all the point items, and shoot down all the enemies with auto-fire.\n\nNot recommended to anyone. It's not terrible in any meaningful way, but it's basically \"would have been somewhat boring even by the standards of free browser games\" tier, so there's no particular reason to ever spend your money or time on it.","timestamp_created":1562659171,"timestamp_updated":1562659289,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.576713085174560547","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+o7w6usCeoX3zQE="}
