    developer_response: '@level94836, thank you very much for your review! :) Our
      goal for the game was to combine classic 3D Action Adventures like "Zelda" with
      the combat and magic of JRPGs. So yes we are of course inspired by Zelda but
      we wanted not to make a clone but rather create a unique mix for a unique experience
      using our favourite engine "source". And making such a game in source is really
      really difficult haha yes. Thanks for following us all the way. <333'

    review: This is a sort of zelda clone in 2011 source. It's not the best game out
      there but it's worth it on sale just for the sheer interestingness of the fact
      it's a 2011 source zelda game that is expected to fully release in december
      2020. This isn't just some indie revival project for source or something either,
      i remember seeing this game WAY WAY back and i'm glad i finally got a hold of
      it. Get it on sale!
