The reason for that is because I'm stuck on the last level. I'm assuming that third level (snowmen in the graveyard) is the last level for this game. I review games based on content, quality, and price.\n\nIf this game only has those 3 levels, then in my opinion, it is very light on content for the asking price. Especially given the quality of said content. Don't get me wrong, I had fun. This is a casual puzzle game. It's not really anything ground-breaking. I've seen this type of game in VR before, but it's done nicely here.\n\nBasically, you're teleporting around a certain area, but you can only teleport in that area. So you have to manage how to get from point A to Point B and your perspective changes as you can go sideways or upside down. You start off by having to throw these little squares to the goal where gravity is directing the little squares in a certain direction, all while you may lose your sense of direction as your perspective changes. Later on you'll be having to use switches and even make some accurate throws if you want to get to the goal with the little square. \n\nI liked the first two levels. I thought they were a casual puzzle challenge for a simple looking game with a brisk pace that held your interest. Unfortunately, the third level seems to have jumped the shark as they say. Suddenly you're forgetting all the restrictions and instead just moving directly to snowmen that you kill with your sword and having to direct a laser to get their shield down. That's quite a jump from what you were doing. And although I got stuck, it was a pretty boring level design. Honestly, I'm not sure if I'm stuck or if it's a bug. I'll assume it's my error and that I missed something.\n\n[b]Sale Price Rating 5.5/10. I got this on sale for $2.49 USD in the Steam Winter Sale. In my humble opinion, it should be more like a $1.99 game (normal retail price) I would probably have rated negaively at $5 USD if I had paid that much [/b]","timestamp_created":1545555407,"timestamp_updated":1545555746,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53271031379699707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzaOT7ecCeLKNtgE="}
