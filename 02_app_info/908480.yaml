    review: "Very fun 2D side-scroller with colorful graphics and fun gameplay. \n\
      \nThe enemy design is solid. Every type of enemy must be fought differently.\
      \ You can't just get away with spamming the same 2 moves all game.\nThe boss\
      \ fights are the highlight for me. The boss design is inventive and each fight\
      \ was really hard for me. The game will punish you for messing up in the boss\
      \ fights. It has an old-school vibe this way. It can feel like they`re piling\
      \ up on you when you screw up. Luckily, the reload screen is very quick . \n\
      There is a very easy mode for young kids who just to experience the story without\
      \ dying all the time. It`s a nice addition because the art is very nice and\
      \ will appeal to young kids."
