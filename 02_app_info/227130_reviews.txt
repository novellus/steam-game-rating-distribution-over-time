While the funky premise of an alternative timeline is cool this DLC is far from polished. Even less than the main campaign and this pulls it down. Moving around in snow is tedious and fighting huge groups of soldiers over and over gets annoying. You get the WOLF special ability here and it is set in the Frontier. Also buying this DLC separately is nonsense because it has an open ending and you have to buy the other 2 DLCs to make sense of the story. This DLC is part of both the Season Pass and the Deluxe Edition of AC3 so you could possibly get it through there.\n\n[b]P.S.:[/b] To activate the DLC, write down the CD-key Steam shows you (you cannot copy+paste it), start the game, go to Extras and then to Redeem Code (if it does not work go to uPlay and redeem the code there too), restart the game.\n\n[b][u]*Note: No longer possible to buy.
