      /><br><br>You''re the prototype for a brand new appliance, a 3d printer that
      can make ANYTHING. The only problem? You''d rather be free. CreatorCrate is
      an intense action roguelike full of electrified death traps, terrifying murderbots,
      and passenger pigeons.<h2 class="bb_tag">FAST, CHAOTIC, AND CHALLENGING</h2>Fight
      to stay alive while everything around you is on fire, exploding, or shooting
      lasers. Dangle by your arm over deadly drops. Climb just ahead of fizzing pools
      of acid. Take it one area at a time with checkpoints or crank up the challenge
      with permadeath mode. Procedural generation keeps the action fresh each time
      so you can get blown up and try again!<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1027060/extras/CrCrPigeonsSmall.gif?t=1608749253"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">MORE THAN RUN AND SHOOT</h2>You improvise and create! Think
      on your feet to outsmart complex systems of traps. Will you disable the security
      camera or avoid it by melting through the floor with acid? Will you dodge the
      hulking robot or throw a chair to lure it into a pit? Stab the humans, hide
      from them, or carry them around as your special pets. There''s always another
      solution to every challenge.<h2 class="bb_tag">GRABBY TOSSY PHYSICS FUN</h2>With
      your grabby robot arm you throw people, block bullets with tables, swing from
      lamps, smash brooms into enemies, and devour anything not nailed down. Snatch
      everything you can to stay alive as you scramble over machine gun turrets and
      flaming furniture.<h2 class="bb_tag">CREATE ANYTHING</h2>It''s great being an
      appliance that can make anything. For instance: what if you need lots of guns,
      but all you have lying around is a few humans? EASY! Just use that useless biological
      matter to print out some handy-dandy firearms. In need of repairs? Eat those
      guns and use their matter to patch yourself up! Lonely? JUST PRINT MORE HUMANS!<h2
      class="bb_tag">A BREATHTAKING CIRCULAR WORLD</h2>Experience the wonder of a
      hard sci-fi setting rarely seen in games: a massive spinning space station.
      Gravity shifts as you explore, from the freedom of low gravity acrobatics near
      the center to the terror of being brutally pulled into space at the outer edge.
      In Zero G, you float weightless, run on walls, and propel yourself with the
      recoil of firearms. You can never trust your expectations in this labyrinth
      of curved floors and devious traps.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1027060/extras/CrCrCurvature600.png?t=1608749253"

    short_description: 'Deadly action and slapstick chaos. CreatorCrate is a viciously
      fast roguelike platformer about an appliance that devours everything, makes
      anything, and fights to escape a massive, circular space station. More than
