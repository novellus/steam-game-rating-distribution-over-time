Otherwise, the Photography feature isn’t fully put together and often can be glitchy and unplayable. \nBuy for your collection on sale but reality is it won’t add anything at all to your game-play.","timestamp_created":1608278130,"timestamp_updated":1608278217,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.584352076053619385","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ksK2uvYCeMqQuwI="}
