    review: "I'm really not a fan of this game. I got it because I love simple little\
      \ point-and-click mystery hidden object games (which the main reason I got it\
      \ was for the hidden object aspect, so mission accomplished I guess?). I wasn't\
      \ expecting this to be particularly mind-blowing or anything, but it honestly\
      \ was just frustrating and kinda lame. \n\nA lot of the puzzles you have to\
      \ solve have ridiculous solutions [spoiler] (like having to fill up a teapot\
      \ with a separate glass in a separate room instead of, y'know, filling it up\
      \ in the kitchen like a normal person? Or using a boomerang to cut a security\
      \ alarm wire?? Or having to use a glass cutter to open a glass cabinet because\
      \ there are 'delicate' things inside, but then you use a hammer to smash open\
      \ a piggy bank?? I'm sorry, what??) [/spoiler] \n\nI don't know, maybe the detective\
      \ is just really stupid, but most of those solutions made no logical sense to\
      \ me (as opposed to most games just like it). I didn't mind it at first, as\
      \ it seemed kinda silly, but then it just became frustrating and kinda sucked\
      \ the fun out. Bleh."
