I’ve got\nno problem with it being a physics-based 2D platformer because the whole\nphysics system this game has is great and has a lot of potential, but the issue is\nthat whole ‘hardcore’ thing. \n\nIf you fail a level instead of just restarting the level\nlike a normal game, it instead sends you back to the previous level and then if\nyou fail that back to the level before that. If you are simply stuck on level 3 for\nexample you keep having to complete level 2 before you even get a chance at\nlevel 3 again. It’s frustrating because I really like the way this game plays, I just\nthink that the game should have a casual and hardcore modes instead the it’s\nmore accessible to everyone. \n\nLike I said I really do like this game and its physics\nbut can’t recommend it due to being yeeted back to the previous level all the\ntime. If it changed that and added some general options like changing\nresolution or turning off music (not that I don’t like the music, it’s actually\npretty good) then I would say it’s one sk8ing game everyone should try.\n\nMaybe put them in the game and release it as SK8 2 or\nsomething.
