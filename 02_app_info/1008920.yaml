      /><br><br>So what do you actually do? Well, you search around and solve puzzles,
      and as you do so you''ll be developing a scene in front of you and hearing a
      story. I want to the story to really stand out, so the game has got really beautiful
      pixel art and top notch music, combined with gameplay and narrative beats that
      individually would do a pretty good job of telling that story, but come together
      to really make something special.<br><br>It''s a pretty short game too. I would
      say just over three hours. There are loads of games these days and who has time
      to play them all? I''ve tried to keep things as condensed as possible rather
      than add filler, to be as respectful for your time as I can be.<br><br><img

      gameplay mechanics. It ended up being a LOT of work, but It''s kind of necessary:
