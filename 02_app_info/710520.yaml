    short_description: The near future. The world was flooded with waste from factories.
      Over time, almost all the land is bogged down in the waste. All garbage and
      chemicals were able to reach even to hell itself. Satan did not like it very
      much and he sent his creations to the ground in order to destroy all people
      for this garbage.
