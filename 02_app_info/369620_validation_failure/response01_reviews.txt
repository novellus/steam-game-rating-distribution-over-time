Has the Nostalgia feeling from the atari 2600, Nes days. I personally up voted this on green light \n\nJust about 15 mins of Game play, Assuming you nailed ever track on its first attempt like I did.. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJQvIqANyqo\nPros \n\n-Controls are simple,\n-Game Loads and runs,\n-Old school feel\n-.99c or in my case 1.09 CAD\n-Damage system that effects handling and top speed\n\nCons \n\n-To short\n-Toooo easy,\n-leaves you with the feeling of wanting more\n\n\nNeeds : \n-Track editor\n-remap keys\n-window mode (alt enter)\n-leader, score board or some sort of record for fastest lap/race per each track.\n-different car skins to choose \n\nMy personally challenge to any one\n\nRecord a entire race with, winning and NOT making any contact with any other car on the track..  The hardest part of the game was passes other cars with out contact.\n\nif you made it this far heres my crash fest video \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67o_Qt66Cow","timestamp_created":1432260100,"timestamp_updated":1432824312,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":33,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.629634380340576172","comment_count":10,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjP6+zc0CeurkPA=="}
