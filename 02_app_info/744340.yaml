    about_the_game: "Welcome to Warspear Online! We prepared a gift for everyone who\
      \ has joined us on Steam. It will be useful for newbies, as well as for experienced\
      \ players.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">5 Minion caches</h2><br>It\u2019s dangerous to\
      \ go alone, especially if you are new to this world. That's why we prepared\
      \ several caches with minions for you. There are plenty of summoned creatures\
      \ with various skills in Arinar, but no one knows for sure what caches conceal.\
      \ Your goal is to catch 'em all! Just kidding, no need to catch them. Just open\
      \ a cache and receive a temporary companion helping you in fighting enemies.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Elixir of Knowledge</h2><br>A priceless item that helps gaining\
      \ more experience for completing quests and leveling up faster. Just don't forget\
      \ that elixir's duration is limited, so use it wisely.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Extra\
      \ pocket</h2><br>Each traveler needs a capacious bag. More capacious. And even\
      \ more capacious. This pocket provides additional place for trophies, and we\
      \ hope that it won't stay empty.<br><br>Attention! This gift will be sent to\
      \ your account as soon as this DLC is added to your Steam library. To receive\
      \ it, choose a character that you want to claim the gift with, open the mailbox\
      \ (Menu-Character-Mailbox), choose a letter and press &quot;To bag&quot;.  Notice\
      \ that the gift may be activated only by one character on each account."
