      \ 320 aerosoft all graphics ar medium High and fsrecorder. I Haven i3 and 2gb\
      \ video card 4 GB RAM. \n\nThe textures are amazing and so is the wiew.  The\
      \ cars are well animated.\n\nThe runway 09 has a difficult aprouch and the runway\
      \ 13 has a easy and beautiful aprouch \u0219i this addon ia perfect for everyone.\
      \ \n\nYou can land and take off any plane eaven the a380.\n\n\n\nI got it on\
      \ sale but i think 13 $ is ok.\n\nIf ther's smoething bad is about the parking\
      \ (You dont have jetways) \n\nYou can see buses and fuel trucks and more vehicles\
      \ but You cant interact with them bit i guess You can but gsx for that. Anyway\
      \ it will be the perfect addon If You could interact with them.\n\nBut anyway\
      \ \xEEs a great addonwhith great orice and quality. I would recomend it for\
      \ anybody.It has no problem at instalation and when You but it It appears in\
