    review: "Another piece of childhood secured on steam. Eventually my whole life\
      \ will be ported to steam... One can hope...\n\nCrime Cities is a very old game,\
      \ and somewhat of a hidden gem. Now, its not mind-blowing or amasing or anything,\
      \ but i do remember having an awful lot of fun with it.\nThen again, children\
      \ have a lot of fun with many things... But i did replay this game like 10 times\
      \ throughout my life, so... \n\nThe game's premise is relatively simple, and\
      \ also very old-school type of badass.\nThere's a solar system that was turned\
      \ into a series of prison-planets, each containing its very own set of convicts.\
      \ Something suspicious is happening in this shithole, and a covert operative\
      \ (you) gets sent here to figure out what's going on before its too late.\n\n\
      Your only way of interacting with the world is driving a flying car, which also\
      \ happens to be armed to the teeth. The game is open-world so you can go and\
      \ have yourself some carnage fun (remember getting 5 stars at GTA? You kinda\
      \ can do this here. Kinda...)\n\nOther than that you're meant to go to one of\
      \ the garage-ish spots where you interact with a wonky menu with VERY weird\
      \ choices for controls. INS and DEL buttons, i think? I honestly forgot. But\
      \ its in there, somewhere.\nYou get to pick yourself a contract (mission / quest)\
      \ and do it. \nThe main story ones advance the story, the secondary missions\
      \ provide you with money to upgrade your car: get better guns, shields, etc.\n\
      \nBut other than that: many missions are amazing sources of world-building.\
      \ Contracts for radical zealot groups of all kinds, criminals, just weirdos\
      \ doing weird shit... All kinds of people live on a prison-world, and you get\
      \ to work for them for cold-heart cash.\n\nI'm pretty certain some missions\
      \ are even LITERALLY and INTENTIONALLY unwinnable, as your contractor gets lost\
      \ or dissapears or maybe something worse - never to be seen again, and the player\
      \ have no choice but to go back to the garage, scared and kinda ashamed for\
      \ his inability to finish this mission, actually CANCEL the contract yourself\
      \ and never speak of it again.\n\n[i]No, i don't know any weird alien conspiracy\
      \ enthusiasts, why are you asking me this?[/i]\n\nThe only piece of criticism\
      \ i have is the before mentioned questionable choice for controls, so some getting\
      \ used-to-it might be required to genuinely enjoy the game.\nThere's also a\
      \ weird, uh... \"ADVERTISIMENT\" system where you get spamed with in-game world\
      \ advertisiments like, uh... Painting your car? I had NEVER in my life figured\
      \ out if you can actually interact with those and do something, or if they are\
      \ actually just literal spam in your in-game inbox.\nVery immersive, i tell\
      \ ya. It's just like having an actual e-mail!\n\nI wish this game got some kind\
      \ of a remaster or a spiritual successor. There's some nice potential here.\
      \ Especially seeing how retro sci-fi theme are ressurging back into the mainstream."
