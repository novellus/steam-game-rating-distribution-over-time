    review: '[h1]Overview[/h1]


      [i]The Queen of Blackwood High[/i] is a visual novel set at elite private school
      focused on a transfer student named Brooke who transferred due to bullying issues,
      and immediately ends up on the wrong side of the fear-inducing Kendra with a
      partner in crime named Courtney.  Brooke immediately secures an ally in another
      student named Molly while Brooke makes the most of her situation all the while
      trying to figure out the motive for Kendra''s behavior.


      [h1]Graphics and Sound[/h1]


      The graphics are purely original and the characters (and scenes) are very aesthetically
      pleasing, and with the exception of Molly, come across as very attractive, and
      may be refreshing to some people who prefer a visual novel that features something
      other than anime characters.


      https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1715713124


      The sounds are limited to basic sound effects that are few and far between,
      but the background music not only does it''s job in setting the mood, but is
      also pleasing to the player''s ear.


      [h1]Positives and Negatives[/h1]


      (Note:  These had to be combined because this could go either way.)


      [i]The Queen of Blackwood High[/i] features F+F relationships, which may or
      may not appeal to the player.  (The established term "yuri" cannot be applied
      due to the non-anime style of graphics.) There''s also no sex or nudity which
      can be a good or a bad thing depending on the player''s preference.  (Despite
      the large amount of trashy visual novels on Steam, players have been encountered
      that would rather not have these exciting elements in their visual novels....  Plot
      twist?)


      The number of characters is also lacking, which wasn''t quite so much of a concern
      for another visual novel found here on Steam, but in this case it''s a bad thing
      because [spoiler]it''s not known if it was the developer''s motive, but Molly
      comes across as that unpopular student who attempts to take advantage a new
      student''s ignorance by getting clingy so they''ll actually have at least one
      friend.[/spoiler]


      When it comes to scenes, there''s a significant amount of corner-cutting in
      the graphics.  I know [i]Kindred Spirits on the Roof[/i] managed to get away
      with corner cutting by not featuring the main character''s [spoiler]first kiss[/spoiler]
      due to everything else that was featured, but this is really inexcusable for
      any visual novel to omit this important part of the main character''s life.
      [spoiler]Regardless of the presence of adult material, it''s safe to assume
      that the player would want to see girls kissing girls.[/spoiler]


      [i]The Queen of Blackwood High[/i] does not contain achievements, which makes
      it more difficult for the player to know if they have seen every ending in the
      game.  (The only way the player will ever know if they''ve seen anything is
      from the unique pictures that have been unlocked in the game''s gallery.)


      [h1]Conclusion[/h1]


      Yes, the author is motivated to write reviews in recent times to help developers
      satisfy Steam''s algorithm so that developers can release market items and have
      in-game achievements officially count on the profiles of Steam users, so go
      ahead and help out the developer (along with an untold number of other players)
      by writing a review, too.  Heck, just adding this game to your wishlist is good
      enough to help with satisfying the algorithm.
