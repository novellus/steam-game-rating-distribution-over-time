Its superficially similar in that you're stranded on an island solving puzzles, and you travel to other worlds. But the puzzles, while challenging and logical to a degree, are a different breed when compared to how the puzzles flow in the Myst games.\n\nThis game is probably great for fans of The Witness, The Room, Rhem, or for die-hard puzzle solvers. For a casual Myst fan, I'd recommend games like Haven Moon or Elansar instead.","timestamp_created":1582076014,"timestamp_updated":1582148908,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvo7br/ACdPaX8wE="}
