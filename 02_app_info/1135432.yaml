    review: "This isnt NFS so dont expect a ton of custom selections for car parts,\
      \ but i was more then happy with the handful of custom parts that the game has.\
      \ \nmuch more to say then other racing games that are fairly niche specific\
      \ such as DIRT RALLY , SPIN tires ETC.. i had zero expectations to be able to\
      \ do anything but slap some paint , and  a livery on the car but was shocked\
      \ to see that as well as rims, bumpers , hoods , spoilers and reinforcements.\n\
      \ncool off cars that you can tell exactly what they are, and a bumping soundtrack\
      \ , Awesome game (Y)"
