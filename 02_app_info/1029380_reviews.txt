Also, you can kill the monsters for achievements, but why would you do that? I did that, and I feel terrible. All the dating options are cute--my favorites were Bailey, Shawn, and the Sasquatch. The only recommendation I'd make is possibly adding a skip function for text that was already seen, since if you want to date everyone, you'll be seeing a lot of repeating dialogue.","timestamp_created":1609289277,"timestamp_updated":1609289277,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45LPH2PYCf8/PvgI="}
