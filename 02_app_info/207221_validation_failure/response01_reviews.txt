Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2 had more options than this: you can't even change the controls. For how I love all the old content brought back I must advise you against this piece of junk. I bought it and the DLC because I'm a filthy fanboy.\n\nAddeddum:\nThis game is completely broken: the physic is so messed up that if you try to jump on a rail too close to you, you get literally shoot in the air through the whole map. For some reason I can't perform special tricks: it's a common issue apparently, if you browse the forums, and turns out that to fix it you have to clear the special trick list and select the tricks again. Too bad it worked only for a single special move, then it was broken again and the game refused to let me perform special moves.\n\nI'm upset that I can't ask a refund.","timestamp_created":1500167174,"timestamp_updated":1500306459,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494256824254989624","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l/nOqN0CdrmJgAE="}
