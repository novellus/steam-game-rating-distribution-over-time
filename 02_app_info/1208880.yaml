      notes: "Radio Commander evocatively portrays harsh reality of the Vietnam War.\
        \ It uses detailed written descriptions and audio recordings to paint realistic,\
        \ disturbing scenes. Violence, cruelty, profanity and abundant racism are\
        \ all a part of this reflection of reality. The game is recommended for mature\
        \ audiences.\r\n\r\nThe game contains some disturbing audio recordings that\
        \ might not be suitable for children"

    review: "First of all. There is no Squad Management in the Squad Management -\
      \ DLC. \n\nSecond, the game is too short for the roleplaying aspect to matter.\
      \ You can't bond with your platoons when there are only 9 missions in the game.\
      \ \n\nIts... Just not good.. I wish it was better. If you're going to buy this\
      \ game I would get this DLC. But hopefully the developer reads this and tries\
      \ harder on the next game they make.\n\n*****Major Problem********\nHaving an\
      \ entire platoon listed (randomly?) from #1 to #36 with absolutely no order\
      \ of battle is just BAD. \n\nDevelopers. You need to organize these platoons\
      \ into squads with Squad leaders / Machine Gunners / Pointmen etc etc etc...It\
      \ should look like unit cards you can drag and drop into place into the squads\
      \ from the replacement pool. That way soldiers upgrade and the platoon's effectiveness\
      \ is directly affected by the manpower choices the player makes.\n\nI just wish\
      \ this was better. I'm opening up the game after beating it wanting to play\
      \ more.. But theres nothing else to do..\n\n"
