This is a difficult yet fun game, in the same vein as Super Meat Boy.  If its too hard for you there is an easy mode so you could still enjoy it as a casual platformer.","timestamp_created":1584663742,"timestamp_updated":1584663742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw47jU+vACdfyq+QE="}
