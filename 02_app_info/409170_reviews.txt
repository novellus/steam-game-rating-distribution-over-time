There's a bug in the game that makes all of the soundtracks play at once, it doesn't sound too bad some times, but it's not the most pleasant thing to listen to;\n\n2)In the safehouse go till the farest wall to the right and change your tie to blue for SPEEED (cuz health is for casuals and stealth is non-existent);\n\n3) NEVER get the Silenced Handgun, it does 0 Damage to dogs which can easily one-hit you.\n\nP.S.: you can crouch to not die to dogs instantly, but when you stand up you'll die.\n\nOh and when you buy something, you don't get to keep it if you buy something else\n\nAnd most importantly of ALL: the ending is not satisfying at All and Dogs are terrifyingly OP","timestamp_created":1588114671,"timestamp_updated":1588170620,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxo+W4/ECcseXhAI="}
