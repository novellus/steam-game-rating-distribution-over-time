    review: 'One of the best tower defense games ever made, in my humble opinion and
      now it''s available on Steam for just 99 cents. Not bad. If you''re used to
      playing this in Warcraft 3 you might be a little disappointed, though. There
      are some minor, quality of life kind of things missing from this engine that
      WC3 had by default. Also, some of the towers are a little different here.


      But, hey! There''s new maps and game modes along with all the ones from before.
      All my strategies that I used to use with great success still seem to work just
      fine. It''s seriously worth every penny.  :)'
