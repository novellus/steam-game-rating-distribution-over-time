When i reached the end of the game i realized they were just reusing the last stage weapon models and recolouring them\n\nsurprize surprize, the dlc outfits complement the dlc weapons. if you are a absolute colour OCD then this is the dlc to get if you want to use dlc weapons.","timestamp_created":1574278047,"timestamp_updated":1574278047,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596224427223205566","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40ZSSxe4Cd4fD2wE="}
