    review: "This game has a lot of good points to provide people who like rpgs an\
      \ enjoyable adventure for a really cheap price.\nThe pros\n\n1. Art- really\
      \ great art for the characters and monsters you will fight throughout the game.\
      \ \n\n2. Skill system- There is also a robust skill system you can customize\
      \ and fine-tune for each character as they level up. Characters through status\
      \ effects and combo mechanics and depending on how you build them can synergize\
      \ with each other in interesting ways. \n\n2. Price vs value- It's price is\
      \ really cheap for all the custom art and great gameplay provided. I highly\
      \ recommend it for a good time to lose yourself in a game. \n\n\n\nCons- \n\n\
      1- I can't think of any really bad aspects of the game.\n\n2- Anything bad I\
      \ can think of would be more subjective like disliking 16 bit art."
