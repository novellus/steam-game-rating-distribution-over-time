It's short, clunky, and it doesn't feel like a well written story. It feels like a decent first draft/outline, but it's lacking in many aspects. I feel bad being so harsh but after playing other games where I enjoyed the stats, writing, and/or romance, this one didn't check any of the three. Try it out if this is THE genre you're interested in, but if this is just a passing curiosity then I recommend you keep on looking. \n\nStats: Didn't feel relevant to the game. I'm sure they are, and this is honestly the least of my concern since I personally would rather not worry about my stats being high enough to beat a stat check. The problem was, it didn't feel like any of them were really reflected throughout my play through. \n\nWriting: The plot was too fast paced for my liking. So many things happened at once and it didn't feel like it was intentional. It feels like something rushed that someone would later on be like 'huh? oh yeah! I did that on purpose yeah!' when asked. It didn't feel like my character was overwhelmed, it felt like /I/ was. The characters aren't memorable besides how annoying the little sister is. And there's no/very little bonding happening between anyone so it feels like I have no loyalties.  \n\nRomance: The character genders are preset and there is only two R/Os. The two characters are on vastly different sides and even though I'm bi it felt weird being stuck with one option if you were straight. And again, the are on very two different teams so your views/stances might not match up with the gender you want to romance. Everything feels like when you pluck up two things and smoosh them together to kiss. THIS is what disappointed me since it was advertised as a Heart's Choice game, the romance oriented side of Choice Of Games. \n\nAll in all, I was personally VERY disappointed. \n\nIf you want to try it out and see for yourself, go right ahead. And if you like it more than I did then that's great! But this was definitely not for me, and I hope the reasons I listed helps anyone that has similar criteria.","timestamp_created":1604095810,"timestamp_updated":1604095810,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnfPjvfUCdvqUqwI="}
