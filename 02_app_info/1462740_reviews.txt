Not sure what I'm doing in this world, or what is supposed to be happening here. It's very empty with the same trees, grass, flowers and rock everywhere. I get that the creator wants you to explore your way at your own pace in this big open forest, but there is nothing to see aside from a select few landmarks and nothing in place to direct you to see them. You just sort of wander aimlessly. There is collision for the trees, but not for the landmarks themselves. Why? Why am I clipping through the statue and the bench and anything that isn't a tree? I can see trees blowing in the wind, but there is no wind sound effect. I can go down to the lake, but there is no sound of water at the shore, or while walking through it (forget swimming). There are no foot steps or environmental sound effects period. How is the player supposed to become immersed in your world when you give them nothing to immerse them? There is no weight to my character and you do this weird floaty jump when pressing space bar, which makes movement feel like you are floating rather than walking. The same grass and flowers you see on land are under the water in the lake as well. What's that about? Again, not sure what I'm supposed to be doing here. I wandered around for about 20 minutes and then stumbled on what looked like a camp site in a cave and the game just ended and thanked me for playing. I had to Alt+F4 to get out of the thank you screen, because there are no menus or title screen and nothing seemed to be working. The background music is okay I guess and the game does look pretty for screen shots, but that's really the only positives. This is NOT a walking simulator you should play.
