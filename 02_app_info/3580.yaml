    short_description: The Wizard has vanished! The clues to his whereabouts are in
      his workbook, but all the pages are blank. You'll need the Wizard's magic pen
      - and your powers of perception - to guess the image on each page. The better
      your guess, the higher your score, and the closer you are to finding the Wizard.
