(ps more gore please!)  and I look forward to seeing new characters and levels.","timestamp_created":1599765550,"timestamp_updated":1599765550,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwu6LdvPQCeICBoQI="}
