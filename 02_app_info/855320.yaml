    review: 'This is the stupidest VR game I have come across. There is NO LOGIC to
      any of these puzzle solutions! Particularly after Floor 2.


      I did, however, enjoy the first floor. The second floor was stretching it sometimes,
      and required a walkthrough to finish. After that it gets worse and worse.


      Why call a game "18 floors" when it only has 4?'
