Though the game doesn't really change from this formula, I started to enjoy it more and more as I played through.\n\nWith over 1,300 lines of dialogue, every character's personality is detailed enough that you'll want to explore all their possible responses.\n\nDirection wise, this game does not hold your hand. \nThis is a game where you have to play it in one sitting, which is about a 3-5 hour playthrough. \nIf you start playing it for a couple of hours and then come back to it weeks later, like what I initially did, you will have a hard time remembering what quests you were on and will most likely have to create a new save.\n\nThe majority of the game is spent hunting for some important information amongst lots of insignificant choices making it hard to reinforce why what you're doing is valuable.\n\nOn the other hand, the massive amounts of dialogue gives you lots of resources that you can use to piece together the game's backstory & gives you enough information to keep the game interesting though your journey.\n\nThe interactions you have between characters give the game plenty of personality, and doesn't hold back mockery on how society builds off of outdated structures without questioning why they were made in the first place. (Like how the QWERTY keyboard layout survived unchanged from typewriters into the digital age.)\n\nMost puzzles are very simple to complete, but some of the optional ones require a bit of cross referencing to figure out.\n\nIt you're still unsure if you should play this game or not, the demo does a good job introducing you to the mechanics.","timestamp_created":1534719544,"timestamp_updated":1605063039,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gcvN2vUCfOfsqAE="}
