    review: "Requested refund. For $10 i expected a lot more. Just not sure how this\
      \ is a finished product.\n\nI had this game wishlisted and was very excited\
      \ to see more reviews and improvements. But after the news they were removing\
      \ due to receiving more reviews than activation's ?? So I pulled the trigger\
      \ even though I was on the fence based off the 2 reviews I could see for the\
      \ price. \n\n I tried to be patient with it but ultimately its not very nice\
      \ experience. I often glitched into the world where objects disappear leaving\
      \ open white space due to what seems going out of boundaries. Then had to reload\
      \ a save point because I was stuck inside a rock, a tree, the ground \xAF\\\
      _(\u30C4)_/\xAF. Sometimes I could jump frantically toward the path and make\
      \ it out. \n\nThe controls and dialogue seemed slow in responsiveness. There\
      \ are a lot of delays both when moving and choosing dialogue that don't seem\
      \ to make sense for the game. Meaning, doesn't seem like it should be part of\
      \ the experience. You also have to left click your text option, or the arrow\
      \ to acknowledge it and progress. So with 4 monitors my mouse cursor  moving\
      \ outside of the game window was troublesome, and broke any immersion I managed\
      \ to build up. \n\nGraphically there are parts so dark and blurry that its frustrating\
      \ at best to try and navigate. Primarily at the start of the game but also night\
      \ in the woods. \nThe start was a complete nightmare to navigate. First several\
      \ times I tried it seemed there were no options except wait and then run, hurry!!\
      \ It was like blackness and blurs with blinding snowflakes. Trying to determine\
      \ where the smoke was to follow, or even where the trees stopped was impossible.\
      \ You can't run through the trees and you can get stuck on them so a lot of,\
      \ 'hey you were caught'...again! Then the falling snowflakes were blinding in\
      \ addition to the screen blurs that were happening when panning around this\
      \ dark mess. \nAfter 40 minutes or so of this looping madness I was just standing\
      \ there and went to esc the game, but hey! yes controls do exist! The delay\
      \ of dialogue at the start was just THAT slow when you initially start. So by\
      \ reducing a few of the options I could actually see there was snow and trees\
      \ not to run into, as well as the smoke you are meant to follow. \n\nI wouldn't\
      \ mind giving to this/these developers if it were $3 or less. But doesn't make\
      \ sense to me to pay $10 for this experience although s/he will make some bank\
      \ taking advantage of removed game collectors to say the least."
