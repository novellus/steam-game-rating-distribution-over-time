Sure, it's solid and works fine; will run on a potato and might even entertain you for a few minutes... but - feels as generic and as dull AF. \n\nIf you want a game like this, where swarms of enemies come at ya in their droves, you could do a lot worse than pick up something more exciting like Assault Android Cactus, Crimsonland, Nex Machina, Tesla Vs Lovecraft or even Nation Red. Even Serious Sam's Bogus Detour (with its dodgy controller optimisation) or Iron Fisticle/Crypticle do a much better job.\n\nThank You.\n\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvvMSERiysrh0aUgU7T09TA/videos] 40 Genres / 40 Top 10s - Enjoy!
