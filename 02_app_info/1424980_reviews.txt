I wish some of the powers were more clearly explained, and there are a few other UI tweaks that would've been nice, but if you're looking for solitaire with a few variations this game supplies it.  It also has an incomprehensible story that's acted by actors really trying their hardest to sell it - and good for them, really leaning in to an acting job that everyone starts skipping midway through - but that's not really worth complaining about.
