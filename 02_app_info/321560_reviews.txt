Since I remember that, i figured I might as well toss a few bucks their way. 3) Totalbuscuit also did one of his later videos on the subject while citing this game and that article so I also kind of bought this in remembrance of him. Buying an older indie game that may not have gotten the attention it needed. \n\nThe game itself is competent. I haven't played all the way through it, but I can says its definitely worth a few bucks at least. Its filled with levels and there are some high difficulty spikes for those who like that. People want a more chill platform may be a bit mislead by its initial appearance. It is pretty unforgiving at points. Other than that, its a solid platform with an over world and a bunch of decently made levels. Its a game where about phasing and jumping.  The gimmick of the game is that you dive into and propel out of platforms instead of jumping onto them. The physics of diving into a platform can used to propel you up more. The levels do a good job and exploring some of the intricacies of the mechanic from what i have seen so far. Its a lot like what I imagine a trout swimming up stream is like. \n\nIf you wanted a fairly punchy, traditional platformer this is a good choice. It gives you some new ways of thinking about the platforms itself which I think is important to keep your interest in that it mixes up how you view similar levels in other games.","timestamp_created":1604550669,"timestamp_updated":1604550669,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rIary/UCeaaxrAI="}
