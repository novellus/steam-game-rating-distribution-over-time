So there was an improvement in that area. Also, the graphics in this one were pretty good in my opinion. The atmosphere was really good. The scary factor was so so, some jump scares, but really what makes a VR horror game scary is not really the jump scares themselves, but the audio that builds up the atmosphere or sometimes lack of it and if well synchronised with the visuals, you can create some interesting horror experiences. I think also the animation of the 3D models is essential, they look too synthetic in movement, the developer needs to work in that area to make the models more natural. That bird in the beginning scared me the most of the lot, he appeared very real and good timing, that sort of thing is required. I recommend you buy this on sale to support the developer, so that they can make something even better, cause they have potential, but nobody becomes a master at once. It is a journey.","timestamp_created":1589758445,"timestamp_updated":1589758445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43Ji/kvICcLS/iAI="}
