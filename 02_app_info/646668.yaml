    review: It seems that I'm in the minority, but I enjoy the Skyrim table more than
      the others. Doom is fun, but the Skyrim table lets you continue from where you
      left off. You level your character up. Change his equipped weapons and armor
      (the process for getting to that screen could have been much better, but still
      cool that you can do it). Although completing main story quests can be difficult,
      once you get past it you do not have to do that quest again if you continue
      using the same character. If you just want a more conventional pinball game
      then Doom might be your game. If you want to try an ongoing Pinball "story"
      then you might want to give Skyrim a try. Happy Balling!
