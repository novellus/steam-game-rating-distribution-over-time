I dont want to call the game a scam because it shows that there was some effort put into it but 5$ is too much for this game. Its like buying a cup of coffee but just getting the cup with no coffee in it and also the cup has a hole in the bottom...also the cup is half made...and the other half is made out of shit.\n\nWhen firing arrows you dont aim correctly you pull the arrow back to your eye which is a really weird perspective and when firing your arrows you can shoot your own bow with your arrow\n\nIn the cut scenes the characters move around like they are having a seizure. The camera follows them around every where they look and it makes you feel like your character is flying around the screen.\n\nBesides a few villages their are HUGE areas of just empty flat nothingness that you have to stare at as youre running around the map\n\nYour scale compared to building and enemies is tiny! Either every player is a midget running around or this world is run by zombies.\n\nI could go on and on about every issue from glitches to sound, from story to graphics, but honestly I would be describing every part of the game which falls short in almost every way. Might be better in the future but right now Im not holding my breath.\n\nPlay through:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSxQpl7ETDk","timestamp_created":1588117464,"timestamp_updated":1588117464,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.598765432834625244","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvKzL4fECf6+YhAI="}
