    review: 'Instant death instant death instant death. That is exactly what you''ll
      get out of this game. Difficulty is fine, but it must be stressed that it needs
      to be fair which this game seems to actively avoid being. A standard run is
      like this: begin play until you meet a sudden unavoidable death. Play again
      through again until you meet that obstacle and carefully navigate around it
      until meeting your next unavoidable death. Repeat af nauseum. The problem with
      this is that there aren''t any real gameplay elements to break up the tedium
      of rote memorisation of these hazards, which makes it not so much a game as
      a monotonous test of patience.'
