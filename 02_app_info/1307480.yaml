    review: You might enjoy this for a few minutes.  After a short while it's just
      the same missions over and over.  No challenge.  Even at $2 this game is over
      priced.  The developer would do good to drop it a dollar.  I mean, I enjoyed
      it for the first 15 minutes.  That could be worth a dollar.  But I can rent
      a movie for $2 and enjoy myself for 90 minutes.  Based on that...over priced.
