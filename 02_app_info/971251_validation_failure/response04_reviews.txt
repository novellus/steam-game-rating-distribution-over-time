Bought separately that comes to $60 and I got this bundle on sale for $10 so considering that this is a good value. If you want at least two of the included costumes it's better to just pay two bucks more and get the full 15. \n\nWhat's cool is you can do the costume code on all of these for extra effects. The code is after you select your V trigger hold LP,MP,HP,LK and Up on the loading VS screen and let go when the match starts. Some changes are minor, like Cammy puts on a scarf, or Sakura wears a backpack, but for some reason Sagat's totally changes him from boxer shorts to long combat pants and boots. So it's like a secret bonus 16th costume. Blanka's is pretty funny too, he wears piranhas biting him.","timestamp_created":1566076451,"timestamp_updated":1566076451,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i8fb0OwCe9fG0AE="}
