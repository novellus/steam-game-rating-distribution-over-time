Would have loved to grow up learning math like this. Great Edutainment game that makes you think. Although Doesn't have anyone playing it - Multiplayer games need multiple people playing them. If it had more people playing this would be a definite buy. \n\nIf you liked this review [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33220185-VR-Games-and-Tools/]Click here[/url] and follow for more reviews of VR titles.
