    about_the_game: "Grab some friends and step up to the tee as you putt your way\
      \ through nine unique and challenging holes in MiniGolf Mania! We\u2019ve designed\
      \ the controls to be very user-friendly while giving you precise control over\
      \ the speed and direction of your shots. Providing hours of fun and entertainment\
      \ for all ages, MiniGolf Mania is a great game at a great price! <br><br><u><strong>Multiplayer:\
      \ </strong></u><br>MiniGolf Mania can be played solo or with up to four players\
      \ locally. The game supports a single controller feature, so you don\u2019t\
      \ need four controllers to play with four players. <br><br><u><strong>The Course:\
      \ </strong></u><br>MiniGolf Mania has one arcade-themed course, featuring nice\
      \ holes based on some of the classic arcade games including Air Hockey, Skee\
      \ Ball, Whack-a-Mole, and Pinball. These nine holes were meticulously designed\
      \ and hand-crafted, each with a unique layout and challenging obstacles. <br><br><u><strong>The\
      \ Power-Ups: </strong></u><br>MiniGolf Mania also features six unique power-ups\
      \ designed to spice up multiplayer gameplay: <br>\u2022\tFire \u2013 Leaves\
      \ behind a trail of fire, launching any ball that touches it into the air. <br>\u2022\
      \tIce \u2013 Leaves behind a trail of ice that causes any ball that rolls over\
      \ it to slip and slide uncontrollably. <br>\u2022\tBlast \u2013 Explodes immediately\
      \ when used, flinging away any nearby objects. <br>\u2022\tWeight \u2013 Makes\
      \ your ball super heavy, making it immune to fire, ice, and blast effects. <br>\u2022\
      \tJump \u2013 Catapults your ball into the air when used. <br>\u2022\tBrake\
      \ \u2013 Slows your ball down very quickly when used."
