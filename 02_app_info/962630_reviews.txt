It builds an intriguing story between the real, the virtual and the dream world, builds up to a final confrontation and then ... fizzles out, as if the devs ran out of time or money. The ending is a huge letdown, unfortunately. Half an hour longer actually resolving the story in a meaningful way and it would have been a solid recommendation. \nPros: The environments are great, the hacking mechanic works well and the puzzles are logical. The voice acting is decent, too, but there are quite a number of typos in the subtitles.\nCons: Length and lack of satisfying ending. Also, there is only an autosave feature that doesn't save often enough.","timestamp_created":1609784199,"timestamp_updated":1609784199,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49bCn5/YCcLu7wAI="}
