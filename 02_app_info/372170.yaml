    review: "This DLC has no content. \n\nIt does not work until you manually extract\
      \ it from the local game files and start the \"Insanz DRTEST Home.exe\" as an\
      \ administrator. \nDoing only that was already more fun than the original game,\
      \ so I guess this DLC scored fully at improving the experience.\nIf you are\
      \ one of the lucky few to actually run this you will see no change to the game.\
      \ I have no idea where the screenshots on the store page are coming from, but\
      \ since the game is literally unplayabe with so many glitched out parts you\
      \ will not be able to pass you would never get far enough to witness the stunning\
      \ effects of the Dr.Test DLC anyways... I am pretty sure you wouldn't even want\
      \ to see them. \n(If anyone can ever prove me wrong on these then I will instantly\
      \ lose my faith in humanity for containing an individual actually willing to\
      \ try out InsanZ DLCs... That must really not ever happen.)\n\nDon't wonder\
      \ about the price. Since a few months ago this DLC will be add to your library\
      \ for free if you purchase the standard game alone and I doubt they will ever\
      \ have to be manually purchased anytime soon again. At least that's something.\
      \ \n\nSo overall this is nothing but some broken coding, but in fact still better\
      \ than the game, so I rate up, whatever."
