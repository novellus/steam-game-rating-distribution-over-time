      /><br><strong>Welcome to the world sketched on squared paper.</strong> The world
      full of adventures and unexpected meetings. Holidays are just around the corner!
      And our hero is waiting for them so much. But everything is not as simple as
      it seems... <br>Somebody has made a decision on no presents this year, but obviously
      you can't agree with it! Reach the &quot;villain&quot;'s lair and make things
      right. <br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/839030/extras/4.png?t=1559201616"
      /><br><strong>Mad Frost</strong> is a platformer with the elements of a puzzle.
      <br>A sketched story is waiting for you! Each object including the main character
      is sketched on squared paper, taken a photo of and made alive with the help
      of Unity. Hundreds of paper sheets, dozens of writing and sketching materials.
      Everything is for you to enjoy the game. <br>The story is not so long as it
      may be desired, but it is to be continued as soon as possible. All funds from
      the project will go to create the next one!
