    developer_response: "As I said on your Youtube channel\n----------------------------------------------\n\
      \nHey thanks for your review and that you played E06 :)\nFirst: I like the way\
      \ you make your reviews. It looks very natural and sympathetic.\n\nThere is\
      \ no team behind this game. I like to develop video games and slowly try to\
      \ turn my hobby into a profession.\nThis ist my first game :D \nI learned a\
      \ lot during the development of E06 and will implement this knowledge in my\
      \ new project.\nThrough your review, I now also know which weaknesses I urgently\
      \ need to improve.\nYes sound effects are currently a big construction site\
      \ with which I had to fight a lot during the development of E06.\nI will definitely\
      \ work on my knowledge to expand this topic.\n\nOf course you are absolutely\
      \ right it is a puzzle game in ego perspective.\nIt was important to me that\
      \ the player gets as little help as possible because I find today's games too\
      \ easy.\nYour muntion is also your life and it is getting harder and harder\
      \ to keep up with while playing.\nThis is not only due to more difficult enemies\
      \ and bosses but also puzzles that must be well thought out to waste as few\
      \ arrows as possible.\nSo it is sometimes better to shoot the heat arrow and\
      \ make the DoT tick while skillfully dodging the enemy to save arrows.\nWhile\
      \ sometimes a frontal attack with the energy arrow is the better option.\nE06\
      \ is a slow game where many situations require a short break to choose the best\
      \ strategy.\nExploring the environment for arrows and hints for puzzles are\
      \ thus a key feature of this video game.\nUnfortunately, this is certainly not\
      \ everyone's taste.\nNevertheless, I hope that you had at least a little fun\
      \ :)\n\nI have subscribed to your channel :) \nGreetings from Germany and best\
      \ regards \n\nAro Games"

    review: This game has potential, it's one of those puzzle games and you get a
      bow and arrow. The problem is nothing is satisfying in this game other than
      the movement. There is not enough sound effects, not enough animations, it's
      like playing a badass game that is not badass. It feels like a toy bow and arrow
      and I think the bow just needs more sounds and animations to make this game
      fun. Also the bow shoots at a horizontal angle which doesn't make sense to me.
      But on the bright side Aro Games, you have a good smooth engine, you just need
      to work on the action packed satisfaction in my opinion, and just the sound
      overall.
