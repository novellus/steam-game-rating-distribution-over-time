The crafting system adds some flair, and the art style is very unique and deliberate. Overall I only spent a short time playing the game but very much enjoyed the clean design and thus far interesting story. I may come back to finish this in the future.","timestamp_created":1607314726,"timestamp_updated":1607314726,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx4vbnfYCcabztwI="}
