    review: 'This is a very solid game that can easily appeal to people who enjoy
      cars, racing, autocross, etc. I''ve played a lot of different racing games throughout
      the years, from more arcade-like titles to full on racing sims, but this game
      really stands out to me because it''s different than most other racing games.
      It doesn''t try to fit into a certain category, which is refreshing.


      This game is not "super realistic", although that should be pretty obvious if
      you watch the trailer. Physics aren''t completely accurate, some of the cars
      have exaggerated behavior, and you''re stuck in third person. But this game
      is overall very simple, which makes it "realistic enough". You don''t pick up
      this game expecting to be playing a racing sim where you have to be conscious
      of tire heating, aero setups, or locking up your brakes in corner entry. But
      there''s also no "drift button", nitrous activation that spews fire out of your
      tailpipe, or any of that arcade nonsense. You''ve got gas and brake and steering,
      and your job is to use those as expertly as possible to get the fastest time
      on an autocross course.


      There are about 25 cars and tracks each, and all of them feel unique. That''s
      where this game really shines. Again, the physics are aren''t going to blow
      you away, but that allows for cars that each handle noticeably different. This
      makes it fun to try out various combinations of cars/tracks and see what you
      can make work. Oh, and there''s leaderboards for each track, which can really
      suck you in to trying to beat everyone else''s time. The only thing that kind
      of sucks with this much variety is that there are only so many cars that are
      viable for setting top track records. Some of the cars are, to be honest, pretty
      trash. They can still be fun to drive, and there are leaderboards specific to
      each car. But there are really like 5 or so that always end up taking the top
      times across all cars.


      Overall, this game is great. Community is awesome too, there''s a discord which
      is really helpful for new players, and we sometimes have tournaments to play
      for steam gift cards (that''s right, you can MAKE money playing this game).
      I would recommend this game even at full price, and definitely do not pass it
      up if it''s on sale.'
