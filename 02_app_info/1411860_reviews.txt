Hours of puzzles? Puzzles on top of puzzles? More puzzles you can shake a stick at?\n\nThis game is for you, puzzle lovers. Holy crap there are a ton of puzzles. And they're all UNIQUE! They don't repeat\n\nThere is more variety of puzzles in this one game than in 10 years of Artifex Mundi games. Artifex Mundi games are maybe 5% puzzle, and they reuse the same puzzles over and over again. This game is 90%+ unique puzzles.\n\nThis game is from 2015 and is not primarily a hidden object game or an adventure game. It's a puzzle game. It's a bit rough around the edges, but it's good. \n\nNote: this first puzzle may be \"how do I get it to run?\".  If you run it and get a blank screen with delayed sound, then it IS running fine, but doesn't like some Windows settings. Try this:\n\nWin10:\n1) right click on Desktop ---> Display Settings\n2) find \"Scale and Layout\" section\n3) change scaling to 100%\n\nSome say their fix was changing it away from 100% to something else, or doing that and then back to 100%\nAlso: might try (if laptop) changing between integrated graphics and GPU graphics.","timestamp_created":1601678754,"timestamp_updated":1601678754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjcjf9fQCcMq+pQI="}
