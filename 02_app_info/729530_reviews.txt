It is just a novel, but I got it on sale and I'm glad I watched it for it had a good story.  \n\nThere should be many more pictures because the images do move slightly for facial expression.  For example: There is part of the story where the main character is sitting on the floor, but the image shows her standing.  If this was a book, then nobody needs images because we would use our imagination.  But since there are images, I'd expect the developer to have the story follow along with the images.\n\nThe worst thing is that it was too short.  If it were a true novel it would be only about three chapters long.  The ending does make way for a continuation.  Maybe the title should be \"Legends of Talia: Arcadia Chapter 1\".  This way if people like the story then they can purchase the next chapter!","timestamp_created":1609254429,"timestamp_updated":1609254429,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lLzC1/YCd+27vgI="}
