Sadly, good little indie puzzlers are getting lost in Steam's endless catalog of cheap hentai minesweepers or similar games that sell their [strike]stolen[/strike] visuals over an interesting gameplay.\n\n[i]Ah, Love![/i] is exactly the opposite : it doesn't have stunning graphics, but it offers a proof of concept, if not a gameplay that has never been seen before. At first, it looks like another tile-sliding puzzle, and it's exactly what it is. However, it adds a simple mechanic that turns it into a whole different experience : the tiles are different pieces of a maze with two hearts, a pink one and a blue one, symbolizing two lovers that must be reunited. But the lovers are automatically attracted to each other : you can only control them by moving the tiles themselves.\n\nIt's as simple as that, but it works as an idea, and the execution is surprisingly good.\nIt will make you think in a way you're probably not used to in the first half of the game, before you start to understand how it works. All levels are handmade and they appear to be pretty well designed : there's usually one unique good path to take to beat a level, and you first need to assemble the tiles together to see which ones fit.\n\nTo be fair, the game has a lot of potential and could be improved on several levels, especially the textures or the animations (the tiles swap instantly, which is a bit disorienting at first), but the gameplay itself is very addicting, and for the price it costs, you can't really ask for more. The whole \"Love\" theme appears to be very simple, but it works well with a game like that.\n\nThere are a lot of different new mechanics introduced at the beginning of the game, which is an excellent thing in a puzzle game. From level 50 and on, I felt like there was a lot of variety in the level designing. There's a couple new and surprising ideas that really make the game more and more enjoyable.\n\nIn the end, I bought [i]Ah, Love![/i] to support the developer, because it's a very promising puzzler, and I have no doubt with some extra work he will come up with new original ideas in the future and could make great and polished games. I hope this honest review can help.\n\n[Edit 02/2019] : The developer has updated the game with enhanced art and visuals as well as a better menu to keep track of the optional objectives. I can't recommend it enough !","timestamp_created":1549056582,"timestamp_updated":1549724895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.572482824325561523","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48aiz6egCcrviuQE="}
