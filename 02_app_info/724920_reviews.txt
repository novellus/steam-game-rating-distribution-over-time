I really like the style and characters, but there really isn't depth at all. Also, it is pretty buggy at the moment. Maybe one day this could be a cool game, but thus far it seems the devs may have abandoned the project. RIP Starcats, I love you RealCat.\n\n(7 minutes because mainly played via family sharing)","timestamp_created":1567823964,"timestamp_updated":1567823964,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9uTlhO0CdKzl0QE="}
