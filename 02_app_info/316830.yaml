    about_the_game: Sprite Lamp is a tool for combining the styles possible with 2D
      art, such as painted or pixel-art looks, with dynamic lighting found in modern
      games. Game developers will be able to make games in the style of classics like
      Metal Slug or Braid, combined with the gameplay and visual appeal made possible
      by moving or otherwise changing light sources. This is achieved by the artist
      painting an object lit from several directions, images called 'lighting profiles',
      and then processing them into normal maps, depth maps, ambient occlusion maps,
      and a few others. Sprite Lamp also includes a variety of shaders designed to
      get the most out of these maps.<h2 class="bb_tag">How it works</h2>Sprite Lamp
      is all about letting artists paint images in a form they are familiar with,
      and using those images to create the more difficult or counterintuitive maps
      that are required by modern shaders. This primarily takes the form of painting
      the same subject lit from a few different directions - between two and five
      - and processing these images to create a normal map and a depth map.<h2 class="bb_tag">Rendering</h2>Sprite
      Lamp includes a preview window and various shader options to let you experiment
      and find out what looks best with your artwork. Sprite Lamp's shaders are included
      in Sprite Lamp in GLSL form, fully commented, and can be used as a base for
      including them in your own game. A growing list of Sprite Lamp shaders for common
      game engines is available at <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://engines.spritelamp.com"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"  >http://engines.spritelamp.com</a>. Sprite Lamp's
      preview window supports:<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Moveable light source
