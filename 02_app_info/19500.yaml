    review: 'I was probably one of the people who hated this when it came out, but
      I replayed it today and...


      Sure it''s a bit janky, but I seriously can''t fathom how this game got to be
      one of the most hated games of it''s time.


      Eternity''s Child biggest mistake was being one of the first indie games on
      Steam, nothing else.'
