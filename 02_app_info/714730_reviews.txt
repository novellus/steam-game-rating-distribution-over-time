VR Review. Updated Full Review 5/1. [/h1]\n\n[i] Note: I tried both keyboard & mouse and Xbox One controller. I preferred the controller. [/i]\n\n[u] Full Review. I am updating my recommendation to nuetral from my initial impressions review. [/u]\n\nSo my initial impressions review was positive. I am editing the review now so it can be a fuller review of the game and gameplay mechanics. I am also changing my review from positive to a neutral recommendation. I still love the game, but it's so difficult to overlook the current flaws in VR. I only recommend the game for people willing to overlook those flaws. I want to emphasize how jittery the visuals are. I have a strong VR stomach so it doesn't bother me, but it is difficult to ignore. It's so prevalent throughout and seems to randomly happen. The camera controls are also so difficult to overcome. I did find a way to work those controls. You have to constanly hit Y on your Xbox Controller to get into First Person View. This resets the camera to where your character is. From there you can easily adjust the camera. \n\nAlso, during battle, I noticed how some of the combat action text was difficult to read as it was to the very edge of your screen on the left side. Of course you don't need to read it because you can memorize where the actions are on the menu after playing a few times. But it is a very noticeable problem. \n\nFinally, there is no hand holding. After the start of the main quest, you're basically left there with no directions on what to do. I went into many different towns on the map. First thing I noticed is that there is a lot of pop-in errors on the map visuals. But if you keep walking they eventually fill. Several of the areas were blocked off. Several towns were not open for reasons I do not understand. However, some towns are open for you to go inside if you go in the correct direction. Unfortunately, I dont' know a way to know that other than random exploring. You do level quickly. I recommend buying lots of items to restore hp, mana, and cure effects. Kill weak enemies quickly first. You can avoid most enemies. But you probably want to fight them, make money, spend on items, level, rinse & repeat.\n\nMy initial impressions review is below. I only edited the final score. I included screen shots in VR.\n\n---- Original Initial Impressions Review ----\n\nIf you can look past some of the clunky controls and some of the graphical issues, this is a gem of a game for VR. I was actually surprised by how immersive the VR was because the dev seemed to indicate only part of the game was VR or that it was an afterthought. In fact, the whole game works in VR and there's lots of cool options. I do recommend lowering the BGM as soon as you can as the music is by default rather loud.\n\nLet me touch on the bad first, because that may effect your puchase decision. I did notice jittery visuals at times. I'm not sure why, sometimes the visuals look perfectly fine and at other times the whole scene looks jittery even when there's not a lot of movement going on. And getting the right point of view can be very frustrating. The good news is that there are options for controlling the camera and eventually you can find one that is best for the situation. But you will have to get used to constantly playing around with the camera angle. \n\nSo this is classic turn-based action in VR with normal attacks, magic attacks, and use of items. So far I am playing the princess bride storyline and the story is really good. I am enjoying doing the main quest. Each of your companions has unique skill sets to help you out in combat. I liked the art style. I love how you can go into FIrst Person mode and it's just amazing to do in VR. I just wish the combat could have also been as immersive, although it's still classic and satisfying combat.\n\nI also like how the narrative text is done. It's easy to read and done really well. There are some spelling errors, but nothing too major. There's several save points so you don't have to worry too much about dying. There's towns and shops and lots of NPCs to talk to. There's all kinds of monsters to battle. \n\nI think at the current sale price of $5, this is a really good deal. I highly recommend it at that price and I can look past the warts in VR for that price.\n\nRate 6/10. Buy on sale only. Only recommended if you can look past all the problems. There's a good game hidden underneath all the rubble. See photos below for why I like the game.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1375761497\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1375761386","timestamp_created":1525152201,"timestamp_updated":1525229144,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.579424262046813965","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/Livj+MCeYq0nwE="}
