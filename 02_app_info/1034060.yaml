    review: "Short story: \n   Worth it.\nFew bulletpoints:\n   +atmospheric\n   +hardcore\n\
      \   +easy to \"learn\"\n   -basic (cheaply made)\n   -RNG heavy\nLong story:\n\
      \   Well i like it. It Could have been better, but its worth the price.\n  \
      \ Its a roug like mix of metro and stalker (and a bit of dead space).\n   Its\
      \ hard, partialy due to limited controls but it kind of magnifies the horror\n"
