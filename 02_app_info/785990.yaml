    about_the_game: The Hub Culture Virtual Reality experience delivers the world's
      first immersive banking experience and is based on the Ven digital currency.
      Members can access virtual hospitality environments and use their HubID to send
      and receive Ven, message members, interact with a virtual Concierge, Zeke, or
      get some exercise in beautiful environments - beach tennis in Bermuda or downhill
      skiing in Davos.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Use pavilions
      to communicate and collaborate with other hub culture members<br></li><li> Play
      tennis or ski</li></ul><br><strong>Hub Culture</strong> is a global collaboration
      network founded in 2002.  Over 25,000 global urban influentials are members,
      with the ability to build worth through leveraged collaboration. <br><br><strong>Hub
      Culture</strong> operates around three functions - Pavilions (places to collaborate),
      Knowledge Brokerage (consulting and deal services) and Ven, a global digital
      currency. Ven was the first private currency to move into the financial markets
      and is priced from a mix of commodities and currencies.  Ven delivers singular
      global pricing, a great currency FX hedge and green DNA to help support more
      sustainable economies. Pricing is available from <strong>Ven.VC</strong>. Use

      is highly curated and often member generated.
