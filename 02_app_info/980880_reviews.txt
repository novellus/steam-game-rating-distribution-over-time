My point is that maybe there could be added background skins that could be unlocked somehow.\n- Despite that the trailer video had music, the game itself doesn't, which is a shame.\n- The Achievements look close to impossible! A million points? A billion?! TRILLION?! QUINTILLION?!?! No wonder there's such a low percentage of worldwide completion! Sure the screenshots on the game's store page show possibilities but how can anyone possibly be THAT GOOD for the rest, especially with those \"You Win\" and \"You Really Win\" Achievements?\n- The characters have no names that I'm aware of, which is a shame because they all have their own unique trait. Make a list of them and for all 40 abilities.\n- No Trading Cards. Yes, this is obviously my opinion but this game HAS the potential to have this feature. Mr. Sun, with all the different characters and gimmicks you made for Twinfold, I'm sure you can get the mindset to come up images, Steam Profile Badges, Emoticons and Profile Backgrounds for us Steam uses to get a little more for our profiles.\n\nConclusion, Twinfold really is a good game to play; it's just a crying shame that it's also just another in the forgotten depths of Steam players' interest. My additional tags put on for the game's store page isn't enough; maybe Mr. Sun should consider making it better known again if he hasn't moved on to other things...","timestamp_created":1600559073,"timestamp_updated":1600795294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk7e12/QCfubvogI="}
