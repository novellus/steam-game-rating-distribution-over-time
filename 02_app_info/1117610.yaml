      notes: "This is 7776 in which players assume the role of a dwarf or the hobgoblin\
        \ playing on the mysterious machine in Dwarven kingdom. Some scenes depict\
        \ animated sequences of characters in shameless acts: confusing people with\
        \ hexamba, eating poisonous mushrooms, and involved in gambling. Victory scenes\
        \ are graphically depicted with extensive self-harming and large amounts of\
        \ beer. Winners are frequently depicted with happiness and sometimes sincere\
        \ frustration, arrogant smiles, or laying on floor. The game also contains\
        \ references, in animated sequences and text; references to other games. Animated\
        \ sequences also depict partially exposed hobgoblin female's breasts and buttocks.\
        \ The words \"\u0442*\u0433\u043E\", \"\u043B*\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043A\u0438\
        \" and \"\u043A*\u043D\u0444\u0435\u0442\u043A\u0430\" appear in dialogue."
