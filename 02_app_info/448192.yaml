      \ Now you can experience the wonder, beauty, and challenging nature of this\

      \ the first proposals for a railway line between Seefeld and Innsbruck began\
      \ to appear in the late 1880s, and following many disputes over financing, approval\
      \ was granted and construction got underway. Seefeld was to be the original\
      \ terminus, but this was quickly extended to Mittenwald, and eventually to the\
      \ already existing station of Garmisch-Partenkirchen. While pushing costs even\
      \ higher, this extension would allow a seamless connection between Munich and\
      \ Innsbruck.<br><br>The line was opened in July 1912; however, it would not\
      \ be until April of the following year until the planned electrification was\
      \ complete and in full operation. Most railway lines weren\u2019t built with\
      \ the wires in mind, however it was decided to construct the Mittenwaldbahn\
      \ in such a condition to avoid any future work being required; the landscape\
      \ was difficult to work in, getting everything done at once avoided major developments\
      \ in the future, despite the initial cost.<br><br>The Mittenwaldbahn proved\
      \ essential to the locals, and saw a significant rise in tourist traffic with\

      \ this time when modernisation was undertaken to accommodate, including re-signalling\
      \ and station re-builds.<br><br>Today, the Austrian section of the line (Innsbruck-Scharnitz)\
      \ is operated as the S5 line of the Tyrol S-Bahn. \xD6BB 4020s would have dominated\
      \ this service back in their heyday, but the more common traction found is the\
