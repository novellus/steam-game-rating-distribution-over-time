      notes: "I Walk Among Zombies is a zombie survival-themed visual novel game.\
        \ The protagonist finds himself in a zombie-infested japan yet for some reason\
        \ zombies do not attack him and he uses this to his advantage to find safety\
        \ in the chaos.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the game, the protagonist will\
        \ engage in non-consensual sexual acts with zombified women who in their current\
        \ state cannot stop his advances. The protagonist also engages in consensual\
        \ and non-consensual sexual acts with the main heroines. The sexual scenes\
        \ contain no mosaic.\r\n\r\nThis game also includes graphic depictions of\
        \ gore and violent imagery involving zombies and other characters as well.\
        \ Such depictions involve blood splatter and sound effects."

    review: "(Steam wouldn't put my review through for some reason, so I saved it\
      \ and was finally able to post it. Now to work on vol.3 :/)\nNot a bad continuation\
      \ of the story. The plot thickens, as they say.\n\nMy personal opinion is that\
      \ I kinda feel bad for Mitsuki because she is barely a part of the story anymore,\
      \ and we really only get to see and hear her feelings in the additional scenes.\
      \ Although we are introduced to Makimura, the doctor of the surviving group.\
      \ She is extremely endearing when we get to know her more and she overcomes\
      \ her past issues. At first I did not like this direction of replacing Mitsuki\
      \ with Makimura, but now, after finishing it and reading Mitsuki's additional\
      \ scenes, I know they aren't going to be dropping our OG heroine. I just cannot\
      \ wait to see how they have the two women interact together.([i]Let's go harem\
      \ route because I have not forgotten about sweet Tokiko![/i]) \n\nEverything\
      \ about the graphics and sound of this continuation is on par with it's predecessor.\
      \ Nothing really changes except we get a tiny, mini split in the story. I'm\
      \ pretty sure that it was just fanservice though, which I obviously chose the\
      \ first time around because I would not have been able to leave Tokiko behind.\
      \ :/\nI am not sure if they are gonna expand on this in the coming volumes.\
      \ I can see it happening though. It happens in every decent VN, more than one\
      \ heroine/love interest means more than one ending. I forsee the series having\
      \ more choices down the line.\n\nThe story... I really hate that they decided\
      \ to do this series in volumes like this. It does feel more like I am really\
      \ a light novel series because I do not get everything in one go like other\
      \ VNs. It is sorta frustrating because I really want to follow this story. The\
      \ H-scenes are just a bonus at this point. We have the intelligent zombies,\
      \ a possible rebellion at the safe haven, and someone other than our protagonist\
      \ might be able to walk among the dead. I just want to know. Let us just hope\
      \ that volume three does not take another eight months to get to us.\n\nOverall\
      \ I had a good time with this addition. My only true complaint would be the\
      \ length. When you compare to other VNs that have trilogies or just more than\
      \ one entry, I Walk Among Zombies feels [b]painfully[/b] short. Just take Grisaia\
      \ into consideration. Each entry has an immense amount of read time([i]I got\
      \ mine from denpasoft since steam wasn't doing eroge back then[/i]). I probably\
      \ spent well over 100 hours reading the whole trilogy. Just the two volumes\
      \ of Zombies took me almost 15 hours. I feel like they could have just waited\
      \ until the novel this VN is based of off was finished and then made one entire\
      \ game from it that took maybe 30-40 hours to complete. That is my only real\
      \ complaint though, so props to Seacoxx for making a very enjoyable, if not\
      \ short, VN."
