Love playing this game mainly coop with my daughter (8) as it's fairly simple controls and it looks simple, but it does test us! We really like the online leader boards as it makes us want to keep going up the listings. When her friends come round they like playing as well. We have clocked up 14 hours so far, so at present we have had loads of fun for 50p an hour which isn't bad.\nIn coop it would sometimes be nice to be able to pick your own power ups but the ones selected are OK. Sometimes the bottom half of the screen goes grayish so you cannot see the platforms and not sure if that is meant to do that or its a bug. Some platforms you can't hit the edge and jump up, which is good as makes it a little harder.\nVerses is good fun as well, being the last to die. And Dave, watch out for Dave!\nWe have 2 controllers but if using those we cannot have a 3rd player using a keyboard which would be good sometimes to have.\nOverall I would highly recommend this game, as you don't need to input loads of time to learn, you can just dive in, have some fun and come out again. It's also a good game if you want your younger child to get used to the controller buttons as not many to master and no need to worry with movement.\n","timestamp_created":1562013711,"timestamp_updated":1562013711,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qbfR1+sCevWRygE="}
