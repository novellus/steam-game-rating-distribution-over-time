There's not a lot of challenge, you just hold the right arrow key and occasionally jump. In my opinion, such a short game is not worth paying any money for.\n\nI can see the formula for a good game here, the controls were fine and the graphics had a nice retro charm to them. Unfortunately, there are 2 levels in this game and not much else.","timestamp_created":1573248319,"timestamp_updated":1573248319,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561348378658294678","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44Ye6pu4CfqzQ2AE="}
