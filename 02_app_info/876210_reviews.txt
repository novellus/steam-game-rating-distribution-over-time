There's just better ones (even some free ones). I would have recommended this game / app, but one of the major listed features on the store page no longer works. YouTube music integration doesn't work and hasn't worked for quite a while with no response from the dev. As such, I can't in good conscience recommend this game. \n\nYou can still play your own music. I believe it does have to be .mp3 format though. I know that .wav format did not work at all. Adding your own music is very easy and can be done within the app. There are three different environments and four different visualizations. You can also vary the levels control, particles, color length, base & treble height & sensibility.\n\nEven though I only paid .99 cents, I just can't recommend this app where there's a major feature that's advertised on the store page that just doesn't work, especially with no response from the dev. Also, there are better free music visualizers. This isn't a bad music visualizer though. If you're looking for one where you can fly around and where you can easily add your own .mp3, then this may be right for you.\n\n[b]Rate 4.5/10. I would have given a positive recommendation and a 6/10 if YouTube integration worked. [/b]\n\n[i]p.s. Vision VR and Cosmic Flow: A Relaxing VR Experience are both free and much better IMO.[/i]","timestamp_created":1593582298,"timestamp_updated":1593582414,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53271031379699707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi726hPMCcdTqkQI="}
