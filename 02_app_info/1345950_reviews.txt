These new additions increase the variety and challenge from the original game, making it perfect for veterans who want a new spin on the original formula. It also adds an in-game leaderboard so you can see how much better your friends are at the game than you.\n\nThis is one of the better games I've played this year, and given that I'm far from skilled at it, let alone a veteran of the original, I nominated it for the 2020 \"Best Game You Suck At\" Steam award.","timestamp_created":1606715277,"timestamp_updated":1606734589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.623137474060058594","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xIW2jPYCe+rStQI="}
