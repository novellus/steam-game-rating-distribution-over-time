    about_the_game: God created the world in seven days. It only took one day for
      humans to destroy the world. Life as we knew it sank to the depths of the sea...until
      yesterday. We do not yet know the broken world and the reasons left behind there.
      An earth where ruins drift about. Buildings, houses, light posts. Cars, traffic
      lights, asphalt... Modern civilization was destroyed, becoming nothing more
      than debris wading in the sea. New ruins drift one after the other before the
      protagonist, who lives on one of those decaying islands.<br><br><strong>Key

    review: 'Full disclosure: As of writing I have not finished the game. I plan to,
      I am mid playthrough on stage 5 of I believe 8. However I do think I am qualified
      to offer an opinion of the game so far. The story as you may expect from Spike
      is good at getting it''s hooks in you and keeping you invested. 2 character
      arcs in particular have stuck with me. I won''t spoil which ones or what happens
      in them. However get ready for some very uncomfortable and dark moments. Another
      one I found pretty decent and another I honestly felt was a little generic.
      As far as the gameplay is concerned I honestly was not impressed. Odd frustrations
      like poorly explained difficulty levels, the fact it takes an entire day to
      advance 1 floor in a dungeon which can make or break your party, resting drains
      stamina...Somehow catching your breath actively tires out your party. The first
      boss is a poison wielding monster they don''t prepare you for at all in the
      dungeon prior, no antidotes, no instruction on how to acquire them, hell they
      don''t even give you the little tutorial pop up for the poison status until
      you are right in the bosses rad cancer spewing face. These plus some other gripes
      eventually combined to where I swallowed my pride and whacked it down to the
      easiest setting. This strips out the gauge management for stress, bladder and
      stamina as well as removes enemies other than bosses, makes bosses die in 1
      to 2 hits, and removes the cost for certain things like returning to base from
      a dungeon. Essentially it all but plays the game for you. I feel like I am cheating
      by doing this and I feel dirty. I have finished Dark Souls, Nioh, Code Vein
      and got the platinum trophy for Sekiro. Yet I cannot play this game legit for
      fear of ripping out all hair until bald. And even with most of the gameplay
      stripped out it is still a tedious laborious process to get through dungeons.
      There are puzzles, alot of them are brute forceable so you won''t find anything
      as elaborate as Zero Escape here. But even they I find a chore to complete.
      Honestly I want to like this game. I want to recommend it.  And from a narrative
      perspective I do.  However you can also experience the story through lets plays
      and other means, and I would say that is prob your best bet if you want to know
      what this game is all about but want to avoid the frustrating and tedious gameplay
      while keeping your pride intact.'
