    detailed_description: "<h1>From the developer</h1><p>Gurren Boomerang\u3001Skull\
      \ Break\u3001Full Drillized\u3001Fire Cart Kick\u3001Giga Drill Break...<br>Under\
      \ the technology limit and game balance, We reduce most abilities in the game,\
      \ and these can be controlled by your hands.<br><br>If you ask us what we insist,\
      \ so we have to mention the most important feature of Hardcore Mecha------To\
      \ make players feel the mecha from the anime, and this time we did it again.<br><br>For\
      \ example, in the anime when Gurren Lagan throws its glasses out to freeze the\
      \ enemy than raise its giant drill. Generally speaking, these two movements\
      \ should be together and hit the target 100%, but we decide to split them into\
      \ two parts,<br><br>Players will find out Giga Drill Break is hard to hit someone\
      \ who has prepared for defense, so this time you need to charge Gurren Boomerang\
      \ to freeze the enemy, then dash to cancel backswing, so you can start Giga\
      \ Drill Break. When you finish your enemy with your combo, we believe everyone\
      \ can understand why Kamina create these with his life. If everyone can feel\
      \ what Simon feels when he cast abilities, we will very glad to see that.<br><br>Thanks\
      \ to the pilot feature, we can restore Simon in the game. We design ability\
      \ with high damage for Simon------Core Drill.<br><br>Just like the battle of\
      \ the Spiral King in the anime, everyone has a chance to damage the enemy's\
      \ mecha.<br><br>There is still much exciting design in the game, but we hope\
      \ the player can find them out in the DLC. We hope you enjoy the game!</p><br><h1>About\
