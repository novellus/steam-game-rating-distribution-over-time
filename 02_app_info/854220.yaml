      /><br><br>The Season Pass includes:<br>DLC 1<br>BEAST OF WINTER (out now)<br>An
      ancient feud between eldritch powers goes unresolved in the southern seas, and
      only you can halt the mounting destruction. Beast of Winter takes your party
      into the Beyond, a realm of the bizarre, with unique challenges and rewards
      unseen in the outside world.  Plumb its depths to uncover the mystery of a doomsday

      new island full of challenges to overcome and quests to seek lost artifacts
      across the Deadfire. Your party must explore an untamed landscape, rediscover
      ancient relics, and relive historical battles of Eora in your quest to out-live
      and out-kill all who stand against you. (post-launch content, a $10 value)<br>
      <br>DLC 3<br>THE FORGOTTEN SANCTUM  (November 2018)* <br>The great wizards of

      plans will have vast consequences for the future of the Deadfire Archipelago
      as a whole. This endgame opportunity puts you in a position to befriend, betray,
      or befuddle the greatest magical minds of Eora as you uncover secrets lost for
      generations. (post-launch content, a $10 value)<br> <br>*Expansion pack launch
