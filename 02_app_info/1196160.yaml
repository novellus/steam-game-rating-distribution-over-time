    review: 'The theme looked interesting, but it''s actually some phone shovelware
      made with unity.

      If you''re still interested: the crosshair management makes this arcade cover
      shooter very difficult to play (it was made for touch) and the time limit makes
      it practically impossible to beat the first level.
