Once you unlock each pet in-game and get them leveled to about level 30 this DLC becomes pretty worthless since the in-game pets will start collecting much faster with each level. \n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=873140323]Steam Inventory Guide[/url]","timestamp_created":1552694377,"timestamp_updated":1579184652,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.65861821174621582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7q+v1+8CcZ2SvQE="}
