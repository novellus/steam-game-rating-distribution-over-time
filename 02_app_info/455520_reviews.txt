This is why you make the map in photo shop, and load it up in game and use plugins to define where you can and can't walk among other things. This means it does take a bit of skill, and more diffcult then normal tilesets to use.\n\nAlso all these medieval sets are ripped straight from daz 3d store assets. Meaning it makes it very easy to use if you use daz 3d at all for CG. Like I got annoyed when I first saw all the stuff on here is from daz, then realized how much of a pain it would been to get the right angles, and render each one at the right pixel counts to make it myself and went meh this was worth buying on sale in a bundle to save me hours upon hours of work for slightly worse results lol.\n\nJust wish he/she did more daz 3d asset conversions to rpgmaker, would be nice to see a scifi pack or something down road, but I kind of get it these resource packs not exactly cheap on 3d daz store, and I hope they got all the licenses before they made these :P","timestamp_created":1600797542,"timestamp_updated":1600797542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw54C+2/QCcO+zowI="}
