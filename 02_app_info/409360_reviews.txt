Some aspects and mechanics are pretty well made (specifically the slide bar to prevent voiding your save file) and some parts of the game are actually pretty well made. That being said, some aspects of the game are not very well made or fleshed out, and the game suffers as a result. Some enemies and bosses (the final boss especially) are quite tedious and difficult to defeat, causing the game to fall flat. I would recommend this game to people, however for it to be more of a fun experience, some things would need to be improved on to make the game better.","timestamp_created":1586165228,"timestamp_updated":1586165228,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510638296604156494","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnpS0p/ECe5TK/gE="}
