    review: "WOW. What a PHENOMENAL game. \nI can play Shitty Cactus for hours on\
      \ end, I will never get bored of reaching the stars through pure skill and prowess.\n\
      I will hone my Shitty Cactus abilities until I am the best player in the world,\
      \ I will log the most hours and be unparalleled in my vigilance and loyalty\
      \ to this incredible game, my runs will last aeons.\nI highly recommend Shitty\
      \ Cactus to any and all people, it is the perfect game, there are no flaws and\
      \ it is impossible not to enjoy many hours of shitting to the stars with Mr.\
      \ Cactus.\nMy only regret in life is that I cannot marry the Grumpy Mr. Cactus,\
      \ he is an alpha male, perfect jumping form and an iron will to reach higher\
      \ than any cactus has gone before.\nHe has a deep, mysterious look in his eye\
      \ that leaves you longing to look into them again when you're apart, he is so\
      \ strong and determined and resilient beyond all logic.\nI love this game more\
      \ than anything in the world, it is a part of my very being.\nShitty Cactus\
      \ is gospel, and it will bring the rapture. \nAll will be revealed and the searing\
      \ light of a thousand cacti will flood every waking thought of humanity."
