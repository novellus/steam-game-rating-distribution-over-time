      or you can purchase a copy as a gift for someone you know that enjoys tetris

      /><br>Stack a color block next to other blocks of the same color. Combine 4+
      color blocks to remove a group and gain extra moves / time (5+ blocks). Connect
      blocks in a line or diagonally as long as they touch. Blocks groups of the same
      color also need to be<strong> &quot;activated&quot;</strong> by a direct hit.
      <br><i>This allows for strategic hoarding of blocks to increase score and gain
      extra move turns. </i><h2 class="bb_tag">* Some Playing Tips *</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>
      Activations can be made by any color block. e.g. A blue block can hit and activate
      a group of orange blocks<br></li><li> A block going from left to right across
      the board will attach to other blocks in its path providing there is a space
      for it<br></li><li> Placing blocks next to each other in a large group without
      activating will allow you to group up 5+ blocks<br></li><li> Blocks can be grouped
      if they touch side by side or diagonally<br></li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">RELEASING
      BLOCKS</h2>Clicking the activators around the board perimeter releases a block.
      Hold down the mouse to see the direction line of the block.<br>The block displayed

      /><br>The game plays with relaxing music to create a calming and enjoyable gaming
      experience and also comes with a <strong>Learning mode</strong>.<br><br>There
      are 3 modes of play currently...<br><br>1. <strong>LEVEL MODE</strong>: Level
      progression, where player must advance through puzzle levels that increase in
      difficulty, using a limited amount of moves and your brain. Players can take
      their time choosing their next move.<br><br>2. <strong>TIMER MODE</strong>:
      The second play mode is one that produces procedural levels that increase in
      difficultly along with a countdown timer. Win extra time by activating 5+ blocks
      together. This requires fast thinking to advance to the next level. You need
      to keep a clear head and remain calm to advance far on the timer play mode.
      This mode is not relaxing unless you get into the zone and feel as one with
      the blocks. :)<br><br>3. <strong>ARCADE MODE</strong>: Starts slowly, but as
      time passes more blocks emerge on the board to clear away. The blocks are released
      from the heavens by the spirits that float around your screen.<h2 class="bb_tag">TEAM
