    legal_notice: Although the Sphaeres VR Experiences are intended to be calming
      and relaxing, some people may experience discomfort due to the nature of immersive
      Virtual Reality and 360 degree videos. Should you experience any discomfort
      we recommend taking off your VR headset immediately and to sit or lie down until
      your discomfort has passed. We take no responsibility for any injuries, accidents
      or discomforts caused during or after watching our 360 degree VR video experiences.
      You watch 360 VR video experiences entirely at your own risk and we recommend
      that you closely familiarise yourself with the risk of using VR headsets before
      use and that you closely read and follow the manufacturer's guidelines of your
      particular VR headset.

    review: "If I purchase a video, I expect to be able to download it and use it,\
      \ even when off-line. If you pay to stream that's one thing, but if you pay\
      \ to purchase, then you should be able to use it off-line, just like any game\
      \ you purchase, just like movies and tv you purchase from video services. If\
      \ you pay to stream you have to be connected to use, but if you pay to purchase\
      \ and can't use it off-line it's like you got deceived into paying for what\
      \ is really streaming only. I purchased the full group of videos, my cable went\
      \ down, due to technical issues on their end, so wasn't able to watch the videos\
      \ I'd just purchased. \nIf I purchase a video, I expect to be able to download\
