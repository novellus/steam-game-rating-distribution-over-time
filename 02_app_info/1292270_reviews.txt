It is a beautiful, from only getting slight glimpses on the planetary background of which this game takes place. I love the kill everything theme. It's almost like Acrid from Risk of Rain 1 before landed on the planet in that game. I also love the smooth transition from upright to crawling. I LOVE the 3D pixel art and the subtle special effects.\n\nIt is a MASSIVELY ganky though. This is enough to turn off most players. The starting menu is kinda blurry the options menu took me like 6 seconds to understand what I was looking at. I couldn't figure out how to turn around. The crawling needs work. I got stuck on the second level because I died twice to guns. The menu inside terminals it a little weird.\n\nAll in all, this is a good prototype. A good test run of a concept. There is potential, but it needs to be focused, honed, and most importantly of all, released! Please make this into a full game!\n\nP.S. the store page is a little weird. It says Zombie something as a game with a weird release date.","timestamp_created":1600056602,"timestamp_updated":1600056638,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo9ezxfQCdJjZoQI="}
