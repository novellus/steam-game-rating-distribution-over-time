To this day, I'm always on the lookout for a decent Addams Family Pinball table when I'm traveling to different cities, pizza joints, and arcades.\n\nPros:\n-REALLY fun to play with the voices, effects, and variety.\n-This is the TOP selling pinball table of ALL TIME, with over 20,000 sold!\n-Actual real voices of the late Raúl Juliá and Anjelica Huston!\n-Two extra flippers that provide extra skill shot challenges.\n-Starting skill shot is actually repeatable once you figure out the pullback amount needed.\n\nCons:\n-No \"saved ball\" if you lose your ball too fast.  But this feature was introduced in later years (with newer table designs).\n-\"The Power\" (spinning magnets) under the table is really aggravating.  But there is a way to get around it if you're patient.\n-Inversing the key controls for table bumps only seems to work on the horizontal axis.\n\nTips:\nIf you're playing on your TV or big screen, ensure that the TV is set on \"Game Mode\".  This will reduce the screen lag significantly.\n\nThis Season 4 Pro Pack was available for less than ten dollars during the Summer 2017 sale... awesome deal!\n","timestamp_created":1499530318,"timestamp_updated":1499530318,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522293031215667725","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi5q+kd0CfJSqfw=="}
