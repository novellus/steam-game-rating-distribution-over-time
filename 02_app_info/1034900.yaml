    review: "A fantastic remake of a classic gem from the days of the NES. The original\
      \ could be considered one of the early Metroidvania titles before the term was\
      \ ever even coined after Symphony of the Night. Much like Metroid, this is a\
      \ game about exploration and powerups. Explore, and hit a roadblock, go back\
      \ and find a powerup, go back to roadblock and use powerup to get beyond it.\
      \ Rinse and repeat. Powerups can range from double jumps to flight, to weapons\
      \ that can destroy objects blocking paths, and more. What makes Blaster Master\
      \ Zero and the other games in this series unique is how you tackle objectives.\
      \ You roll around in a vehicle with a cannon attached to it, and that is your\
      \ main mode for traversing the massive and tangled platforming areas, but you\
      \ can actually exit your vehicle and walk around. When you exit your vehicle\
      \ you can enter certain areas that turn into top down shooter areas for you\
      \ to explore on foot. It gives you 2 different perspectives and ways to explore\
      \ as well as 2 different styles of action gameplay: A side scrolling platforming\
      \ shooter, and an overhead shooter to boot. \n\nMy only main gripe with the\
      \ game is that they toned down the difficulty immensely. The original was hard,\
      \ but it was not brutally hard. It had your average NES era difficulty. This\
      \ one seems much easier. And it's not just my age speaking. I have played the\
      \ original recently, and it is definitely harder. Part of that could be artificial\
      \ difficulty, the other could just be due to limitations of the NES in terms\
      \ of controls and other things. Granted, while this is easier, it is in no way\
      \ less fun. Some of the things they have added have made for a more enjoyable\
      \ experience, such as new powerups, better graphics and more. It's still the\
      \ same style of gameplay, so if you liked the original, this one is a must."
