That's the downside to the game, im not a great gamer and i blew through multiple endings quickly.  for the price i still recommend it, its a nice little distraction, but dont expect a long story arc or hours upon hours of gameplay.","timestamp_created":1599104834,"timestamp_updated":1599104834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwneuEqfQCfMq7nwI="}
