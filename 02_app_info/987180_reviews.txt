Since it was fairly cheap despite being on early access (Around 9 USD when I bought it. ), I decided to give it a try. I don't really know how will this game evolve but at the current state I wouldn't say it's worth buying even for that much. \n\nYou have 2 types of attacks, dash ability (It doesn't seem to be possible to mix it with an attack. ) and jump that CAN be mixed with an attack. Game uses analog stick for movement and camera adjusts automatically (Though it sometimes gets stuck behind objects. ). You can also grab (But it seems that there's only one grab animation per character. ), block and if your gauge is high enough - use an ability that seems to be similar to a guard impact or use a finisher (The last one takes some time to execute. ). There doesn't seem to be a crouch option, low guard or low attack possibility so despite I played it only against the AI opponent - I'm a bit sceptical to how fun can be a game against a human player without various types of attack and block heights. When it comes to AI - there is no difficulty setting and what you're given is not much. It doesn't really seem to be possible to lose against it and it often gets stuck while running in the corner of the arena or just stands there and does nothing. \n\nI know that it's an early access game (And a fairly small project. ) but at the current state - it's just not worth it. Maybe after some major changes it could become an enjoyable budget (Or free to play with minor microtransactions. ) fighter but it is not that at the given moment.","timestamp_created":1593041907,"timestamp_updated":1593041907,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520547926425933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4082s9PICf778jwI="}
