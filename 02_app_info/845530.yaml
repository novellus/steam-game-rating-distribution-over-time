    review: What rubbish! No save to or load function. No instructions or tutorial,
      not clear what is the point of doing anything is. Also, the land purchase is
      always cheaper that other options. But things randomly do not work. I think
      the game designers have a very long way to go, and a lot of rethinking before
      this is anywhere near ready for retail. It is very cheeky to be selling this
      junk at this stage. Overall, it could have been an interesting game but at present
      it is far from recommendable.
