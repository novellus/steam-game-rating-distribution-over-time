      /><br><br><strong>MAINFRAME DEFENDERS</strong> - tactical retrofuturistic strategy
      game.<br>A computer virus has infiltrated the &quot;Stargazer&quot; research
      complex. Most of the robotic units are controlled by the virus. Lead a squad
      of 4 prototypes on a mission to defend complex mainframe. You''ll have to repel
      assaults, destroy unit fabricators, download valuable data, clear infected nodes,
      and do more on your way to the deepest parts of the complex. Work with item
      limitations and drawbacks to build powerful combinations. Destroy your enemies
      with diverse tactics: overheat them, melt with corrosion, absorb damage, and
      return fire. But don''t rely on a single strategy too much - enemies might have
      a way to counter it. But above everything else: defend the Mainframe!<br><br><strong>*

      /><br><br><strong>* DIVERSE TACTICS:</strong> Cook enemy robots to death, bury
      them under your bullets, eliminate with a single powerful shot, or render your
      opponents useless with debuffs - this game is designed with a lot of viable
      strategies in mind.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1184810/extras/shield-x.png?t=1605008664"
      /><br><strong>* BUILD YOUR SQUAD:</strong> Similar to how in card games you
      have to build your deck, in MAINFRAME DEFENDERS you have to combine different
      items with unique abilities, to create an unstoppable squad. Work with item
      drawbacks or double down on them, creating flawed, yet powerful build!<br><img

      /><br><strong>* UNIQUE ENEMIES:</strong> Enemy squad won''t sit idle, though.
      Each unit has its own role in the squad and designed to counter certain strategies.

      /><br><strong>* PROCEDURAL LEVELS:</strong> Hand-made rooms are combined with
      procedural generation to create random levels. Missions have differing objectives,
      combined with unique mission conditions. Will you accept the challenge or avoid
      the unknown and risk falling behind?<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1184810/extras/shield-x.png?t=1605008664"
      /><br><strong>* PROGRESSION SYSTEM:</strong> Victory or defeat, the game is
      not over yet! Unlock new units, each with a unique set of upgrades and load-outs.

    review: The game will appeal to those who love this kind of extraordinary and
      unusual) Personally, I liked it, I love retro graphics that have their own zest.
      For a non-standard approach, definitely like)
