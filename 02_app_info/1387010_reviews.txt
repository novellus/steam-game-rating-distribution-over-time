My 2nd play through was much easier as now I knew what I was doing, I knew that I had a timer and was going to get attacked in the first place...it's a fairly easy game. Kind of lack luster at the moment but could possibly end up being good depending on the devs. Right now at 10 bucks it's not a bad price but it took me 4 hours to get to a point that I had experienced everything and there was no further to go. My rule of thumb is usually a dollar per hour on a game makes it worth it, so as of right now I wouldn't reccomend buying it unless you're into the genre then it's not bad and will hopefully provide a bit more as the devs get to it.","timestamp_created":1607269704,"timestamp_updated":1607269704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528067529201507568","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwlKyvnPYCfa7ktwI="}
