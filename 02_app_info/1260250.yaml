    review: "This looks halfway done. You can't change keybindings, you have limited\
      \ resolutions to choose from, and if you're like me and hate the tearing from\
      \ missing vsync, well vsync is off and you'll need to make driver config to\
      \ have it on in this game.\nAnd the game itself, well, you start at a beach\
      \ I guess. The whole environment looks kinda weird here, not to mention the\
      \ sea itself which looks like a living blob. The graphics is really poor, yet,\
      \ it runs bad. Then you run towards the forest or one of the sides of the beach\
      \ in hope to find something else than invisible walls, but you'll get disappointed.\
      \ At other points you can walk through solid walls of rock, so I guess that\
      \ makes up for it.\nI feel there hasn't been much work put into the movement\
      \ either, with its 1 frame ducking. \nWouldn't recommend it even if it was free."
