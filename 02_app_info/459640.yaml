    review: 'There''s no shortage of RPG Maker games to be found on Steam, some of
      which

      belong to certain RPG Maker teams. Aldorlea is one of them, having made quite

      a few that have garnered some dedicated fans. Having fully completed this game,

      allow me to say that if you like the games that come from Aldorlea, or are interested

      in trying out one of them, you should steer far away from this game.


      Although this game is certainly nowhere near the standards of Triple A games
      or

      even some of the more professionally made independent games, it''s nevertheless

      shocking to me that Aldorlea would release this game in the condition that it
      was in.


      When asked if the dev would make another game, the dev responded with a no,
      as

      this game wasn''t close to being successful (you''ll find out why). However,
      what had

      bothered me was the developers response, and I quote :


      [i]..."but I guess people prefer the usual RPG formula that most of the other
      games

      follow"....[/i]


      This right here? This just screams of deflection. No doubt the dev had some
      very

      big ideas for this game, but it clearly showed that this dev had little to no
      understanding

      about how to go about doing so. Rather than taking more time to polish and fine
      tune

      the product, said dev just decided to ship it out as is, which is very irresponsible.
      So

      when you see how bad a job they did, and look at the above response, you cannot
      help

      but think to yourself, [u]"the nerve"[/u] to say something like that.


      === The Bad ===


      1) The Interface


      Yes, right off the bat, you''ll very quickly find that the game''s user interface
      and just

      navigating the menu, and other locations to be just flat out awful. The hoops
      you

      have to jump through for the clunky and obviously unoptimized menu is just asking

      way too much from you.


      2) Itemization


      So [i]YOU and who else?[/i] fancies itself as a kind of strategy (?) RPG, and
      like

      in all RPGs, as you get stronger, you''ll need better equipment as you level
      up.

      Unfortunately, the fact that the weapons and items are **limited**, means that

      the player can''t fully outfit their army to prepare for the battles ahead.
      Instead the

      player is forced to choose favorites, which limits the players freedom of choice.


      Also, it makes keeping players decently geared extremely limited, which again,

      considering how ridiculously unoptimized the difficulty of this game is, even
      if you

      just focused on 1 General, they can''t carry the entire game alone. Essentially
      you

      need items, desperately so, to advance, and the game just doesn''t give it to
      you.

      Normally you would imagine this was a creative decision to emphasize difficulty

      or even strategy but I assure you, you''ll very quickly find out that this is
      just yet

      another example of bad development.


      Which leads me to the next big issue : income being virtually nonexistent. Fire

      Emblem, a series not generally known for grinding (at least in the old days),

      had at least some areas where players could grind some iota of currency to help

      bolster their forces. And grinding in general, is as much a staple for RPGs
      as it

      comes.


      Instead, there seems to be only two ways to gain currency : taking over locations

      (the 1st time only), and if you have an item equipped that gives a pathetic
      6 GP

      after every fight. Considering how the further you go, the more expensive things

      get, this is almost akin to the very poor and ultra grindy RPG designs from
      the

      80''s and even early 90''s. Once again, this isn''t a choice to challenge the
      player,

      this is an example of bad development making a decision that ultimately [u]makes

      the player waste their time[/u].


      4) Bad Combat


      By far the strangest (and worst) design of [i]YOU and who else?[/i] is the combat.

      The structure of battles is done by having one of your generals and their small

      party of unique to them NPCs fighting wave after wave of pre-set enemies in
      turn

      based combat until you clear them.


      Now the game clearly doesn''t support this system well, and to make matters
      worse,

      the design aspects of this are beyond needlessly frustrating. If at any point
      in time

      one of your generals is defeated, rather than give the player the option to
      switch to

      another one (which would make sense considering how you are a party), instead,

      the battle simply ends. Which makes one wonder why you''re even in a party to
      begin

      with.


      5) Unbalanced Difficulty


      Because of the mountain of problems caused by it''s unbalanced gameplay, my
      god

      does this mess of a game become unbearingly difficult. So as I stated earlier,
      the

      nonexistent income and poor itemization certainly contribute to the difficulty,
      but in

      truth the real issue is how EXP is distributed.


      Experience points are laughably low, so low in fact that you''ll be grinding
      for hours

      just to make any headway. And to top it off, you don''t get EXP for clearing
      each

      wave, you [u]ONLY[/u] get it after clearing the entire wave entirely. As you
      can

      imagine, you won''t be having the slightest ounce of fun while this is happening.



      6) Terrible Story


      And the coup de grace of this game is easily it''s forgettable (even as you''re
      playing)

      story. Of what little there is shown, it embarrassingly appears as though this
      was the

      dev''s first time at learning how to write a story. The introduction feels lazy
      (so the

      protagonist has a boy/girlfriend, who contributes....nothing to the story. Why
      even

      mention them to begin with?), there is no tension or sense of urgency in the
      plot,

      no proper sense of build up or if there are even any stakes, and literally ZERO

      world building despite the multitude of different locations, races, characters,
      etc.



      So if you''re asking, "is this one of the bad RPG Maker games?", the answer
      is

      with an outstanding yes, this is one of those.'
