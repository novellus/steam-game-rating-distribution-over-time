It is not my kind of game.  I didn't feel like I had much control over my small fleet, and it just was a long 45 minutes watching the battle unfold.  I won, but I don't feel so accomplished.\n\n3/10 at an 80% discount, and I would not buy one of these again I am afraid.  YMMV if you are a seriously hard core naval warfare person and want to see two fleets line up.  I worry they will all play about the same, just with slightly different ships on each side.","timestamp_created":1587861886,"timestamp_updated":1587861886,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.626490890979766846","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww7L82fECdP7AgwI="}
