The strategy layer is very good, giving you the feel of the partisan commander long before Firaxis XCOM-2 managed to do the same. Also, it gives you the feel of the good old days, when you could do the game with the southern officer as the main character just because it makes for a great gameplay.\nBut the tactics need work, definetely.","timestamp_created":1602230837,"timestamp_updated":1602230837,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510935604572296143","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48MuZhvUCdI7ipgI="}
