Originally checking out the game, I was drawn into the simple appeal of a furry visual novel that isn't softcore porn, and I am glad to say that there is very little pornographic material here. However, [url=https://chirmaya.itch.io/vestige-of-the-past]when I looked at the itch.io page online, the last update for the game was nearly a year ago[/url]. So it seems that the developer just wants to make a buck, or see how popular this game is. This, of course, means that there is potential that this game will never get the sequel it baits so heavily at.\n\nThe Good:\n- The art is great. The main characters have multiple facial expressions, and the protagonist has multiple postures, and none of it looks bad. Environments are also nice as well. There is a lot of potential here, and I would like to see what happens next.\n      - Minor side note: Some parts of the later end of the game lack completed visuals. Just something to note. This might have been a version error, but understand that it seems that this demo isn't finished.\n\nThe Bad:\n- The story is weak. The protagonist is motivated initially by a desire to escape that is bluntly but weakly expressed in the story. After that, the character's motivation disappears, until it is injected back into the story towards the end. This left me feeling underwhelmed, as the weak build up tapered off into an equally tepid conflict that ended in an unsatisfying conclusion. This might be a side affect of...\n- ... The story's short length. I think that I am a little bit of a speed reader, but even then, it should only take you between two to three hours to complete the game. While brevity is not inherently bad, it does leave the reader wanting more.\n- The writing is weak. The narrator fails to convince the characters all blend together, as each one lacks a distinct voice that would separate them from generic NPCs. No one character stands out in the writing, and the characters only express themselves within the narrow parameters designated by the author.\n- The lack of choices. Spoiler Alert! None of your choices matter. The choices do not influence the story, and any available options only deliver a bit of exposition before dropping you back to choose again, minus one choice. The lifeblood of a good visual novel is the ability to project yourself through the character, and a lack of significant choices harms immersion.\n\n* A minor note: While the game certainly struggles to deliver a convincing story, it isn't because there isn't a desire to deliver one. The story emphasizes the power of magic, and the mechanics by which it operates. While certainly interesting on it's own, it becomes a dead end when the narrator fails to establish the rules as to how it operates. As the reader, it is hard to care about the power of magic when it seems to be more of a plot convenience than a mechanic. Investment is further damaged by the banality of the story's Groups of Interest, as the few characters that the protagonist interacts with aren't fleshed out enough to draw sympathy towards any side. Even then, you aren't allowed to choose what side you want to ally with, and [b][i]that[/i][/b] hurts the most, as a game with illusory choices spits in your face by not allowing you to decide your allegiances.\n\nThe Ugly:\n- To be frank, little to nothing about this game falls into this category. The graphics are great, the UI is pre-built, and the story is serviceable. With so little gameplay, there is little game to mess up.\n\nOverall, it is a game that has a brain, but lacks an emotional core due to its brevity. This probably won't be a problem in a full-length game, but as it is now it is quite disappointing. Don't play this game with the expectation of a full game, and understand that your five dollars will be paying for something more akin to a demo.\n\nTL;DR: This is not a finished game, but more like a demo. While it is certainly earnest, it is unrefined, and leaves the reader wanting.","timestamp_created":1573452546,"timestamp_updated":1573452801,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535597622394561768","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vozGrO4CcPCp2QE="}
