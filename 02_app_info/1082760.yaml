      Martius is one of Rome's most feared warriors. So, you know, as this is a war
      story, that's gonna have a happy ending. As a war story in Shakespeare Times(tm),
      it will 100% have a happier ending than any other happy ending.<br><br>Yes,
      that's sarcasm.<br><br>Enemies are around every corner. Old vendettas lurk in
      every shadow. War is never over. Navigate Caius through this poorly-drawn (boy,
      that joke is really overused by now) visual novel of battle, betrayal, and choices
      that you have to make every so often that may or may not throw the story in
      a new direction. A direction that Shakespeare never intended. Scary, right?
      Total Death of the Author right here.<br><br>Navigate a weird lil' adventure
      game of war and more war, and sometimes politics. The politics of - wait for
      it:<br><br><strong>Modern Warfare</strong>.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> As
      Caius, the choices you make in how exactly to respond to certain situations
