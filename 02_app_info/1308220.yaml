      \ graphics and sound. Quickly solve puzzles to master the Mojometer, find new\
      \ Orbals characters and unlock special abilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe player\
      \ controls a spherical character called an Orbal through a series of traps in\
      \ order to break all of the colored Mojo Crates in a level. There are over 100\
      \ levels included in the game and all stages are timed. Players can only smash\
      \ Mojo Crates of the same color, requiring the player to roll over special color\
      \ infusers to change the Orbal into the correct color. To succeed, players must\
      \ quickly plan each move in advance to efficiently navigate and clear the stage.\
      \ Orbals characters have unique special abilities fueled by Mojo to help the\
      \ player complete each stage faster. Abilities can only be replenished by collecting\
      \ Mojo Essence from Mojo Crates. The player must smash all of the Mojo Crates\
      \ and Bonus Ice Cubes to advance to the next stage."
