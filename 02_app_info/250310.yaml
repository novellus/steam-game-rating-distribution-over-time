    review: 'This is one of the best fighters to get started with in DCS World. The
      pit isn''t clickable, which makes it much easier to learn, but it does have
      the reworked "Professional Flight Model", meaning that the sensors and operation
      are simplified, but the flight modelling of the plane is on the level of the
      full modules.


      It''s also one of the only FC3 level planes with good tutorial missions. If
      you follow those you should be able to fly it well in about a week. IMO, it''s
      also a better choice than the F-15C to start out with, as the F-15C has a more
      cluttered and harder interface, which might distract you during combat. If you''d
      like to do air-to-air refuelling and carrier ops, think about getting the Su-33
      instead, which is a bit more sluggish but also carries more weapons and is carrier-capable.


      Overall, I''d recommend getting the Flaming Cliffs 3 module entirely, but if
      I had to pick a single plane out of it, I''d pick this one.'
