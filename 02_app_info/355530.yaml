    review: 'This game employs ''dialogue based combat'' to approximate the battleground
      that is a dinner party. To represent this, they have taken the concepts of discourse
      and dialogue and distilled them to an extreme abstract. This. Was. Brilliant.


      Reading a lot of the negative reviews, it seems like not everyone ''got'' it,
      but I assure you, this is one of the most accurate depictions of mincing words
      I''ve ever seen, and it could only be achieved by extreme abstraction. Obviously,
      an actual conversation is a touch more complex than this, but they''ve done
      an admirable job of capturing the tone of discourse without it having to apply
      to any *specific* discourse. Mad props to the designers for coming up with a
      game that basically describes how I interact with the world.'
