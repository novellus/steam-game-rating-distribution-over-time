Has two factions you can playthough as and many different ships and customization options for your mothership, and Interesting abilities on a few of the ships. One i particularily enjoy is the tractor beam which can either repel and attract enemy ships you can use these ships to either keep ships out of your range or to attract them to your broadside frigates, a really nice game mechanic and add strategic depth to the space combat. That's not all there though are many other ships but i dont want to spoil them for you :) \n\n       However my favorite thing in the game is the easy fleet formation. There is a wonderfull hotkey that allows you to draw a formation for the selected ships to form the excact formatino you just drew so its very easy to create simple wedge or half circle formations for your fleets to move in. If you dont like your formation or encounter a new obstacle then simply draw a new formation its so elegant,simple, and yet adds so much depth because the formations really do matter for keeping your ships in range and firing on whatever they counter.\n\nOne thing to note is the tutorial is very nice and explains the game well, which sadly is not always the case in strategy games so the tutorial here is a very nice touch.\n\n Main thing holding game back from being more popular is graphics so if like me you prefer gameplay this one is definelty for you and worth the price.\n\nI will say that many other negative reviews of the game come from early access, i just bought the game recently and there have been several patches to fix the bugs ( i didn't encounter any bugs in my time playing the game)\n\nOverall definetaly worth the price!","timestamp_created":1590114677,"timestamp_updated":1590115184,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581749081611633301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2IWQnfICfeW1iQI="}
