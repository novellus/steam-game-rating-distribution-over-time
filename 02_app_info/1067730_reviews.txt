Sorry devs, I know you guys care about this project but it's... really barebones and unfun.","timestamp_created":1570322256,"timestamp_updated":1571926684,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575795352458953857","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlraI/+0Cc+XM0wE="}
