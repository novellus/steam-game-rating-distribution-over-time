Get this!\nActually want to use them and play some hours? Stay away.\n\nDont get distracted by the big amount of positive reviews. They're simply focussing on the fact that its \"the first modern tank sim\". They disregard its (lacking) features and simply recommend it for the thing it tries to be, not what it is.\n\n[b]Its more like a WW2 Tank Viewer and Tank Ballistics Tester[/b]\nWhy? Because the Tanks (behavior, interior etc.) and ballistics are superior to every other game, while other content simply sucks\n\n[i]Before I continue, most of the negative points are focused on Singleplayer, some of the following points can simply be ignored when in Multiplayer.[/i]\n[i][b]And before you ask, no, its not worth getting it for MP only. [/b][/i]\n\n- No Career Mode (only some scripted campaign which arent that good) and way too few missions\n\n- The quick missions are just head on head duels\n\n- Most of the time its you who is doing EVERYTHING, driving, shooting, spotting, range finding. The friendly AI (no matter if crew or other Tanks in platoon) are almost completely braindead. They do not report enemies, their reaction time is terrible and their formation discipline is non existent (and they also like exposing their side when in a firefight)\n\n- The commander of your tank doesnt even bother to spot or range targets for you, but if youre the commander and you tell the gunner to engage an enemy, he immediately knows the distance. What the actual fuck. And yet the AI handles it like it was nothing. Their range finding is almost spot on. Usually the first shot (seldom the 2nd) lands 5m around you, and the next one hits your tank.\n\n- You feel alone all the time. Also the Key Bindings are overcomplicated. Especially the command system for the commander. \n\"Bruh its a Simulator\" isnt enough. Some Actions should & must be minimalistic like simply TALKING TO THE DUDE WHO IS AT YOUR LEFT FOOT THROUGH INTERCOMS. Or opening your hatch and peaking with binoculars.\n\n- You always must fully expose yourself if you want to look with the binoculars. No option for simply peaking out with them. The commander role is worst and least effective of them all.\n\n[i]Small Unimportant negative point is the lack of official skins. Yes, its up to the community again[/i]\n\nThe devs really wanted to extend their area from aricraft to tanks and suddenly realized, its almost too much for them. Their engine and maps are perfect for Air combat but doesnt fit Tank Warfare. This \"project\" is/was a high risk/high outcome trial. So its a 50/50 chance they'll turn this into a great modern tank sim, or a cemetery for the hopes of tank enthusiasts.","timestamp_created":1608173812,"timestamp_updated":1609875698,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":64,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.80289536714553833","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlbaE6vYCeKDsugI="}
