As usual, some poor guy gets thrown into the deep end and has to save the world. Considering the game starts with him losing his beloved... let's just say he's got a bit of a sword to grind...\n\nThis game is a slight improvement on the previous game, and grips you from the beginning.","timestamp_created":1491910183,"timestamp_updated":1491910183,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491262137889862061","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hdmxrtsCcoTGdg=="}
