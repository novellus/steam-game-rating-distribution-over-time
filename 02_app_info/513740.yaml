      a series of deaths occur, seemingly random at first, but gruesome in their nature.
      One day, you find an object that doesn''t belong in your house. An old, worn-out,
      stained mirror. That is the very moment when you''ll discover that the simple
      mirror isn''t the only thing that is out of place. <br><br>Explore the thriving
      streets of the small suburban area, search through the abandoned houses stained
      by gruesome past, and find out what haunts you through the silver pane of glass.
      As the game progresses and the more you approach the root of all horror, you''ll
      realise that not everything is what it seems. <br><br>Peace together fragments
      of the past events, read between the lines, and look at things from a different
      perspective. All alone in the crowd, the cold grip of a confused and consuming
      rage will coarse through your veins.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features: </h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>A
      detailed and AI populated game world.<br></li><li>A Haunting game atmosphere
