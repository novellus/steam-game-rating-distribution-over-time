    review: An old classic horror game. In Today Is My Birthday you have to advance
      in the game by solving puzzles and avoid being seen by the evil clowns and crazy
      people. If you enjoy horror games and you have guts to solve the puzzles in
      the game, try it out and you would love the game.
