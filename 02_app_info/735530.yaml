      \ /><br><br><strong>This game is designed for windowed mode!</strong><br>This\
      \ game is a time killers game, which is often played in small sessions. So this\
      \ is why this game is a windowed mode game. You can do still uses full screen\

      \ is a little short in time puzzle game, which the game might been used for\
      \ trading cards framing. Im dont want the game ends like that, so this game\
