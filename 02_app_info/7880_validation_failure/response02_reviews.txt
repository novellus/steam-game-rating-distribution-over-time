It looked good and did what it was supposed to do, but since I didn't play it that long, I can't say what I really liked about it.\n\n[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]\n\nI remember this as the first Anno game I ever played.  I was clueless on what needed to be done.  I remember sailing around and just not getting what the point of the game was.\n\n[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]\n\nI tried to take this like a city builder.  It's not that simple.  None of the Anno games are.  So that's why I ended up quitting just after a couple hours.\n\nWhile this game isn't on the Steam store anymore, there is a remake.  If you liked any part of the Anno series, then I recommend looking into this game.  The setting has a lot to do with it too.  I preferred the futuristic Anno games as opposed to the earlier settings.  Just a thought, as I know that impacted how much I liked each of the Anno games.\n\n[b] Disclaimer [/b]\n\nI have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!","timestamp_created":1609346252,"timestamp_updated":1609369703,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pZr62vYCer3pvgI="}
