    review: "This Visual Novel took me on a ride that I thought would be enjoyable\
      \ but because of all the issues that appeared, I decided not to continue on\
      \ it. I feel that An Octave Higher shows a lot of promise but does not deliver.\
      \ The start of it was alright and engaging. However, the writing and overall\
      \ storytelling kept on bugging me.\n\nThere were places where information was\
      \ dumped onto me, which is never a good sign for any type of writing. It would\
      \ have been better to spread information out throughout instead of trying to\
      \ hammer it in all at once. That way, it's more engaging rather than feeling\
      \ like you're being force-fed content that may or may not be important to the\
      \ overall plot of the story.\n\nThe switch between the three characters was\
      \ confusing too and I can't say whether or not it added anything to the story.\
      \ It's easier to focus on one character\u2014as your main\u2014and getting to\
      \ know them as a person rather than more. It might have been better to let the\
      \ player choose from whose perceptive they wanted to experience instead of the\
      \ forced switch.\n\nThe text is what made me quit in the first place. It's highly\
      \ inconsistent in so many different ways. It also had no character whatsoever,\
      \ which means that it fell flat. The text kept telling me things instead of\
      \ showing, which in writing is a sin. Many words were repeated when they didn't\
      \ need to be and some parts made no sense at all. I had to look up certain terms,\
      \ which I should not have had to do. One may think that using complicated words\
      \ that mean simple things will make you appear smart, it actually has the opposite\
      \ effect. It shows that the writer is na\xEFve.\n\nIn the end, nothing was really\
      \ memorable about An Octave Higher\u2014unless you wanna count it for being\
      \ unforgettably bad. If you want to play it though, then don't let my review\
      \ stop you. Just don't be surprised if your experience turns sour."
