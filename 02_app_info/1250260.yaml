    about_the_game: An old western sci-fi RPG set in an apocalyptic world, without
      any means of defense other than talking. Stranded in the middle of a desert,
      you wake up remembering nothing about yourself. Your memory databanks appear
      to be fried, and the only thing you see when you wake up is a soda machine.
      In 20XX, all currency is defunct, leaving only liquids as the form of currency.
      It just so happens that soda is one of the most valuable types of liquids...
      Not remembering anything, the only logical idea you have is to try and find
      a nearby town to search for a Quarter Dollar, so that you might obtain a can
      of soda.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1250260/extras/Gear2Joyful.png?t=1600547021"
