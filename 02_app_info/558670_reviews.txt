Everyone disappeared and the building was hiding orphans with paranormal habilities. Given the fact that the caretaker is also missing, it's up to you to help them to come back in their physical forms: they're not dead but if you don't hurry, they might be... What is the truth behind these walls?\n\nThis is a sequel to Mystic Hospital and if you've played the CE Edition, you learned in the bonus chapter that a member of a brotherhood is supervising an orphanage... which is Cinderstone. So, it's not a shock to find yourself at this destination. The plot is also good: you help the \"ghosts\" with their most prized belongings and they're giving you their powers so that you can advance in the story. It's just the end that is quite hard to make sense (and it's more confusing in the bonus chapter). Who was really behind all that? I mean, yeah, I've understood who was the real culprit but I still don't understand how he managed to pull all that?\n\nAnyway, Cinderstone Orphanage has the same mechanics of Mystic Hospital: you find items, you use them, you solve minigames and you're searching for hidden objects, some even hidden in hidden scenes (red items). You have also a second type of hidden scenes: replace items at their right place. I would say that the game isn't not so difficult but it's true that some minigames need more thinking. I will not say that everything make sense (it's an hidden object game, so searching for vital items hidden where you don't expect them is normal) but at least, it's reasonable. Besides, I've noticed that hidden objects in a word list often find themselves being used in a replace scene. Also, searching for postcards returned, so, it's nice to have collectibles to find.\n\nThe real new feature is the use of the powers. Mystic Hospital spoke about paranormal stuff but even being stored in the Nexus didn't help. Here, the Nexus comes back but you can use the powers that the caretaker and the kids let you borrow. It means that you can change the size of the items, see through walls, use telekinesis, repair broken stuff or bring pictures alive. That's a nice addition.\n\nThe art is still good and given the time of the year, it's always sad to see an orphanage with Christmas objects and snow being destroyed. But it's not so dramatic, it's perfectly dosed. The cutscenes are also good. What disturbed me most is the ending, it constrast totally with the rest of the game. I also liked the colored powers as they're really indicating which person holds them and in the end, you can see the \"souls\" being related.\n\nThe soundtrack and the voice actings were good too.\n\nI've just a little problem with the bonus chapter: the minigames are repetitive (which is a recurring fact in the series, it's worse in the next game) and you always have the impression that there is more hidden objects scenes than in the first game. I like bonus chapter and as in Mystic Hospital, you get a clue of where your next adventure will happen, but if it's to be axphyxiated by hidden objects scenes and minigames, I would prefer none.\n\nMy conclusion is that this game is still an enjoyable one and while it's maybe an old game, you can still find pleasure in it for the genre. Cinderstone Orphanage is a nice sequel, though Mystic Hospital was better in terms of atmosphere, however, the addition of the powers is a nice feature. So, go ahead for it, you will not regret it!","timestamp_created":1602409766,"timestamp_updated":1602409766,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx5PEi/UCc7yapwI="}
