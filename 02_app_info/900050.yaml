    review: "[h1]What you have in your bag?[/h1]\n\nIt's another game  published by\
      \ Gamehouse which is known for these cute and addictive casual games.\nThis\
      \ time there are some changes and in my opinion they're for the best.\nGameplay\
      \ has not changed a lot. Same old principle is present in Amber's Airline. This\
      \ time you work at the airport and your dream is to become a stewardess. The\
      \ game is very simple but pretty well written for such a small mobile-like game(is\
      \ this on mobile too?).\n\nYou start your career at the airport gates. You check\
      \ passengers, check their bag content, help people to put stuff into their bags,\
      \ search people at the gate and so on. Some actions require to play a 3 second\
      \ mini-game. You just do the simplified version of actions you'd do in the airport.\
      \ \nThere are of course other levels with slightly different jobs so it won't\
      \ be boring and repetitive since locations, story and your job are constantly\
      \ changing.\nYou get a cut-scene before and after each level where the story\
      \ is told. There also are challenges you need to keep an eye for while playing.\n\
      \nThe biggest change comes with a completely new graphics engine. The game is\
      \ now in 3D and it's for the best. The game still retains the old art-style\
      \ and looks extremely cute only now the graphics a more clear, it feels like\
      \ a proper PC game, not a low res mobile port.\nGameplay feels smoother too.\
      \ There's less waiting, people request your assistance instantly so no more\
      \ waiting fro 10 seconds until people make up their minds.\n\nThere's not a\
      \ lot of bad things I could think of. Maybe sometimes the mouse click doesn't\
      \ register if you do everything very quickly after the past action. Other than\
      \ that i'm enjoying this improved version.\n\nGraphics are really pretty, this\
      \ new engine works wonderfully and performs very well.\nSadly there are some\
      \ issues with resolution. I'm on ultrawide monitor. While gameplay scenes seems\
      \ acceptable (only black borders on both sides) the map is displayed in fullscreen\
      \ which leads to some portions of the map cut off. There's no real windowed\
      \ mode for some reason. If I put the game in windowed mode it displays the game\
      \ at the same resolution in a window which leads to even bigger part of the\
      \ screen being cut off.\nJust let me play it in 1080p window please.\n\nThis\
      \ game reminds me of one of those TV movies women watch at Sundays. It's a good\
      \ casual game with pretty graphics and interesting story. Worth getting for\
      \ the fans of the franchise.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*]Good graphics\n[*]Fun\
      \ gameplay\n[*]Interesting story\n[*]Good variety\n[*]Smooth gameplay\n[/list]\n\
