      \ applied a revised livery to their existing stock without the need for repainting!\
      \ This involved the use of vinyl decals applied to the lower sides of the HSTs.\
      \ The existing green and ivory colouring remained but the decal featured a central\
      \ gold stripe and a series of parallel green lines which had the appearance\
      \ of fading the ivory into the green. This early green and gold livery was referred\
      \ to as the \u201Cfag packet\u201D (British slang for cigarette packet) livery\
      \ due to its similarity to certain cigarette packets of the time, and this is\
      \ the version recreated in this add-on. The \u201CNight Riviera\u201D, a sleeper\

    review: "Ich habe diesen Zug im Sale f\xFCr 1,39 bekommen. Diesen Preis finde\
      \ ich in Ordnung. Allerdings ist dieses DLC auch sehr \xFCberfl\xFCssig. Wer\
      \ einfach nur so vom HST fasziniert ist, der ist mit dem European Loco&Asset\
      \ Pack besser beraten. Dort gibt es den HST n\xE4mlich in vier verschiedenen\
      \ Varianten und der HST hat dort auch eine Innenansicht. Was ich an diesem DLC\
      \ sonst noch bem\xE4ngeln muss ist die Beschleunigung. Um 200 zu erreichen braucht\
      \ man bei ebener Fl\xE4che 30 km."
