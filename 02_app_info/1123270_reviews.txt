A reasonably structured roguelike.\n\nBad elements:\nThe UI is clunky (for example the cursor doesn't move you where you intend half the time); very little is intuitive -- it's generally \"die once to learn something\"; and the things that can kill you are way, way too strong. You will eventually run into a ghost that will just one-shot you through your magic shield, max hitpoints and platemail ... from RANGE. One example from many.\n\nFun to play for a little while. Not fun to play after a little while.","timestamp_created":1603006183,"timestamp_updated":1603006298,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+d6nnfUCdprKqAI="}
