    about_the_game: 'Bells ''n'' Whistles is a punishing point-and-click game that
      tests your ability to multitask. The goal of each level is simple: Prevent a
      machine from breaking down. Each machine has a unique requirement you must meet
      in order to shut it off successfully. Failing to maintain the machines many
      systems before it is shut down results in a game over. Are you up to the task?<br><br><strong>WARNING</strong>:
      This game is made to be challenging. Some levels are rigorously difficult to
      complete, but most are beatable. I say &quot;most&quot; because I have reserved
      a section of levels called &quot;Insane&quot; levels. Unlike all other level
      difficulties, these levels will not be tested to see if they are able to be
      beaten. You have been warned.<br><br><i>Note: This game is best played with
      a mouse</i><br><br><br>Oh, you want a longer description? Fine, here''s a list
      of features:<br><br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> 30+ levels, ranging from Easy
      to Insane<br></li><li> A tutorial mode so you stand a chance<br></li><li> Make
      one mistake and it''s game over<br></li><li> Every time you lose, you''ll be
      insulted!<br></li><li> Charming pixel graphics</li></ul><br><br>So what are
      you waiting for? A totally relaxing and not at all rage inducing experience
      awaits...'
