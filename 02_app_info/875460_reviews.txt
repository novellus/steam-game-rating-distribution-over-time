It is possible to have many various faces with different styles, gender, color, et cetera.\n\nRecommended for Indy developers that want to produce 64x64 pixel art faces. I'v been able to create about fifty faces in half an hour. Are they perfectly suited to my use? No, of course not. But it saves me a lot of time, effort and money. I can now adapt one of the standard items (a cap) to my needs and import them into the development software. \n\nThere is room for improvement or a 2.0 version though, such as the ability to create your own items before you make the faces, choosing your own size (now limited to 64x64 or a version of 256x256 which is only a blown up version of 64x64), selecting or filtering between different genders, age and ethnic groups. \n\nNevertheless, very useful for my own purposes and a great time saver thus worth the money. \n\n@Tassilo: if you want my input for a version 2.0, let me know.","timestamp_created":1595658311,"timestamp_updated":1595658311,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41bKpwvMCfdG0lwI="}
