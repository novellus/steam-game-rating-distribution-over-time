    review: HIGHLY recommended! It does start out slow but picks up to some grizzly
      moments, especially in Chapter 4!  You are in the 15th century(or something
      like that) during the Renasaunce period. You are Leonardo de Toledo, (of Toledo)  and
      mentor to a thick-headed but brave apprentice named "Bruno". You have been sumoned
      here to solve a murder(or several). with an Inquisitor on your tail as you try
      and solve these mishaps at the abbey.  You are an investigator, not part of
      the Spanish Inquistion but you are not in good standing with them!  The beginning
      starts out slow, but it picks up after Chapter One. lots of underground exploring
      in Chapter 3 and lots of drama in Chapter 4. nice beginning opening movie and
      nice closure at the end.  Do not pass this up! play this and then go for the
      Director's Cut too!
