[b]I refunded the game but will purchase it again if that is ever fixed.[/b]\n\nThe game is fun, like Hotline Miami if it were an FPS, the combat is fun, controls are tight, graphics and art is very very appealing, sound and music is great, but the g-ddamn loading screens man... Each \"level\" is basically broken into quarters. [b]Because of the above reasons I have to rate it 5/10, if that is ever remedied the game would easily be a 9 or even 10.[/b]\n\nIf you are patient and do not mind the action being broken up frequently by loading screens then I recommend this game to you, if not, then I recommend to wait until a later date where the sections can be joined.","timestamp_created":1609297192,"timestamp_updated":1609297382,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwp6nm2PYCc6TTvgI="}
