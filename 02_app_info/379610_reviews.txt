The puzzles are great, they're not overly animated, but enough to enhance the \"vibe\" of the picture. You can choose how many pieces you want and what kind of pieces so you can tune it to what you want. You can even create your own puzzles for pictures and gifs.\n\nIf you're looking for a Jigzaw game, this is the one I'd recommend!","timestamp_created":1606756521,"timestamp_updated":1606756521,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wtqJjfYCcPv4tQI="}
