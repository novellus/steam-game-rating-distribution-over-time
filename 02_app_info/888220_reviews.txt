They are slowly but surely updating. For those on the fence, try out their first game MatchyGotchy to get an idea of the gameplay. What has been added is many minigames, food to feed them, etc.\n\nAll in all, a charming heart warming experience.","timestamp_created":1561773033,"timestamp_updated":1605767654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwp73N7/UCcdHXxAE="}
