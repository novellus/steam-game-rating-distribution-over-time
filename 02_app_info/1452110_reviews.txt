So in short, I know very little of this game so far. The UI and map are excellent, I'm excited to go back and look at it more. I only took over one single city and explored over half of the map thus far, but it feels good to play.\n\nIf you consider yourself a fan of something, you deserve to something something good review.","timestamp_created":1608919695,"timestamp_updated":1608919695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46cfFzfYCeOmPvQI="}
