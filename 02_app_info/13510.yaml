    about_the_game: "Ubisoft's award-winning shooter that was founded on the PC returns\
      \ with Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter\xAE 2, designed specifically\
      \ for the PC gamer by GRIN. Building on the foundation of Ghost Recon Advanced\
      \ Warfighter, the sequel is a near-future warfare masterpiece. Ghost Recon Advanced\
      \ Warfighter 2 for the PC screams tactics, and you'll need to bring your best\
      \ to bear if you are going to get the Ghosts past their latest challenge...<br>\t\
      \t\t\t\tIt's 2014, and the soldier of the future returns to encounter a new\
      \ and more imminent threat along the recently completed wall on the U.S./Mexico\
      \ border. The Ghosts are more powerful with an upgraded Integrated Warfighter\
      \ System (IWS), but will have only 72 hours to assess the threat and stop the\
      \ rebels from reaching U.S. soil. With a border that's 1,900 miles long and\
      \ an enemy that doesn't play by the rules, this is a job for the U.S. military's\
      \ most elite fighting unit. This is a job for the Ghosts.<br>\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"\
      bb_ul\"><li><strong>Vastly Improved Multiplayer</strong> - Huge variety of modes\
      \ from classic team deathmatch to the exclusive recon vs. assault.<br>\t\t\t\
      \t\t</li><li><strong>Top-Notch Tactical Gameplay</strong> - PC-exclusive tactical\
      \ maps and non-linear missions in both indoor and outdoor environments.<br>\t\
      \t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>More Options Mean More Strategies</strong> - Your team\
      \ is more customizable and has grown with the addition of a communications specialist.\
      \ New team play options abound including the 'bubble system,' which rewards\
      \ players for more cohesive teamwork.<br>\t\t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>All-New\
      \ Battlegrounds</strong> - For the first time ever, the Ghosts will defend U.S.\
      \ soil from a cross-border attack, taking the fight to all-new locations. The\
      \ Ghosts will battle enemies in mountain terrains, barren deserts, and even\
      \ protect their home turf in El Paso, Texas. Each environment presents its own\
      \ benefits and challenges and will call for fresh tactical approaches.<br>\t\
      \t\t\t\t</li><li><strong>More Technology and Firepower</strong> - All systems\
      \ have been upgraded to give players more power and control on the battlefield,\
      \ including an improved Cross-Com. Cross-Com 2.0 will go full screen with the\
      \ click of a button, enabling you to deliver more precise and deadly attacks.<br>\t\

      \ Their AI has been upgraded as well. They'll feed you more of the information\
