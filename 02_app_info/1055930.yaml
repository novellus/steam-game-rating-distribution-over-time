    review: "I really, really wanted to try and like this game, but after trying it\
      \ there's just no way I can recommend it. \n\nThe game promises a feel of PS1\
      \ era games, notably the hidden gems Legend of Dragoon and Legend of Legaia,\
      \ which were two of my favorite titles on the platform. The game fails to live\
      \ up to them in every possible regard, right from the very moment the game is\
      \ loaded in.\n\nThe very first thing you'll notice is that the interface lacks\
      \ polish. While the ingame models certainly have PS1-era graphics, it becomes\
      \ clear that little to no effort was put into polishing the interface. The title\
      \ screen alone feels less like a videogame menu and more like a Powerpoint presentation\
      \ screen. And this is before starting a New Game proper.\n\nUpon starting a\
      \ New Game, you're treated to a simplistic opening animation where you're zooming\
      \ across an undetailed landscape, and a quick rundown is given to you. A picture\
      \ of one of the plot elements is introduced, once again, like a slide in a Powerpoint\
      \ presentation. A tutorial screen is shown that infodumps aspects of the gameplay\
      \ on you (My advice: Do not do this; rather than infodumping the game's mechanics,\
      \ introduce the mechanics over time as the game progresses and give explanations\
      \ of them one at a time.\n\nYou eventually get into a battle, and to start with\
      \ you only have the Attack, Magic, and Defend commands. The interface is somehow\
      \ even more simplistic than at the title screen, and has the feel of a cheap\
      \ flash phone game. The framerate remains terrible, the attacks and spells lack\
      \ impact, \n\nThe character designs look interesting, but overall this game\
      \ is terribly lacking in polish and in substance even from the onset, and is\
      \ riddled with bugs. I can't even begin to recommend it. I sincerely hope that\
      \ the creator intends to improve and to make more attempts in the future; the\
      \ premise is promising but a lot of work needs to be done for the presentation\
      \ to be interesting and enjoyable."
