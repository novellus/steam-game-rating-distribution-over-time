    review: '[b]DLC verdict: Don''t get it[/b] OR [b]Get it in the Season Pass[/b]
      OR [b]Get it in the Deluxe Edition[/b]


      [b]Comment:[/b]

      This is the FIRST part of Tyranny of King Washington. While the funky premise
      of an alternative timeline is cool this DLC is far from polished. Even less
      than the main campaign and this pulls it down. Moving around in snow is tedious
      and fighting huge groups of soldiers over and over gets annoying. You get the
      WOLF special ability here and it is set in the Frontier. Also buying this DLC
      separately is nonsense because it has an open ending and you have to buy the
      other 2 DLCs to make sense of the story. This DLC is part of both the Season
      Pass and the Deluxe Edition of AC3 so you could possibly get it through there.


      [b]P.S.:[/b] To activate the DLC, write down the CD-key Steam shows you (you
      cannot copy+paste it), start the game, go to Extras and then to Redeem Code
      (if it does not work go to uPlay and redeem the code there too), restart the
      game.
