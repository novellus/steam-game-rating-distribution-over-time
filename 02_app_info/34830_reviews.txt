Not because it was fun to play through, but because the thought of paying whatever \"full price\" is on an outdated dumpsterfire like this game. To be honest, I'm surprised I made it through the first mission. What kind of \"stealth\" game with GHOST in the title has at least one section per mission that requires you to go loud? If you want to waste ~5 hours on something that has very little story and extremely outdated mechanics, this game is for you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to consume enough grain liquor to make me forget that I have a steam account.","timestamp_created":1609906487,"timestamp_updated":1609906487,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47e/56vYCc9bzwAI="}
