In the case of this game that extra is adding special powers to suits (like push, bleed, etc). Each turn you get 5 cards, which you can combine into poker hands dealing more damage in a single turn and stacking effects of all suits. However, in most cases it is enough to just play whatever you have. Long levels, and frankly boring fights quickly overstay their welcome for what is essentially a casual game with very little tactical combat and card play.\n\n[h1][b]The positive[/b] [/h1] \n+ Unlockable classes and different special powers of suits is a cool idea.\n\n[h1][b]The neutral[/b][/h1] \n* Some monsters bosses have a LOT of specials characteristics, which could've been interesting if it wasn't a drag reading through all of it, \"hidden\" in the info panel..\n* Art style may not appeal to everyone.\n\n[h1][b]The negative[/b] [/h1] \n- Repetitive combat with that doesn't require much thinking. Drawing 5 cards doesn't offer much decision making.\n- Repetitive music.\n\n[h1][b]Conclusion:[/b] [/h1] \nBland and repetitive combat (yes, I'm aware of the irony using repetitive again) combined with levels that take too much time don't keep interest for too long. However, if you crave SOMETHING to play for cheap and are intrigued by the combination of poker and special suit powers, it may appeal to you. For me, unfortunately, it was not enough.","timestamp_created":1602539236,"timestamp_updated":1602539236,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48142695426940918","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqoWyj/UCf4/DpwI="}
