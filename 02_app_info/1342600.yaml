    review: "This is a very different kind of game for me.  It is not a long game,\
      \ but it seems to have some good replay value, as it is different each time\
      \ you play.  I really liked the way it forces you to think strategically, especially\
      \ towards the later levels.  \n\nEach enemy requires a different approach, and\
      \ there are several strategies you can employ to finishing a level.  The tension\
      \ rises as enemies start to take a more offensive role.  I found myself, after\
      \ failing a few times, learning how to be more careful in where I looked, where\
      \ in the earlier levels, I would try to \"see\" the whole board before making\
      \ any kind of decisions.  \n\nAs someone who is not into strategy games, I felt\
      \ like this was good as an intro to a new genre that can seem overwhelming to\
      \ someone who prefers single player, first person action games."
