    review: 'I first noticed this game because it was very similar to a gamejam game
      me and a couple of friends made for GGJ 2014. If you''re interested in it, it''s
      called "Manhattan".


      I''m not ashamed to say, this game is a lot better than the game we made.


      This game is what I would call a hidden crowd game. Basically, there is a crowd
      of non-player characters that look identical to the player characters, and it
      is the player''s task to conduct an objective without being noticed by other
      players. This is primarily accomplished through careful movement and crowd navigation,
      in order to decieve opponents into thinking that you are an NPC.


      In this particular game, the objective is to kill your opponents. This is done
      through moving up to the suspected player and attacking (by pressing X). This
      instantly kills them and awards you with one point.


      This dynamic is made complicated by the different player classes available.
      At the beginning of each round, players anonymously choose a class, which comes
      with 2 unique abilites. One ability can be used once, the other can be used
      three times, but both interact with the gameplay in interesting ways.


      Will you be a Warrior, who can cause a crowd of npcs to attack, or a Ranger,
      who can feign death by tricking an opponent into thinking they killed an NPC?
      A Rogue, who can clandestinely kill a player without making any noise or visual
      cue? Or a Wizard, who can teleport and polymorph foes. I feel these different
      classes are well-tested and had real thought put into them.


      I hope this game is successful enough to add additional classes, maps, and modes.
      Don''t misunderstand me though, the game is well made as it is.


      Hidden crowd games are an exciting genre that is just getting started, and I
      hope this game carves out a name for itself on the ground floor.'
