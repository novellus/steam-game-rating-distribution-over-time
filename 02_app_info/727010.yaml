      \ a simple yet wild game. <br><br>Enormous amount of enemies will be flooding\
      \ into your site in every level. <br><br>There are so many of them, and your\
      \ last resort is fighting back.<br> <br>You need to try your best to avoid their\
      \ attacks and organise counterattacks. <br><br>Eliminating all enemies is the\
      \ only rule if any. <br>And the difficulties will be increasing as you levels\
      \ up.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\xB7Game Control</h2><br>You can control your hero\
      \ using your keyboard. <br><br>The arrow keys will guide the movement of the\
      \ hero. <br><br>You can use the C key to launch normal attack,<br>and use the\
      \ key X, S, B to initiate different skills.<br><br>You can modify the control\
      \ settings to suit your own preferences<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\xB7The characters</h2><br>There\
      \ are three heroes for users to choose: <br><br>Thor(Wizard) is your initial\
      \ hero, who use a warhammer as weapon. <br><br>Thor is master of thunder power\
      \ and good at AOE attacks. <br><br>Odin(Warrior) can be unlocked by leveling\
      \ up, good at close-in combat using his iron fist as weapon. <br><br>Freya(Archer)\
      \ also needs to be unlocked by leveling up, good at long-range attack with bow\
      \ and arrows.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\xB7Learning the basic skills</h2>Thor can\
      \ learn all skills through passing the levels, while Odin and Freya will be\
      \ unlocked with all the skills.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\xB7Advancing the skills</h2>You\
      \ will receive diamonds as rewards when passing levels. <br><br>And you can\
