    about_the_game: 'Orbital Strike: Arena is a team-based, online shooter for the
      HTC Vive. We''re out to create nothing less than the premier multiplayer game
      for virtual reality. Battle your way across no man''s land and enemy AI drones.
      Use teamwork and tactics to attack the enemy base and destroy their turret defenses.
      Take out their AI Drone production capabilities before making your final push
      on the headquarters. Built for the HTC Vive and a room scale virtual reality
      experience: dodge, take cover, and use your shield to survive. Good Hunting!<h2

      AI drones and static turrets to invade the enemy''s base<br></li><li>Blaster,
      Auto-Blaster, Shotgun, Rocket Launcher, Shields, and Frag Grenades ready for
      Early Access<br></li><li>Holster inventory with fast and fun weapons handling.

      class="bb_ul"><li>Complete redesign of the teleport system. Dash teleport, cooldowns,
      graphical improvements, better use of cover and the tactical value is fully
      integrated into the gameplay. We''ve worked hard on this aspect and we believe
      it''s the best teleport system yet in VR.<br></li><li>Damage system redesign.
      Improved bullet netcode, bullet speed, removed bullet distance limits, added
      scattering as a stat for weapon balancing, and flexible function based damage
      modeling for all weapons.<br></li><li>Inventory and weapon handling redesign.
      Massively simplified the inventory system to make gun-play more fun and exciting.
      Previously this was an overly complicated setup which required multiple menus
      and clicks to grab, equip, and shoot weapons. Now weapons are generated on the
      fly when needed. Simply click the trigger to grab, reload and shoot. Reloading
      is as quick as bringing the controller down to your belt and hitting the trigger
      to bring up a new gun at any time. Tactical reloads are possible and used guns
      are discarded automatically.<br></li><li>Grenade redesign. Grenade throws are
      entirely predicted clientside now so they behave as what you expect from other
      single-player VR games. Grab, hold, and throw using natural motion.<br></li><li>Drone
      and AI improvements across the board. Optimizations, targeting improvements,
      new graphical effects, and health bars.<br></li><li>Added Voice chat. Hold right
      grab buttons for Global chat and left grab buttons for Team chat. We''ve remove
