But seriously this game annoyed me so bad within the first 10 minutes that I don't even want this in my library; and I've kept some really bad games simply because they were cheap.\n---\n\nBefore I begin, let me note: I used to play tons of scrolling shooters when I was younger and while I don't play them nearly as often anymore, I still like to pick one up from time to time for nostalgia. What attracted me to this the most was the trailer which has a cool hard-rock soundtrack reminiscent of the late 1980's early 1990's shooters.\n\nFirst of all, right from the start even with English set as the language the menu and interface are a mix of languages, some of English, most of it, not. I don't know what most of the buttons say and they don't even seem to be consistent between menus. This is a low effort poorly translated mess and it's not making a good impression even just trying to start the game.\n\nSecondly once you figure out how to navigate the menus, you are presented with leader boards to show the top players rankings for each difficulty before you even start the game. Those leader boards are 100% cheated. There's a single player taking up every top score on all three difficulty selections so that no one else can use them at all. Hey, I understand anti-cheat is hard to do; but maybe don't have the leader board be such an up front in your face display. It's insulting that before you even start the game this is presented to you like this. Also, who makes a leader board where the same person can take up multiple places anyway? It should only display each person once with their best score. Otherwise even if they didn't cheat the best player could still make it so no one else ever appears in the list. (except in this case it's very obviously cheated, as in there's 100 of the same perfect identical score repeated on every board from one guy)\n\nSo, let's ignore those issues and start the game:\n\nUnfortunately the next thing I noticed was the music wasn't anything like what was shown in the trailer, maybe something like that shows up later in the game but it's not even in the same style. The music isn't terrible necessarily, but it's a much more routine and generic choice than the trailer would lead you to believe. I could over look that but it was definitely disappointing. \n\nNext comes the poor design choice of how to collect points. You don't get points for shooting/killing, you get points for collecting bits after things die. But those bits \"shoot at you\" for you to collect them. They streak at you just like the bullets, lasers and other attacks from the enemy.\n\nThis is a bullet-hell shooter and the points you are supposed to collect look like the bullets you are supposed to dodge and they shoot at you in a similar way? What kind of idiot design choice is this? In a game where you need split-second decision making and perfect timing to avoid being hit by little streaking lights on screen, they start swarming you with little streaking lights on screen that you are simultaneously trying to collect. \n\nEven taking the time to learn the color differences it's deliberately stressful trying to pick through at high speeds which light streaks to dodge and which ones to pick up.\n\nCan you learn to navigate through this mess? Yes. Is it fun to do so? No.\n\nThis is a functional but ultimately boring side scrolling shooter marred with horrible design decisions and lazy presentation at every step of interaction from the interface to the game play.\n\nAnd I still might have kept it if the soundtrack matched the trailer, but nope; they couldn't even get that right. I play a lot of bad games, many I will suffer through for achievements even if I mark them not recommended for others. But every once in a while a game annoys me to the point I don't even want to keep it in my library. This is one of those games.\n\nRefund please.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]","timestamp_created":1597880825,"timestamp_updated":1608678952,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.584591865539550781","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1597891886,"developer_response":"Hello, thanks for your feedback, it is very important to improve the games already released and bring new games even better. we're sorry that this happened to your game.
