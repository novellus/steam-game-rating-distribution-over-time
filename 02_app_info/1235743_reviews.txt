I would always recommend buying all the Sims 4 DLC when they're on sale, but if you're thinking of buying any of them, I would highly suggest this one for starters. This pack offers a new neighborhood, an entirely new way to play, crazy powers and perks, the entire game is changed as a vampire. I found that this pack goes especially well with City Living, because living in an apartment allows your vampire sim to nearly avoid sunlight, which is very important at the start. As you progress, you can basically become a god among sims. \n\nHighly recommend!","timestamp_created":1609350437,"timestamp_updated":1609350437,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iNuw2vYCevDrvgI="}
