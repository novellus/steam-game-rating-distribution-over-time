    about_the_game: <strong><i>This is the Pre-Alpha release of the game and does
      NOT represent the finished product. It's at a very early development stage so
      that means I'm open for suggestions for the next Alpha releases leading to the
      beta and final game.<br><br>Remember, YOU, the player, are the most important
      part of this project, your review/feedback will determine where this game will
      go.<br><br>I'm always active on forums and social media so I always listen to
      everyone's feedback, don't be shy to message me addressing any bug or stuff
      that should be changed/improved.</i></strong><br><br>The game revolves around
      a very peculiar kind of horror called Cosmic Horror, making the player feel
      the fear of the unknown and unfathomable and struggling to survive in situations
      you may call hopeless. The player will be able to make use of guns, however,
      that will not be the main focus, guns won't be enough to deal with the enemies
      I have in store. You have to use your wits and take decisions in order to make
      it through.<br><br>This first Pre-Alpha demo will have the key feature of the
      game but with some of them still unpolished, you will have access to one long
      demo level with a beautiful immersive environment but watch out, you don't know
      what might lurking behind this landscape.<br><br>You will have access to weapons,
      3 to be precise, but the ammunition will be scarce, you will need to be careful
      with how you use your resources.<br><br>The enemies right now will be demo-exclusive,
      meaning that they won't appear in the final version of the game, those will
      be much more frightening, but that doesn't mean you will be able to underestimate
      them.<br><br>The game will also have one level for it's survival mode, where
      you will face countless waves of enemies charging at you, with very small time
      for you to refill in between. <br><br>More content will come in following updates.<br><br><br><strong>The
      story</strong><br><br>The story takes place on a planet which name is still
      classified, a week prior to the events of the game a scientific research team
      went missing on that planet, they were studying the flora, fauna and vestiges
      of an ancient civilization that disappeared thousands of years ago without leaving
      a trace. Although the planet looks lush and full of life, it's pretty much devoid
      of sentient beings and animals. After many other mysterious events, it was decided
      that military intervention was necessary. An Spec Ops team was sent to the planet
      to unravel this mystery.<br><br>What will their fate be, what will they encounter,
      what lies beneath that God-forsaken rock?

    detailed_description: <h1>30% of the revenue from sales will go to a charity every
      2 months</h1><p>In the last couple years many things happened in my life, my
      dad had a heart attack which he survived, and my mom had two surgeries, one
      of which was for cancer, thankfully she overcame it.<br><br>We overcame all
      of that together but all of that changed me and made me more thankful with life.<br><br><strong>SO,
      MAKING THINGS SHORT</strong>, every two months I'm gonna donate 30% of the game's
      revenue to charity for cancer research, you can also vote and choose for another
      charity where I can donate.<br><br>That's all, thank you.</p><br><h1>About the
