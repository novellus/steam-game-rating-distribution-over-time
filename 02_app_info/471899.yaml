    about_the_game: "The Boeing B-29 Superfortress\u2122 was a giant leap forward\
      \ in bomber technology and production by the U.S. during WWII. Design studies\
      \ for a &quot;super bomber&quot; were requested by the U.S. Army Air Corps in\
      \ November 1939, with a contract for the first two XB-29s\u2122 being awarded\
      \ in September 1940. The first flight took place in Seattle, Washington in 1941.\
      \ Various system and structural modifications were made to aircraft following\
      \ the early test flights. The B-29\u2122 featured a number of firsts, including\
      \ a fully pressurized cabin, electronic fire-control system, and a 20,000lbs\
      \ bomb load. It rapidly found favour with crews thanks to its size, speed and\

    review: I like this plane very much. It's a pleasure to fly. But do yourself a
      favor and purchase somewhere else. At least then you'll have other skins and
      repaints and textures. What you get here is a base skin with no markings or
      paint.
