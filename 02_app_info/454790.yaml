    review: "TL:DR - Decent and cute. Passable.\n\nIt's good - the voice acting is\
      \ alright and the audio quality is okay, but I kinda agree that the script can\
      \ be a liiiittle bit grating in terms of repetition... I think the main game\
      \ is better, but I think that can be reasonably expected! The sound effects\
      \ are kinda varying in quality, some are better than others, and the binaural\
      \ feature is definitely an awesome touch even if it's not the same as the things\
      \ you hear in other drama CDs (or Cookie-tan's videos!) \n\nA great add-on to\
      \ the main game."
