      \ /><br><br>Post Scriptum is a WW2 themed tactical first-person shooter game,\
      \ focusing on historical accuracy, large scale battles, a difficult learning\
      \ curve and an intense need for cohesion, communication and teamwork.<br><br>Experience\
      \ the intense campaigns that were Operation Market Garden, Plan Jaune (Fall\
      \ Gelb) or Operation Overlord which stretched across farms, woods, villages\
      \ and city areas of the Netherlands, Mountains and rivers of Belgium and shores\
      \ of France. Whether you\u2019re jumping out of a plane, arriving in a landing\
      \ craft by sea, resupplying friendlies or operating a tank, you will find multiple\
      \ reasons to drop back into the battlefield in this grand scaled representation\
      \ of a WW2 setting never explored in a large multiplayer environment.<br><br>Post\
      \ Scriptum will cover multiple theatres in the form of chapters, with the 1st\
      \ Chapter \u201CThe Bloody Seventh\u201D being the original setting in Operation\
      \ Market Garden, it covers the 1st Airborne, 82nd and 101st Airborne, the 9th\
      \ Waffen SS and the Wehrmacht, with over 40 vehicles, 9 maps. The 2nd Chapter\
      \ \u201CPlan Jaune\u201D covers the Invasion of France in 1940 and features\
      \ the French Army as well as the Wehrmacht of 1940, dozens of new vehicles,\
      \ 2 new maps with a 3rd still coming. The 3rd Chapter &quot;Day of Days&quot;\
      \ which will cover the Invasion of Normandy in 1944, features new factions like\
      \ the German Fallschirmj\xE4gers and US 4th Infantry, each with new vehicles\
      \ and a few new weapons, and with 2 new maps and a 3rd coming later, which adds\
      \ to the already large selections of maps. Included in this new Chapter is a\
      \ new game mode &quot;Invasion&quot; which puts a twist on the original game\
      \ mode &quot;Offensive&quot;.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/736220/extras/FactionsGIFCh3.gif?t=1607023047\"\
