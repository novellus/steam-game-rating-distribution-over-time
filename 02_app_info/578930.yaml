    review: A simple, basic, and unique platforming game that has a great sense of
      character. The game itself if isn't difficult at all but it is rather enjoyable
      playing each level as it's uniquely designed with a different soundtrack for
      each level. Looking at some of the other reviews, they found that the game is
      more challenging and difficult than I personally perceived. If you're looking
      for a hard-set difficult platformer game, I would suggest something more like
      Spelunky or Noita- but, if you're looking for something to sit back and relax,
      this is a great game just for that. The checkpoint system as part of unlimited
      is great for that specific purpose but the game offers more challenging modes.
      Overall, I would highly suggest this game as it's wonderfully created with the
      melodic soundtrack and the original design for each and every level.
