    review: "- Bad engine sound loop while idling.\n- The usual 'DTM bell' which seems\
      \ intuitively wrong on this loco given its age and type.\n\n+ Snowed-over model\
      \ in winter; matches default Soldier Summit stock.\n+ Extra in-cab camera positions\
      \ representing standing up to see better over the hood.\n+ Working gauge light\
      \ dimmer. Given how (literally) spotty early gauge lights are, this is actually\
      \ a pretty functional addition.\n+ Lots of extra stock with original models,\
      \ supporting dynamic loaded/unloaded states.\n+ Probably the most attention\
      \ a caboose has received in any release for this game \u2014 a unique model\
      \ with six liveries and four passenger view positions (cupola left & right;\
      \ desk; bed). It's only missing the option of crewed versions.\n+ They went\
      \ overboard with the customisable details on this (control binds in manual).\
      \ It's just a shame these variations don't appear automatically at random or\
      \ linked to loco number. It's probably possible to set them on AI trains through\
      \ scenario scripting, but, all the same, these variations will only rarely be\
      \ seen.\n\nNotes on caboose usage:\n\u2022 Table of liveries observed in use\
      \ over the years: https://utahrails.net/drgw/rg-caboose-paint-01400-01439.php\n\
      \u2022 \u2116 01400 appears to have been the sole example in the black-with-orange-roof\
      \ livery, and operated out of Roper on locals."
