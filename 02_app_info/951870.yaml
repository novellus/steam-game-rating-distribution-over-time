    short_description: This is the Prisonbreak Zorbie skin, which reflects his appearance
      when he first exited incarceration. While it is purely cosmetic, enjoy hitting
      your foes with the naughty french convict!

    review: though i like all the skins they are a tad overpriced so i think ts up
      to you what you think but of my knowledge right now this skin doesnt have any
      effects on it except the starting animation (he comes in a police car and thats
      mostly it) but in all out THIS skin is ok if you main him but if you dont just
      dont get it, and for the other skins they are kindia the same some might have
      some effects to em but all out these skins are overpriced.
