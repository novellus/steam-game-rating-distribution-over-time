The textures at the airports are often rather poor and the map is small. The key issue is how MUCH of the map is modeled. I get that it is small, that is fine, I mostly build small missions anyway (I don't even use it for WW2 stuff, I play Il2 for that). I have a problem with the fact that only the area around the French coast is completed. There is so much more they could do, I mean there are airports on the English side but the coast isn't complete and it just seems forgotten.\n\nAnyway, I still give this a positive review because it is a nice change of scenery and if you buy it on a sale it isn't a bad little map to play around with. Hopefully they give it some more love in the future despite the popularity of the Channel map taking over.","timestamp_created":1608914040,"timestamp_updated":1608914040,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzP6vzfYCdteMvQI="}
