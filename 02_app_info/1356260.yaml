    review: "First off I enjoyed the game, it was fun and entertaining and playing\
      \ with a friend was funny and competitive. Definitely a good start for the developer\
      \ and a promising future ahead.\n\nNow there are a few points that I think should\
      \ be addressed albeit nit picking: \n\n- Firstly the food falling, its hard\
      \ to tell the distance from the ground as the shadows are too subtle. A good\
      \ performance and UX tip would be to just instance a circular plane on the ground\
      \ with some semi transparency that follows the x and z axis of the item and\
      \ depending on the distance adjust the size. This was implemented very well\
      \ in the first 3-D Mario games as the player couldn't decipher the characters\
      \ distance from the ground. This feature could work really well for this type\
      \ of game and it gives the game a semi nostalgic style to it that works both\
      \ aesthetically and practically.\n\n- The next is the use of the music. I love\
      \ the idea of adding fun and upbeat music but using a specific genre, i.e tropical\
      \ house, can cut off a part of the market, as I among a few others can't stand\
      \ it. So something more casual game orientated rather than commercial sound\
      \ would be more appropriate but that is a personal preference.\n\n- The next\
      \ is sound mastering. The music and sound affects are near deafening on the\
      \ lowest setting. Personally to have to lower the games volume in the master\
      \ volume control in windows after already lowering it in the game to its lowest\
      \ is very off putting for a game and needs to be adjusted in the engine.\n\n\
      - The missions and game modes are fun and there are many to choose from however\
      \ some repetition makes it feel like a copy and paste but with subtle changes.\
      \ An idea is taking some scenes and shuffling items around with various obstacles\
      \ that a bug would encounter like an empty shoe, wrapper, table leg, dog bowl\
      \ etc, Another idea would be to use things other than a foot stomping like a\
      \ fly swatter and bug spray that leaves an area toxic for lets say 5 seconds.\n\
      \n- Finally UI. UI needs a bit of work as it feels very prototype like and the\
      \ pickup icons are cool but the simple black and white just doesn't pop. Looking\
      \ at maybe some complementary colors like green and yellow with a red outline\
      \ can really make it vibrant. Also adding a kind of size alternation to make\
      \ it catch the eye could really help draw the eye to it better and a satisfying\
      \ sound could + celebratory visual cue like a poof or something could make it\
      \ more addictive to collect them. This could even be implemented with a verbal/visual\
      \ reward for a combo like \"NICE JOB\" often used in Nintendo games to release\
      \ serotonin and make the player feel good for doing well.\n\nIn conclusion I\
      \ enjoyed the game but there is still some work to be done. I look forward to\
      \ future patches and games from this developer!"
