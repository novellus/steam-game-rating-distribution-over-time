    review: 'Imagine this: There is a slope down in front of you and a pit to jump
      over all while there is a low ceiling. It''s one of those games where your hero
      falls by steps when walking down slopes instead of acting properly. And he also
      falls like a brick as soon as he hits ceiling. Actually, he does so even when
      taking pickup. Would you enjoy jumping over the pit? Chances are, you will DIE.


      I mean, it''s already quite a "classic DOS platformer" that is more of puzzle
      with infinite lives and limites shots that carry between levels where you may
      get stuck. A thing of it''s time. No good story, no good graphics, no music,
      so no art enjoyment, aha.


      But on top of that it features FAST engine where the collision is out of whack,
      with main hero physics and interaction with level geometry being nothing shot
      of offending. It really is trying to place you correctly over the game field.
      But it''s not very good at it. So you slightly sink here and there and miss
      the jumps.

      Yea, it''s a game so classic you can get stuck in a wall without speedrunning
      skills.


      Also, based on fake science book. Take that!'
