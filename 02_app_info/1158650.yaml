    review: "I feel the description of the game is misleading and a little too vague...when\
      \ playing it I am not getting or see this so called experience.\n\nGo behind\
      \ an enemy and hit him with the melee of my hand, 5 out of ten times it works\
      \ properly, the other times you have to re position and try again...So that\
      \ is a huge oversight. \n\nDoesn't feel good because you have to use w and s\
      \ and your mouse to move like it's 1985. Free control would be great, adding\
      \ a and d when moving should have been mandatory IMO.\n\nCookie cutter design,\
      \ unintelligent AI...simple and boring, not worth the time or money."
