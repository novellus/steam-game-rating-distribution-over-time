    review: "On the Fun Scale, this game lands somewhere between \"cleaning an oven\"\
      \ and \"intractable diarrhea.\"\n\nIt's surprising, given that games with three\
      \ equally bad names are usually a home run...\n\nAs a matter of fact, it concerns\
      \ me that the developer STILL refers to the game on its Steam game page as Folding\
      \ Edge, Folding Space AND Starship Helmet. Purple Helmeted Love Warriors, anyone?Sure,\
      \ why not? \n\nIn other words, if a developer doesn't take a basic step such\
      \ as this to maintain game integrity and with consideration of its player base,\
      \  how much time do you think they have and will spend putting a decent game\
      \ forward? \n\nI changed half my original review three times today, and all\
      \ within fifteen minutes. Take five to fix that garbage, developer."
