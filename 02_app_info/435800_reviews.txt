I very quickly got annoyed by how difficult it is to control the 2 balls precisely. It appears you just have to find out by trial and error what the correct sequence of jumps is to get to the end of each level - and IMHO that is not how these games are suppopsed to work. This game is not for me.\nBuy only if you like being punished. You don't often see games were most reviewers admit they were heavily frustrated while playing but still give it a thumbs up.","timestamp_created":1602015241,"timestamp_updated":1602015241,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4spTj//QCcPmjpgI="}
