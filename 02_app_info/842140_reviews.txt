You can tell a lot of love went into this game and the developer took feedback and used it when adding new features etc.\n\nIts been pretty quiet over recent months, so it would be nice to have an update from the developer once in a while on what they are now working on.\n\nThe store page really summarises the aim of the game, so I honestly don't feel the need to go into much detail on this review as the info is already available to you. Honestly, the game is worth getting, its decent fun, and, after cleaning your own cats turds up throughout the day, you can relax in VR and clean up some more.\n\nMy only wish is that we could name our kittens what we want, and not have it use our steam friends names.","timestamp_created":1590332086,"timestamp_updated":1590332206,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwu/XLo/ICcN3/iQI="}
