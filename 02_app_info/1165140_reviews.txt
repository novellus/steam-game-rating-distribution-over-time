This is one of the worst I've ever played, with puzzles that seem to have been auto-generated by a very basic Space Invaders template, no greying of rows, and a godawful hand-holding when you accidentally misclick, with no way to change tiles since it tells you wrong instantly. No pics ever showed up, but after looking at the pictures, that's probably a blessing, the art had to be made by a teenager.","timestamp_created":1605955732,"timestamp_updated":1605955732,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530516445636749268","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwovia9fUCdtHSrwI="}
