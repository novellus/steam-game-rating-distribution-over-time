      \ hier.\nIch Spiele es mit einem 2  , zur Zeit auf 1 Hof  und wir haben so viel\
      \ Spa\xDF.\nWir teilen uns die Arbeit und Sprechen uns \xFCber alles ab und\
      \ freuen uns immer wieder auf was Neues , auch wenn das Spiel noch im EARLY\
      \ ACCESS ist ist das Spiel mit so viel Liebe gemacht , das Sp\xFCrt man und\
      \ sieht man in jeder Hinsicht .\nIch bin sehr Dankbar f\xFCr so ein Tolles Spiel\
      \  das uns so viel Spa\xDF macht und ich freue mich auf viele neue UPDATES die\
      \ das Spiel  auf ein N\xE4chstes LVL bringen .\nIch werde dieses Spiel in N\xE4\
      chster zeit auch Streamen  und werde dar\xFCber auch Youtube Videos + GUIDES\
      \ schreiben .\nF\xFCr das Spiel ist mir die Zeit was ich dann dort rein steck\
      \ jede Sec. wert.\n\nAlso alle die ein Enspanntes Spiel auf Normal Modus wollen.\

      \ kein ONE SHOOT und im Krankenhaus sondern Minimal 2 Hits das deine Energie\
      \ weg ist  also habt immer ESSEN dabei !!.\nOder ein Spannendes Spiel mit DRUCK\

      \ mehr Zunder geben .\nEs ist f\xFCr jeden was dabei .\nIhr werden mit dem Spiel\
