    review: 'this game is adorable i loved it very much!! the art is adorable! the
      content is pretty much safe for all ages (the characters are clearly not all
      18 or older despite the disclaimer, but there is no r18 content to speak of
      so that whole thing was basically unnecessary)

      gameplay-wise it plays in short story segments spread across a calendar, so
      its easy to pick up and play in short sessions.

      i love yuno and tamaki and saeka and i love that you never have to be locked
      into any particular route with them. but although the game description makes
      it seem that way, they are not the only major characters in the game - the spotlight
      is shared between with several other pairs as well, to the point there really
      is no character thats treated as more important than all the others!

      its a sweet vn, try it out if you like cute girls doing cute things and loads
      of fluff..'
