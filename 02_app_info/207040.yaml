    review: "I have just realized that I have this game. I bought it in 2011 played\
      \ few hours then completely forgot it nearly 10 years. I didnt remember how\
      \ was the game play and why I was so curious that why I dont remember the game\
      \ since I usually really like sidescroll shoot em ups. So I downloaded it again.\n\
      \n+ The gameplay is actually really colourfull. Power ups, special weapon, time\
      \ slow mechanism, temporary shield and life-time gain with every hit, it gives\
      \ more than an average sidescroll shoot em up.\n+ Graphics are shining. I mean\
      \ really. Even after 10 years I can say that they done an excellent job with\
      \ design, depth and details. You dont get bored with visuals even if you play\
      \ same level hundreds of times.\n\n-\tThe problem with the game starts with\
      \ its atmosphere.  It is dull. Overdose! and I realized that that made me get\
      \ bored and forget the game easily. There is nothing in the game that pulls\
      \ you in that world.  The game makes you feel like story is someting and the\
      \ game play is something else. Makes you feel irrelevant, like \u201Cplaying\
      \ flappybird clone to pass the level and in order to learn the what happens\
      \ next in the visual novel\u201D or like \u201CBejewlled style matching the\
      \ colours in order to kill the dragon and recue the princess\u201D\n-\tSoundracks\
      \ are also colourless. I mean for a shoot em up I always expect some aggressive,\
      \ joyful or rocking music at the background in order to pull me more in the\
      \ game and provoke me to shoot more aggressively\u2026 Unfortunately there is\
      \ none. It is more like flying and shooting in the bliss until some Hungarian\
      \ sentences start.\n-\tThird part the voice acting. Ok I cannot speak Hungarian\
      \ but voice acting feels like some 3rd class dubbing for some C+ movies. You\
      \ can find no excitement, no energy, no atmosphere in it. Furthermore after\
      \ a while it bomes annoying like static.\n\nAre you a shoot em up collector?\
      \ Definitely buy it. But if you are a gamer who wants some action and excitement,\
      \ dont buy it.\n\n@Developers: Duraaak, good graphics, Duraaak, good play, Duraaak,\
      \ Hire some good voice actors next time, Duraaak. \n"
