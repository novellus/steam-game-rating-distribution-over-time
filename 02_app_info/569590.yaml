    review: "Owlia is a game that hits the nostalgia just right in terms of graphics,\
      \ sound, music, and boss battles...but that's a small portion of the game. Too\
      \ bad most of the game is excruciatingly cryptic. And not in the NES way where\
      \ you could figure most things out with in-game hints. In Owlia, many of the\
      \ puzzles are just guess work. Many puzzles require bombs and whatnot that require\
      \ a lot of grinding if you're not lucky enough to figure out the solution to\
      \ the puzzle before running out of bombs. \n\nIn Owlia, every treasure chest\
      \ contains gold pieces. Strange, being you don't purchase anything in Owlia.\
      \ Gold is used to enter every dungeon.... Yep, you have to grind hundreds or\
      \ thousands of gold pieces just to enter a dungeon.  Too much tedious grinding.\
      \ If the grinding was removed, the game would be fairly decent. If the puzzles\
      \ weren't terrible, the game would be good, even. But in its current state it\
      \ is not good, imo.\n\nIn the game's three to four hour duration (the game would\
      \ be maybe 1-2 hours if the puzzles and grinding were removed), there are a\
      \ few good boss battles and nostalgia inducing sounds and imagery. But if you\
      \ want a FUN game, you're going to be a bit let down.\n\nPros:\n\n-great OST\n\
      -decent sprites\n-a couple good bosses\n-interesting world and story\n\nCons:\n\
      -Grinding!\n-Gold buys nothing\n-Puzzles are annoying\n-Padded adventure to\
      \ bloat its duration\n-Some rooms in dungeons are crammed with monsters,\nleading\
      \ to cheap deaths\n-Seriously, whose idea was it to put gold currency into the\
      \ game but have nothing available to buy?\n-Treasure chests galore and NO ITEMS\
      \ IN THEM!\n\n\nOwlia is a well designed game in the technical sense, but more\
      \ care next time around focusing on fun factor would be appreciated. Less grinding.\
      \ Less cryptic puzzles. NES was great, but this game took it too far."
