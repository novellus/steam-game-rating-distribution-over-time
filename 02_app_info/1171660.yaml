    review: This game is a wonderfully crafted fantasy game. The combat and challenges
      become more difficult as you progress and you get items that completely change
      the way the game is played. The bosses are challenging and you feel rewarded
      after finally beating them. The time stop mechanic is one of the coolest time-based
      abilities I've seen that does't make your character brokenly powerful. 10/10
      you will die, and enjoy doing it.
