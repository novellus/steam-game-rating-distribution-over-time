    review: 'I do recommend the game if you NEVER played any air hockey or even shufflepuck
      game - in game or in real life (if you don''t know air hockey, try it at least
      once, it is cool). I do recommend this game too if like me, you remember your
      teenage time playing Shufflepuck Cafe on Atari... good times. Now, I would not
      recommend this game just like that, because it is not that great. It is fine.
      Very repetitive (that''s air hockey... better in real life with real friends),
      very grindy (win 15 times against him - good, now beat him 8 times without loosing
      - good, now you can duel the new opponent... who tells you to beat the previous
      one 10 times...), and the table is a TAD too small (actually, there is too much
      camera inclination), BUT the gameplay is really smooth, the different opponents
      moves are nice though as too simple as the original game, so, yeah, overall
      it is enough to pass the time if you buy it on sale.
