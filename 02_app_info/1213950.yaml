    review: 'While I recommend you beat the RPG mode to unlock him, he is honestly
      one of the most fun characters in the game.


      His combos have a lovely amount of style and effectiveness with a decent amount
      of safety.


      His abilities make him a monster in the corner, easily half an hp bar if you
      can bully someone into it.
