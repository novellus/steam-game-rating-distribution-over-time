This is the kind of game that I would typically enjoy, but I am at a loss on what good strategy is for this game. Sometimes, it looks like I'm doing well, but something outlandish happens and I instantly lose with no real explanation. Maybe if someone sat me down and walked me through every aspect, I could get better, but that shouldn't be the threshold for simply being able to play the game! The lack of decent graphics and sound doesn't do the game any favors either. You'll need to invest lots of time to learn the game, and by then, you may find out that you don't enjoy it very much.\n\nOverall: 2/5","timestamp_created":1607975520,"timestamp_updated":1607975937,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vrS1sfYCf8WbugI="}
