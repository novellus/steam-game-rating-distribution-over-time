The acting is great, the storyline is very real, and it shows how different people react to things differently and the vices they use to get through pain. The only problem I had with the movie was the story never really had peaks aside from one scene...the movie lacked that 'umph' that I was hoping for. In movies like these you would expect to get some sort of wisdom. I just didn't get that from this movie.  I wouldn't watch it again, but I do think it's worth watching at least once.","timestamp_created":1488603505,"timestamp_updated":1488603505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.576997280120849609","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ltzry9oCfc/Ocw=="}
