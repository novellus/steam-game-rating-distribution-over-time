The software states that the default UDP port in F1 2018 is 20777, when it is actually 20888.So the port in SRT is hard coded to 20777 with no option to change it.  SRT also defaults to the IP address of the host machine and you can't configure the software to use the loopback (127.0.0.1) even though the help file says that you can.","timestamp_created":1600126027,"timestamp_updated":1600126027,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1606046585,"developer_response":"Sorry for the late reply! Unfortunately Steam doesn't send notifications for reviews and it's hard for us to look at all of them. No excuses anyway :)\n\nIn the next version of SRT, we'll add the option to customize the listening port used by SRT, right to simplify how to use our application together with others.\n\nIn the mean time, if you want to try again SRT with other apps/systems (like Fanalab), you can follow this guide that addresses exactly your problem: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2261220478\n\nFor any issue, please write in the forums (where we see the notifications :P ) or at support@simracingtelemetry.com . Thanks!"}],"cursor":"AoJ4z7C8x/QCe4LyoQI="}
