Getting to know them better in this audiobook  was totally amazing. It certainly makes the game come much more alive, when you know what they are fighting for and who the heroes are. The audio chapters are more or less separate stories from the years before the game starts, when the aliens arrived. Explains the origin of the superpowers of the heroes and where they came from, as well as the alien and their reasons for the invasion. The amulets (nanomachines) grant certain abilities to the wielders (our heroes) and they have started the earth liberation. More powerful than the regular players, but can't be permitted to be killed, forcing you to restart the mission. \n\nGreat with background information about the game and its characters. Audiobook is pretty good in spoken english.\nIf you have the game and want to understand what's going on? - this audiobook provides invaluable help.\nMore chapters are promised to be added. I rekommend the sci fi/fantasy audiobook warmly. \n\nSPOILER ALERT? The alien characters haven't shown up in the game missions yet, but here's a first glimpse of the alien society, not just waves of attacking monsters. Gives the score a boost to 8/10 for giving some serious future expectations to see more great stuff in the game as it's developed.\n","timestamp_created":1487030213,"timestamp_updated":1487030213,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mIv6nNoCcJCNcg=="}
