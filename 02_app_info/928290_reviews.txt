Well, no. So you'll be there for twenty minutes or so.","timestamp_created":1565255814,"timestamp_updated":1565255814,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537608861923217773","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1576726281,"developer_response":"Please do not spoil things for those who have yet to play them."}],"cursor":"AoJwt4mhuOwCcKP6zwE="}
