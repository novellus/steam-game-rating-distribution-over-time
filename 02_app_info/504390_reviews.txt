As someone who enjoyes games like Life is Strange, I'm glued to the monitor, carrying the laptop around and playing. Story is well written and really interesting, choices matter, excellent visual style and touching music.\nPlayed on an openSUSE Tumbleweed laptop (native Linux version) with an  HD 4400, runs perfectly. Tried it on my Arch/1660 Ti machine and works fine as well.\n\nJust finished it. It was amazing. Bought all the other Nova-box games and can't recommend it enough to anyone looking for a good story.","timestamp_created":1609867335,"timestamp_updated":1609884584,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.651167094707489014","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhKmm6vYCd6rhwAI="}
