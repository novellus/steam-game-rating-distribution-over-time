    review: 'As a huge Monster Jam fan myself who has been going to shows annually
      since 2015, I was really hoping for this game to be its gaming comeback, considering
      how terrible ABAIG, Crush It, and Battlegrounds were. Did it turn out to be
      that way? Well....yes and no. Here''s why.


      [h1] The Pros [/h1]

      +A nice variety of trucks and tracks to choose from

      +Good handling -- not as great as POD, but still good

      +Improvable truck stats (Speed, Acceleration, Traction, etc)

      +Great Career mode (and even a Career+ mode to boot, if you like things [u]
      really[/u] challenging)

      +Several fun competitions to choose from

      ++Feels more realistic than most other Monster Jam games -- body panels break
      and fall apart, cars don''t explode when hit, "one-wheel wheelies" are a thing
      of the past, and frontflips are much more difficult to pull off, as they should
      be


      [h1] The Cons [/h1]

      -No online multiplayer

      -The AI can be a pain in the neck if you''re not careful, especially in Waypoint
      and Circuit Racing

      -The Truck Customization feature that was POD remains absent here

      -The DLC is mostly just additional paint schemes for trucks that are already
      in the game; only includes three additional trucks and no new tracks or other
      additional content besides that

      --This one''s a bit of a nitpick but I''m counting it as a huge con anyway because,
      despite the huge selection of trucks, if i''m correct, [b] this is the first
      Monster Jam game to not have any independent trucks [/b] (Not even Avenger or
      Stone Crusher)


      [h1] The Verdict [/h1]


      Overall, Monster Jam Steel Titans could''ve been better, but it also could''ve
      been much worse. It''s a huge improvement over other recent Monster Jam games
      such as the ones listed above, and gave me some POD vibes as I played. Would
      I recommend it? Unless you''re quite a big Monster Jam fan, I would wait for
      a sale. I also would not recommend buying this if your PC can''t handle high-quality
      games very well. Otherwise, expect to be on loading screens for 15+ minutes
      (you can lower the quality but it''ll look like a PS2 game). And if you''re
      looking for complete realism and nothing more, I''d recommend getting Beamng.drive
      instead and getting the CRD mod on beam-monsters.com, because that''s as close
      to the real deal as you''ll get. Otherwise, enjoy the action and destruction
      you can make in this game with peace of mind knowing that your truck won''t
      handle like garbage.
