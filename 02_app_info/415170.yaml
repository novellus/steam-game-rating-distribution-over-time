    reviews: "\u201CEngare is an eye-catching game. In Steam's sea of gritty multiplayer\
      \ shooters, pixelated platformers and cartoonish RPGs, it immediately stands\
      \ out. Engare is sparse yet richly detailed at the same time, filled with looping\
      \ lines and delicate curves. It's a game about geometry, art and architecture.\
      \ Put simply, it's a game about beauty.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/11/07/engare-indie-game-iran-mahdi-bahrami-islamic-art-steam/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Engadget</a><br><br>\u201CI'm so delighted\
      \ that the years of wait for Engare, after teases at events like GDC, turned\
      \ out to feel absolutely magical and unique in the gaming realm. I want to install\
      \ this game on the hard drive of every self-proclaimed nerd\u2014and every elementary\
      \ and middle school's computer labs. I want this wild geometrical-shape spirograph\
      \ experiment to be an edu-tainment rite of passage, just like SimCity and Carmen\
      \ Sandiego were for me. And maybe above all else, I want the Western world to\
      \ look in awe at the culturally unique stuff that gaming can create when it's\
      \ put in the hands of more diverse creators.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/engare-review-spirographs-math-and-islamic-art-blend-for-quite-the-game\"\

      \ also when I\u2019d gotten it wrong. Because either way, I\u2019d made a pretty\
      \ pattern.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/10/26/engare-review/\"\

    review: Almost too minimalist, but I'll recommend it on sale because it's unique.
      I've never played anything quite like it, but it's very simple. Oddly, there's
      an editing suite included you can use to make some neat designs based on the
      gameplay principles.
