This will not necessarily result in the unlocking of the full content and features yet. Instead, for the serial numbers of the current product generation, you will receive credit in the built-in store system that will enable you to obtain the numbers of items from each store category (soundpools, instruments, functions) that are associated with your particular edition's license.\n\nSo, in practical terms, if you e.g. want to use more than 8 tracks in your projects, you would need to switch to the \"Store\" tab on the right-hand side of your Music Maker screen, choose the \"More features\" category from the drop-down list, and obtain the \"More tracks & formats\" item. In the same way you can use your remaining credits on obtaining other program features, soundpools or instruments. Once you have exhausted the credits included with your edition, you can purchase additional content through the in-app store.\n\nPlease note that the \"Activate Edition\" option will not disappear from the program, once you've used it to enter your serial number. This is behavior by design. The option can e.g. be used to activate older versions of Music Maker that you might have a license and serial number for. This will result in the content and features associated with those older versions automatically becoming available in your current installation of Music Maker.\n\nBest regards,\nThe MAGIX team"}],"cursor":"AoJwuoHyguwCe8nPzgE="}
