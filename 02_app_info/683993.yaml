    review: "[Note: I play plenty of this in on my phone rather than Steam]\n\nEasily\
      \ the better of the two dual-faction expansions, in my estimation. Triggering\
      \ 2 factions, or being triggered by both factions, is their main draw, but many\
      \ of these cards work pretty well in even a 1-color build.\n\nYou may note that\
      \ in this and the other expansion, there is no Star Empire + Machine Cult faction,\
      \ nor Trade Fed + Blob (my favorite combo! :( :( :( )\n\nSince WWG doesn't really\
      \ fully fill you in on what you're grabbing, please see below:\n\nExplanation:\
      \ C=Combat, HP=Authority, T=Trade\n\nTrade Fed / Star Empire = Alliance\nShip\
      \ - Alliance Frigate: 3-cost; 4C, yellow faction +3C, blue faction +4HP <- [i]this\
      \ is a beast of a card even in 1-color decks![/i]\nOutpost Base - Alliance Landing:\
      \ 5-cost; 2T; faction (either) +2C; 5 hit points <- [i]it's okay in decks of\
      \ its intended color; unimpressive otherwise[/i]\n\nBlob + Machine Cult = Unity\n\
      Ship - Unity Fighter: 1-cost; 3C, scrap a card in trade row; scrap to scrap\
      \ a card in hand or discard. <- [i]This is basically a War Elder hero in ship\
      \ format. A pretty good early game card that self-scraps, so no risk in grabbing\
      \ it regardless of whatever faction you're building into.[/i]\nOutpost Base\
      \ - Unity Station: 7-cost, scrap 1, and scrap a card in trade row; faction (either)\
      \ +4C. 6 hit points. <- more expensive Junkyard with some extra bells and whistles.\
      \ Works okay in any deck for the auto-scrapping.\n\nTrade Fed + Machine Cult\
      \ = Coalition:\nShip - Coalition Freighter: 4-cost; 3T; blue faction, put the\
      \ next ship this turn on deck; red faction, scrap 1. <- [i]Wait, a freighter\
      \ that also scraps? Yes please! Needs more Cult ships to keep that scrapping\
      \ going, though.[/i] \nOutpost Base - Coalition Fortress: 6-cost; 2T; faction\
      \ (either) +2C OR +2HP; 6 hit points <- underwhelming, only decent as a damage\
      \ sponge.\n\nStar Empire + Blob = Union\nShip - Assault Pod: 2-cost; 3C; faction\
      \ (either) Draw 1 <- [i]runs well even in blob-only decks for the Draw 1; basically\
      \ another blob fighter.[/i]\nBase - Union Cluster: 7-cost; 4C; faction (either)\
      \ Draw 1; 8 hit points <- [i]works better than it looks on paper, and good even\
      \ in yellow-only or green-only decks; the 8 hp makes it a hard kill.[/i]"
