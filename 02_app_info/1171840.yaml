    review: 'If not a great one then Ironheart is at least a very good CYOA text only
      book.


      Among the positive points is the attention given to details and little choice
      that carry over the course of the game and give the feeling of true customization
      and flavour to your character. The attitude of your character also change depending
      on your choices and I find this very well made. The universe does''nt seem shallow,
      key events are very well written and absorbing and there are also some surprise
      here and there. A lot of choice and stats are just there to give you the feeling
      of CYOA games and you can feel the author affinity with the genre.


      The negatives can be found in straightforward "choose the right move" battle
      that only requires you to read the text attentively to find the good answer.
      Sometimes I found the story unconvincing or a little rushed but there are only
      few of those moments. Some other times I found the characters a little blank
      or useless. That''s not always the case and most of the times they''re well
      depicted. The story also seem it could have been longer and/or more focused
      and intense. Some stats hardly have any use as well.


      Overall, although it is a good story it sometimes felt like a highly refined
      testing field with a little bit of everything and some things added here and
      there to the patchwork. This feeling of uncompleted draft keeps me from classifying
      Ironheart as a must-read but I think it''s nonetheless a hotly recommend title
      for me.'
