I have glitched through the wall on multiple occasions (though this was to my advantage) and sometimes I could not move at all which meant I had to kill the character. Sadly the developer hasn't updated the game since 2015, but I still highly recommend the game.","timestamp_created":1610053789,"timestamp_updated":1610053789,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467479676008224487","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41OSr7/YCfaSwwQI="}
