    about_the_game: 'Possession is a turn-based traditional roguelike where you play
      as a ghost trying to make your way to the surface. You are incredibly frail,
      but have one advantage: you can possess the bodies of the monsters you encounter,
      and use their strength and abilities as your own. Hop from body to body as you
      attempt to make it back to the surface.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/629340/extras/eyebeast.png?t=1579469075"
      /> Dozens of possessable monsters, from the horrifying to the hilarious, with
      a wide variety of powers.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/629340/extras/sarcophagus.png?t=1579469075"
      /> Special themed levels with unique hazards, creatures and layouts. Randomly
      generated, and each floor has multiple possible levels, so each playthrough
      is different!<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/629340/extras/chest.png?t=1579469075"
      /> Item-less gameplay. The dead have no need for worldly possessions, they just
      slow you down.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/629340/extras/ghost.png?t=1579469075"
      /> Quick to pick up and play. Unlike most roguelikes, Possession doesn''t require
      you to memorize dozens of weird key commands, or puzzle over confusing skill
      and ability lists before you start playing.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/629340/extras/fungalwizard.png?t=1579469075"
      /> Entirely playable with just the keyboard, just the mouse, or a combination
      of the two.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/629340/extras/unicorn.png?t=1579469075"
      /> Mod support! Add your own creatures, powers and special levels, or change
      the ones already there.<br>@ Choice between graphics or ASCII mode, for the
      oldschool roguelike fans.'
