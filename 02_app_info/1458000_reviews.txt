First of all, the sfx slider doesnt work, i put all sound at 0 and it still broke my ear each time i picked a double jump crystal. \n\nSecondly, the mouse sensitivity display doesnt work either, i have to put my mouse at 16k dpi to be able to look around properly. Oh and theres no cursor lock so my mouse keep wandering on my second monitor meaning i could click out of the game by accident anytime\n\nThirdly, small thing, but you can have multiple menu overlapping each time, and be able to play\n\nAnd Finally, the optimisation is really bad. i put it on the lowest graphics and my pc was still heating. There was also no vsync so its probably the major reason, running this game in 500+ fps instead of 144 must be hard, even for a 2060\n\nEdit Turn out the mouse sensivity issues is cause by the lack of vsync (144hz fixed it) But having to go through nvidia to activate it is a bummer, if this is fixed + the sfx option it will probably change to a green thumb","timestamp_created":1608988972,"timestamp_updated":1608997862,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548387110233306885","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwp9/vz/YCffawvQI="}
