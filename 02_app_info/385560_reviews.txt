The ultimate side scroller to end all side scrollers.  This game puts just about every game I have ever played to shame.  Execution is tight, gameplay is perfect, and visuals are top notch.  Forget the fact that you get to collect upgrades, train, and play at various difficulties to hone your skills.  Amazing, stunning, perfect.  Metroidvania #1.","timestamp_created":1607749243,"timestamp_updated":1607749243,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h9LUqvYCdJ6tuQI="}
