This game is ONLY hidden object puzzles. NO PLOT, no real scenery or progression of story except little video clips between puzzles. No voices, which in itself is not a bad thing, but in this game it just adds to the misery. Not my type of game.","timestamp_created":1505942329,"timestamp_updated":1554909371,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507692337036132813","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p8P0g+oCcPTuhQE="}
