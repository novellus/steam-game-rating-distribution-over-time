Somehow I get the old X-Com vibe (MicroProse ones, not Firaxis reboots) rather than obvious genre references, and that's not at all a bad thing.\n\nAlso, 3 HD wallpapers are provided as PNG files whose resolution is 1920x1080.  Cute, but nothing to write home about.\n\nGood value for money if you can catch it on sale.","timestamp_created":1572296618,"timestamp_updated":1606739448,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.659497380256652832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjMrIjPYCefON1QE="}
