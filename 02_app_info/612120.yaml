    review: 'This looks very promising and well made. Unfortunately the shooting part
      was annoying far above acceptable level.


      I had a difference of up to 20cm between the real position of my controllers
      and their position in VR most of the time during level 3.


      I would love an option for "easy shooting" where the pistol is already unlocked
      and filled with unlimited ammo. Without this I can''t really recommend the game,
      I do not even want to emagine having to shoot like this in a stressful environment...'
