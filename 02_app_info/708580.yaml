    review: "I think i'm going to love this series of games. I saw the film and it\
      \ scared the pants off me. This game played in VR is repeating it here. Not\
      \ the same story line as the films, but shaping up to be just as good.\nVery\
      \ immersive. very creepy sounds in background, nice voices and soundtrack. \n\
      So far so good.\nSo far a thumbs up from me.\n"
