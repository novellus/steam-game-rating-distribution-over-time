I run a brand new MSi GE62VR and had trouble with screen transitions and loading. The first stage end transition saw drops in frame rate to 6 or 7 fps, maybe less. I even went outside the map at the beginnings of the server room floor where the outside skyline can be seen, walked through, no jumping, never to return again. I had an issue at the start I shrugged off where my sprite fell to the lower levels and i was seeing screens from elsewhere in the game with no sprite on screen. I opened the map to try and figure out what happened and when I exited the map i was visible and in a completely different area. I had an instance of checkpoint reversal where I died just after hitting a checkpoint but it threw me back to the checkpoint before, then to test it further went and died on an obstacle placed before that checkpoint and got rolled back even further. I saw no return to the furthest checkpoint and it wouldn't trigger as if it were a new checkpoint again. This left me disappointed and I hated feeling that way because the whole post human civilization with a little guy coming along to revive it was a nice story line. I love metroidvania and while this was more of a platformer/ruins explorer type game i felt right at home. I absolutely HATE to not recommend this game because it has such potential and feels a little like a cross between fez and \"the dig\" for those old enough to remember that game. \nTL;DR\nI LOVED IT until I found game breaking glitches.","timestamp_created":1490817531,"timestamp_updated":1490817531,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x8fpjdsCc//IdQ=="}
