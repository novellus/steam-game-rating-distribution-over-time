Health potions not going into inventory. \nCamera going way OoB during a boss battle. \nEnemies animations derping out as they reposition, enemies \"dropping dead\" but still having their eyes open and their breathing animations playing.\nThe HUD constantly flickering in and out during dialogue sequences.\nEnding your turn while using your 2nd action point to reposition results in enemies firing at the space you just ran past instead of the space you're going to.\n\nThis game as a whole just drags and drags.","timestamp_created":1609283012,"timestamp_updated":1609283012,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2sCv2PYCfcXMvgI="}
