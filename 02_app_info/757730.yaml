      \ /><br>Every night you are haunted by visions of your death in ancient ruins\
      \ to hordes of <strong><i>nightmare creatures</i></strong>. The NEXUS, a <i><u><strong>Hyper-Dimensional\
      \ Holy Ruin</strong></u></i>, barrages <strong>Dreamers</strong> with such visions\
      \ <i><strong>for years</strong></i> until the nightmares drive them into a <strong><i>mad\
      \ frenzy</i></strong>.<br><br>Seeking to avoid this fate and having learned\
      \ of these stories, you've hunted down an entrance to the ruins; a rift into\
      \ the back-stage of reality from which there is <strong><i>no return</i></strong>.<br><br><img\
      \ src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/757730/extras/ScrawlIntro1Alt.PNG?t=1602264075\"\
      \ /><br><br>However you've also learned of another story. It is said that from\
      \ The NEXUS one can access <u>Transcendental Planes of Reality,</u> and that\
      \ a pilgrimage to the Gods would grant you the <i><u>ancient secrets of these\
      \ ruins.</u></i><br><br>It feels like like you've stood here among the ruins\
      \ before, all those battles in your dreams... preparing you for the real challenge\
      \ ahead. The time is now to <i><u>steel yourself and <strong>ENTER THE NEXUS!</strong></u></i><br><br><img\

      \ /><br>Your <strong>Experience Points and Skills</strong> are not the only\
      \ things that survive beyond death in Shadowcrawl. Elements of your game world\
      \ can also be changed in permanent ways that will persist between playthroughs,\
      \ and some of them even <strong><i><u>between save files!</u></i></strong><br><br>Completing\
      \ quests <strong><i>permanently adds new weapons, armor, and enemies to the\
      \ game</i></strong>. Unleashing secret mini-bosses and allowing increasingly\
      \ powerful loot to appear in Gold Chests.<br><br>Some quests even <strong><u>replace\
      \ entire groups of enemies</u></strong> with stronger overpowered ones for the\
      \ ultimate difficulty spike. Aid Miya the Blood Knight in exterminating the\
      \ Goblins and you will only succeed in unleashing their true form as all Goblins\
      \ in your game world are forever replaced by the mighty Orcs! This can be done\
      \ with every enemy set in the game.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/757730/extras/ScrawlSteamStoreNewBreed.png?t=1602264075\"\
      \ /><br>Shadowcrawl is not your standard Roguelike, with quests, cults, factions,\
      \ multiple endings, unlockable enemies, hidden game modes, secret levels &amp;\
      \ more! We've taken the classic 80's &quot;Free-Turn&quot; roguelike formula\
      \ and updated it with modern game design lessons to add layers of depth as well\
      \ as shift the gameplay focus towards player skill. Because of this, Shadowcrawl\
      \ is less about luck or collecting loot than it is about strategy.<br><br><br>As\
      \ you accumulate perks and abilities your character will take on traits that\
      \ let them adapt more effectively to different features of the maze generator.\
      \ Forcing you at all times to use spatial awareness of your environment so you\
      \ can manage the massive swarms of enemies that hunt you in the NEXUS and overcome\
      \ impossible odds.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STEALTH</h2>Some characters even have\
      \ the ability to move through the shadows carefully in order to avoid detection.\
      \ In low to minimal lighting conditions the <u><i>Shadowmeld Perk</i></u> makes\
      \ players much harder to detect and even undetectable if standing quietly in\
      \ total darkness.<br><br>Combine with the <i><u>Assassin Perk</u></i> to reap\
      \ devastating attack bonuses from stealth attacks, or the <u><i>Maze-Master\
      \ Perk</i></u> to keep enemies on their toes.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/757730/extras/ScrawlSteamStoreLivingUniverse.png?t=1602264075\"\
      \ /><br>Shadowcrawl takes place in a <i><u>dynamic world</u></i> that is driven\
      \ by Dark Gods and Occult Forces, all of which can be tampered with. Should\
      \ a player find and kill the Goddess that governs the Health mechanic, then\
      \ all characters (enemy and player alike) across all save files (even new characters)\
      \ <strong><i><u>will be forever turned into living piles of undead meat!</u></i></strong>\
      \ Thrust into a new <u>health based economy</u> they must steal meat from others\
      \ while protecting their own to survive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">LUNAR CALENDAR</h2>This\
      \ is just one of the Gods and corresponding Forces in Shadowcrawl. That being\
      \ said Shadowcrawl also has a <strong>functioning Lunar Calendar</strong> that\
      \ detects the <strong><u><i>current actual phases of the moon!</i></u></strong>\
      \ During periods of <strong>high lunar energy</strong> various in-game characters\
      \ will attempt to <i><strong>harness this power</strong></i> for their own means.\
      \ In the best cases this causes in-game events to occur, however some enemies\
      \ will attempt to enact <strong><i>dangerous, game altering rituals</i></strong>\
      \ that make Shadowcrawl <strong><i><u>actually risky to play on nights of high\
      \ lunar energy!</u></i></strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">PAGAN WHEEL OF THE YEAR</h2>Shadowcrawl\
      \ also celebrates the entire yearly Pagan calendar with special events running\
      \ every 2-4 weeks. These events reveal hidden features of the game and add special\
      \ enemies, quests, cults and much more as the balance of power between the Gods\
      \ ebbs and flows. You can even alter the course of the Wheel by tampering with\
      \ the natural forces.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CULTS</h2>In Shadowcrawl, various\
      \ Gods and other powerful entities can be worshipped by the player for massive\
      \ bonuses. Join cults to gain new perks and powers as well as to access new\
      \ faction specific quests, enemies &amp; loot. You can even worship some beings\
      \ in secret without violating existing pacts, if you don't get caught.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">CORRUPTION</h2>Betraying the game-world mechanics can release terrifying\
      \ secret enemies into your game. Things like killing the Omnipotent, collapsing\
      \ dimensions in on themselves, or just generally warping space-time will unleash\
      \ the deadly &quot;Glitch&quot; enemies into your game.<br><br><br>Unlike normal\
      \ enemies, the &quot;Glitches&quot; can jump between your save files and show\
      \ up in any universe for any character. Worshipping powerful Glitches can even\
      \ invoke the \u201CAge of Glitches\u201D which affects all save files everywhere\
      \ and thrusts you into a twisted world of glitched and overpowered enemies.<br><br><br>The\
      \ \u201CGlitches\u201D can potentially be stopped however,. Killing &quot;Glitches&quot;\
      \ you have freed will kill them for good, until you unleash some more. If you\
      \ have freed too many however you might have to seek the aid of a God who can\
      \ fight the Corruption."
