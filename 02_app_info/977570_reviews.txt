Sadly its kinda short and i completed it within an hour. The vibe is kinda scary, wich i like alot. And the puzzles are kinda hard, but not too hard. It sometimes takes a little bit to figure out what to do with the puzzles, but it doesnt take hours. \n\n8/10","timestamp_created":1609976851,"timestamp_updated":1609977134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwu6+H7fYCeJySwQI="}
