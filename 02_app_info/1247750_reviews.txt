The reviews are mostly negatives at the time of writing this one, but I decided to buy anyways since I played all the content available on Steam already and I loved all of it.\n\nI decided to recommend because it offers something different from the other 240h of Neverwinter Nights I played prior to playing this one. It is more like a point and click game and you have to talk to the right people at the right time to advance the story. Time is of the essence is this DLC and a maximum number of actions can be done in a single day. It was a little wind of change for me, and proves that Neverwinter Nights can still see many stories added to it in the future and still be a relevant game for me. I will always buy these DLCs as they come out.\n\nThis being said, the quality of the result is poor and feels like a demo. First of all, the story feels extremely convoluted for a 5-10 hours expansion, but that, I can excuse. What is more concerning is that a player might get completely stuck at some places. Once you enter a zone, you cannot go back, and if you are not \"as ready as you think\" for an encounter, you really might get stuck for real, so saving often is a must (unless you do not care about respawning several times). The combat felt extremely unbalanced, ranging from too easy to too hard. A lot of stuff does not make sense : for example some people will sell expensive items that you will never be able to buy. It really does feel like an unpolished beginning of a bigger adventure.\n\nDark Dreams of Furiae is irritating more often that not. For examples, rats keep attacking every time I would take a certain exit on the map, it feels impossible to get more gold once you spent the one you have when beginning the adventure, some regions \"unlock\" without you knowing or the game telling you, the effect of a few actions had unwanted and unexpected effects on my alignment (I played a Lawful Good character and the options seemed to always be either Chaotic Good or Lawful Evil), etc.\n\nSo I do recommend, but only for people having played everything else and still being hungry for more content and wanting a change of pace in the gameplay.\n\nI still wish to see more of Neverwinter Nights !","timestamp_created":1604910912,"timestamp_updated":1604910912,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521276593208312988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoKKJ1vUCeKunrQI="}
