      /><br>The Father of all Gods, Oberon, has become a myth even to the immortals
      of the universe, to those willful spirits that have ascended beyond the form
      of humanity and now flit through the tides of the universe as naturally as walking
      occurs to mortal men. You are one of these immortal beings, once human but now
      a divinity that seeks power through worship, seeking to guide your faithful
      in this darkness from the dangers of all sides.<br><br>There is much ruin and
      destruction - wrecks in the battlefield of the gods, but you are yet capable
      of sculpting planets into hospitable, even lush, wonderlands for your followers.
      Their temples will exalt you, and in your name, they will launch great fleets
      to expand your divine empire. You will shield them from the stellar radiation,
      the envy of their rivals, and much darker entities that lurk between the space
      of the cosmos. <br><br>But mere benevolence is not always enough.<br><br>There
      will be enemies, but you need not rely only upon your posthuman followers to
      deal with them; the primal forces of the universe are at your disposal. Disrupt
      the asteroid belts, plunging a hail of destruction upon the entire stellar system
      of your foes. Kidnap their planets into a pocket universe of our holding, their
      populations ready to be dealt with at your will. Or simply destroy their suns
      in artificial supernovas, leaving nothing alive in their wake.<br><br>There
      was a time when such acts would have been thought horrific. But now, as the
      end of the universe approaches, as the forces of entropy threaten to extinguish
      all life, light and hope, you must gather what power you can to brace against
      the incoming horrors of the Black Sun.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/423890/extras/Features.png?t=1501592744"

    review: "This Game Here, It Has Some Flaws, It Has Some Positive Things, But,\
      \ Lets See How Well It Does With People Like Me, Or Some Other People Who Are\
      \ Similar(Which Is Alot) But, I Will Update This Review As It Progresses, And\
      \ As I Progress Through The Game\n \n\nPros\nNavigation Is Simple, Easier To\
      \ Sprint If You Played Skyrim\nPopulation Management, And Diverse Genders\n\
      Slightly Different Construction System\nCiv Players Will Feel At Home In This\
      \ Game\n\nCons\nIts A Pain Trying To Find A Empty Star System\nNo Species Are\
      \ Different(Well, This Is Probably Minor, As You Can't See Them Anyways, But\
      \ It Could Be Used To Provide Them Benefits, Or Something, Maybe You Can Have\
      \ Them Grow Certain Traits As You Progress?)\n\n\nFeatures Needed\nWon't Do\
      \ This Until I Go Progress More\n\nTherefore, I Think The Game Is Alright I\
      \ Guess, I Wish The Developers Luck, I'm Curious What They Can Do\n\n\nHowever,\
      \ this opinion is... a bit invalid, its not something you'd want to come back\
      \ to, for some reason, it doesn't have much to make you... want to play it,\
      \ it doesn't have that special touch that many games have, if your game isn't\
      \ something someone wants to go back to, how can you expect them to give it\
      \ another try? i hope this doesn't cause any problems :P (Still better than\
      \ no man's sky tho)"
