Same with the voices.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Forced combat is always a nono for me (for normal enemies I mean)\n- Some jumps are freaking annoying to make\n- Last but not least, I had to give up on the RAM boss (was it? the big guy with the axe? idk), waaaay too unfair and slow paced. Hitboxes suck everywhere too. Sometimes he'll take attacks, sometimes he won't, he can easily stun lock you with his axe throw, and the list goes on. And yeah, he just takes forever to kill. It's not fun, it's straight up tedious.\n\nEdit: I was able to kill that stupid boss above. Now in the second RAM level (the middle one) and it has a really stupid puzzle I can't figure out for the life of me. So yeah, that's me done unless someone tells me how to do it I guess.\n\n\nOverall I'd definitely say the game is at least worth a shot. That price point though... a bit too much imo. Go for it if you have some disposable cash I guess, eh.","timestamp_created":1589024579,"timestamp_updated":1589025971,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596151351928710938","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s4PV/PECfJrOhgI="}
