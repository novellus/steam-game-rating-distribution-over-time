Sure there are better eye candy costumes but the sci-fi look is great too... but what shines in this set is the Rapier Thruster shotgun. Feckin phenomenal weapon. 800 round cliiiiiiiiip, decent damaaaaage, awesome automatic fire rate... turns hordes of orcs and deathnights to paste in seconds. If there is one DLC to get for normal gameplay this is it. (man I wish I had sprung for the deluxe version of the game.)","timestamp_created":1586530044,"timestamp_updated":1586530044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhumjsvECeYfZ/wE="}
