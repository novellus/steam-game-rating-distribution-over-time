    review: 'Having owned this game years ago and really enjoying it, I had to buy
      it on Steam.  I was a bit anxious that it would not be as good as I remembered,
      but it does not disappoint.  This is not your typical "point and click, solve
      puzzle" game, but a rather complex deciphering of information using spycraft
      tools such as computers, photographs, and human interactions.  This is by far
      the best espionage pc game I''ve ever played.  If you have an interest in espionage
      and research, you can''t go wrong with Spycraft: The Great Game.  Yes, the game
      is very dated, but once you get into the storyline, you won''t even notice,
      as the game is about information more than anything.  I''d LOVE to see an updated
      version of this game released someday.'
