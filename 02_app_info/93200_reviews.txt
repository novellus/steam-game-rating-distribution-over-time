At this price I cant recommend, you can rest easy if you decide to pass this one up even if its on discount! \n","timestamp_created":1609951070,"timestamp_updated":1609951070,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8/ij7PYCdfCFwQI="}
