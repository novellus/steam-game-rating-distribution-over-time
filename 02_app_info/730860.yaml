    about_the_game: Amoeba Battle is a new breed of RTS game where you control amoebas
      as they battle against the infection that threatens their realm. Explore beautiful
      yet alien landscapes to feed and strengthen your fledgling amoebas!<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><h2
      class="bb_tag">EXPLORE AND FEED:</h2>Find algae for herbivores, go hunting with
      carnivores, or just eat everything with omnivores! Once an amoeba has eaten
      enough food, it becomes well fed. A well fed amoeba does more damage, but more
      importantly, it can replicate into two amoebas!<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/730860/extras/Feed.gif?t=1593545896"
      /><br></li><li><h2 class="bb_tag">AMOEBAS DON'T NEED BASES:</h2>Unlike other
      RTS games, there are no bases to build - amoebas don't build houses or towns
      after all! New amoebas are created through the miracle of binary fission; well
      fed amoebas can replicate into two identical amoebas, doubling your army with
      a click of the mouse! <br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/730860/extras/Replicate.gif?t=1593545896"
      /><br></li><li><h2 class="bb_tag">MUTATION IS EVOLUTION:</h2>Multiplying amoebas
      won't always be enough. When the competition gets tough, introduce mutations
      to evolve your weaker amoebas into stronger species. Experiment with different
      amoeba combinations to field a diverse force that can face any threat!<br><img

      CAMPAIGN MODE:<br>Outbreak is a roguelike RTS campaign mode that can be played
      solo or co-op with up to two friends. In an Outbreak campaign, you will traverse
      a randomized microscopic world with dynamically generated missions. Outbreak
      is designed to have endless replayablity, and no two campaigns will ever play
      out the same!<br></li><li>CROSS-PLATFORM MULTIPLAYER:<br>Compete against other
      players in our 18-player Battle Royale Versus mode or take on the AI in Skirmish,
      either solo or with up to two friends, across console or PC.<br></li><li>INNOVATIVE
      RTS GAMEPLAY:<br>Unlike other RTS games, there are no bases to build - you will
      need to feed, multiply, and evolve your amoebas to claim victory. Every amoeba
      is not just a fighter, but a potential army via the miracle of binary fission.
      And through the power of evolution, even the lovable Locust can grow and evolve
      into an unbreakable Ursa!<br></li><li>IMPACTFUL TACTICAL DECISIONS:<br>Utilize
      the inherent adaptations of herbivores, omnivores, and carnivores to your advantage,
      such as carnivore stealth and omnivore mobility. Make use of special terrain
      features, like Spawning Pools that cut replication times in half. Turn the tide
      of battle with deployable Probes, such as Cryo Probes that slow enemies to a
      crawl.<br></li><li>DELIGHTFUL ART STYLE:<br>Journey through four exotic landscapes
      and battle with nine species of amoeba, all delicately rendered using a remarkable
      fusion of watercolors and pixel art. <br></li><li>FAMILIAR RTS CONTROLS:<br>Employ
      fully featured keyboard + mouse controls including control groups, box selection,
      hotkeys, waypoint queues, and more. If you prefer joysticks and buttons, feel
      free to plug in a controller instead! </li></ul>

    review: 'I can''t decide, if this is a well made baby''s first RTS, in which case
      it would be a lovely addition to the genre, or an attempt gone wrong to cutify
      an RTS war scenario, in which case it might still be a lovely addition to the
      genre. Basebuilding is completely out, because amoebas produce units by mitosis
      and upgrade by metamorphosis (NOT EVOLUTION! GET YOUR TERMS RIGHT!).

      it is competent, a bit slow, and has some harsh difficulty spikes. But it is
      a nice divergence from the war-like scenarios of humans vs aliens, humans vs
      humans, robots vs goo, etc.
