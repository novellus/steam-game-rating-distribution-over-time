I really like the puzzles and minigames. however finding clues with the sparkle effect is a little tricky at first, but you get used to it. I played this a little after it came out, and in 2020 its just as fun.","timestamp_created":1607365751,"timestamp_updated":1607365751,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jd6dn/YCfKmDuAI="}
