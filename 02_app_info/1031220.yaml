    review: "If you seek a good RPGMaker game...well keep looking.\nThis one is a\
      \ real downer.\nThe story is the usual safe the world nothing new here.\nYour\
      \ party...the usual...paladin/healer, archer, mage and another fighter.\nInteraction\
      \ between them is done during a few sentences at every resting area.\nNow, there\
      \ are some good RPG/Maker games around....even for free. They have both interesting\
      \ story and a good looking world.\nHere...you don't see much NPCs....the world\
      \ is rather dull. And the fights are boring. Mostly you will fight one or two\
      \ different groups of 4 enemies. No random encounters...you see them and if\
      \ you fight them they are gone for ever.\nThe only question for the fights is....using\
      \ skills or not. If not, the fight will take up to 2 rounds. \nIf you use skills/magic\
      \ its done in one round but...because there are so many of them you must use\
      \ potions or the replenish points *rare*. And that means that after every 10\
      \ - 20 rounds you leave the dungeon and travel back to the last replenish point.\
      \ Or, later in the game\nyou take a few hits and fight the *long* 2 rounds fight.\
      \ Fun fact, you maybe know that in most\ngames certain enemies are imune against\
      \ a spell or take less demage. Well, not here. Every\nenemey takes the same\
      \ demage...that is at last a good point because your mighty mage\nhas only 3\
      \ spells (level 16).\nLoot...only a few exp. and coins and seldom a potion.\
      \ \nBut its the layout of the dungeons.....they are boring. Grey walls, next\
      \ to nothing furniture and long passages.\nAnd I mean real real long narrow\
      \ passages.\nFor the extra dungeons...till now I visited 4 of them...urg, they\
      \ are even more boring....and you get only a few skill points and some extra\
      \ equipment.\nOh, and don't hope for the dynamic party system....so far this\
      \ contains only that after every break the characters change the walking order\
      \ of the party.\n\nSo my points are: boring gameplay, dull graphics, next to\
      \ nil interaction, no secrets, linear gameplay (dungeon, optional extra dungeon,\
      \ next dungeon)."
