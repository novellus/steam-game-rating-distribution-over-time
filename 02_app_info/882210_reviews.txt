These are never too restrictive on what you can or can't do, it's very unlikely you will mess up at any point.\n\nYou can build towers where trees exist on the map. These are for the most part, generously abundant and approppriately placed. You can improve towers just by standing on them and waiting for a bar to fill up. Depending on the type of tower (i.e. arrows, bomb, anti-air) you may improve attack rate, range, power, etc., allowing for experimentation and flexibility. Towers cost money which you get from clearing a wave (mostly) and defeating enemies (less so, but still will net you an extra tower or two at the end of a level).\n\nIf things get dicey you can also directly attack enemies (and dodge-roll between them to avoid damage and collect the coins they drop) although without some improvement on the skill point tree it won't be a solid tactic, and takes more of a secondary role during levels.\n\nVery nice music, visuals are clean and clear. It's very relaxing and pleasant, few games strike me as such, much less tower defense ones. Made me like it a whole lot more than I expected.\n\nGlad to have picked it up and very recommended for anyone looking for a casual, light-hearted and fun tower defense.","timestamp_created":1570480074,"timestamp_updated":1596091783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511002421379089355","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49fqez/MCfoXc0wE="}
