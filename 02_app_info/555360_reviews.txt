I feel like keeping the ball is fairly reasonably easy--especially since the only way you'll drain left side is if you miss the automatic kickback that has a satisfying shotgun sound.  Just be careful of right outlane and note that you can finish the letters for ball return while it's lit to get the right kickback activated.  The main feature is the 'rapids' which is this really cool spinning pegboard over the left lanes with a hole in the middle.  It really messes with the ball and adds some fun (and sometimes funny) randomness to the game.  I also love the unique drop targets that will pop back up after 30 seconds so you can't just knock em down and deal with the rest later.  Highly recommend this table.","timestamp_created":1608324673,"timestamp_updated":1608324673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43t3nu/YCcaqjuwI="}
