    review: "[Edit 12/18/20]\n\nHardcore mega man fan. As the game is okay, nothing\
      \ to write home about, but you can have some fun with it.\n\nI managed to play\
      \ the game on a powerful PC capable of running the game smoothly. Don't try\
      \ to play this game with an integrated graphics card. If you're not playing\
      \ this on some sort of gaming rig, you're in for a bad time. Even with all the\
      \ settings down low, it will not play right. If you can't get access to a machine\
      \ with it's own graphics card, avoid it, you won't really be able to play it.\
      \ The graphics seem to be intensive.\n\nNow For a review  with is fully playable\
      \ at normal speed. it's okay, but not $20 okay. If I were to put a realistic\
      \ price on it, I'd say it's a solid $10 game. The devs are improving the game,\
      \ actively, with nearly daily updates. So if you're interested, keep your eye\
      \ on it, maybe wait for a sale, and see what the updates are. \n\n[Controls]\n\
      \nthe game when running correctly is very fast. the sense of speed is pretty\
      \ good. Air dashing is a bit OP as you can pretty much circumvent most everything\
      \ in this game by just dashing across the stage. wall jumping works okay, not\
      \ great. in boss rooms, wall jumping can be unreliable at times. and trying\
      \ to wall jump off bottom edge of a wall is kinda janky. you might just conclude\
      \ that you cant do it, but it is possible. \n\nThe game does little to nothing\
      \ to explain anything to you and hopes that you just know what you're doing.\
      \ special weapons can be charged, and the ice weapon is your utility weapon.\
      \ charging it up gives you a wall that you can climb up and jump off of, allowing\
      \ you to skip even more of the level.\n\n[Camera]\n\nThe camera has been greatly\
      \ improved since the game's first release. It's at a fairly comfortable distance\
      \ now. Good Job Devs. Now if only the camera wouldn't let you see past the boundries\
      \ at the start of the stage, or any other boundries. There are a couple spots\
      \ that just have invisible walls.\n\n[Challenge]\n\nI spent most of the game\
      \ dashing and spamming the basic buster. that gets your through most of the\
      \ levels, with the occasional platforming. like 60% of the game is a zig zagging\
      \ downward drop, where you go from left to right, with occasional enemies or\
      \ obstacles. it makes the levels feel very samey. you generally run forward\
      \ and shoot, or air dash from small platform surrounded by spikes to the next\
      \ getting hit by whatever flying enemy is to close to respond to, or you're\
      \ going down a zig zag drop. there are sometimes different parts that were kind\
      \ of fun, but the rest was the same thing with no real difference, even the\
      \ same enemies most of the time which you can mostly ignore.\n\nYou won't die\
      \ in the stage unless you slip up and touch an insta-kill hazard. Enemies respawn\
      \ almost the instant you turn your back, and health drops are plentiful, so\
      \ you can farm health super easily.\n\nThe bosses have been improved since release.\
      \ Most bosses will attack you in the corner, but I found that the fire boss\
      \ can still be cheesed by staying in the bottom left corner, and the mosquito\
      \ boss can be cheesed in the upper right corner.\n\nyou have special attacks,\
      \ but all they ever did for me was make the game jankier. I used a rage attack\
      \ against a boss and it not only did no damage to them, but I was stuck facing\
      \ one direction until I took some damage.\n\n[Cutscenes]\n\nThere are three\
      \ skippable cutscenes in the game. All boss dialogues and cinematics must be\
      \ viewed over and over again. When you make a short replayable game akin to\
      \ the mega man series, you make every single cutscene skippable. sometimes players\
      \ don't care about the story, sometimes they die and have to re-enter the fight.\
      \ Having to watch all the cutscenes over and over again every time you play\
      \ is a major hassle and hurts replayability.\n\n Allow us to skip all cutscenes\
      \ and boss dialogues. You can't even speed up the dialogue, nor slow it down,\
      \ it goes at it's pace.\n\n[Graphics]\n\nThe art is okay, models are fine, Things\
      \ are decently easy enough to distinguish from each other. The art in the dialogue\
      \ boxes aren't too great though. it would be better to replace it with a 3D\
      \ model, as your assistant looks pretty terrible in them, and those dialog boxes\
      \ are opaque and take up half the screen while you're playing. These dialogue\
      \ boxes should be transparent, and maybe optional with the use of the \"select\"\
      \ button.\n\nOverall, the game is pretty sloppy. it feels like a beta product.\
      \ There's some good stuff, and some boss fights are enjoyable. the stages are\
      \ mostly boring though with like 2 interesting ones. it's getting better, but\
      \ feels like I'm playing early access.\n\nThe game can use some improvement,\
      \ but it has potential, and if the series were to continue, it might become\
      \ a true successor to the Maverick Hunter X games.  I can't recommend this game\
      \ for $20. That's a steep price for what the game is. There are many way better\
      \ for that price, like Azure Striker Gunvolt 2. Gunvolt 1 is a much more solid\
      \ game than this, and the asking price for that is $15."
