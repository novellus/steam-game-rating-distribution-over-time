      \ SVT-40 is a Soviet semi-automatic rifle. It is a big improvement from the\
      \ older SVT-38. It fires the hard-hitting 7.62x54mmR ammunition also found in\
      \ most soviet rifles and machineguns.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ampulomet Model 1941</h2>The\
      \ Ampulomet is a 125mm grenade launcher introduced in 1941 to give the infantry\
      \ a weapon to fight tanks. It uses a special 12 gauge shotgun cartridge to launch\
      \ a FBM-125 anti-tank grenade easily capable of penetrating 90mm of armor.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Tula Tokarev 33</h2>The TT-33 is a soviet semi-automatic\
      \ pistol. As with most Russian designs it is simple to manufacture and easy\
      \ to operate and maintain. It is a formidable weapon, with good penetration\
      \ and effective range.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TM-35</h2>The TM-35 is a square metal\
      \ cased Soviet anti-tank mine. When a vehicle drives over it and applies sufficient\
      \ pressure, the main charge of several 200g blocks of TNT detonates usually\
      \ destroying the vehicle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">RPG-43</h2>The RPG-43 is a Soviet\
      \ hand-held anti-tank grenade. It uses a very effective shaped charge HEAT warhead\
      \ similar to the Panzerfaust. It can penetrate up to 75mm of steel armor making\
      \ it very dangerous for enemy tank crew.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GAZ-67</h2>\tThe\
      \ GAZ-67 is a general purpose four-wheel drive vehicle used by the Soviet military.\
      \ It\u2019s main design has been copied from the American Willys \u2018JEEP\u2019\
      . It serves the important role of immediate troop transportation.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">42WLA Lend Lease</h2>The 42WLA is an army motorcycle used for quick\
