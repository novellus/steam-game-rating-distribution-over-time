Do not fall into the trap of comparing this to Slay The Spire, they are fundamentally different.\n\nThe core of the game consists of two ingredients: (1) all your cards are 1-use only. But don't worry, you get plenty of cards and it is unlikely that you run out of cards unless you make bad decisions. (2) this is a strategy game in disguise of a roguelike deckbuilding. Because all the cards are 1-use, the game makes no effort in building real card synergies. Instead, the order of cards played, and where they are played on the battlefield matters. There is a continuous stream of enemies incoming and you should choose which cards to play. All of the cards have a different range and/or area of effect.\n\nThe game has a great, coherent artstyle that is based on low-order polygons and limited color pallete. A downside is that I believe all enemies should have an outline of sorts, because sometimes they blend with the background or other enemies (due to limited color pallete).\n\nApparently the game has a lot of content, and hidden routes. A downside is that, even though I've played for 10 hours already, I'm still not sure how to unlock a lot of the hidden content.\n\nAll in all, this game is *definitely* worth its price, and also your time, if you like roguelike deckbuilding, or puzzle, or strategy games.","timestamp_created":1610106605,"timestamp_updated":1610106605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43KH18PYCfMLCwQI="}
