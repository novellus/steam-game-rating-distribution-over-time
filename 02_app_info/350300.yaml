    review: Nice chill card game with online for 1-4 players.  Plays a bit like Uno
      meets Rummy meets Poker.  You try to get rid of all your cards by playing sets,
      runs, or single cards based on strength of set and combos.  A set is won when
      someone plays all their cards and you score points for what you have left if
      you don't win the set.  Once someone gets 100 pts, the player with the lowest
      score wins.
