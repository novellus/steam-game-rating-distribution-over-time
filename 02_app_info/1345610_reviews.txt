It's just a bit buggy.[/h1]\n\nI installed some new voices from Windows' settings and they did not appear as voices on the program.\n\nI have no idea what \"Bound Hotkeys\" page is meant to do. It just has a random text box... Maybe the \"Add Bound Phrase\" button would add some bounds there but then the button is not working. \n\nThe GUI is alright but doesn't feel satisfying. The drag bar buttons are a bit too small. There are two drag bar buttons, the \"help\" button \"?\" and the close window one. The help button doesn't do anything. It is useless, literally.\n\nMoving down a bit from the drag bar to the panels/pages/windows, there are no options to resize them. Wanted to make the Speech Input higher and less wide? Nope!\n\nChanging the GUI colours works but it doesn't change the history's selection colours. \n\nThe toggle view key is a mess. You can only bind single keys, CTRL + [Letter] or similar won't work. If you make your toggle view key a letter, after you open the GUI it will type the letter to the Speech Input window.\n\nThere are a lot of empty space on the GUI that could be used. No hard feelings, but I think the developer's strongest suit wasn't designing. The GUI feels inconsistent and unprofessional. It wasn't very user friendly. But after all, it works. Although the voice lagged for me too.\n\nThis is still early access, so I am hoping there will be some major changes in the future, which there probably will be. If the developer wants some ideas or help with the GUI, let me know.\n\nUPDATE 29.11.2020: The program suddenly stopped working. It's giving me a null reference exception. Reinstalling did not work and I've white listed the program on my AV too.","timestamp_created":1606416549,"timestamp_updated":1609895763,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4w/vQ6vYCf5DhsgI="}
