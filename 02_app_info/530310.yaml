      Irwin Chusid, WFMU DJ SEX AND BROADCASTING is a human, and humorous, look at\
      \ New Jersey\u2019s WFMU, a radio station that refuses any programming boundaries.\
      \ Most of its disc jockeys are unpaid volunteers, working for their love of\
      \ surprising, spontaneous radio. They play everything from flat-out uncategorizable\
      \ strangeness to every form of rock and roll, experimental music, jazz, psychedelia,\
      \ hip-hop, hand-cranked wax cylinders, gospel, Inuit marching bands, R&amp;B,\
      \ C&amp;W, radio improvisations, spoken-word collages, and throat singers of\
      \ the Lower East Side. Their captain is station manager Ken Freedman, who has\
      \ spent the past three decades keeping WFMU alive, independent, and one of a\
      \ kind. At 54, Ken has strapped his entire life and family to this crazy station,\
      \ and it may all soon be a memory. Since the introduction of the 1996 Telecommunications\
      \ Act, radio has seen massive corporate consolidation. This has dramatically\
      \ decreased the diversity of music formats being broadcast nationally and has\
      \ eliminated many independent and local voices from the public airwaves. Simultaneously,\
      \ the rise of algorithmic internet radio models (Pandora, Spotify, iTunes, and\
      \ Clear Channel\u2019s iHeartRadio) that deliver \u201Cautomated music recommendations\u201D\
      \ has tightened the screws on smaller players that attempt to use the internet\
      \ to bring human-controlled radio to larger audiences. During this time WFMU,\
      \ through it\u2019s foresight and perseverance, has served as a beacon of hope\
      \ for those who love music and believe in the importance of truly independent\
      \ media outlets. The film weaves personal stories of WFMU\u2019s eccentric DJs\
      \ with an exploration of the 21st-century media landscape that has made the\
      \ station such a rarity. As the film unfolds, WFMU reaches a crisis: Ken meets\
      \ with the board of directors. With six months until their next fundraising\
      \ marathon, they are almost out of money. Can WFMU stay on the air and stay\
      \ true to its independent spirit?"

    short_description: This documentary takes a close look at WFMU, the strangest
      and (some say) greatest radio station in the world. As the station manager tries
      to keep up with a changing media landscape, he battles a recession while keeping
      his rebellious DJs united.
