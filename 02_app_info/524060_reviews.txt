The controls take some getting used to (rotating the blocks mid-flight is a challenge) but once you get that down, it makes for fun and challenging gameplay. I recommend giving it a shot if you're into tetris style puzzle games, especially for the low price. Even better, I got it in a game bundle, so it's been well worth the few pennies I got it for.
