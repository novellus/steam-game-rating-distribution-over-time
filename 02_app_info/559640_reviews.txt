It feels like Steam is just trying to accrue easy money by selling a low-effort product to gamers who don't know better. Even that is fine as a business choice, but then there's the reality that the games are unstable and even have game-breaking glitches that are harder to fix thanks to the unconfigurable, out-of-the-box emulation structure that seems convenient on the surface but is actually really restricting.\n\nEither give out the broken game license for free or justify charging money by fixing the problems. It's like Steam is a landlord that owns the game rights and demands ridiculous circumstances to have the privilege of using it.","timestamp_created":1609190244,"timestamp_updated":1609190311,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469798654317855835","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xfDN1fYCddudvgI="}
