This game obviously draws some of its inspiration from The End Is Neigh.\nI won't go as far as to give it a thumbs down, but the game is so short that even the 50% off sale is too expensive.","timestamp_created":1608847971,"timestamp_updated":1608847971,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4q/qzy/YCeIryvAI="}
