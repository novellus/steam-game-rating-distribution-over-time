I have not played a game quite like this.The developer worked hard on optimizing the game.So much in fact that he did not put an idle animation on the player character.The lighting has to be rebuilt on some levels.The entire level is loaded all at once so there are no hiccups in performance.Pros:You play as an anime girlThird person, first person, Vehicles, and a floating camera all for you to control.Anime girlsOpen WorldRich and enticing plotlineIf you don't like the dialogue, you can actually edit the onscreen text and change it to whatever plotline you want.You get a penthouse in earth mode.You get a normal house in mars mode, but with several waifus to keep you company.A rich crafting system, so rich I'm not even sure how it works yet.Did I say there was anime girls?Cons:The game isn't called Tetris Story as it was first announced to be. EDIT: Still don't know what GDT2 stands for.9.9999999/10 still not better than Garfield Kart.","timestamp_created":1599086341,"timestamp_updated":1600326822,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":9,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568609058856964111","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh626zfQCepa3nwI="}
