But now I've lost two save games in the past three days, with one of them after putting in 40 hours, and the other after ten. I save and exit like usual, and when I start up the game again, there is no option to continue playing, and it shows my ship as level zero, and then loading the game the ship has no weapons or cargo or anything, so it's not like I can even try to rebuild from there. Developer help? This developed sometime in the past two weeks or so, I'm guessing from a glitchy patch or something. I'll be happy to change my review if it gets addressed or fixed because honestly I would recommend this game in all aspects except for this. 40 hours is a lot of time to lose on an update glitch...","timestamp_created":1609029289,"timestamp_updated":1609029289,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.461783438920974731","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4wtDn0PYCcaXJvQI="}
