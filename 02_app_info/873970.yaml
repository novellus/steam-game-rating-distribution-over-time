    review: I bought this game a while back and was just looking through my games
      and decided to review it. DO NOT Buy this game on pc, Play the mobile version
      which is way better and also free, The resolution is horrible on pc and even
      though im against micro-transactions none of them are here to help you quickly
      progress through the game unless you do it through cheat engine which is the
      ONLY way I could find, The only reason this isn't refunded is because I support
      the company, Even though I don't support this port.
