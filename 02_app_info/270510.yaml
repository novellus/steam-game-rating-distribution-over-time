    review: "EPOCH is an on-rails shooter that was original released for iOS devices\
      \ back in 2011. It found its way to Android a year or so later, and eventually\
      \ made its way to Steam in 2014. For a mobile game at that time it was probably\
      \ a pretty awesome experience with all the swiping and tapping and whatever\
      \ else that would have been going on. I imagine it could have been quite an\
      \ intense and exciting experience. Unfortunately in 2020, on Steam, it\u2019\
      s very much the opposite.\n\nThe gameplay consists of switching between 3 positions\
      \ and taking cover to avoid damage while attacking and destroying enemy robots\
      \ with a variety of weapons. Upon finishing a level you will receive a number\
      \ of credits based on your performance and you\u2019ll salvage an item or upgrade\
      \ to equip yourself with for the following levels, or to sell in the scrapyard\
      \ (shop). You\u2019ll also acquire some \u201Cintercepted data\u201C which you\
      \ can read between levels for some basic idea of what\u2019s going on story-wise.\
      \ You gain experience at the end of each level too, and each level up will,\
      \ of course, improve your stats to some degree.\n\nFor the majority of levels\
      \ on easy and normal, the gameplay was pretty slow and boring. Unfortunately,\
      \ you\u2019re forced to play through easy first, then you\u2019re expected to\
      \ play again through three more difficulties. I have no doubt the higher levels\
      \ are of a much faster pace and pose a greater challenge but by the time I had\
      \ finished easy and most of normal, I was bored of it. The easy playthrough\
      \ took less than an hour, and normal wasn\u2019t a great deal longer, so I got\
      \ bored pretty quickly. It may have been a little more enjoyable if we could\
      \ pick the difficulty from the beginning rather than forcing us to replay the\
      \ game several times over, but even then the gameplay mechanics just aren\u2019\
      t that great on PC. There\u2019s also an arena mode you unlock quite early on,\
      \ with endless amounts of enemies, but it\u2019s still just the same basic combat\
      \ over and over.\n\nThere is little in the way of story in EPOCH, with most\
      \ of it being through reading the intercepted data after each level. There\u2019\
      s a few seconds of the opening scene to the first level that gives a very basic\
      \ overview of what your aim is, and you can clearly see that you\u2019re travelling\
      \ somewhere while playing through the game and killing robots, but that\u2019\
      s about it. With the gameplay being so poor, it would have really benefitted\
      \ from a decent story. Unfortunately it just doesn\u2019t deliver. There\u2019\
      s not really any reveal or context with the ending either. You defeat the boss\
      \ and that\u2019s it. The end. Play again on the next difficulty.\n\nI don\u2019\
      t doubt that EPOCH was probably a great mobile game a few years ago, and maybe\
      \ even still, but my experience of it on Steam was certainly not impressive\
      \ or enjoyable. Being forced to play through an tediously easy starting difficulty,\
      \ with slow and repetitive gameplay, is not something I find enjoyable. It\u2019\
      s a cheap game though, so it\u2019s got that going for it, and that would be\
      \ the only reason I\u2019d suggest trying it if it looks like something you\
      \ might enjoy already.\n\n[quote]For more reviews follow [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33506892/]Gawain\
