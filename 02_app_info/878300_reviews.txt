The \"earth\" has a sort of mass that leads to slower turns and huge amounts of momentum just like I imagine the earth really is. It's not a perfect game and the levels are simple in design but get harder as you play.","timestamp_created":1559522703,"timestamp_updated":1559522703,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46f6yjesCePDRwgE="}
