On the startscreen, it runs smooth, ingame (after minutes of waiting coz of \"loading\") it also runs smooth. \nI thought its my GC settings but those are all fine. i changed the compatibly from win 8.1, 8, 7 and vistra - nothing helped. I changed the ingame settings from Epic toll low and that also didnt helped. \n\nIts the game itself. I tried to change it but i cant recomment it if that is \"normal\". its [b]NOT PLAYABLE[/b] in this state.\n\nI asked for a refund already. Its sad, the game actually looks nice and i wish it would be playable - i sure would enjoy it.","timestamp_created":1492639906,"timestamp_updated":1506677871,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50132143497467041","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mfq/5t4CftiYdw=="}
