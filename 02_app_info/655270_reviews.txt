Plenty of options for sound controls fov to make it a comfortable experience and really let you get lost in the game for a bit. Levels aren't too confusing, but the dialog is. Maybe it's because I haven't put in the time to read the footnoted content in the credits before playing to understand the placement of quotes and such, or maybe it's just simply meant to be confusing as part of the experience. Also Found a potato so that was the most rewarding thing I got from this game lol. I appreciated the potato. I played through it a second time to look at the things I missed which was nothing major, just a few quotes as far as I can tell. Anyways, it's cheap, takes a few minutes give it a try if the screenshots look appealing to you.","timestamp_created":1609634121,"timestamp_updated":1609634121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40vDq4vYCfZf0vwI="}
