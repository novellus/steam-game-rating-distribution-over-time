It can stand on its own with a host of different features like production chains and resource management as well as three dimentional dungeon creation. This means you need to provide your minions with food and drink and weapons and armour. You can also be more creative and build things like a lava moat around your base. Oh and there's a lot of hydrualic options aswell, although i havn't played around with these yet so i cant comment on how they work.\n\nA mention also must be made for the developer Rasmus who despite being extremely busy working on the game still takes time out on the games own website and steam forums to answer posts and help out players.\n\nOverall a very enjoyable game even in early access as long as you accept the inevitable bugs.","timestamp_created":1440275844,"timestamp_updated":1609838530,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503984928131103516","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw3dH26PYCfaiyQw=="}
