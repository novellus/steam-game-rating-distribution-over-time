A major update has tackled the concerns therein head on, which means it's time for a new one. I've played through the first 41 levels so far and on a preliminary basis can say that the changes worked—the game remains fun and challenging, but not challenging in a tedious way. I now provisionally recommend it (a fuller review will have to wait until I've replayed a lot more of it).\n  \nThe art is good for its style, the writing is excellent (it's amusing without overdoing it), mechanics are good, difficulty curve is smooth (so far), and the overall conceit is charming. The controls are slightly annoying from time to time, but not nearly as annoying as they used to be, and now well within the bounds of acceptable.\n\nWith the changes, I expect to finish it now.\n\n———\n\nThe concept is great and a lot of the levels are extremely fun. So why don't I recommend it? Because the difficulty curve is far too uneven and too many levels rely on the pure physical challenge of mastering chaining together a sequence of extremely precise mouse movements and click timings, with nothing interesting remaining to \"figure out\" apart from the necessary physical practice, long past the point it ceases to be play and instead becomes something akin to athletics, or training for performance art (in the sense of, e.g., juggling or ballet). It might be fun to watch someone else stream it, but to do it yourself is... well, work.","timestamp_created":1548832020,"timestamp_updated":1609339864,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558503091335296631","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609270050,"developer_response":"It has been quite some time since this review, but we appreciated your feedback and thought you might want to take another look.  We just released a major update that addressed a number of community concerns, and improved the game in every way. It won't change everything, but that feeling of \"work\" is hopefully gone!
