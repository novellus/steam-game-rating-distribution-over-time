    review: This is a good puzzle game until you reach the last stage(stage 6)in this
      stage the puzzles become hard to the point that you would have to get into developers
      head to figure out every move and exactly what that person had in mind when
      he was creating this.I could do that and waste another 20 hrs but I see no point
      in doing that.Up until last chapter the puzzles are well done and there are
      some very clever ones too.The game is inspired by English Country tune and you
      can see that in every mechanic and even the graphics but sadly in the end this
      game is too smart for its own good,If you like puzzle games and dont mind the
      uber hard last stage then you can give it a go.
