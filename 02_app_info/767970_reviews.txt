I love the realistic loading (though towards the end or in Descent mode, you will want the Arcade style reload instead).  Most of the bad guys do the same thing (come straight after you), but there's some nice varieties as you progress through the story.  Even one I've never seen before in any game (a bad guy that slows down your bullets, unless you have lasers).  Story is a little cheezy, but that's not why you play this game.  You play to shoot up hordes of bad guys that are strategically placed to give you a challenge.  And every now and then you get thrown a curve ball as well.\n\nMost of the bugs in the game have been worked out.  The few that remain are minor and definitely don't take away from the fun!  Some might have trouble with the gripping of the guns (it works like a toggle), but you get used to it and eventually it becomes 2nd nature.\n\nIt's awesome that you can have a co-op game like this (up to 4 people) for such a price!  Just make sure you have a friend for that...you won't randomly find people to co-op with.  To me, with all the features, configurations, and game-play, this game could easily be worth $30.  Yeah, the graphics aren't the best, but the gameplay is a lot of fun.  I find myself going back to play the Descent mode by myself on a harder difficulty from time to time.\n\nAs of the time of this review, I've put 40 hours into this game (according to Steam)!!  Well worth the price.  :-)","timestamp_created":1603898661,"timestamp_updated":1603898661,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iOvzt/UCdrvUqgI="}
