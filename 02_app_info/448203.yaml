      \ the GWR Saint &amp; TPO add-on, enabling you to recreate realistic travelling\
      \ post office operations in the British Railway era.<br><br>Introduced originally\
      \ by the Great Western Railway, the Travelling Post Office would set out from\
      \ London in the dead of night and deliver the post to every major town, ready\
      \ for the locals to open in the morning. The concept of the Travelling Post\
      \ Office first originated in the 1830s on the Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railway\
      \ following an agreement with the General Post Office, and within the decade\
      \ it became mandatory that all railways had to carry the mail in some capacity.\
      \ The services quickly became known as Travelling Post Offices, and could either\
      \ be formed of dedicated mail rolling stock or a mixture of mail and passenger.\
      \ <br><br>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the Travelling Post Office\
      \ is the rolling stock itself, and how it operates. The Sorting Coach and Baggage\
      \ Coach were built from existing rolling stock designs, and would feature dedicated\
      \ \u2018TPO\u2019 interiors, complete with unique mail equipment. The Baggage\
      \ Coach was fitted with a net and several mail bag holders, while on the trackside\
      \ similar equipment was installed to perform the mail transfer. <br><br>At specific\
      \ locations, workers inside the TPO would prepare the mail bags to be hung from\
      \ the side of the coach, and these bags would be collected by a trackside net.\
      \ At the same time, any empty mail bags would be returned to the coach by a\
      \ similar process. This operation happened while on the move and allowed for\
      \ non-stop services throughout the night. <br><br>The BR Saint &amp; TPO Livery\
