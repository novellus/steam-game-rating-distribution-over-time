Generally speaking, these two movements should be together and hit the target 100%, but we decide to split them into two parts,<br><br>Players will find out Giga Drill Break is hard to hit someone who has prepared for defense, so this time you need to charge Gurren Boomerang to freeze the enemy, then dash to cancel backswing, so you can start Giga Drill Break. When you finish your enemy with your combo, we believe everyone can understand why Kamina create these with his life. If everyone can feel what Simon feels when he cast abilities, we will very glad to see that.<br><br>Thanks to the pilot feature, we can restore Simon in the game. We design ability with high damage for Simon------Core Drill.<br><br>Just like the battle of the Spiral King in the anime, everyone has a chance to damage the enemy's mecha.<br><br>There is still much exciting design in the game, but we hope the player can find them out in the DLC.
