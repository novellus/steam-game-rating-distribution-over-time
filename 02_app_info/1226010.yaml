    review: 'Basic game, borderline boring. Most of it is Match 3 puzzles, but here
      and there are a few other minigames, including Mahjong and Hidden Object segments.


      The Match 3 puzzles are the simplest I''ve seen. Not much variety when it comes
      to combos or power-ups, which makes the solving of the puzzles tedious and too
      time consuming. If achievements were included at least there would be some incentive
      to go through so many similar and unremarkable levels.


      I''m not giving the game a negative review because the game works and it cost
      me pretty much nothing, since it came in a big bundle of games. Would I recommend
      it? Maybe to young kids and older folks, who can benefit from the slow and not
      challenging nature of the game. Other than that, there must be better options
      out there.'
