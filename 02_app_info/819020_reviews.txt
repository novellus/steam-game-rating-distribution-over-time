I plan to, I am mid playthrough on stage 5 of I believe 8. However I do think I am qualified to offer an opinion of the game so far. The story as you may expect from Spike is good at getting it's hooks in you and keeping you invested. 2 character arcs in particular have stuck with me. I won't spoil which ones or what happens in them. However get ready for some very uncomfortable and dark moments. Another one I found pretty decent and another I honestly felt was a little generic. As far as the gameplay is concerned I honestly was not impressed. Odd frustrations like poorly explained difficulty levels, the fact it takes an entire day to advance 1 floor in a dungeon which can make or break your party, resting drains stamina...Somehow catching your breath actively tires out your party. The first boss is a poison wielding monster they don't prepare you for at all in the dungeon prior, no antidotes, no instruction on how to acquire them, hell they don't even give you the little tutorial pop up for the poison status until you are right in the bosses rad cancer spewing face. These plus some other gripes eventually combined to where I swallowed my pride and whacked it down to the easiest setting. This strips out the gauge management for stress, bladder and stamina as well as removes enemies other than bosses, makes bosses die in 1 to 2 hits, and removes the cost for certain things like returning to base from a dungeon. Essentially it all but plays the game for you. I feel like I am cheating by doing this and I feel dirty. I have finished Dark Souls, Nioh, Code Vein and got the platinum trophy for Sekiro. Yet I cannot play this game legit for fear of ripping out all hair until bald. And even with most of the gameplay stripped out it is still a tedious laborious process to get through dungeons. There are puzzles, alot of them are brute forceable so you won't find anything as elaborate as Zero Escape here. But even they I find a chore to complete. Honestly I want to like this game. I want to recommend it.  And from a narrative perspective I do.  However you can also experience the story through lets plays and other means, and I would say that is prob your best bet if you want to know what this game is all about but want to avoid the frustrating and tedious gameplay while keeping your pride intact.","timestamp_created":1609973752,"timestamp_updated":1609974057,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gtH77PYCdYORwQI="}
