    about_the_game: "<p>Monday Night Combat is a class-based, third-person shooter\u2026\
      \ and the most popular lethal sport of the future! It blends intense combat,\
      \ finishing moves, and gameshow-like challenges and rewards to produce an action\
      \ experience unlike any other. Why fight for \u201Chonor\u201D or \u201Cduty\u201D\
      \ when you can fight for the real American dream: cash, fame and endorsements?</p>\n\
      \t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>Key Features:</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>It\u2019s the Throwback Throwdown\
      \ in Monday Night Combat! Uncle Tully\u2019s Funland is now available in Crossfire\
      \ with new game play features! First up we have Chickey Cantor. He will now\
      \ spawn in Uncle Tully\u2019s Funland. Make Chickey fly away by shooting him\
      \ and earn a big single-life buff for your entire team! Wait for Chickey to\
      \ slam the ground and then you can grapple him. Ride him for eight seconds and\
      \ earn big money! Just be careful, riders tend to be easy targets for enemy\
      \ Pros. Secondly we\u2019re introducing new bot spawners. These spawners have\
      \ buttons for specifically spawning Jackbots, Black Jacks, Slims, Scramblers,\
      \ Gremlins, Gapshots and Bouncers.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Co-op</strong><br>\n\
      \t\t\t\t\t\tBlitz mode allow players to defend their Money Ball against armies\
      \ of robots by themselves or four player co-op over Steam. During various Blitz\
      \ challenges, players can spend money earned by destroying bots to build defensive\
      \ turrets around the Moneyball, upgrade one of six unique character classes,\
      \ or set off robot crushing environment hazards. The Challenges vary from a\
      \ ten round Exhibition Blitz to endless robot waves of ever increasing difficulty\
      \ in Super Sudden Death Blitz. Money earned from each Challenge goes into a\
      \ persistent Lifetime Earnings that allows players to unlock over 370 ProTags,\
      \ create custom classes, and get ranked on Leaderboards.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Competitive\
      \ Multiplayer</strong><br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCrossfire mode pits teams of players\
      \ against each other over Steam. Each team is supported by an endless stream\
      \ of robots fighting on their behalf; overwhelming your opponent\u2019s stream,\
      \ upgrading your Pros, and base defenses will be the key to your success!</p>\n\
      \t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Customizable Characters</strong><br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEach\
      \ Pro caters to their unique style of play and comes with their own set of upgradeable\
      \ skills.  Customize those skills and abilities even further with a variety\
      \ of unlockable products in the Custom Class feature.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Persistent\
      \ Stats</strong><br>\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEvery game of Monday Night Combat earns the\
      \ player money that goes towards their Lifetime Earnings. Lifetime Earnings\
      \ can be spent on unlocking custom classes and buying earned ProTags. How much\
      \ Lifetime Earnings you have also determines what level you are. Monday Night\
      \ Combat keeps a large set of persistent statistics for all aspects of gameplay.\
      \ MNC features over 370 \u2018ProTags\u2019 which are customizable tags you\
