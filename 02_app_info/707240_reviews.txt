I don't know if the bug was a result of the DLC or the original game but it didn't give out the 5000g reward after finishing the adventure. If you don't care about gold gain or are particularily fond of Valeros, the DLC might be worth buying. In fairness, I probably still would have bought it for the extra cards and character, but I wouldn't recommend it given that they managed to mess up what should have been a pretty simple if statement. That's 10 treasure chests I was shorted in addition to the chests that I keep getting shorted when the treasure chest menu bugs out while opening chests. Just enough to subtract a chest from my inventory but not quite enough to actually give me the contents. AND ANOTHER THING! *Rabble rabble rabble*\n\nY'all make it so difficult to love a game that would be nearly perfect without the bugs.","timestamp_created":1536553309,"timestamp_updated":1536553309,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513325631618499756","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tNrt4OUCcYuwqgE="}
