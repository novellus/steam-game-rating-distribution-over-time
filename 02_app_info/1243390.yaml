    review: 'I can''t say that this is a "must have" DLC for the game, since it''s
      not that hard to get the money from the Global Mine, but it does help a lot.
      You do lose the feeling of earning, since your gold is always directly gathered,
      but without it, you would get an extra job to do, you won''t see the need to
      Attack Click or HP Heal Click until a bit later on the game, but if you need
      to farm you gold coin by coin, it gets overwhelmingly hard to keep up with your
      health/attacks.


      You should only buy this if it is discounted.'
