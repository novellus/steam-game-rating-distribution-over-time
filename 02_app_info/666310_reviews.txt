There is a lot more content now but the game still has a ton of issues. The flashlight has next to zero functionality. The enemies can block your exit (See the video) and force you to restart. Axe swinging animation is extremely basic and feels terrible. Keep working on it my dude.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UumB18Pejpk\n\nSo the developer has put a ton of work in, polishing the opening sequence.\nHowever, the entirety of the game currently available takes 9 minutes to beat, less if you don't die.\nI applaud the dev for continuing to work on this and release updates, but the game is still not even close to finished.\nI will say though, this one does WORK at least. :D\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FdgXu791jA4\n\n*---Previous review---*\nWhy bother realeasing this onto Steam?\nI realize it is early access but this is TOO early.\nThis is the dream that a fairly unimaginative teenage boy has at night, too early.\nThe game is ugly, broken and basically unplayable.\nPut this thing back where it came from or so help me!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KglhagEQlw&feature=youtu.be","timestamp_created":1500214617,"timestamp_updated":1524059641,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":41,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.623805999755859375","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1501535945,"developer_response":"Hi,\nat first, thanks for your review.
