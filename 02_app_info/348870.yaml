    review: "Normalito. Es bastante corto, se juega del tir\xF3n en 2 horas y media.\
      \ Se nota que el juego es antiguo y/o est\xE1 hecho con pocos medios. Las EOO\
      \ son buenas, porque no son de las facilonas. En cuanto a los puzzles, algunos\
      \ son entretenidos y son largos, pero otros son tont\xEDsimos. \nEn fin, como\
      \ impresi\xF3n general, est\xE1 bien para pasar el rato, por el precio que tiene\
      \ no se puede pedir m\xE1s."
