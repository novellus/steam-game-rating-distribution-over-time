    review: 'Mekabolt is a steam videogame featuring slowly loosened gripping grasped
      puzzles with a lemon twist!!!

      Nice camping visual effects that drive your mind insane...pouring with a thin
      amount of glass torches its a surprising consequence that does it fully right!!!


      Nifty heavy bulked level design the perimeter is cleared outstanding i give
      this game a 10/10 a trapped yielding experience with a dragging cutting out
      styled performance whipped into delivery shape love the burrito master'
