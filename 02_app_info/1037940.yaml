      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Please Read Before Buying!</h2><br><strong>Dead Monarchy
      is now going through a rebuilding process so updates won't be as frequent. If
      you feel the game is not ready yet based on what I've mentioned below, it would
      be best to hold out and not buy the game yet. For those that do buy the game
      to provide me with feedback and to help support ongoing development, you have
      my utmost gratitude.</strong><br><br>Dead Monarchy is an open world, turn-based
      tactical RPG inspired by games such as Battle Brothers, XCOM and Jagged Alliance.
      Equip your warriors with historically inspired equipment and attempt to survive
      in a dying world overrun by all manner of monsters.<br><br>There are three layers
      to the game. The &quot;town&quot; layer where you manage the player base, the
      &quot;map&quot; layer where you traverse the world and take on contracts and
      the &quot;combat&quot; layer where you engage enemies in turn-based tactical
      combat. Currently in Early Access, the goal of the game is to hunt down and
      defeat the 5 Monarchs whilst simultaneously building up your company and upgrading/defending
      your base.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1037940/extras/Dead_Monarchy_Features.jpg?t=1590488179"
      /><br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>[NEW] A multi-region open world map free for
      the player to traverse. There are 5 large maps, each map is a unique biome and
      has multiple settlements. This is still currently in active development.</li></ul><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>[NEW] There is now a perks system which completely reworks
      character progression. You can optionally carry up to two weapons which allows
      you to mix and match abilities at the expense of not fully mastering a specific
      weapon type. There are now also perks for boosting stats. Still in active development.</li></ul><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>[NEW] A manual save/load system has now been implemented as
      well as an optional ironman mode which is enabled during the start of a new
      game. Previously there was only an autosave system. That has changed, there
      are now 3 save slots for non ironman playthroughs and only 1 save slot for the
      ironman playthrough. Starting a new ironman playthrough will delete the current
      ironman playthrough. Not new but as an additional note, character death is permanent
      unless you reload a save file.</li></ul><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Turn-based,
      tactical combat where the player can control up to 18 warriors at once. No longer
      do you have to justify to yourself for playing with a small party of 6 poor
      souls against the world. Combat is phase based, meaning all units within a faction
      act before the next faction goes however movement is based on action points
      allowing movement multiple times in a turn.</li></ul><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Counter
      attacks and attacks of opportunity, ranged combat, synergistic abilities, flanking,
      action point system, positional bonuses and elevation tiles that influence hit
      chance.</li></ul><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>45 active abilities divided into
      9 weapon types. Sword, axe, mace, greatsword, greataxe, warhammer and rapier.
      There are then 2 ranged weapon types, longbow and crossbow.</li></ul><br><ul

      /><br><br>Dead Monarchy Studios is me, one guy named Kevin Zhang. I'm a solo
      developer and a gamer who's been chasing a lifelong dream of creating a RPG
      that I could live in. I was born and raised in Australia and I spent my childhood
      playing games. Dead Monarchy is my passion project and it has been influenced
      by games such as Battle Brothers, XCOM and Jagged Alliance. I plan to develop
      Dead Monarchy for several years, even after release. If I don't, then I'll see
      you at the stake.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kevin.

      notes: There are ways to trigger decapitations and explode heads during combat.
        The story isn't established enough to really contain anything let alone mature
        content except for character biographies. There is also minor "nudity", one
        enemy unit the "Mutant Scout" has a topless variant that sometimes appears.

    review: Im giving this a thumbs up because its very inexpensive and the one man
      dev team has openly stated hes not happy with the game right now and is reworking
      it completely a very brave decision and one which i wish more game devs would
      take rather than pumping out the typical steam early access turds. I love the
      basic concept for this game and i think its potentially a winner its unique
      enough and compelling enough to make it a future sleeper hit but from what i
      have seen so far this game really does need a vast amount of work particularly
      in regards to enemy variation loot being both exciting and rewarding enough
      i may have just been unlucky but so far i get nothing but garbage and dead recruits
      far too many dead recruits and as new recruits dont come with weapons and even
      terrible weapons are insanely expensive to buy or make in its current state
      the game at least in my experience so far is very hard indeed. Only buy this
      if you really like the concept and want to help a brave and honest developer
      suceed if your just looking for a almost finished game look elsewhere for now
