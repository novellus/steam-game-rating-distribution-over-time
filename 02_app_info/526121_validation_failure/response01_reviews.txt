Eighteen-and-a-half minutes this time! [i]Almost[/i] an album's worth!!\n\n   Value still sucks, though; in fact, it's worse than ever before. Five dollars for eight short tracks ain't exactly a bargain, certainly by Steam standards. \n\n   Same advice as the last two soundtracks: wait for a sale. And make it at least 50% off this time.\n\n   Verdict: 9/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1542891804,"timestamp_updated":1564674797,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566413521766662598","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43NX4puwCdubLsAE="}
