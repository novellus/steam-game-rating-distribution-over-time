    about_the_game: 'You have to control the animal in an uncompromising struggle
      for survival. Each has its own individual characteristics: mass, speed, manoeuvrability,
      damage, skin thickness, absorb and dry. The battle takes place on land, in water
      and in the air. Water is a major resource that activates regeneration and prevents
      death from thirst. You can distance yourself, but the drought begins and players
      are forced to go to a risky rapprochement in the fight for the last water.<h2
