The mistery of the Lost Cosmonauts is an actual theory that states that the USSR covered the deaths of cosmonauts in failed missions previous to Gagarin's. It was the reason I bought this. However, this game does not provide any background about it. It just presents 10 different  one line \"riddles\" and provides a few words for hints over some overlay of static images. Then you are supposed to google it to figure out the answer and input it in a text box, that is all. It should not be called ARG, it is not such thing. However, for any achievement hunters out there looking for some easy ones, this can net you a 100% completition in less than half hout (or faster if you use a guide). I wouldn't recommend this, better to read any online articles on the subject","timestamp_created":1545365833,"timestamp_updated":1545365833,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.611138403415679932","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40ui+5+cCffvqtQE="}
