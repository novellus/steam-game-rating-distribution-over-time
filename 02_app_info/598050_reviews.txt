It's mostly diverse, though there are a bit too many tasks that are of the “find the tiles for the next puzzle\" sort. The puzzles themselves are of easy-to-medium difficulty. There are not very many hidden-object scenes, but they are all good and even require some creative thinking.\n\nThe story won't blow you away in its originality, but it's well developed and satisfying. The characters are annoying and prissy rich people, but they are appropriately conceived and fit the tone of the narrative.\n\nEven the bonus material is terrific. There's a quest that adds an important new dimension to the story, an extra casual game, and a fun video and photos from the development process. It's great to see a little bit of the real people who made this lovely game. I wish all games would do this.\n\nAnd there's even a charming companion cat! How can I not give a thumbs up to that? :)","timestamp_created":1543370752,"timestamp_updated":1543370752,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56556934118270874","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgJiErOcCdI/yswE="}
