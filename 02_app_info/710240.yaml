    review: "After trying the demo for interworlds. I became very interested in what\
      \ the creator would do with the mechanics (mini world especially) and unfortunately\
      \ I cannot recommend this game at this time. \n\nPros : (They ARE there!)\n\
      The concepts are sound, and the visuals impressive for an early stage of development.\
      \ The creator has even updated the visuals to be more framerate friendly even\
      \ with ragdoll physics. The levels feels lush and like they didn't just slap\
      \ some geometry together.\n\nBut what it has in flair it lacks in substance.\n\
      Cons : \nMechanically right now this game is clunky, and not player friendly.\
      \ Controls are locked unnecessarily when tools are present. Thinking outside\
      \ the box isn't rewarded, and certain in-game interactions conflict with the\
      \ theme the game is trying to promote. Let me present some examples.\n\nThe\
      \ mini world offers players the opportunity to  move MUCH larger objects than\
      \ themselves, and it creates some fun interactions with the world. One part\
      \ lets you place a bridge across an otherwise unpassable river. One part lets\
      \ you use a massive block as cover from a handful of archery goblins! However,\
      \ my phrasing is deliberate when I say it \"Lets you\" do these things. What\
      \ if you try something new? Lets use the bridge on a different part of the riverbank\
      \ to get behind the goblins... Nope, it locks into place to create the only\
      \ traversable walkway. What if you want to use that large block to SMASH the\
      \ goblins instead of use it as cover? Nope... passes right through them. What\
      \ if I want to teleport or quickly access mini world with my sword hand? NOPE\
      \ gotta un-equip the sword first. No \"auto-sheath\" function, really? And you\
      \ can only access many features from pedestal boxes with the necessary piece\
      \ you need for the obstacle. For example, a \"boss\" stands between you and\
      \ the end of the level, and you qickly find your sword is useless. Instead you\
      \ are offered a fireball spell that needs to be pulled from the box for EACH\
      \ use. Standing still means the boss doesn't even kill you however, so it's\
      \ NOT very threatening. Just another exercise in tedium to finish EXACTLY what\
      \ the game intends you to do.\n\n\nTLDR:\nThis game has GREAT potential, but\
      \ someone with some game design background should work with the creator to flesh\
      \ out the mechanics and breath some life into this already potential filled\
      \ project.  As it stands however, I find it unplayable due to being bland and\
      \ nit-picky about what you're allowed to do at any given moment."
