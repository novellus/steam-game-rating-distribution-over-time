Using VR Noda provides users Mind Mapping on steroids! Noda is an invaluable tool to those wanting to optimize thier brain power and leverage the power of VR in organizing and generating thoughts and ideas around a specific topic or effort. Want to map out your life goals, organize a research paper, author a novel, or plan a party. You can do it better in Noda! The experience is at once meditative as well as gamified and designed to put you \"in the zone\" so you can be your most creative and productive. I find after i start a Node map i visit it several times a week and just the experience of being there looking at the map will trigger new thoughts and expand my map. \nCheck out my overview of Noda over at my YouTube channel, VR 4 Work https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOPivLudusITkFvxUMzu3SA","timestamp_created":1607696931,"timestamp_updated":1607696931,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i4uNqfYCdcuNuQI="}
