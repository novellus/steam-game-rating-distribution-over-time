You can tell how much love and passion was poured into this game from every angle.\n\nEvery run, you collect pieces of the dragons, which unlock new temporary power-ups when collected for the first time. These power-ups then show up on runs, and you have to collect them to get their temporary effects. You can also use your currency, water, to buy the power-ups early, if you're finding a dragon too difficult or not fun and just want the power-up. You also collect eggs each run. Every dragon has 3 eggs, each one makes you do more damage against that dragon on that run. Eggs and dragon pieces are also used for upgrading your items and water tank.\n\nA very minor negative point would be that not every power-up is helpful. There are 2 power-ups that do nothing but make the game harder to see. Sure, it's fun that discovering that getting 3 specific power-ups (including these two) at the same time makes the screen turns pretty colours, but otherwise, I don't see a reason why these are here. Maybe there's actual reasons for these to exists, perhaps a secret I haven't discovered, but nevertheless it's just kind of annoying.\n\nThe random generation never feels unfair, probably because it's got set layouts that are mixed and matched to form the level. Each dragon has specific enemies, layouts, and secrets, play this game for long enough, and you'll end up mapping out the intricacies of each dragon variation. \n\nThis game has a fantastic sense of discovery for a randomly generated runner. Each run you'll find little things you didn't know existed. An egg location, a new shortcut to a lower atmosphere, or a specific path where you bounce along a conspicuously placed row of enemies to find a power-up location or egg that you never found before. Perhaps you'll even hear the song of a mysterious creature, cradling a single piece of a larger whole.\n\nDid I mention that the art and animation is beautiful, and the soundtrack SLAPS? \nSeriously this soundtrack is so good, it reacts to what you're doing, have different variations on the same song depends on the type of dragon, and even switches between chiptune and a full band version!\nThe art perfectly captures the weird creatures that live on the backs of the dragons, while also being capable of sprawling landscapes of space, cloud formations, and a ruined planet.\n\nEarthNight is magnificent. I made this review right after my first win, and I still have more secrets to uncover. Buy it if you want something to play while doing something else, or a game to sink into and enjoy the atmosphere for a couple hours.","timestamp_created":1596819611,"timestamp_updated":1596819611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ417P35PMCcJuAmgI="}
