The amount of passion and creativity put into this title is unbelievable.\n\nIts an arcade game kind of hard to describe, the main feature consists on eating balls to get bigger and puke them depending on the situation. As weird as it sounds, its really polished and what it looks like a simple game mechanic turns into a massive amount of variety really soon. You'll go from throwing darts, bowling balls, bombs, etc... to dodge giant and weird creatures like a bee-cat or insect-bulls and use them to your advantage, to solve puzzles and intrincate mazes, to fight bosses with really fun and yes, weird designs, and the list goes on.\n\nThere is a lot of exploration between levels that gives you some freedom, lots of costumes and powerups that can be used to complete levels in more efficient ways, many many side challenges through the way, and various multiplayer modes (though the player base its extremely low sadly, so...). To sum things up, it has a lot of content, getting the 100% of the game will take you around 20 hours.\n\nThe pixel art its beautiful and extremely detailed, and the soundtrack is surprisingly good and full of personality. Also, the chaos that can happen sometimes on screen, accompained with the great music tracks, create some hilarious situations that are just fun to watch.\n\nNothing bad to say about this title honestly, its fantastic, and its really cheap considering the amount of content it offers. If you buy it you are probably gonna love it, and in that case, please, leave a review. The game only has around 25 reviews on Steam (all of them positive) and its a crime in my opinion to let this hidden gem die in obscurity.\n\nGive this game a chance, you wont regret it!","timestamp_created":1604019204,"timestamp_updated":1604019204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+tW/u/UCcPv6qgI="}
