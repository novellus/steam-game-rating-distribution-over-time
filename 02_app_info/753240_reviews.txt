Oh my goodness!   I want to say good things about this game cause its obvious stuff was being tried here.  But stuff simply put did not work right here.  Between the recipes you get being randomized, the uncontrollable camera, accidentally walking through walls, and the rather unpredictable difficulty I don't have many good things to say at this point.\n\nThe main reason this negative review came so swiftly for me was due to hardlocking myself (IE saving at a point where due to an event flag not triggering properly meaning you have to restart the entire game), not just once BUT TWICE!   My word I've had this happen not very frequently but this pissed me off so much.  \n\nAVOID THIS GAME!","timestamp_created":1561325139,"timestamp_updated":1561325139,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w96Ow+sCd6OPxAE="}
