    review: 'I was thoroughly displeased during the entire game, but managed to force
      myself to play the game till the end, in hopes that things would turn around...Well,
      I was wrong. Boring romance options--it is the first time I didn''t care about
      who I would romance--boring world, and a boring story that jumped from one event
      to the other at the snap of a finger. It felt like several different stories
      sloppily put together rather than one coherent and well-written game.


      Barely got 2 hours of gameplay. Not worth the high price it is asking.'
