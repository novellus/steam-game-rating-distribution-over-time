    about_the_game: "Bounce off logs, fences, roller coasters, and whatever else you\
      \ can find to pop as many bubbles as you can. Or turn on Dodge Mode to make\
      \ popping a bubble result in a loss.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlay on six unique levels,\
      \ all of which has a different twist to the gameplay!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease\
      \ note that this game is designed for multiple people. Playing the game in single\
      \ player would be a great way to get used to the game, but playing without another\
      \ person will make the game get very dull rather quickly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      So play Bubble Bounce today! Or maybe watch some gameplay or the trailer and\
      \ decide based on that instead of a vague description."
