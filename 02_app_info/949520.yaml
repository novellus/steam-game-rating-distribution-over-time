    review: "I REALLY wanted to thumbs up this title. :( While there are a lot of\
      \ walking simulators out there, only a hand full of titles are directly aimed\
      \ at relaxation. I would love to explore a new space, discover new areas, but\
      \ find my personal hauntings as well. Find that perfect meditation spot and\
      \ bookmark it for ready use. A place to be present and centered, wherever I\
      \ may be. I can only hope!\n\nSadly, I cannot recommend this title at this time\
      \ by my mentioned criteria (below) and on principle. I even made sure to take\
      \ the time to try it on all of my systems to see what was design and what might\
      \ have been system specific issues or simply defects:\n\n** Tested on HTC Vive,\
      \ Oculus Rift w/motion, WMR (Samsung Odyssey) | 1060 through 1080 GPUs\n\nPros:\n\
      * Wonderful concept even if not fully realized, and I feel like this HAS been\
      \ implemented with some caring rather than a quick wrap cash grab.\n\n* The\
      \ environments are well crafted, and definitely have that \"iconic spot\" feel\
      \ to them; That image in your head that embodies a special place, realized,\
      \ on demand.\n\n* Ran smoothly on all of my devices, feels moderately optimized.\n\
      \nCons:\n* Price - this is NOT marketed as an Early Access game, therefore I\
      \ must judge it by what is promised in the description vs what is actually delivered.\
      \ It is almost STRESSFULLY full of \"almost-there\", as if the road was paved\
      \ until the concrete ran out, stamped \"DONE\" and then left those final few\
      \ yards to our imaginations. I could forgive quite a bit of my experience if\
      \ I had some inkling of intent for fixing things up, or if this is in fact the\
      \ GA release and relegated to bug fixes.\n\n* Locomotion - Hello Teleport! When\
      \ first using teleport as guided I was expecting a nice soft pulsating ball,\
      \ or ethereal projection, gently gliding me to my destination on the breath\
      \ of angels. What I got was, a very much no-transparency thick white (what I\
      \ can only describe as) crosshair on the ground that joltingly appeared before\
      \ me. It feels out of place.\n\n* Locomotion Part Deaux - One above them all.\
      \ Swimming... I love underwater adventures, but What it turned out to be, for\
      \ me at least, was less a swimming experience and more of a \"Drowning Simulator\"\
      ! It starts fine, . Then... things turned dark. I was having to paddle uncomfortably\
      \ fast to try and even stay afloat. I was a rock, destined for the bottom of\
      \ the ocean and there I landed. After spastic attempts to \"cruise\" along blipping\
      \ and bobbing through the water it REALLY ended up feeling disturbingly like\
      \ what drowning might feel like.. No matter how hard I paddled I couldn't keep\
      \ the surface of the water, and if I took a break for even a second the physics\
      \ would drop me like a cement-shoe-laden gangster seeing his last few moments\
      \ on this earth. Sadly it is not in me to withdraw... so I put on my brave face,\
      \ and paddled my little heart out until back to shore.\n\n* Tutorial - I am\
      \ glad there is one! But unforutnately as quickly as it appeared, it is gone\
      \ and you are left wanting. (same experience all 3 HMUs)\n\nSummary: Would be\
      \ a promising EA title, if it were EA. Marketed and priced as a GM product,\
      \ however, all I can say is Caveat Emptor \"let the buyer beware\". \n\nNote:\n\
      I really do love their concept, and despite the sound of it, a lot of the implementation.\
      \ So, I am going to eat the cost, and hope that this is a labor of love that\
      \ will get the care and feeding needed to realize its potential. \n\nI see it...\
      \ Only so frustratingly... out... of... grasp."
