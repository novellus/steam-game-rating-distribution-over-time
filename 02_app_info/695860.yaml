      down to the squadrons, targets, locations, times, weather, flak locations, etc.

    review: Played this to help me learn the Spitfire.  Great campaign for someone
      that varies the missions to really show of what DCS can do as well provide you
      enough familiarity to build up your skills.  If you are learning the Spitfire,
      highly recommended this if you aren't ready for multiplayer yet.
