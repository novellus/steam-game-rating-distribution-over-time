    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>STORY</strong></h2>Awaken in a cursed
      land covered in a violent miasma that forces man to devolve to their most primal
      senses and take on new forms. Bear the burden of a dark spirit wishing for your
      only course of action to be the death of all those around you. Face countless
      foes on your way to the land known to very few as &quot;The land of limitless
      sky&quot;.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>FEATURES</strong></h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Stamina
      Management based combat system</strong> - The player has access to 10 different
      weapon types and can learn new skills for each weapon type, selecting two to
      use at will. Every skill the player uses consumes stamina and leads to tight
      situations when over used.</li></ul><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Decision
      Based Dialogue System</strong> - Situations play out for the player and lead
      to vastly different objectives based on how they choose dialogue options. Some
      NPCs can get to know the player and slowly build a connection to the player,
      eventually offering additional interactions.</li></ul><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>NPC
      Based Quest System</strong> - The NPCs in the game are the driving force of
      the plot. Each quest will center around different characters and the actions
      you take will have different effects to them and the world around you.</li></ul><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Soul Seat System</strong> - As the player rises in
      level the dark spirit, Kaithe shall force them to face a person he once possessed
      in order to prove they are worthy to gain more of his strength. Until the challenge
      is passed they are locked away from leveling up any further.</li></ul><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Kaithe Release System</strong> - The player is embodied
      by a dark spirit. As enemies fall in battle they release an aura of their hope.
      Collecting these regenerates your health as well as builds up a meter to release
      the dark spirits powers.</li></ul><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Travel Based
      Ingredient/Crafting System</strong> - Potions require special ingredients to
      be crafted which can be found around the land in areas where they thrive. A
      night blossom is found most commonly at night in full bloom. Some ingredients
      can only be found in precarious locations.</li></ul><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Within
      each chapter, the player is tasked with breaking through forces that have entrapped
      and estranged travelers from distant lands alongside horrific creatures. The
      hero awakes with no knowledge of his surroundings and only has their fragmented
      memories to comfort them. Despite being a new resident of this dangerous land,
      they may be the only one who is capable of freeing the people from their endless
      curse. All the while the hero must bear the burden of his curse, a never ending
      life as a puppet to a dark spirit.</li></ul>

    review: 'Shit, everything looked preem till i started it. Cool armor at first
      but i couldnt EVEN SEE IT from soo MUCH FOG/GAMMA the game has. Everything looks
      GRAY ffs. Then, combat was cool but not even sounds of steel meeting steel,
      nothing. And to topple it not even an ESC button! wtf i mean i alted-4 the shit
      to close it.


      Looks promising tho. I''ll wait for the final game. For now, a refund is in
      order.'
