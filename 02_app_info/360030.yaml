    review: "If you enjoy Diablo, you'll probably like XLarn. In essence, Larn is\
      \ Diablo. So much of the gameplay of Diablo so closely resembles Larn that Blizzard's\
      \ game is at least a homage: level layouts randomly selected from a pre-designed\
      \ list; persistent monsters appearing in random locations when first entering\
      \ the level; random loot drops; being able to both cast spells and wield weapons\
      \ (melee and ranged); health and magic that regenerate over time; spam combat\
      \ that involves repeating basic attacks over and over again with more powerful\
      \ weapons/spells; distinct, powerful boss monsters at the bottom of the dungeon...\
      \ A lot of these elements are commonplace now, but they were first brought together\
      \ in one game in Larn, and didn't appear together again until Diablo.\n\nPlayers\
      \ of Rogue, NetHack, or any of countless other early roguelikes know that the\
      \ most common way to die in all of those games was getting stuck in a randomly-generated\
      \ level with no obvious way to continue, and thus slowly starving to death.\
      \ Larn directly addresses that problem, both by not randomly generating dungeon\
      \ layouts, and by not having a starvation mechanic. So you never get stuck on\
      \ a level that was generated with no exits, as happens sometimes in Rogue and\
      \ almost always in NetHack, but even if you do get stuck for some other reason,\
      \ the game does not punish you by killing you for not being able to find an\
      \ exit that isn't there. What this means, though, is that Larn is an easier\
      \ roguelike than most; you can successfully complete a game of Larn at least\
      \ 25% of the time.\n\nLarn consists of two dungeons: the normal dungeon (with\
      \ a very scary boss fight on the tenth level), and the elite dungeon (the volcano)\
      \ which actually contains the object of your quest: the unique medicine needed\
      \ to heal your daughter. You have a timer of \"mobuls\" - basically your daughter's\
      \ health - that decrements one every 100 moves. The first time you play, your\
      \ daughter has 300 mobuls. Once you win the game, that amount decreases the\
      \ next time you play, and you start with a debt that has to be paid in addition\
      \ to finding the potion. \n\nIt even allows for some strategic variation, with\
      \ a variety of weapons and equipment that you can find that improve upon what\
      \ you can buy. The store has two top-tier weapons: the sunsword and the Lance\
      \ of Death. The sunsword is like a +10 weapon: it does a lot of damage, and\
      \ hits about 99% of the time. The Lance of Death instantly kills about 99% of\
      \ the monsters in the game, but it has a much lower hit probability.\n\nXLarn\
      \ is a recreation of Larn that uses mouse input and tile graphics. There are\
      \ a few things changed/missing in the translation:\n- XLarn accepts single-letter\
      \ commands, with mouse input for any additional information. So you can move\
      \ with the keypad, but you cannot choose a direction to shoot with a keypad,\
      \ or type the name of a spell to cast. You must learn to recognize the spell\
      \ icons so that you can click on them in the spell menu.\n- the graphics are\
      \ lovely. For the most part, they remind me fondly of Glenn Wichman's Atari\
      \ ST implementation of Rogue. Some of them are arbitrary, jokey, or just selections\
      \ that were \"close enough to work, I guess\" from a public-domain icon library\
      \ (the shambling mound is a D&D troll, the lamia noble is... a donkey? The umber\
      \ hulk is... Hulk??)\n- there are a bunch of additional items in the game that\
      \ didn't exist in Larn. So far I've found: rope, ladders, and magic boxes (which\
      \ are basically like chests).\n- the player's inventory is not listed with letters,\
      \ so when you want to select an item from your inventory, you must scroll to\
      \ highlight the item you want and press enter, rather than just typing the corresponding\
      \ letter.\n- an early game exploit has been removed, preventing players from\
      \ short-cutting their way to a sunsword as you could do in the original\n- there\
      \ is no way to tell which specific squares you have visited on each level\n\
      - there are multiple difficulty settings to choose from at the beginning of\
      \ the game. These seem to adjust how hard monsters hit you, and how often.\n\
      - the hit probability is set much lower than in the original; fights with even\
      \ basic monsters take many turns because you have to swing 20 times to hit once.\
      \ This makes combat a much more strategic choice than in the original: do I\
      \ stay to fight this monster so that I can gain XP and get stronger, or do I\
      \ save time by running away? If you stay to fight every monster like you would\
      \ in Larn, you may actually have a hard time completing the quest in 300 mobuls.\n\
      - vermin monsters - rats and bats at least - spontaneously multiply while you\
      \ are fighting them. Combined with the lower hit probability, this becomes really\
      \ troublesome. In my plays of the game so far, both the first level of the dungeon\
      \ and the \"overworld\" (outside) filled with so many bats it began to be difficult\
      \ to traverse the level. This is the only issue that resembles an actual bug\
      \ I've encountered so far. When I finally get powerful enough to hit reliably,\
      \ I make a point in every game to go back and exterminate all the bats and rats\
      \ on every level, just to cut down the likelihood that I will get trapped by\
      \ a solid wall of bats.\n- a bunch of impassable terrain - trees - have been\
      \ added that make the overworld more visually interesting while also providing\
      \ obstacles that one must maneuver to avoid.\n\nAs a result of these changes,\
      \ XLarn feels different than Larn: a little slower, a little more grindy. But\
      \ it's close enough that I still love it, just like I love Diablo, too."
