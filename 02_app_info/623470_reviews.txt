There was a minor graphics glitch for me in one scene early on, which worried me, and I wasn't sold on the style at first; however, the glitch didn't affect the game at all, and the art, puzzles, and HO scenes turned out to be excellent. This second entry in the League of Light series has a distinctly Halloween-y feel, with witches, scarecrows, and a full moon rising.\n\nPros:\n- excellent art\n- nice variety of puzzles and HO scenes\n- customizable difficulty settings\n- fully interactive map\n- better-than-usual story\n- good bonus chapter\n- second, small-but-enjoyable bonus chapter that fully rounds out the plot\n\nCons:\n- I had an issue where my screen would flicker (like a refresh) in one particular area early in the game; it wasn't wholly resolved by using Windows compatibility mode (for Windows 8, in my case), but it didn't affect the game, and didn't show up anywhere else\n- no Steam achievements or trading cards (but the in-game achievements were interesting)\n\n[b]Overall:[/b]  Highly recommended.  Most of the puzzles are easy/medium, but there are a few challenges. In the end, I found this game more immersive than many HOPA games.  I would wait for a sale or at least buy in the bundle, but that's not a reflection on the quality of the game.","timestamp_created":1605375480,"timestamp_updated":1605375691,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.574844956398010254","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j6H24/UCesiurgI="}
