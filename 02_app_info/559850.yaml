    review: "Time Tenshi 2 is the sequel of Time Tenshi. It adds to the story from\
      \ the first one while adding a lot of other elements to keep the reader entertained.\
      \ With the concept of time at your grasp, the possibilities seem endless. \n\
      \n[h1]Pros[/h1]\n- Some interactions between characters are nice. I especially\
      \ the interactions Kenji has with Rose.\n- The character portraits are improved.\n\
      - The art and background music is nice. Better than the first game? Not sure,\
      \ but it is more consistent in comparison to the first game where some CGs had\
      \ different artstyles. The egyptian sounding music in the title screen is nice.\n\
      - I like most of the characters and how they were handled here. Tessa is a little\
      \ rude, but is entertaining in a couple of scenes. Rose, Michelle, and Tensai\
      \ are done fine as well. \n- The story is entertaining and gives a lot of explanations\
      \ on things to give you a good understanding as to what is going on and why\
      \ it is happening.\n- More choices. Yay!\n\n[h1]Cons[/h1]\n- Wish Kyo acted\
      \ more serious since her talking about breasts during their missions happened\
      \ a lot. It was getting to the point where I almost got annoyed with it like\
      \ Tessa was. Speaking of which, I was hoping she and Kyo had better interactions\
      \ since they seem to butt heads. Instead, it mostly consisted of Kyo ignoring\
      \ her, Tessa insulting her, and then [spoiler]Tessa has one line near the end\
      \ where she apologizes for being rude to her.[/spoiler]\n- Wish there were more\
      \ scenes that referenced things in the first game. Also, I wish there are handled\
      \ better than just to throw it in here and ask the reader, \"Hey! Remember this\
      \ from the first game?\" Not to say there was anything wrong with them. It's\
      \ just like there were only there for that sole reason. Not for a causal interaction\
      \ between characters that the reader could remember a character mentioning a\
      \ particular trait, but just asking the reader if they remembered a certain\
      \ character trait. \n- I get that the devs want to get character interactions\
      \ quickly to focus on the story, but there has to be a better way than a character\
      \ telling us their life story in one scene.\n- Why doesn't Kenji have a character\
      \ model? Would have been nice for a scene near the end of the story where [spoiler]they\
      \ state Kenji is now buff, but we never get to see his buff, steroid body.[/spoiler]\n\
      - Even though I just enjoy seeing them, it would've been nice to see Kenji's\
      \ parents more. We only see them for one scene and only mentions throughout\
      \ the VN.\n- Kenji should've had some time talking about how he feels like he\
      \ is dead weight instead of [spoiler]Rose giving him a task to do, and him telling\
      \ this to Tessa in her romance ending[/spoiler]\n- There were a lot of unanswered\
      \ questions. Questions that probably won't get answered anytime soon.\n\n[h1]Nitpicks[/h1]\n\
      - Why isn't Mizuki in the title page or in the store page trailer? What happened\
      \ with Mizuki?\n- One scene with Tessa shows Tensai's name in the text box instead\
      \ of hers.\n- I would like if there was a previous page button in the Gallery\
      \ section. Additionally, can we view the different iterations of a CG? For example,\
      \ one of Rose's CG has two different backgrounds when it shows up in the story.\
      \ However, unless I'm missing something, I can only view the first one. I tried\
      \ pressing buttons, but nothing happened.\n- Wish some scenes were structured\
      \ differently. Many went like \"talking, and then BOOM! Fanservice CG.\"\n\n\
      [h1]Overall[/h1]\nTime Tenshi is a good sequel. The art and background are nice\
      \ to look at. Not to mention that it improves on a lot of issues I had from\
      \ the first one. However, the excessive fanservice and breast expansion will\
      \ turn some people away from this. If you liked the first one, then I definitely\
      \ recommend it. If you want to read through a VN with time travel and fanservice,\
      \ then this VN is the right one for you. Definitely recommend getting it on\
      \ sale. Thanks for reading my review and have a good day, everyone."
