    about_the_game: 'Step into the fog to confront your terror: the evil that hides
      within.<br><br>The Fog Knows Your Name is a 300,000 word interactive teen horror
      novel by Clio Yun-su Davis, where your choices control the story. It''s entirely
      text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable
      power of your imagination.<br><br>It''s senior year of high school. Your classmate
      Rex Keller was found dead six months ago, and you were the last person to see
      him alive. Half the town thinks you murdered him, including his sister, Ennis.
      The other half believes it was the fog.<br><br>In your town, ever since anyone
      can remember, people die when the fog rolls in. No one knows exactly how or
      why. Some say the land didn''t want the colonizers, so it sends the fog as an
      agent of vengeance. Some say the Devil himself lurks in the fog, collecting
      souls. Others believe the fog simply drives people mad, causing them to enact
      violence onto each other and onto themselves.<br><br>There is one element of
      the tale that remains the same in every telling: those who perish in the fog
      are guilty of wronging another without confessing to it. Those who admit to
      causing harm can walk in the fog untouched. The liars die.<br><br>Their ghosts
      haunt the town. They''re haunting you, they''re haunting Ennis Keller, and they''re
      haunting your friends at school. If you and your friends can''t unravel the
      fog''s mysteries in time, those ghosts are going to kill you, one way or another.<br><br><ul

      aromantic, or poly.<br></li><li> Stop the thing in the fog and exorcise the
      ghosts who haunt your town.<br></li><li> Enter the fog and die.<br></li><li>
      Solve murders. The clues are just waiting in the fog.<br></li><li> Entangle
      yourself in romances with your friends and enemies.<br></li><li> Protect the
