Fast forward to today, and this simple take on the game is, in fact, the game stepped up.\n\nIf you've played Snake before, you need little gameplay description. Worth mentioning is the customization options. You can choose to set up walls for if/when a rectangular battlefield has become too boring. It is also possible to choose projectile shooting ability, although I don't know what this is supposed to do.\n\nLikewise- and perhaps more interesting to interest in challenge- there are three speed settings available to choose.\n\n---\n\nThe game is gratifying to play in this form at least as well as any other I've played, and more importantly the increased gameplay options offer replayability value. For a game to pull up on any toaster and play for when you want to \"zone out\" to a simple game, with openness above the base game as it's more well-known, I'd recommend this.\n\nNot quite for full price, though. Greatfall Games gets credit for making and adding options, but the options to customize play aren't very diverse. By downloading Python 3.0 onward and PyCharm, some troubleshooting, and with the help of an online tutorial, one can even make a game of Snake themselves, making it apparent for this game you're mainly paying for these few extra options. \n\nFor that I recommend giving two dollars a miss- for that money you can buy the ingredients to make miniature pastries in real life- and instead waiting for it to go on sale for $0.79 or less, like it is at the moment of my writing this review.\n\n--\n\nThis is a good game, and for 80 cents or so, it's a good take on Snake. I do recommend it.","timestamp_created":1605588303,"timestamp_updated":1605588303,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yaeh6vUCeubwrgI="}
