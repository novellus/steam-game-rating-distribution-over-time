      you left off<br>- Saving is automatic between scenes and upon exit (Alt-F4 or

      flee home. There is a penalty though, you lose all the collected treasures from
      the inventory.<br>- No tutorials, you have to figure out what to do - watch
      out for indications shown by Ollie, the crab<br>- No rush, play at your own
      pace; there is no time limit <br>- Secret Area<br>- Playable by controller or
      keyboard<h2 class="bb_tag">Controls</h2><br>- Start Game - Space button / A
