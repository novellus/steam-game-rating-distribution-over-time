    review: 'Musubihime benefits immensely from the lore & characters already being
      well established, leaving plenty of room for the story to do the talking while
      not feeling rushed at times like the main read. Overall, its story is one of
      the best Iwaihime has to tell, adding some much needed content to one of its
      most vital characters that was sadly overshadowed previously, and as such, I''d
      consider it a must read. That said, however, it really feels like something
      that should''ve been included with Iwaihime to begin with, rather than being
      sold separately as a DLC.


      If you''re looking to buy the game & find yourself wondering if the bundle is
      worthwhile, then my answer would be a resounding yes. If you''ve read the main
      story & want more, I don''t think you''ll be disappointed with what Musubihime
      has to offer.'
