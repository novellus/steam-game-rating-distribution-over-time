      \ the barrage you will be rewarded with additional lives (and a much higher\
      \ score). <br><br>Players who want a higher challenge can enjoy Dissonant Mode,\
      \ where Discord is permanently enabled. While playing in Dissonant Mode, the\
      \ Balance gauge is used to power Flash Bombs instead. A Flash Bomb will clear\
      \ bullets in a radius around you. If a regular enemy is caught in the radius\
      \ of one, that enemy will be marked. Marked enemies will drop additional items,\
      \ including extra life and bomb pieces if the enemy is sufficiently powerful."
