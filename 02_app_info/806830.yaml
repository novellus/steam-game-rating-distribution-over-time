    review: "I cannot say I would recommend this game. \nThere is no story whatsoever,\
      \ the gameplay is extremely limited, repetitive, and boring. It plays like a\
      \ mobile game. \nIt feels cold and lifeless. The animations are outrageously\
      \ bad. The horses often clip through obstacles while jumping over them and,\
      \ in first person camera mode, you can see the horse's rear end when jumping.\
      \ \n\nThis is an empty shell of a game. Young children who love horses deserve\
      \ a better game made with more care and with a real story. I would recommend\
      \ you purchase Petz Horsez 2 instead."
