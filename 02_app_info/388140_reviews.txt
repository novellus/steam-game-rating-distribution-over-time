I picked it up thinking it was going to be a lackluster grand strategy, but turns out it has much better graphics and flavor than my previous favorite, Commander the Great War.  Every city is illustrated, and the unit graphics are attractive, which I hardly expected.  Don't be deceived by the nato type units in the trailer; the graphics are just right.  The youtubes don't really show how pretty the game is. \n     It took awhile to figure out the mechanics since there doesn't seem to be a tutorial, but once you right click and bring up the sidebar menus it works smoothly.   I'm only up to the beginning of 14 September; there's a lot to do, but I expect to spend many, many hours with this lovingly researched game.","timestamp_created":1606878977,"timestamp_updated":1606878977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vuvckPYCdNbUtgI="}
