      /><br>Build whatever comes into your mind with over 220 blocks to build with!
      Most blocks can be chiseled and shaped in dozens of ways to ensure there is
      everything you need!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/950810/extras/2.png?t=1592211759"
      /><br>A planet is not enough? Well, luckily there are 100 additional planets
      to explore! Each randomly generated, no one looks the same. Some have villages,
      some epic dungeons, lava oceans, giant caves or purple alien worlds. There is
      always something to explore!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/950810/extras/3.png?t=1592211759"
      /><br>With friends everything is even funnier. Just input the name of your buddy
      and you can join his world, no server, no work.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/950810/extras/4.png?t=1592211759"
      /><br>Ever wanted level 10 on your gold-silver bow with a mithril string and
      a cactus on it? No? Well, with the forging system you can use whatever material
      you want!<br>Furthermore, there are paintings to collect, bosses to slain, music
      to play, precious ores to mine, dungeons to loot, villager to trade with and
      get mini quests from, plants and trees to grow and a high tech airship to craft
      (out of leather, steel and wood. Trust me, it flies!)<br>You are not sure what
      you want to do? An exciting main quest will lead you through the world of SquareWorld!<br><br><img
