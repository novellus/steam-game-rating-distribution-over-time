It seems pretty polished, but I have found some visual bugs when playing. Keep in mind at the time of me writing this review it is still in early access. I've sunk 3 hours into this game on the first day of buying it  before i got burnt out and needed a break. Overall, I would recommend buying it if you are looking for a fast paced high energy game with a unique look. This game is also perfect for speedrunning or to have in the background of a commentary YouTube video.","timestamp_created":1571224169,"timestamp_updated":1571224169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540636062622070313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4osWQ6u0CdsyZ1AE="}
