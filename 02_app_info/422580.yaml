    review: 'This DLC is a Core Rulebook for D&D 5E. This review is not specifically
      about this particular Core Book, but about how these work in general.


      Fantasy Grounds comes stock with the 5E SRD and Basic Rules for 5E, so you don''t
      strictly speaking need to buy the core books to play - that said, Wizards of
      the Coast did a great job when they created the SRD/Basic Rules, leaving exactly
      enough content out of the free version to make the free version feel fine to
      play, but also making the paid content vastly superior by comparison.


      Adding the Core Book DLCs to your collection grants you the ability to utilize
      the corebook material in place of the free content, which is usually superior
      with more listed options.


      After loading the module, you can access the content of the DLC by clicking
      the Library Button in the lower right corner and scrolling down until you see
      "Core Rules" where you can then click the title of the DLC Core Book in question
      and then a reference table appears.


      From here you can access and drag-and-drop any content from the book into your
      campaign and at the bottom of the reference list, there will be a "reference
      manual", which is actually a fantasy-grounds version of the book itself, that
      you can read page for page (though it isn''t nearly as easy to read as a physical
      book, or even a PDF).


      This still makes for an incredibly user-friendly and hassle-free supplement
      that any fantasy grounds DM can take full advantage of, but it isn''t a particularly
      good replacement for the "real thing". If it comes down to buying the physical
      book or this DLC, I would say buy the book - the free content will carry you
      far enough - that said, having both is great.'
