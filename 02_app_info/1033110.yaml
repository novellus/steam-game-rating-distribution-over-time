    review: "Warning- Don\u2019t read this if you can\u2019t handle sensitive topics\
      \ such as suicide and death. The review is based on current gameplay (It will\
      \ be updated later).\n\nA young teenager named Kazuya Nanami lies on a snowy\
      \ ground, reminiscing about his dull life and his closest friends while he tries\
      \ to escape the forest. The boy\u2019s leg is in perfect condition, but how\
      \ is that possible? Kazuya knows the place is fictional because he\u2019s supposed\
      \ to be somewhere else. AT HOME. A trail of footprints leads him to a lake where\
      \ he sees a beautiful girl singing with a single cloth. The unnamed person recognizes\
      \ Kazuya, kisses him, and disappears. Is she human?\n\nKazuya\u2019s world Episode\
      \ 1- Waking up in his bed, Kazuya can\u2019t remember whether it was a dream.\
      \ He checks his computer and discovers people are committing suicide in his\
      \ town. What\u2019s causing them to die? You are introduced to Kazuya\u2019\
      s friends: Playboy Rei and Childish Miu. Childhood crush Ibuki hasn\u2019t been\
      \ in school due to medical reasons. There isn\u2019t much information about\
      \ those deaths either. In this episode, you\u2019ll learn what happened to Kazuya\u2019\
      s leg and how he has changed since the incident. Some comedic scenes were uninteresting\
      \ because it dragged. There are several scenes without any sound. It seems to\
      \ be intentional according to the developer. \n\nI completed the first episode.\
      \ In my opinion, I thought this wasn\u2019t a good start. The visual novel has\
      \ a great prologue, but it tends to fall flat with unnecessary boring scenes.\
      \ I kept reading to give it a chance. I still want to know who the mystery girl\
      \ is. Features include Japanese voice acting, decent artwork, and background\
      \ music. You can\u2019t make choices. Would I recommend it? No. My review might\
      \ change once I finish it.\n\nEdit Review: After reading a bit further into\
      \ the visual novel, I decided to keep the negative review. There are different\
      \ perspectives of the characters' stories. You will encounter references from\
      \ famous works, but it's rather awkward. I felt like it wasn't needed, and I\
      \ was losing interest. You don't want to bore your audience with dull scenes.\
      \ I can\u2019t give it a positive rating. Definitely not recommended."
