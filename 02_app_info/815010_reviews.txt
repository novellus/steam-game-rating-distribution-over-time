Elements pop, float, and drift with natural animations.\n    [*]Gameplay is straightforward and self-explanatory. Like Scrabble or Boggle, it maintains its longevity through simplicity. Longer words score higher. Varied words prevent hitting the \"same letter limit.\"\n[/list]\n\n[b] Cons [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Dictionary is inconsistent. Sometimes word forms like past-participles, adverbs, and gerunds are allowed. Other times they are not. It all depends on whether the specific word is arbitrarily in the accepted word list or not. This becomes a problem when you're at risk of a letter-limit game-over or fail a \"minimum word length\" challenge because you can't add a -ing, -ous, or -tten suffix.\n    [*]Mouse-based controls are unwieldy. Letters will too-readily stick to your working word, which can be particularly annoying when you want to simply want to drag a 12-letter word to the scoring box but a stray letter attaches itself at the last minute, requiring you to drag the word back to the \"break letter\" box, then once again back to the scoring box hoping that another letter does stick and make you repeat the process ad inifinitum. Playing via keyboard avoids this issue, but as of writing the only way to queue up multiple separate words on the playing field is through the mouse.\n[/list]\n\n[b] Verdict [/b]\nRecommended for word game enthusiasts, but with the caveat that this is not a perfect game.
