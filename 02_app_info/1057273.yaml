    review: 'This is useless for killing bugs, but ups the fun of playing with friends
      by a large factor.


      Nothing like screwing around honking at people and drifting up the sides of
      cliffs while everyone else is trying to bring down the anchors with rocket launchers.


      Recommend souly for the goof off potential.'
