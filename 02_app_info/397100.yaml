    short_description: The main purpose of this game is showing and watching machines
      made out of blocks. Some of the game-modes allow you to battle or race against
      other players. (testing phase) You can create your original machine with ease
      by reassembling those machines that are distributed, or by using the automatic
      control block.

    review: 'This game is about building,Sharing in workshop And more...


      If you''re a good builder,you can share your creation

      If not,Then download one if you want


      Pros: Can build anything you want

      Anime Contraptions


      Cons: May Lag on weak PC''s(Doesnt lag that much on my laptop)


      I recommend this game for everyone,it''s very good.
