When your stone moves onto a temple square, it scores a point, and if it survives enemy turn, it scores another point. The same applies to your enemies. Aside from placing or moving your stones, you can also play cards by finding certain patterns made of your stones. After you play a few games powerups will also start appearing, which let you do certain actions when moving on them. This game, like other games by this dev, has rank system, and as you win more games, your games will get harder but you'll also unlock new features, cards and enemies. Personally I have found the progression a bit slow but you can level up your rank manually if you don't want to wait. I also found it a bit weird that this tactical turn-based game had timers but there's a mode that disables them so it's fine. Overall I have enjoyed the gameplay and would recommend this game if the description sounds appealing to you. It's also worth mentioning that this game is inspired by Tash-kalar, a board game which laso requires you to make patterns from your units, so if you enjoyed this game you will enjoy Tash-kalar too (you can play it for free online)","timestamp_created":1608467894,"timestamp_updated":1608467894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw74mKwPYCdZ7ZuwI="}
