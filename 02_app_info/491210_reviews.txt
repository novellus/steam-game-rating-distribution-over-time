But it immediately felt too grindy.  The controls are meant to confuse and irritate because they are cumbersome.  In some ways it's supposed to be fun because it challenges the left hand verses the right hand and multitasking, but at the end of the day- I wouldn't recogmend it to my friends because it felt too grindy.  I can see what the game was trying to do though.","timestamp_created":1536890610,"timestamp_updated":1536890610,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.466101676225662231","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlbT06uUCdKvMqgE="}
