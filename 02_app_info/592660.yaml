    about_the_game: <strong>Zen Garden</strong> is a calming puzzle game, built around
      an ancient Japanese tradition.<br><br>Each mechanic is simple, but don't let
      that fool you, it is their combination, which lies in the heart of every challenging
      level.<br><br>The game does not encourage brute force, you can't just wing your
      way through every obstacle on your way to success. Sometimes you have to stop
      and really think what you are about to do. Because just like in real life, after
      you place your rake on the sand, there is no undo, you can only start over.<br><br>It
      goes without saying, that in order to get immersed in this gorgeous scenery,
      you need suitable soundtrack. That is why graphics and handcrafted levels go
      hand-in-hand with music composed specifically to set your mind at ease.<br><br><strong>Have
      a good time</strong> and <strong>Thank You</strong> for your support.
