The other islands were enjoyably relaxing but he ruined it with his constant reminders of the obvious things I was supposed to do while I was already doing them.\nI know the devs targeted kids with this game but kids aren't that stupid and the free islands worked fine without this.\n\nLast nitpick that matters to nobody but me: I get those cartoons aren't meant to be seen as realistic depictions but couldn't you at least give the raptors their feathers and not have the hands pronated?","timestamp_created":1593458186,"timestamp_updated":1607427252,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497310906648635864","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8quIofYCfoq2kQI="}
