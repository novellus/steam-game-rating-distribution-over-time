Most of the free VNs I've tried are just too sketchy. This game is very light and sweet. I also appreciate the writer's sense of humor. The story is linear; you select one of three endings early on then follow it to the end. I found the characters likeable, the art was good, and there was a sufficient amount of music for the length of the game.\n\nOh! Don't miss out on the extra content that unlocks after you get an ending. There are extended endings and more fun scenes.","timestamp_created":1488131730,"timestamp_updated":1488131730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpYXkvdoCeJKbcw=="}
