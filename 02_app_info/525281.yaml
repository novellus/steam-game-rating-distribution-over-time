    review: "Great expansion for Medieval packages from PVGames.  It is suitable for\
      \ expanding weapons and other equipment to enrich the character in the game.\
      \ \n\nBefore you evaluate negative packs from this creator, it is important\
      \ to note that DLCs from PVGames are not intended for RTP style stuff or Celiana\xB4\
      s DLC. It's because of a realistic concept from this author (as well as his\
      \ work for the previous generation of the program - RPG Maker VX ACE). \n\n\
      Full use of all DLCs from PVGames requires patience and a little need to set\
      \ up third-party plug-ins. Yes, this is not a plug and play extension. For advanced\
      \ use of the material, it is necessary to use graphic software.  [url=https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/plug-in-and-tools-list-useful-for-pvgames-resources.63602]\
      \ Here is a link to the list of add-ons recommended by author himself.[/url]"
