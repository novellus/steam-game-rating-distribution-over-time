    review: 'It was hard to decide whether or not to recommend since I consider this
      DLC to be the worst by far for Neverwinter Nights. The reviews are mostly negatives
      at the time of writing this one, but I decided to buy anyways since I played
      all the content available on Steam already and I loved all of it.


      I decided to recommend because it offers something different from the other
      240h of Neverwinter Nights I played prior to playing this one. It is more like
      a point and click game and you have to talk to the right people at the right
      time to advance the story. Time is of the essence is this DLC and a maximum
      number of actions can be done in a single day. It was a little wind of change
      for me, and proves that Neverwinter Nights can still see many stories added
      to it in the future and still be a relevant game for me. I will always buy these
      DLCs as they come out.


      This being said, the quality of the result is poor and feels like a demo. First
      of all, the story feels extremely convoluted for a 5-10 hours expansion, but
      that, I can excuse. What is more concerning is that a player might get completely
      stuck at some places. Once you enter a zone, you cannot go back, and if you
      are not "as ready as you think" for an encounter, you really might get stuck
      for real, so saving often is a must (unless you do not care about respawning
      several times). The combat felt extremely unbalanced, ranging from too easy
      to too hard. A lot of stuff does not make sense : for example some people will
      sell expensive items that you will never be able to buy. It really does feel
      like an unpolished beginning of a bigger adventure.


      Dark Dreams of Furiae is irritating more often that not. For examples, rats
      keep attacking every time I would take a certain exit on the map, it feels impossible
      to get more gold once you spent the one you have when beginning the adventure,
      some regions "unlock" without you knowing or the game telling you, the effect
      of a few actions had unwanted and unexpected effects on my alignment (I played
      a Lawful Good character and the options seemed to always be either Chaotic Good
      or Lawful Evil), etc.


      So I do recommend, but only for people having played everything else and still
      being hungry for more content and wanting a change of pace in the gameplay.


      I still wish to see more of Neverwinter Nights !'
