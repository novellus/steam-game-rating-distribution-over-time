There is no way to change color scheme, description and screenshots are unhelpful, the first achievement pops before the first encounter with the problem. Still passable thanks to a sliiight contrast, but frustrating.\nAside from that, a decent, even if too short, 'laser' puzzle.","timestamp_created":1609171423,"timestamp_updated":1609189778,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpezL1fYCfKmSvgI="}
