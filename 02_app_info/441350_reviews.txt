The bosses feel clumsy and the mech suit has no weight or feel to it.\nReally disappointed I went in hearing this was like cybernator (assault suits valken). While some of the mechanics are there it definitely is not it. \n\nApparently its a remake of Assault Suit Leynos for the Sega Genesis? I kind of wish they would have modernized the mechanics.\n\nCame back to try and beat this game. Got to the final boss. Accidentally looked away to see how the hell people beat the bullet hell last stage. \n\nIt failed the continue had to start the WHOLE THING over again.\nAccidentally restarted from stage 1 it deleted all my save data. I cannot push myself through this game again good god its frustrating.\n\nI wish they would have just redone Cybernator instead. There are NUMEROUS camera bugs in the game too where it will cutscene to an enemy then instead of going back to you stay focused on the enemy which means you have to die to restart that section again too.","timestamp_created":1608680311,"timestamp_updated":1608845277,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49Napy/YCcLmmvAI="}
