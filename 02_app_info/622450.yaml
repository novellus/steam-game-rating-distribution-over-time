      \ /><br>The reserve wardens Conni and Doc have received a new shipment of equipment\
      \ and thanks to Robert Sommer\u2019s connections, they were able to get their\
      \ hands on a tent and a ground blind. These new items will make your hunting\
      \ experience in both Hirschfelden and Layton Lake District even more complete.<h2\

      \ /><br><br><strong>ELITE 2 TENT</strong><br><br>Setting up tents will create\
      \ fast travel points almost anywhere you wish (although remember that in-game\
      \ camping fees apply) which makes it great for exploring new areas and traveling\
      \ to parts of the map that are particularly dense in the animal species you\
      \ would like to hunt. <br><br>The ELITE 2 TENT is a two-man tent suitable for\
      \ all weather conditions. The patented high-tech Mosquito Wall 2.0, tested under\
      \ severe conditions in northern Scandinavia, is proven to decrease user blood\
      \ loss by almost 5% compared to its previous generation. That\u2019s a lot of\
      \ blood! This award-winning product also includes a large storage container\
      \ that'll turn your mobile home into a fully functional outpost.<br><br>The\
      \ tent makes it possible to access the store and purchase new gear for your\
      \ inventory as well as rest up after a hard day of stalking and tracking. Just\
      \ remember that placing, as well as fast traveling, to a tent creates noise\
      \ which means you might spook some of the nearby animals.<br><br>Additional\
      \ Characteristics: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>A maximum of 8 tents can be placed\
      \ in each reserve at the same time.<br></li><li>You can dismantle and move a\

      \ blind offers the ultimate portable camouflage but it also functions as weather\
      \ protection. Once deployed, it provides excellent visibility concealment and\

    review: 'Gives you tents that act as ''mobile spawn points''. I don''t really
      feel they''re ''mandatory'' as some like to claim since most maps have outposts
      scattered all over and it''s not far of a walk to any good hunting area from
      those.


      This should be part of the base game, if you really want to use these - I would
      recommend it on a very steep sale.
