If you enjoyed Pinkman then this will scratch the same itch. In fact most of the hazards will be very familiar if you played Pinkman. This could be Pinkman 2 if it wasn't for the new cute graphic style and the air dash replacing the double jump fart. I played this and Pinkman back to back. Both are very good games and well worth your time if you enjoy platformer games.","timestamp_created":1609629079,"timestamp_updated":1609629079,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43dLX4vYCecbxvwI="}
