    review: Gorescript is such an amazing game.  I wouldn't compare to doom as much
      as I would compare it to quake.  Fast and intense gameplay with fun enemies
      and fun arenas.  It is 100% worth your money.  It also comes with a level editor
      which took a couple hours to understand but it is very fun to use.  The soundtrack
      and sounds are great.  One of my top games.  Buy it.  If you don't have the
      money or still don't want it then get the demo and see for yourself how fun
      the game is.
