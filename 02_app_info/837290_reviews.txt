I was really excited to play it because the concept is really cool. I dont feel that it is a BAD game, but whether or not it was worth the price is debatable. In the game you are just searching for items that will aid you in escaping from a monster(s) that walks one pathway, and are not aggressive whatsoever. Depending on how fast you find the items will determine how fast you beat the game.\n\nMy playthrough: https://youtu.be/PvlQrTA95EE","timestamp_created":1525457269,"timestamp_updated":1525457269,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.626888453960418701","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kNaVluMCf7XTnwE="}
