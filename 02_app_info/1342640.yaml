    review: "I've gotten this game while its on sale, and for the price, its definitely\
      \ worth it! \n\nThis is a point & click game, where you use your mouse only\
      \ to interact, \nYou get to choose to attack or defence or use your special\
      \ (requires attacking 2 times successfully) per turn; as you play more, you\
      \ will have a strategy on what to use\n\nI like the pixel graphics & the story\
      \ plot of saving earth from some cow grunts/commander :P\nI've also like the\
      \ sound effects, really sets the mood!\n\nAt the time of writing i've only played\
      \ the story mode and have completed it, so I would say it takes 1.5 Hours to\
      \ complete the story mode\n\nLast but not least, I also like that if you get\
      \ defeated in the story mode, you get to re-try again at that point again, you\
      \ do not have to restart over; there are also surprise elements where you think\
      \ you've lost but its actually part of the plot!\n\nI will try out the arcade\
      \ mode later on to try to unlock the remaining achievements!\n\nOverall Summary:\n\
      - Love the Pixel graphics\n- Cool Background Song\n- Touching Storyline\n- Affordable\
      \ pricing!\n\nWould i recommend this game? : Yes - if you like point & click\
      \ games, this game is for you!"
