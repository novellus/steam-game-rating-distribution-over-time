    review: "W. O. W. \nI set my expectations pretty low for this game  (I am happy\
      \ to say this game blew my expectations out of the water). The reviews looked\
      \ fun, but the game seemed bland and basic. I bought the game to have on while\
      \ I am in a zoom class or something of the sorts, yet it took me by surprise\
      \ when I first played. The games UI is simple and easy to learn, the games tutorial\
      \ is really engaging, and the themes of the game are great. The tactics are\
      \ not as simple as they seem, be prepared to adapt to different enemy types.\
      \ I also really like the High, Medium, Low, Surface, and Undersea zones of engagement.\n\
      Seeing Tomcats whiz by some B-52s as they approach Russian vessels is a sight\
      \ to see! I rarely comment on games that I play, and the ones I do are usually\
      \ negative. However I felt compelled to encourage people to support this game\
      \ in its current state. I am VERY eager to see the growth of this game, and\
      \ I do hope that the devs keep it alive."
