    review: "For me this game is just very enjoyable. I love the simplistic ASCII-art\
      \ graphics combined with the strange universe, music and characters. \n\nI recommend\
      \ this game to everybody who likes point'n'click adventures and also something\
      \ different from the mainstream.\n\nAlso big plus for the developer who helped\
      \ me when I was stuck without giving me the solution but instead gave me enough\
      \ hints so I could feel the satisfaction of finally being able to solve the\
      \ next part of the journey myself!"
