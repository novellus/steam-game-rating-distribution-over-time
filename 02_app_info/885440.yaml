    review: 'I can only say: buy this ! It is already a great way to make music videos
      with very nice vizualizations. Hopefully the creators will keep supporting this
      and add more features. The dancers option is nice, maybe some more variations
      there. During the day I searched the internet for a tool like this. There are
      some available, but much more expensive and actually what I tested in those
      apps, was not of the same quality as Easy Audio Vizualization, and options were
      less then we get already now in Easy Audio Vizualisation. If you need nice looking
      music videos, I recommend you buy this product. Your YouTube music videos will
      look much better and probably get more attention. Same goes for Blog posts and
      so on.'
