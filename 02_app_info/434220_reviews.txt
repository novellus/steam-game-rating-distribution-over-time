I definitely felt like a fnaf clone though. Sometimes the game seems impossible due to where the bears will spawn but once you kind of figure out their trick it becomes a lot easier. The jump scares only really scare you if you are absolutely non expecting them otherwise they just get annoying ove time. I'd still recommend the game if you like strategy games though. For those iffy on the game feel free to check out the playthrough for nights 1 and 2 that I made","timestamp_created":1609051093,"timestamp_updated":1609051093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gOe60fYCfuTTvQI="}
