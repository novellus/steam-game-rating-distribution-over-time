It takes a lot of inspiration from wolf3D but is very basic and with really good strafing. The only really challenging level is the boss fight at the end. But even then, it only took me (someone who is kinda bad at games) three times to beat. There are 15 levels but they all look exactly the same. The best thing about this game is the sadly short gameplay.","timestamp_created":1609825129,"timestamp_updated":1609825129,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4osLD6PYCcaPOwAI="}
