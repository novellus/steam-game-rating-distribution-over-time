If you look past the lack of options, a pause button, and other conveniences often given to other FMV ported games, you'll find that the actual game itself is a very memorable experience.\n\nWhile it shows on here that I don't have much playtime, I actually played the original cabinet at Galloping Ghost Arcade (GGA) many times. I genuinely think it's a one of a kind experience, and I'm very grateful for all the work people put into resurrecting this game and giving it new life.\n\nMost of my bitterness regarding this port comes from just an overall lack of effort. After playing the cabinet at GGA, it's abundantly clear that the devs put as little effort as possible to simply get this on the store. There are no options to change volume levels, resolution, or include subtitles. Furthermore, there is NO pause button whatsoever in the game. If something comes up and you gotta pause, your run is as good as dead.\n\nGGA had a great opportunity here to take the original material and really spruce it up with some quality of life features, but rather, the port just seems like a cash grab used to exploit the previous arcade exclusive nature of the game. Given the nature of choose your own adventure-esque games like this, it SORELY needed a restart feature or some form of save states. You have to go through the drawn out ending sequence every time,  making it take upwards of a minute simply to just restart the game.\n\nAll these complaints aside, credit REALLY needs to be given to Brian Colin for creating this one of a kind experience. The whole thing reeks of B-movie vibes, and it's certainly a good thing. The writing and loads of possibilities will keep you coming back for more, and each encounter you make in the mansion REALLY stands out from each other.\n\nIf you get past the lazy port efforts made by GGA, I'm sure you'll find this to be quite the gem of a game.","timestamp_created":1609649719,"timestamp_updated":1609649719,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47bCm4/YCcKH7vwI="}
