Same irritating song keeps playing over and over, some puzzles don't work or have bugs. Got tired of it quickly, hers an example of how buggy this is... If you don't want to figure out a puzzle just reach through the wall holding the gold block your supposed to unlock and grab it instead. Puzzle defeated.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, if the developer gets the bugs fixed and improves the game it does have potential.","timestamp_created":1532929080,"timestamp_updated":1532929080,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539655148983001709","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwrK/s9OQCcsmYpwE="}
