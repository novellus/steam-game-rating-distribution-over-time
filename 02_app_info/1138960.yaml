    review: 'Biomass is an excellent Souls-like metroidvania that feels like a side-scrolling
      companion piece to Hyper Light Drifter. Like HLD, it uses atmospheric synth
      music to great effect, has a vague story you must piece together, and arms the
      player with a variety of lightsabers and guns.  Set in a post-apocalyptic flooded
      metropolis, the game alternates between above-ground areas where you fight members
      of three warring factions, and underground tunnels infested with alien monstrosities.  The
      game presents you with different choices to make and optional areas to explore
      that will impact later events.


      Gameplay can feel a bit slow and plodding at first, due to the movement of the
      player character (think slightly faster than NES-era Castlevania). If there''s
      anything I would ask to be patched it would be a way to quickly climb up and
      slide down ladders because there''s a ton of them and you''ll spend a good deal
      of time wandering around to explore every inch of the game world. Thankfully,
      combat is more lively with clashing and parrying attacks, and a dodge roll.  Once
      I had leveled up a bit and was able to explore more of the world, the game really
      sucked me in to its lore and mysteries. I''m so thankful I kept at it, because
      Biomass is a truly rewarding experience.


      This is a game that rewards exploration and experimentation.  Poke around, try
      new routes, make different choices, experiment with the combat and different
      weapons.  Pay VERY close attention to all NPC dialogue in order to learn what
      you need to do and what is going on in the game world.  Sometimes, you''ll need
      to do a little experience grinding to make things easier, but this becomes less
      and less necessary as you progress and "git gud" with the combat mechanics.
      Even after completing the game, I''m still going back and discovering new things
      that I missed and it''s such a great payoff.


      As this game is fairly new, there are a few bugs here and there, but nothing
      that was game-breaking in my experience. Funniest thing that happened was I
      got stuck in the crawling animation on a ladder, but due to the auto-save feature,
      I just restarted the game and it plopped me back at the beginning of the room.  The
      developer has released several patches, including one that adds a dedicated
      healing item, and has been welcoming of feedback to fix issues.


      Overall, I had a great time with Biomass and would highly recommend this game
      to all metroidvania and Souls fans.'
