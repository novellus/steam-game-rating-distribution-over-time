With simple yet addicting gameplay and genius level design that has the player get really invested in each level, this game has it all. The story is rich and complex, but not told directly to the player, which I can appreciate. You have to put in the effort to get fully invested in the complex lore. The game is a graphical achievement. The main menu immediately sets a standard for the entire game unmatched in the industry today. Environments are gushing with detail, you'll find yourself getting lost in levels, distracted by the beauty in front of you. Enemy designs are a perfect portrayal of vaguely human yet grotesque and unnerving. The game has great physical feedback as well, every time you fire your keyboard rumbles, which really boosts the immersion to another level unmatched by its competitors. Another factor contributing to this immersion is the sound design. The ambiance as you walk through each level is perfect for the bleak hallways of the game. One thing I wish was better was the characterization and pacing. Plot points happen in quick succession, with long breaks in between, it came off as very uneven. The character arks also feel unfinished, the ending is a little disappointing. All in all, this game is a must buy for any gamer.","timestamp_created":1609820520,"timestamp_updated":1609820520,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5Pex6PYCetHMwAI="}
