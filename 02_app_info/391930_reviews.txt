But I CAN say, for such a moody-lookin' game, this sure-as-sh*t ain't a moody f*ckin' soundtrack.\n\n   Look, it's fine. It's sufficiently melodic, very well produced, and offers a whole lotta tracks for not a lotta cash. I guess that, er, \"chilled urban grooves\" (taking a punt here) just ain't my cup of tea. I bought this soundtrack in the hopes that it would at least be at the cuter end of spooky, but it's nothing of the sort. \n\n   I'll give it a thumb-up, but only barely, and would only seriously recommend it to anyone whose musical tastes never swerve from the dead-set middle of the road.\n\n   Verdict: 5.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1523718816,"timestamp_updated":1523803305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.595622777938842773","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wqbw5OICdLufngE="}
