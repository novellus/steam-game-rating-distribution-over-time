      \ game&quot;, you might also note that the level looks super easy or just the\
      \ opposite, impossible... But as you make the first move, &quot;What???&quot;\
      \ - the whole labyrinth rebuilds, you have to look for a new way through. After\
      \ each move you can surprisingly find yourself in a dead end and have to go\
      \ back, or in an open room able to move anywhere, but you never know how it\
      \ will rebuild next time, so just make your guess... <br />\r\nThe goal is to\
      \ collect blue cubes within minimum moves possible, but also don't ignore the\
      \ bonuses - they may be very useful. Sometimes it seems that the game is just\
      \ screwing with you - but it can't, walls move in an absolutely random way (excluding\
      \ only the possibility to lock player in one cell). However that doesn't mean\
      \ there is absolutely no strategy, you'll figure it out while playing."

    short_description: Imagine a labyrinth where walls move every time the player
      moves making it impossible to calculate your way to the goal in advance so you'll
      have to improvise.
