Definitely for people who like a good long read! Excellent artwork and music. It's a great piece of software, that, sure, has a few wrinkles, but give how long it is, and how little it costs to buy, still translates in to a real bargain. Oh, and it's written and presented in the first person so you get a real sense that you are the protagonist. The title, incidentally, School of Talents, refers to the fact that ( most of ) the students have special abilities, the concept of which I am sure you are well used to if, like me, you watch loads and loads of anime! Having said that, the story is not one that insists that the reader is a real fan of anime to appreciate. Some anime defintely needs the uninitiated to be lowered in gently (!!). So all in all if you like a good long read, with a great story, and love anime art style, then this is definitely a novel you will enjoy. And lets be honest, even if you don't, you haven't exactly spent a lot of money buying it, but you really have helped some talented people with their startup venture.","timestamp_created":1608705038,"timestamp_updated":1608705038,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw69qSx/YCcsuvvAI="}
