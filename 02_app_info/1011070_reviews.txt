The turned-based combat is reminiscent of Battle Brothers, but the small party size and complexity of the fights require a well thought out plan. Admittedly, the trading can get a bit monotonous over time, but it took me a solid 12-14 hours of play before I started to pull back the reigns on my playtime.\n\nI highly recommend this game as something that is both unique and entertaining.","timestamp_created":1593919433,"timestamp_updated":1593919433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ko3AjvMCdJjzkgI="}
