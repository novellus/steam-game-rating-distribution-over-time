    review: It's hard to decide on this one. I wish there was a neutral option. Some
      of the feats this adds are pretty interesting and useful/balanced, but others
      are very imbalanced or need some tweaking. If you want to give your players
      more options this is one to consider, but at least of few of the feats you'll
      probably want to make off-limits by DM Fiat.
