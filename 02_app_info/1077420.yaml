      /><br><br>Ambidangerous is a game about ambidexterity (using both left and right
      hands), so enemies and weapons are designed with two-handed play in mind. However,
      you can opt to play in <strong>Amputee Mode</strong>, which lets you progress
      through the game with just one hand. Perfect if you''re missing a hand, sipping
      a beer, or holding a baby.<br><br>IMPORTANT: This game uses a special control

    review: "If you are looking for a challenge you will enjoy this game.\n\nAs you\
      \ maneuver through this 2D world, it feels like a puzzle trying to figure out\
      \ the best methods to use two character simultaneously during certain bosses\
      \ and with certain weapons. It is completely unique in that way and unlike most\
      \ games I have played before. \n\nPositives: \n- The Bosses are difficult to\
      \ beat and all require a unique offensive approach to defeat them.\n- Weapon\
      \ selection; there are a lot of weapons to pick up that are fun to play with,\
      \ that work well against certain enemies, and that match your specific play\
      \ style.\n- Levels; A variety of different environments processed with rng.\n\
      - Gameplay; unique as stated above and fun to figure out (though it isn't for\
      \ the feint of hear).\n- Enemies; you can see a trend here, a lot of variety.\
      \ Many enemies to kill in various ways.\n- Graphics; depending on what you like,\
      \ but the 2D top down style is well thought out and works nicely with the dual\
      \ character mechanics\n\nNegatives:\n-Although I think the game is worth what\
      \ it costs, it is a short game depending on your abilities. It took me an hour,\
      \ but I played it for a few minutes during the development stage and have thousands\
      \ of hours logged in video games across the board.\n- The final boss battle,\
      \ although difficult, is fairly short once you figure out the level.\n\nAll\
      \ in all it is a wonderfully unique game with fun mechanics you should try if\
      \ you are looking to challenge yourself."
