    about_the_game: 'Mythlink is an upcoming VR-only monster battling game. Players
      can level up and battle with their Mythlink in hopes to create the best Mythlink
      Unity ever!<h2 class="bb_tag">Mythlinks</h2>So just what is a Mythlink? A Mythlink
      is a type of monster that players will select when the game begins. These monsters
      are based on various mythological creatures (such as a dragon, Cerberus, etc.)
      Once players have selected a Mythlink, a special bond begins to form between
      the player and their new friend. This link between player and Mythlink is called
      a &quot;Mythlink Unity&quot;, and is so powerful that as one of you improves,
      so does the other. Because of this, players themselves will take part in various
      strength, dexterity, and brain training exercises to improve both themselves
      and their Mythlink.<h2 class="bb_tag">Leveling Up</h2> <u>Available now in the
      demo.</u><br>Mythlinks have 3 stats which can be improved through playing the
      game. These stats are strength, brain, and speed. Picking the best way to improve
      your Mythlink stats is key to victory! <br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Strength: Helps
      your Mythlink deal more damage. Strength training includes games which involve
      punching and using force. <br></li><li>Speed: Helps your Mythlink move and react
      quicker. Speed training includes games which involve moving quickly.<br></li><li>Brain:
      Helps your Mythlink learn more advanced moves. Brain training includes a block-clearing
      game.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Battling</h2><u>Available now in the demo.</u><br>Once
      a Mythlink Unity is confident in their skills, they can enter the arena and
      battle against other Mythlink Unities! Both players will be placed high above
      the arena at opposite ends where they can see the entire area at once. From
      this high vantage point, they will control their Mythlink and utilize abilities
      in order to knock out the opposing Mythlink. These 1 on 1 battles will showcase
      the fruits of all efforts put into training. Last Mythlink standing wins! <br><br><br><i>*Game
      is currently under development. Any number of things may change before the complete
      release! To follow the development of Mythlink, please read the monthly blog
      available on the official Steam/website/Facebook pages.</i>'
