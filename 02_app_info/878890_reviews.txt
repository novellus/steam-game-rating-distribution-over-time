The difference between the standard and the deluxe is device info sharing, which should just be a standard feature.... Most applications now a days have device sharing for no extra cost vs this which is nearly double the cost without even a mobile app version... If you want an inflexible organizer with an interface from the early 2000's with no device sharing this is your software, otherwise stay away and use your calendar and notepad that comes free with windows/mac/linux.....","timestamp_created":1562123554,"timestamp_updated":1562123554,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56081080436706543","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzbn02usCfJ2hywE="}
