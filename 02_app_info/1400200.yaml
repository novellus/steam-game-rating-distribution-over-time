    review: It is a good game, but I recently replayed Dire Grove and Fate's Carnival
      and in no way is it in their league. If you like the signature Big Fish mcf
      mega puzzles that open on to a huge strange contraption with few clues that
      you have to click and hover your way to figuring wtf?!? you will be disappointed
      in this offering. Lots of finding pieces that you have to remember what it goes
      to and the story is engaging but its no Madame Fate.
