      \ a low paying job after he dropped out of college. He survives by eating only\
      \ cheap food in a tiny apartment. When a ship that he's on to visit his parents\
      \ sinks, he's unable to get to the lifeboats in time. Just before he runs out\
      \ of air, he sees a light and finds himself in a strange world ruled by monster\
      \ girls. In this world he encounters three of them, one after the other. Each\
      \ of them want him to be their husband because there are only females of their\
      \ species, so monster girls only have humans to choose from if they desire children.\
      \ Due to how their world works, there is a very short time limit on Morgan's\
      \ choice. The three girls decide to have one day with him each and one shared\
      \ day with all of them. Afterwards, he will decide who he likes best.<h2 class=\"\
