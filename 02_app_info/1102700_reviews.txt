The starter gun is as balanced as it should be.\n\nI like the shader effects I encountered in level four with the bouncing enemies (really impressive to do that, I have 0 understanding about shaders).\nIf you like rogelikes and the 2-bit style he went for, this is the game for you. Mechanic-wise is it a mix between TBoI and EtG.\n\n[i]Can I just ask for maybe a controls-editor or WASD-to-ZQSD function? I have an Azerty keyboard and in my games I tend to put keyboard-type-toggles in. Alt-Shift isn't hard to do but it gets annoying while eg. trying to chat with a friend while playing.[/i]\n\nEdit: grammar","timestamp_created":1578958590,"timestamp_updated":1578959017,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wtLS0O8CeY/o6wE="}
