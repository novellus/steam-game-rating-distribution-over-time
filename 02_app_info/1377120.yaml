      /><br><br>Gameplay is follows: you drag &amp; drop any <strong>mp3/wav</strong>
      music track into game''s window and it breaks up into short puzzle pieces and
      gets shuffled. Now you have to put it back together using nothing but <strong>sound</strong>,
      colors are purely decorative. You can listen to any pieces as many times as
      you want, take your time there is no pressure :)<br><br>If you made mistake
      game will tell you how many, but wont show you the place :)<br>Post game you
      have some stats: time taken, all time best, number of times you listened to
      a piece.<br><br>There are <strong>7 tracks</strong> included with the game,
      kindly provided by various artists, this will let you checkout the game. But
      main focus is that you will bring your own music library. After all this is
      <strong>Your Music</strong> Puzzle.<br><br>Your game experience is highly dependent
      on music you choose. If its some hardcore <strong>Dubstep</strong>, then you
      will be in for 10-15 minutes of brain melting frenzy putting together a drop
      from barely differentiable pieces. If its <strong>calm, vocal</strong> focused
      song, then you are about to dive in into 30 minutes of relaxation and meditation
      :)<br><br>I originally made this game for myself and so far been playing it
      for almost a full year. It gives me unique experience of seeing my favorite

    review: Cute little game, just don't expect literally anything more than the very
      base puzzle stitching mode. Slightly let down by temperamental controls that
      require you to sorta overlap pieces before they stick but does what it sets
      out to do, ultimately.
