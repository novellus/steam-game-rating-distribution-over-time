    review: '[h1]EDIT:[/h1]

      Newly updated and actually works, I still don''t like VS but now it''s a little
      less of a headache and works with the modern version. Good to see the guides
      getting updates along with AGK itself!





      [h1]ORIGINAL: [/h1]

      Honestly this guide is virtually useless, the AGK process of using tier 2 is
      not up to date and made in just a confusing way. This guide should be over how
      to install the libraries versus using an out of date example that doesn''t work.
      All of this is compounded by how horrid visual studio is as an IDE. All I''ve
      ever had is problems using tier 2 and tonight was the last straw. I cannot recomend
      this guide. For those of you who use Tier 2, I applaud you. I''ll be going back
      to GCC and codeblocks, the better C++ compiler. If only AGK would migrate.........'
