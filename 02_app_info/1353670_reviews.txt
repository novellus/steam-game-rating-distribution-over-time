BUT if you want me to get my friends to play this game. I would like to suggest. \n1. mini tutorial on the controls. OR  show the controls on the screen please.\n2. using shift e to throw the item is kind of awkward, maybe 'F' key?. \nOR \n3. Allow us players to customize our keys.\n4. Single player doesn't work. I see there is another character there but there is no indicator key to switch to that person, after seeing another review say the button to switch was Tab, was still difficult to play.\n5. For single player the blocks move a little too fast on the conveyor, running back and forth throwing. I lose more points than earning (possibly an easy, medium, hard levels in the future?).\n6. The layout design concept of the game is simple, easy to navigate through, which I appreciate so please keep that for the future. \n7. Possibility of having more than just 2 co-op players. Maybe 4? handling one color each or two colors each. who knows just some ideas\n8. having controller compatibility?\n\nOverall I still want to give this game a chance. The idea of the game and it's co-op mechanics is simple enough to recommend to many of my friends. Been looking for co-op games and this one really has potential , however still needs major improvements. For a single developer / indie game its really well made. Obviously the game still needs time to be worked on.\n\nI will change my review when I see the next major update. and as well give that update a fresh start for the game.","timestamp_created":1608860231,"timestamp_updated":1608860374,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv6Ljy/YCc8z2vAI="}
