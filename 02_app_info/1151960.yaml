    about_the_game: "Commanders of Valor is a strategy, role playing tabletop game.\
      \ Set in the last two centuries before the common era, players can take control\
      \ of a royal family of three factions and lead them to glory.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nRole playing experience: Each character in your family has their\
      \ own attributes and motives. Treat them fairly and they will become one of\
      \ your most capable and trusted commanders. Send them to seek education, pursue\
      \ their hobbies or become a famous sport\u2019s champion to help them achieve\
      \ greatness. Every decision that these commanders make dynamically shape their\
      \ future and the way they think of you and your leadership. But beware of unexpected\
      \ events that may change the course of their journey.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStrategic\
      \ battlefield: Take charge of your commanders and their armies to lead them\
      \ to glory on the battlefield. Utilizing the environment and strategic tactics\
      \ is just as important as training and bringing the right units onto the battlefield.\
      \ This turn-base experience will let you fight, loot, take prisoners and scare\
      \ your enemies off the battlefield. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFactions: Pick side\
      \ with one of the available factions, each with unique roster, play style and\
      \ gameplay mechanics.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnique rosters: Between Rome, Parthia\
      \ and Greek States there are more than 25 units, each with their custom design,\
      \ play style and historically accurate special abilities! Train them, pay them\
      \ and send them to hospital after battles for them to recover from their injuries.\
      \ The more victories you earn the more experienced your units become.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nMultiplayer: Competitive multiplayer battles is the most fun way\
      \ to grow your family and push your commanders\u2019 valor to their limits on\
      \ the battlefield.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSingle player: Each faction has a single\
      \ player campaign. Following the foot steps of a famous historic character will\
      \ let you see the world in their eyes and experience their heroics in the engaging\
      \ story of their lives."
