I was instantly met with a nice Kart racing community that got me into sppedrunning one of my most well cherished games. \n\nUnfortunatly the events that unfolded with in the last year with the Alpha, Beta, and the Release of this game coming out with in the span of less than a year, the postponning, and the constant silence from the developers its saddened me to see a full game at $25 NZD being sold with it full of bugs and glitches. After 2 - 3 years and that's it?!\nNot to say that there were no good things. The characters looked original, the mechanics felt right in my opinion, the tracks are great to play on with the senery looking amazing and the music is great to listen to.\nBut having 3 years of development with it still feeling like Beta and even Alpha states at times. It feeling more than dissapointing. And thats just the beginning. The tracks still felt glitchy and the A.I felt eaither to easy or gets glitched into the track itself... the activitys for single player felt...bland if not scarce at best.\n\nI want to keep supporting the developers but until the game is accepted by the Kart Racer community I can't buy this. I can only hope that in the coming months that actions will speak louder than words....","timestamp_created":1528497811,"timestamp_updated":1577661818,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.694853425025939941","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwyZz+qe8Cd/m6ogE="}
