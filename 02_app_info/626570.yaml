    short_description: Build tiny voxel worlds in virtual reality! Microcosm is the
      game I've wanted to play in VR ever since I saw the Oculus Rift Kickstarter
      way back in 2012. I picked up a Vive last year, but no one seemed to be making
      the voxel game I wanted. Finally, I said enough was enough, and just decided
      to build it myself.

    review: Microcosm is a vr voxel tool, and for early access it seems like a great
      start. It lacks a few key features, such as undo, but I'd expect the dev is
      aware and will want to put that in before the full release.
