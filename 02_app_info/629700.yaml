      campaign is set during the long and bloody battle at the Kuban bridgehead that
      lasted from the Spring until the middle of Autumn 1943, when the last troops
      of the occupying force retreated. The air forces of the Black Sea fleet played
      a major role in the fighting, striking airfields, seaports and surface targets
      and providing air cover for the troops of the North Caucasian front as well
      as supporting Soviet marine landings. This is the story of a former fighter
      pilot who has been transferred to the 47th Attack Aviation Regiment of the Black
      Sea Air Force after recovering from a serious wound. Incapable of flying a nimble
      fighter anymore and starting as a simple wingman once again, this time piloting
      an IL-2, he has a long road in front of him to eventually become the Deputy

    review: 'In this expansion, you get the Kuban region map in three seasons (Spring,
      Summer, and Autumn), as well as 8 standard aircraft (10 if you get premium).
      Said aircraft include:


      [i] Standard [/i]

      1. Bf/Me*-109-G4

      2. Fw-190-A5

      3. Bf/Me*-110-G2

      4. He-111-h16

      5. Yak-7

      6. P-39 (Lend-Lease)

      7. Il-2 Mod. 1943

      8. A-20b (Lend-Lease)


      [i] Premium [/i]

      Hs-129b

      Spitfire Mk.Vb (Lend-Lease)


      All of these aircraft are amazing in their own respects, and have their unique
      quirks and features that make them all the more special. I would recommend this
      expansion to anyone who is wanting to continue in this sim. It is a must have.


      (*I put down both Bf and Me titles because I was involved with a War of Words
      on Wings of Liberty server that regarded this very subject. It goes by both
      designations, guys.)'
