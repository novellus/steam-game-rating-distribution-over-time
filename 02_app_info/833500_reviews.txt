It's super addictive and works amazingly well with steam link and with lots of controllers.  You can play with up to 8... yes 8 of your friends at once in this game and the fun literally never stops.   Even after your car dies, you get to continue playing by throwing exploding barrels on the remaining players.  While the graphics may look simple, the game play is revolutionary and reminds me of when consoles used to cater to multiplayer and how much fun that was.  I play with my two younger sons and we max out the computer players and have a blast.  Btw, the computers are amazing players in themselves and you won't be disappointed if you are playing it by yourself.  Great game, so glad this exists. Keep up the great work Typical Entertainment... you're amazingly atypical :)","timestamp_created":1598581302,"timestamp_updated":1598581302,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwr9y3mfQCe72dngI="}
