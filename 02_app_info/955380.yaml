    review: "I\u2019m going to start this out by saying some nice things, mainly because\
      \ I don\u2019t want this review to be entirely negative, and there were some\
      \ things I liked about this. The concept is really interesting. The idea of\
      \ being \u201Cdeath\u2019s little helper\u201D is interesting, and the cloaks\
      \ are super fascinating and a cool mystery to try and unravel. Plus, the concept\
      \ of cutting dead/dying people\u2019s tongues out to collect their stories is\
      \ super fascinating and unique\n\n[b]So, now, the negatives [/b]\n\nThe story\
      \ can be oppressively depressing. I mean, I know the subject of collecting people\u2019\
      s tongues after they die is dark, but come on. Everyone hates each other and\
      \ constantly argues to the point where it stops even being interesting storywise,\
      \ and it felt like half of the time, even when leaning on my character\u2019\
      s strengths, I would never be able to succeed at anything. I\u2019d try calling\
      \ in some of the favors I\u2019d earned, only for nothing to come of it. Yet\
      \ I feel like I still had more success than the average player considering I\u2019\
      ve gotten achievements that 13% of people who played it had. If I had more success\
      \ than average, I can\u2019t imagine how obnoxiously hard it must feel for other\
      \ people to play this game\n\nThere were a lot of times where it felt like what\
      \ I would choose didn\u2019t matter, and I was destined to ruin things, which\
      \ is really not what I like to see from a game that\u2019s supposed to be based\
      \ around your choices. I felt like I was frequently being railroaded, and the\
      \ choices didn\u2019t do nearly what I expected them to do, so I never had any\
      \ idea what would happen based on my choices other than me failing in some way\
      \ or another. It made it difficult for me to keep playing the game-- when I\u2019\
      m trying to do something enjoyable, I definitely don\u2019t want to constantly\
      \ feel like everything I do is futile and that I\u2019m screwed no matter what\
      \ I do\n\nFor example, at one point [spoiler] my character was hit with a court\
      \ summons for apparently antagonizing Kara, the librarian, and causing problems\
      \ in the library. Which is weird because I never did that. Throughout the library\
      \ scene, I took Kara\u2019s side and did what I could to be polite, so I have\
      \ no idea why my character would have been put on her blacklist. I feel like\
      \ this is also related to an issue with the characters seeming to hate you no\
      \ matter what you do. Kara specifically felt like this, since throughout my\
      \ entire interactions with her in the early part of the story, we seemed to\
      \ be getting along well. Suddenly, she dislikes me enough to put me on her blacklist\
      \ for seemingly no reason, despite the fact that it still says the she \u201C\
      finds (me) amenable\u201D. [/spoiler] I wanted to like the characters, but stuff\
      \ like this made it really hard for me to connect to them since it felt like\
      \ no matter what, they wouldn\u2019t like me\n\nIt seemed like my character\
      \ stats hardly changed throughout the entire story. Maybe I was just picking\
      \ all the wrong options, but I feel like most of the time, a good portion of\
      \ your choices will affect your stats in some way or another with all the COG\
      \ and Hosted games. However, several of mine remained exactly the same from\
      \ the first chapter to the end of the story, which made it feel even more like\
      \ my choices didn\u2019t really matter. This feeling was only made even stronger\
      \ by the fact that there were a lot of long pages of text, some of which would\
      \ end without even giving you a choice of something to do. It felt more like\
      \ I was along for the ride than actually able to make a choice in things, and\
      \ while that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, for a game where the whole\
      \ point is you making choices, I felt like nothing I did really mattered\n\n\
      I also encountered tons of glitches that made it nearly impossible for me to\
      \ understand what was happening at times, sometimes things that I assume are\
      \ from the code would appear alongside the actual text, and characters I\u2019\
      ve never met before would be referred to as though I was supposed to know who\
      \ they were. I believe one other reviewer here mentioned that these could be\
      \ easily patched out, and while they probably could be, it\u2019s been 2 years\
      \ since the game came out and the bugs are still there, so. Not really a great\
      \ sign. At one point, [spoiler] I ran into a glitch where I was supposed to\
      \ be interviewing three tongues. One of them needed to basically be resuscitated,\
      \ and I managed to do that. Yay, based on the rarity of the achievement, that\u2019\
      s something kind of difficult to do. The excitement of having done something\
      \ difficult on my first try was marred by the fact that I ran into a glitch\
      \ where even after having gotten the thoughts from the resuscitated tongue,\
      \ I could select to hear from it again. Assuming that there was more from it,\
      \ I chose that option, and since the game was apparently only programmed so\
      \ you could make three choices in this segment, that means I completely missed\
      \ out on one of the stories [/spoiler]\n\nThe worst glitch I had was an issue\
      \ where what I assume there could have potentially been a conflict between myself\
      \ and another one of my coworkers. However, there must have been a coding error\
      \ or something, because instead of there actually being a person that I was\
      \ up against, it would say \u201Cno one\u201D. I assume what was supposed to\
      \ be happening is depending on relationships with coworkers, you would have\
      \ to try and succeed against one of them here, but since I had a neutral to\
      \ positive relationship with all of them (allegedly, it felt like they all hated\
      \ me), it just said there was no one\n\nTo show how completely incomprehensible\
      \ this was, [spoiler] again with my character being called to court, and I tried\
      \ to call in a favor with Pedita. It said that \u201Cno one\u201D had the same\
      \ target, so I thought \u201Coh, okay, that\u2019s good\u201D. Then the next\
      \ sentence says \u201Cshe throws you a hateful look\u201D, and context says\
      \ it's not Pedita doing that, which implies that someone else is. But the only\
      \ other person who could be involved here is Roza since no one else uses she/her\
      \ pronouns, and Roza\u2019s not involved. Then several times throughout this\
      \ page of text, it again refers to no one as if there\u2019s a person that should\
      \ be here. [/spoiler] It got to the point where I thought that this had to be\
      \ some kind of intentional thing, like the author was trying to play with my\
      \ mind somehow. Honestly, I wish it was because then I would have at least been\
      \ able to figure out what on earth was happening in hindsight\n\nMy ending also\
      \ felt highly anticlimactic, and like countless plot threads had just been abandoned.\
      \ [spoiler] I never learned what was up with the ministry and why my house was\
      \ hated so much, what was going on with that assassin, what was up with the\
      \ cloaks-- really anything about any of the mysteries that were set up throughout\
      \ the story. I didn\u2019t even get anything happening with my RO, though granted,\
      \ with how I was treated by them sometimes, I'm not even sure if I was successfully\
      \ romancing them. [/spoiler] I\u2019m sure I probably just got a bad ending,\
      \ but even the bad endings of other stories from COG/Hosted don\u2019t leave\
      \ every single plot thread from the story unanswered. Maybe one day I\u2019\
      ll replay the story to try and get something better so I can at least have some\
      \ answers, but I doubt I\u2019ll be doing that any time soon due to just how\
      \ hard this thing was to slog through near the end\n\nI\u2019d probably give\
      \ this game a [b]3/10[/b]. The concept is interesting, but there are so many\
      \ issues and the plot was so difficult for me to follow that I finished the\
      \ game feeling unfulfilled and lost. Kinda disappointed I spent my money on\
      \ this, especially when the demo was so promising, but at least I got it on\
      \ a sale"
