    review: "First of all, it's probably important to say you're getting VR cricket\
      \ for \xA33.99 here, so it's hard to have too many issues with this game.\n\n\
      Pros:\n- Gameplay itself is pretty solid - I edge the ball a lot so it must\
      \ be realistic.\n- Touch support works well.\n- Replays look nice and give you\
      \ a chance to see how wrong your technique was.\n- Dev responds to feedback\
      \ (see comments).\n\nCons (fixed since writing review):\n- Quite a lot of the\
      \ balls are pitched short, making it hard to drive. On the plus side, my hook\
      \ shot is looking a lot better nowadays.\n- Menu system could do with a bit\
      \ of work, quit and continue buttons are close together which means I have mistakenly\
      \ quit games halfway through.\n\nOverall, worth picking up for the price if\
      \ you're into the sport."
