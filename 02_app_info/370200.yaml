    reviews: "\u201CTwo Steps Back is an exciting visual novel debut. The quality\
      \ is quite high for something designed by a single person. Honestly, you rarely\
      \ even see games in the genre that take the time to provide animated sprites!\
      \ The unique, frightening storyline stands out against its colleagues as well.\
      \ If this review got you interested then definitely seek out Two Steps Back\
      \ for yourself and unravel its mysteries.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://cliqist.com/2014/09/15/trapped-in-a-dream-with-two-steps-back/\"\
