    review: "Region price may differ, so your millage may vary.\n\nFor NT700 (Around\
      \ US$20?), You'll get....\n[b]a DH Express Pass for 30days[/b]\n[list]\n   \
      \ [*]Extra 10 Bag Space, so if you using collector, you can pack more stuff!\n\
      \    [*]30% OFF on Kill Coin rescue,once you pass the 20F or above, you'll see.\n\
      \    [*]Access Royal Elevator, does not cost you Kill Coin\n    [*]Insurance,\
      \ if you get raided, there is nothing to lose aside your fighter,\n    [*]Instant\
      \ retreat , if you find yourself in a difficult raid.\n[/list]\n[b]a sack of\
      \ DM for storage expansion.[/b]\n[b]and a decals that worth the price?.[/b]\n\
      \nOther then that , you are on your own.\nLET IT DIE!\nCompare with Uncle Prime\
      \ Pack on PS4 , minus one DH Pass, and it's a cheaper version.\n(Thanks reddit.)\n\
