I thought reviewers were exadurating when they said they had to force themselves to finish it, but the issues go beyond just the un responsive controls.  It seems that every design decision in this game was made with the intent to make it as aggressively un fun and painful to play and I regret the time and money I wasted on this wasted potential of a game.","timestamp_created":1609664340,"timestamp_updated":1609664340,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgpTe4/YCeJKBwAI="}
