I don't know if I can recommend it.\n On the positive side, the loco is very realistic in appearance, performance and sound, and really powerful like the prototype.  I took eight coaches over Masbury Summit at 50mph!\nHowever, there are some serious issues. Firstly, it is misleading.  It has an auto fireman option, but the manual says  you still have to operate the injectors manually.  This is incorrect, as option 4 of the 'Driver & Fireman Assistants' gives automatic water level control. Secondly, the small ejector key pad activation doesn't work. Thirdly, you have to operate the reverser from the reversing wheel and lock itself which is quite fiddly: the F4 hud reverser doesn't work.  Also to operate it you've got to at least go to a screen with a dark top left background so you can read the F5 key information including the reverser setting.  This means regular switching of screens and spoils the fun.\nAll in all, it would have been better if it had a  simple fully automatic fireman setting and easy access reverser like JT'S Britannia and Standard Class 5.\nOnly buy this if you're prepared to put the albeit relatively small time to familiarise yourself with the controls and the manual.","timestamp_created":1609610746,"timestamp_updated":1609610746,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519417464733123779","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiduR4vYCdOTmvwI="}
