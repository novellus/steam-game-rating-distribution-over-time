    about_the_game: An awesome way to show your support for Quintet. The trio ship
      was originally for Kickstarter backers. Several players requested being able
      to access this ship as well. Trio access gives you everything the regular upgrade
      gives you (additional scenarios and the ability to create your own) and access
      to all 5 Trio ships.

    review: Definitely worth having 3-crew ships with a science bay. Creates many
      more opportunities for scanning and remote interfacing without the need of a
      quintet ship.
