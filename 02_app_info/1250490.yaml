    review: 'Forgot to write a review: I know the developer and they''re one of the
      most down to Earth people I know. Seriously, they''re definitely not an alien.
      They''re an indie game developer and are well known within their small community
      of game devs. This was originally a Flash game that they ported to something
      a little more playable.


      You definitely want to keep any eye on this guy. He will make quality games
      for years to come.'
