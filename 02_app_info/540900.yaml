    about_the_game: "It is the year 1959, the world is drastically changing in the\
      \ aftermath of the Korean War and the death of the Soviet Dictator Joseph Stalin.\
      \ The power balance of the world is forever altered by the discovery of the\
      \ destructive A-bomb. From former British colonies in the South East Asia, US\
      \ spies came back with the disturbing news of communist insurgents creating\
      \ nuclear weapons. Nobody knows how they got their hands on uranium to fuel\
      \ such a weapon and the required knowledge to make it. Faced with the dangers\
      \ that communist terrorists could pose to the US and it's allies, the CIA Directors\
      \ have decided to send their top man, Jack MacArthur to investigate the rumors\
      \ and if they are proven true, to sabotage the nuclear capabilities of the terrorists.\
      \ Still haunted by the horrors of the Korean War, Jack sets forth to eliminate\
      \ the threat not only to the US, but to the whole world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nNuclear Contingency is a stealth game inspired by the old school top\
      \ down spy titles (such as the Metal Gear series). A deep and compelling story\
      \ line spread across a period of 4 years will constantly keep you on your toes\
      \ while you travel across exotic locations of Vietnam, Kongo, Cuba, Afganistan\
      \ and more. Be prepared for an intriguing political thriller filled with unforeseeable\
      \ twists and turns. Playing as a top field operative, players will be tasked\
      \ with completing various missions by using stealth or confronting  enemy soldiers\
      \ head on. However, if alerted, the guards will prove to be a great challenge\
      \ as a single bullet is enough to send Jack to an early grave. Only with a stealthy,\
      \ smart approach, cool head and steady aim will the player be able to complete\
      \ the mission and put an end to a nuclear threat, bringing back peace to the\
      \ world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhats next'<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe still wish to\
      \ work on the game and improve certain ai mechanics. For now we still have not\
      \ figured out why the AI sometimes breaks. Please let us know about everything\
      \ you would like to see improved so we can put it in the upcoming patch!<br\
      \ />\r\nFinal note- During beta testing we have come across one weird but fun\
      \ bug. The map is for some unknown reason filled with blood like someone before\
      \ played the level... We found this interesting and we have no idea what causes\
      \ the bug so if someone sees this please let us know so we can maybe figure\
      \ out what causes the Massacre bug."
