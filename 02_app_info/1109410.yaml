      \ at DigiPen in 2012. Now, for the first time, the game comes to Steam, updated\
      \ for modern computers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn Perspective, the player has two\
      \ modes of control: a first person camera moving in 3D space, and a 2D avatar\
      \ constrained to your screen. In order to get the 2D avatar to the exit at the\
      \ end of the level, the 3D player needs to move around to create new 2D paths.\
      \  Unlike other spatial puzzle games like Crush or Fez, Perspective allows the\
      \ 3D player to move around freely, opening up new ways to use perspective tricks\
      \ to solve puzzles in 2D."

    short_description: Perspective is an experimental platformer. The player avatar
      moves in a 2D space that transforms when the player changes perspective in 3D
      space. The player needs to use this mechanic navigate the 2D avatar to a goal
      in order to progress from level to level.
