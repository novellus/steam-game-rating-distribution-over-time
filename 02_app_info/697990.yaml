      \ /><br><br><strong>Pursuit of Power\xAE 2</strong> is a real-time strategy\
      \ game with a different focus than traditional RTS games. Players connect fortresses\
      \ together in order to build, research technology, generate bonus resources,\
      \ defend allies, and lay siege to enemies. Each player has a leader unit that\
      \ summons structures and casts powerful abilities. Rifts dynamically spawn invaders\
      \ and epic creatures that reward players with prestige when defeated. There\
      \ is a priority system for enemy targets and a rage mechanic that affects combat\
      \ in multiple ways.<br><br>Fight through a single-player campaign game with\
      \ unique content and objectives for your leader. Play local and network skirmish\
      \ games with up to 10 players. Join a team with allies that can come to your\
      \ aid. Create new skirmish games using a map editor with a rich set of features.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">What is in the Demo?</h2>The demo for Pursuit of Power\xAE\
      \ 2 places you in a skirmish game as a Shadow Knight versus another SK computer\
      \ player at normal difficulty. The features are limited in order to simplify\
      \ things, which is important since the campaign tutorial has not been implemented\
      \ yet. You will definitely want to read the &quot;help tips&quot; image and\
      \ it would be good to read the extended help window too.<br><br><br>Pursuit\
      \ of Power\xAE 2 will not be finished until late 2020, so this is really just\
      \ an early preview of it. There are some important gameplay features missing\
      \ that will add a lot of depth to the game. Over the next few months, I will\
      \ add an upgrade path for your leader, multiple fortress upgrades, epic bosses\
      \ that spawn from special rifts, powerful zealot abilities, flying guardians,\
      \ and more. The current version of the game should give a good idea of how it\
      \ will play, but the final version will contain much more depth and have a lot\
      \ more polish too.<br><br><strong>I am launching the Steam Demo early, so I\
      \ can begin building a community around the game. I will update the store page\
      \ during development, especially when I add new content and features to the\
      \ game.</strong><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/697990/extras/demo_help_tips.jpg?t=1579370700\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>A long time ago, the first crystal awakened\
      \ with a pulse of power. It called out like a beacon, whispering to rulers across\
      \ the lands, invading their minds. They soon learned how to infuse their people\
      \ with the magic of the crystals to create devout followers. Each new zealot\
      \ increased their influence and fueled a hunger to rule over all.<br><br><br>The\
      \ rulers continued to harnessed the power of the ancient crystals, believing\
      \ they could gain immortality. They absorbed so much power that they ascended\
      \ to another dimension, becoming worshiped by the mortals left behind. The deities\
      \ then began to fight for dominance while gathering the strongest allies across\
      \ every known dimension.<br><br>The battle for supremacy left unimaginable carnage\
      \ in its path. The crystal formations became corrupted, tearing a rift within\
      \ them and bringing chaos into the world. Invaders poured from the rifts, slaughtering\
      \ anything that stood in their path. Balance must be restored to the Universe\
      \ before everything is consumed by this Chaos Dimension.<br><br>You have risen\
      \ to lead the mortal armies of your deity. As you conquer each world, you consume\
      \ its power until you are able to transport your spirit to another world, leaving\
      \ behind the remains of a diminished planet. From there you launch your assaults,\
      \ summoning your armies through portals that connect those worlds.<br><br>You\
      \ are aided by the Avatar of your deity, a formidable creature that can grant\
      \ you god-like abilities to smite your enemies. This Avatar gives you insight\
      \ into all divine beings, including the crystal formations and the zealots of\
      \ your enemies. Through its omniscience, you can even sense when your fortresses\
      \ are going to be attacked.<br><br>Now you must conquer each new world and harness\
      \ its power to give your deity the dominance it needs to restore balance and\
      \ heal the crystals. And perhaps in time, you will ascend to rule over your\
      \ own empire...<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Current progress</h2>Pursuit of Power\xAE\
      \ 2 is currently in the Beta 1 phase of development. Most of the major game\
      \ components have already been completed. That includes the path-finding, troop\
      \ AI, computer player AI, networking, multiplayer, game editor, combat mechanics,\
      \ fortresses, chaos levels, rifts, invaders, and other major components.<br><br><br>The\
      \ main features that need to be finished are the leveling system for leaders,\
      \ fortress upgrades, epic bosses, and the campaign mode. Those items will be\
