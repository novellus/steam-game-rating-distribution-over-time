    review: Great foundation for a good off-road game. The amount of customisation
      is surprisingly good. There are currently some bugs but the game will get better
      as it develops. With most being resolved by saving so if the game closes you
      just load a save you made, loosing near to no progress. Doesn't take long to
      get used to the controls either. Just make sure to read what the help says and
      you'll be set. Other than that, it is an enjoyable game.
