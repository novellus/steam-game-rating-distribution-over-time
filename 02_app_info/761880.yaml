    developer_response: Thanks for the detailed review. We are working hard on refining
      the controls and gameplay. The game will keep getting better as we push out
      more updates. I would also suggest you to switch on the "Arcade" mode, it has
      faster teleportation and attack times. Thanks again.

    review: "First of all, this is an early access review.  \n\nI see plenty of potential\
      \ here.  Currently the controls can be a bit wonky, and the advantage is definitely\
      \ with the redneck (as opposed to the the \"superior\" aliens).  There isn't\
      \ much to do at this point, only two maps and gameplay is repetitive but after\
      \ refinement this would be an amazing party game. \n\nThe alien needs a buff\
      \ badly, quicker teleport and most importantly, better aiming.  There were a\
      \ few times I would put the line right on the redneck and the laser went BEHIND\
      \ me :(.  A ground marker for the laser would be helpful.\n\nCan't wait for\
      \ updates to this game!"
