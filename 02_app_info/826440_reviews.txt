The items needed are from the various places you've already visited.  \n\nThere is a tip system if you are stuck, although the puzzles are not difficult.  This game is perfect for relaxing with enjoyable visuals.  \n\nThis is the first time for me to play this type of game, and i chose it for something to do when I needed something quiet and simple to occupy my time.\n\nI can picture this being enjoyable for people of all ages - or even playing together with children.  They would be delighted with the sparkles and fairy wand sound effects.\n\nThis is a short game, but there are items to return to collect and seek out if you don't find them on the first run through.\n\nI'd be happy to answer any of your questions about this game in the comments!\n\nEdit: The game is longer that I originally thought!\n\nPros:\n-Great graphics\n-Compelling simple story cutscenes\n-Increasingly complex puzzles\n-Tips in an active window of what type of item to seek or what type of item to obtain\n-Pleasant, non distracting music and sound effects\n-The collectible section has additional puzzles and rewards when all of one set is acquired\n-More than one player can have a \"save\" and player is easy to switch\n-Low computer system requirements\n-can play in windowed mode and do two things at once \n-You have the ability to skip a puzzle after completing a certain number in a row\n\nCons\n-Intro cutscene replays each time the game opens - the escape key bypasses it\n-No \"undo\" option for a puzzle, so a complete reset would be required\n-I haven't found a way yet to go back to the area I missed pages for my creature collection book - this is a MAJOR CON as I went into the final area and the game ended but i hadn't completed all the areas.  When I go to the bonus content, I can't access it because I haven't \"finished the game\".  Going back into the game takes me to the final cutscene and there's nothing I can do\n-To replay the game, you have to play as a new player name apparently\n\nOverall, besides the disappointment at the end (which you can avoid if you check the menu logs before moving to a new area) at not having completed the game apparently, I'd definitely still give this game a big thumbs up!","timestamp_created":1550057627,"timestamp_updated":1550135353,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46ovR9egCc83lugE="}
