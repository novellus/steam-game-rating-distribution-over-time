    about_the_game: Pylon Racer is an experiment. On the one hand it was the one game
      I craved and could not buy, and on the other it is a sandbox where I can experiment
      with new rendering and game-play techniques.<br><br><strong>From a games perspective:</strong><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>True first person gaming. No HUD overlays, no ribbon in the
      sky to follow, no chase plane views. Fly it the way a pilot would, then watch
      the TV replay afterwards.<br></li><li>Insanely difficult. It is the <i>&quot;flappy
      bird&quot;</i> of flight simulation. There is no rookie mode to nurse you around.
      You will have to practice the turns repeatedly until you are in full control
      of the airplane.<br></li><li>Accurate simulation of a modern aerobatics plane.
      <br></li><li>Pure test of pilot skill. No upgrades, especially no in app purchases.
      Your time only reflects your skill as a pilot. I hope that combined with leaderboards
      for time and penalties it will foster a community that race each other for the
      top spot.<br></li><li>Fast stable game-play. Down to the minimum spec, my testers
      have all managed a guaranteed 60 fps. I feel so strongly about this aspect of
      gaming, that I will report bad frames as part of your results. In a game this
      fast, even a single slow (30 fps) frame will through you off balance. Combined
      with a 1000 fps joystick and flight model simulation, it is the smoothest simulation
      experience you can get.</li></ul><br><strong>From a developer perspective:</strong><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Trees. With 4 million individual leaves in the world, and
      more than half of them visible in a single frame at times, it was a chance to
      prove that 3 dimensional trees have a place in flight simulation. It builds
      on my research in growing convincing trees on the GPU, and I look forward to
      expanding the vegetation in the future.<br></li><li>Radiosity solution inside
      the cockpit. Full light bounce simulates the complexities of light and the wide
      range of light effects. While my initial research showed fantastic promise,
      a maths bug has forced me to tone it down a little for this release. </li></ul>
