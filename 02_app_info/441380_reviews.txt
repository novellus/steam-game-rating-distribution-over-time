The mazes are now center symmetrical horizontal like classic PAC-MAN, with the reintroduction of teleport/jump pads from Pac-Man Mania (I think). \nNow, if Namco had stopped there, that would have been enough and this game would have probably been a hit.\nThe problem is Namco introduced a bunch of new game mechanics that just do not seem PAC MAN.\n\nThe Bad:\nFirst, the new 'minion' ghosts which are used to build the ghost trains.  They don't make sense, and they don't make eating a ghost train satisfying.\nThe eating pellets to limit break up the generation of Fruit or Power Pellet. This just does not make sense, and removes a bit of strategy from how one goes about clearing a board.\nThe bumping ghosts to make them mad?  This just does not make sense.\nFinally, Namco switched to using the Criware engine for this game.   Normally, this probably should not be a big deal, but in this case it is because it totally alters the control input.  \nOne of the great things about the original PAC-MAN CE games, it how faithfully they recreated the feel of the original PAC MAN game control-wise.  Specifically, in the classic PAC-MAN game is the super important to how one can lean into a turn to get a little speed.\nThe Criware engine totally breaks this, and in fact makes it a liability.  If you lean into a turn too soon, especially using the thumb stick, you risk the game will misread your input and do the opposite of what you want when you get to a turn. \n\nThe short take is this:  If you want a game that is PAC-MAN-esk to scratch an itch, then this game is fine.   But if you completed a bunch of the goals in PAC-MAC CE and want to continue with some more, this game will leave you disappointed. \n\nOver all I do recommend the game, but with caution.","timestamp_created":1609070578,"timestamp_updated":1609070578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlZGF0vYCdujcvQI="}
