Maybe if the multiplayer was in any way, shape or form still alive then MAYBE it would be more fun, but as a single player game there's really nothing to it and they're now busy working on the new battle royale version of this game.\n\nNever the less I played it for a good 25 hours and for the price I got it for (sale) I certainly can't complain, but as a full priced game I can't in all fairness recommend it.\n\nP.S - The AI ships are OP as hell.","timestamp_created":1560550887,"timestamp_updated":1609987763,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.607287585735321045","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s/Wv7fYCdvm1wwE="}
