    review: 'Here''s my video review of this title


      https://youtu.be/KgpOglr95Bs?t=53


      I don''t want to be too harsh, but this game is pretty much unplayable in it''s
      current form. The camera is horrible, the gameplay is undefined, there''s ZERO
      tutorial, no story that I can find.


      That being said, this game has potential, I hope the developer keeps working
      on it. I hope he adds new features, polishes what''s there AND fixes the camera.
