It's pretty bad. \nThe writing is cringy as all hell, the game won't even go into fullscreen mode and of course there are no in-game settings whatsoever. Can't even adjust the volume. I think all the effort went into the drawings, which,  credit where credit is due, are pretty nice. Everything else? Half-arsed.","timestamp_created":1539609047,"timestamp_updated":1539609915,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.653491079807281494","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45935u+YCfuvdrAE="}
