It really shouldn't draw me in, but for some reason, it does.\n\nThe game is needlessly complex, obtuse, & poorly explained. The cast is boring & annoying - with half of them being explained in a sentence or two, then making superfluous appearances on & off. Random events & images are all over the place, but don't seem to have anything to do with the plot at all. The story lacks substance & is chock-full of meandering dialogue that manages to say nothing of importance. Every time I launch the game, I need to consult fan-guides to figure out what the hell I'm doing & what I need to do.\n\nThat said, the game scratches a rare, vague itch in the vein of StarCrawlers & Disgaea. You can create & customize a variety of characters (some of the customization options even look good). You crawl through dungeons in first-person, & get to explore, dealing with random encounters, hidden areas, & tiles that can harm your party, push you along, or even spin you around. The battle system somehow manages to be both fun & simple while also complicated & (in my experience) unique.\n\nDespite all the bad, it's been fun & almost hypnotic to dive into a dungeon with my customized squad & leverage them to their fullest from skirmish to skirmish, while also seeing the strange & abstract levels that the game offers. In order to do this, expect a lot of trial & error (fan-guides are very helpful!) & to sink a significant amount of time in figuring out how this game works. If you're into this type of game, or are willing to take your time & figure things out, & aren't overly concerned about a story, there's very much game to be had here.","timestamp_created":1606287104,"timestamp_updated":1606287104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544632494449615479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgIOL//UCdNivsAI="}
