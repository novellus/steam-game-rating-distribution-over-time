Sometimes, you'll need to begin a new campaign because you can't do anything but try a different manner to avoid spending too much money you've \"stolen\" or to add to your trace level. That's perhaps the most frustrating thing in HE. Finding exploits, reading files to find a clue, a password, cracking, decrypting and stealing money so that you can reduce your trace level or to buy better hardware, that's what you will to do.\n\nAnd with a package called Hardcore, you're expecting to be challenged... though this first DLC is incredibly easy. Hack every server with money, take it and you'll beat the two levels (yeah, two levels only) as a chief!\n\nFor 2 euros, you would have expected something more. I mean, I can understand two levels but if the challenge isn't up to the name, why bother then? I've activated this for the challenge and it wasn't met.\n\nHowever, why I'm still recommending it? Because, well, even if the challenge isn't there, it's making up for the abrupt ending of the main game, it's more levels with Xenti secrets....\n\nBut if you own the Hardcore Packages for the first game, Hacker Evolution, maybe you should avoid investing in both DLC. Because guess what? They're the same levels. Without any difference. The Hardcore Package was clearly developed for Untold though, as they're played with the rules of Untold in the first HE.","timestamp_created":1453365009,"timestamp_updated":1453365009,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569347202777862549","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4psPTsdICep3mTg=="}
