The issue as far as I know has not been resolved to date. the company that made the game has responded to tech support and they basically told them that they can't help them fix it. do not buy ever. this is also apparently a wide spread problem if at all possible i would recomend not buying from Maxis or EA they made this game and now they can't be bothered to help out paying customers, shame on them.","timestamp_created":1344971096,"timestamp_updated":1493082782,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk+eq0dsCdJnbEw=="}
