    about_the_game: Glitch War is a Action, Strategy, video game. It's a game where
      you command units as you take back your world from invading monsters. You control
      unique characters who each have their own special attacks. There are puzzles
      and boss fights that you will have to make your way though. There is an open
      world to explore. You can go in any direction you want, find new areas, new
      units, and experience each area as you progress through the game. I am an indie
      developer and have been working on this game for just under a year now and its
      really shown me my passion for creating games! It has been such a blast and
      I hope you enjoy it as much as I have making the game!
