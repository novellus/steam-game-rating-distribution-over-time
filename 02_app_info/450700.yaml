      \ simulation games and classic play -- which heavily influenced <i>The Spatials</i>,\
      \ their first project. Inspired by the great classic sim games of the '90s,\
      \ <i>The Spatials</i> combined classic base-building gameplay (based on isometric\
      \ tile room building) with a real-time combat system and an exploration campaign.\
      \ <i>The Spatials</i> was released on Steam in March 2015 and took off! Thanks\
      \ to its success and growing fan base, <i>The Spatials</i> spawned a sequel\
      \ -- <i>The Spatials: Galactology</i>, which updates the original concept with\
