    review: 'This is an early review, so things might change.


      Very cool minimalist game!

      It has unique gameplay, it''s like if you took the ship mode from Geometry Dash
      and made it better.

      Also, I would really like to see this game be ported over to something like
      the Google Play or App Store.

      The major drawback to this is that when you''re playing, the next section doesn''t
      load until you''re almost there, making it way less smooth and for some reason
      it distracts me.

      Another big drawback is the price. Now, if I were to sell a game like this,
      I would want money, but $0.99 originally seems like a stretch. So, if you''re
      thinking of buying this game, my advice is to wait for it on sale.

      And, sorry if it may seem like I''m picky, but can you make the coins bigger?
      It''s very hard to collect them with my late reaction times.


      Overall rating: 8/10 (IMO)

      It''s a great game to play on the go or when you have a few minutes of spare
      time.'
