The characters roaming about a little corny, but the aspects of building a new society are enough to keep you invested. It certainly has worked for me so far. \n\nMore mods would be cool, I couldn't imagine what this game would be like with the full force of the community tweaking and modding it. \n\nGreat game, just buy it!","timestamp_created":1609350049,"timestamp_updated":1609350049,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4zp2v2vYCdNPrvgI="}
