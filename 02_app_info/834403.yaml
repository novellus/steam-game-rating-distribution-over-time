    review: I can't make this review very long as I have zero complaints. This is
      a stunning add on pack and is very detailed. I am not going to talk about the
      scenery very much on this review as I have explained what I think of the actual
      route more on my review on the GEML. The train is fabulous. It is pretty much
      identical to how it look in real life and the sounds are great. I have not received
      this pack in a deal. I have paid full price for it and I can say that it is
      money well spent. I have also got the TFL pack so head over there to check my
      review on that.
