    review: "You walk painfully slowly down nearly identical smoky & dark corridors,\
      \ find a mirror & hold LMB to blink for 3 or 4 seconds (which so far as I remember\
      \ the game doesn't tell you to do) and some jump scare nonsense happens & then\
      \ you do it again at every other mirror. \nSome don't do anything, some open\
      \ corridors behind you that have more mirrors in them, some lead to a cutscene\
      \ that kills you & then you respawn & have to do a number of mirrors again in\
      \ order to then not Blink in the mirror that kills you in some tortuous trial\
      \ & error 'gameplay', there didn't seem to be a way to tell which mirrors were\
      \ going to kill you beforehand & there seemed to be no ability to run once you\
      \ realised your mistake you had to just redo the mirrors & then leave; after\
      \ the first such bollocks I hoped it didn't return as a mechanic & then it did\
      \ it again with the same result, trapped in a cutscene that ends with a screen\
      \ that tells me 'You have burned alive' & my only reaction was \"Good.\" & then\
      \ I returned it.\n\n"
