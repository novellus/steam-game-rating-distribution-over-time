    review: "Most of the tiles in this DLC look great and give off that old PC game\
      \ vibe. That's perfect for making some classic feeling RPG games. However, some\
      \ of the tiles are nearly ruined due to the new 3 tile tall character sprites.\
      \ If you use RPG Maker very much you might already see some of the problems\
      \ this can pose. \n\nFor example, what if you had a 2 tile tall lamp. For 1\
      \ tile tall sprites that's all fine and good, as you can make the top tile of\
      \ the lamp be an overlay, and the bottom be an un-passible tile.\n\nBut this\
      \ doesn't work with 3 tile tall sprites as now they are tall enough to reach\
      \ that top, overlay tile of the lamp. This means that you'd need a script to\
      \ change the overlay settings of the top tile of the lamp on the fly. \n\nAs\
      \ I've not found a script to do this, the problem renders many of the tile sets\
      \ almost useless. For the $30 price point seems way too high for something that\
      \ hardly works, and seems poorly thought out.\n\n\n(Also, I can't find out how\
      \ to make use of hte side view battle system, so the DLC doesn't quite seem\
      \ as easy as they make it out to be in the description) \n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway,\
      \ this might just all be me not seeing something super obvious, but I feel it's\
      \ best in this case to write about my own expierences with the product."
