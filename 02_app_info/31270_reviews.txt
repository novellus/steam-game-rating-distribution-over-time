For fun he sat us down after dinner one night with work packets filled with logic puzzles that he had to do at the hospital so they could test his cognitive function and know when to release him. It was then that I realized that if I ever had a  stroke, or was ever suspected of having had a stroke, I'd be institutionalized until the money ran out. The presentation on this game is wonderful, and the story is really intriguing, but it isn't worth it when all that's underneath is logic puzzles. I thought it would be the fun kind of puzzle.","timestamp_created":1610076219,"timestamp_updated":1610076219,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.45267486572265625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ456yB8PYCefG4wQI="}
