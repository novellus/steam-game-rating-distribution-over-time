    about_the_game: In the unknown expanse of the deep sea, survival of the fittest
      is taken to a whole new level. The weak and slow perish while the strong survive.
      To withstand the unforgiving nature of the depths, its denizens must adapt.
      For many, the only survival option is to evolve into an exotic and dangerous
      being. <br><br>In Qualia 3, you take form of an evolving creature - a &quot;<i>Multi
      Agent</i>&quot;, comprised of three base creature elements. To become stronger
      and to overcome your adversaries, you will need to adapt and gain access to
      new forms. The only way to do this is to kill other creatures, collect their
      energy, and obtain trophies that unlock new forms. If successful, you will gain
      dominion over the deep sea and become its apex predator! Should you fail, your
      fate will be sealed as just another forgettable part of the food chain. <br><br>Set
      out to control the depths, or die trying!<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>26

    review: 'In this game, you play as an insect swimming on the surface of a big,
      rectangular tub of partially-set gelatin, fighting against a horde of pickle
      slices, slices of star fruit and other fruit and vegetable slices.  I guess
      just having a bug in the gelatin wasn''t bad enough, and you have to ruin the
      whole fruit salad.  Anyway, you fight against the slices by splashing the gelatin
      at them, either using energy bombs or telekinetic pulses, depending on which
      armaments you purchase from saving up clouds of magnetic money gas.  (This story
      is my personal interpretation.)


      It''s actually kind of fun once you figure out how to build up harmonic motion
      to generate strong enough splashes.  Notice that your own motion compresses
      the gelatin in front of you.  If you take advantage of this and also save up
      enough magnetic money gas to get some of the pulse weapons, it becomes like
      a surreal shooting game.


      If you pick the right settings, you can play this game with an XBox360 controller,
      which I definitely recommend.  On the downside, this game requires a lot of
      grinding to get to the decent weapons.  On the up side, it provides a new and
      entirely different kind of challenge than any normal arena shooter.  It totally
      breaks out of the gelatin mold.'
