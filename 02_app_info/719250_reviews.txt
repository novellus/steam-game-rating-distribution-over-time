Think of a seaside arcade to goof around in. There's mini golf, which was the best part so far, and would be worth the price to me. You go around a pirate theme course and can even walk on a pirate ship or chillax underwater. It's really fun, and seems to have the best physics.\n\nThere is also skeeball and basketball games, and bowling. I admit my ball never returned in bowling, but I'll also admit I'm so bad it jumped lanes and landed in another gutter. \n\nThe escape room was fun though I didn't get the whole way through yet. And there are VR games I didn't even get to try yet.\n\nAlso included are the random things like free sodas, pizza and instruments to fool around with. I enjoyed that the game contained so much variety, and if your on the fence I'd say get it. It's well worth the full price and played well on my Oculus Rift.","timestamp_created":1564014650,"timestamp_updated":1564014650,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1568222705,"developer_response":"Thank you for the review! I'm glad you enjoyed my game! Make sure to try out the vr arcade mini games. They add a lot of content. The Case of Parlagog is a detective - escape room mini game that is about an hour long alone. You can play that one by putting on the VR headset. Have fun and thanks again!"}],"cursor":"AoJwqbSik+wCe5SHzwE="}
