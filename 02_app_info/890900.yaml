    about_the_game: '<strong>Whacker Guy: Distance Hunter</strong> is a 3D physics-based
      baseball batting game set in a beautiful ballpark with a specific goal - accumulated
      distance.  Total distance is the score.  Skill is required to be great!  Will
      you take the challenge?<br><br><strong>Home runs</strong><br>Naturally, home
      runs will usually get you more distance, so they are a big part of excelling
      at this game, though there is more to it than that.  <br>Each struck ball into
      fair territory that is not a home run is an out.  Similar to home run derbies,
      yet in this game a foul ball is NOT an out.  Good for you.  And each home run
      comes with an added bonus - an upbeat, feel good sound track.  String the homers
      together and keep the music playing!<br><br><strong>Power Hits, Power Level
      and Strikeouts</strong><br>Additionally, well struck balls (Power Hits) are
      accumulated and are important for success in this game.  For every five Power
      Hits, your Power Level is increased, which results in greater distance.  So
      if you make solid contact it bodes well for later in the game.  Unless of course,
      you strike out a lot.  Every strikeout decreases your Power Level, so you must
      learn to make solid, consistent contact to have the best results. However, at
      every five-multiple of Power Hits, you get back all the Power Level you lost
      from strikeouts.<br><br><strong>The Controls</strong><br>New: NOW with controller
      support for Xbox One/360 controllers!<br>The controls are simple.  There are
      two on-screen joystick knobs.  The left hand joystick is to position in the
      batter''s box.  The right hand joystick is to control the bat.  Using a mouse
      left-click and drag the right hand joystick back and angle it appropriately.  Releasing
      the left mouse button will swing the bat.  This game is all about timing and
      angles.  There are also varying techniques to pull the ball vs hitting it to
      the opposite field.  This game is all about learning those techniques and being
      able to repeat them consistently.  For example, in this easy mode (the only
      mode available at initial release) the same pitch is thrown every time.  But
      don''t think that makes it easy to hit.  Not at all!  You still have to execute
      a proper swing and be on time.  There is a lot of skill required which makes
      this game both challenging and rewarding... and fun!'

    review: 'Presentation


      it''s a homerun derby game for over 10$ ... fun for a quick run if you want
      to hit some balls , the control are simple , you pull a virtual joystick around
      to move the bat and release it to swing.


      who I recommended this to


      those who want to burn 10$ on a game that no one seem to own.


      plus


      -game download size is small , very small

      -performances are extremely good

      -it''s baseball , it''s homerun derby , it''s simple ... the balls come and
      you hit them.

      -I do see some potential for this to become a good game (with more gamemodes
      and a bit of polish)

      -I''ve scanned the files with 3 different anti-malwares softwares and haven''t
      found a virus.


      minus

      -the pitcher look like a bald robot

      -the virtual joystick do appear ingame and you have to interact with them with
      your mouse

      (unless you''re using a gamepad)

      -I do wonder if the developer have aquired the rights to show all these logo
      from things like ford and pepsi in the game.


      Final vote


      6/10 ... at least it''s not a digital homicide games.'
