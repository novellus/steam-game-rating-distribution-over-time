Plays a bit like sins of a solar empire against an overwhelmingly powerful opponent. You cannot expand too fast or the AI will find you and murder you. You have to launch expeditions to \"loot\" the technology the AI has lying around on their planets to get powerful enough to expand further giving you longer reach (and allows you to claim other cool stuff that you only get when taking a planet). During this the AI will perpetually launch counter attacks to reclaim its lost territory.\n\nThe game can be customized to whatever you enjoy. Difficulty levels range from extremely easy to impossibly hard. On difficulty level 10 it even says that in the case of your victory, you should file a bug report containing your strategy so that the devs can introduce countermeasures. In the beginning using the default difficulty 5 is a good start to get familiar with the game (but if you are familiar with strategy games you probably want to crank that up soon). It is also possible to include additional alien, human or AI factions that change the way the game plays. Some of them aid you, some the AI and some just want to watch the world burn.\n\nThe game is definitely not for everyone but if you like RTS and get a thrill out of winning against all odds, you probably should give it a shot!","timestamp_created":1609750837,"timestamp_updated":1609750837,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48I6o5vYCeOaqwAI="}
