The camera and dying can feel a bit capricious but it is over all fun to play. Especially with as many friends as possible, which leads me to my major issue with the game. It claims to support 8 players but using xbox one controllers on PC i can only get it to recognize as many as steam big picture will. I used a program to force steam to recognize all 8 of my controllers but then this game does a weird glitch that makes it unplayable after a few levels. the level will load in, no players will spawn and then it will move on to repeat with the next level. would be a fairly decent game if not for this problem","timestamp_created":1582664086,"timestamp_updated":1582664086,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn66Iv/ACearK9AE="}
