    review: "The game doesn't have the best production value, but it sure exceeded\
      \ my expectations. The concept and idea about the world and characters fascinated\
      \ me. I enjoyed the humor and references in game. Artwork is beautiful although\
      \ some character models are lacking. \nDownside is that it get's too easy at\
      \ times and at times it's very illogical with it's puzzles. I wouldn't say that\
      \ the story and dialogue are very strong in this one.\nThere are also some bugs\
      \ with the objects and models, and the dialogue can get stuck sometimes.\nBut...\
      \ 99 cents for this game is a steal considering all the effort put in this game.\
      \ It's by no means a masterpiece, but an unpolished diamond in my opinion. \n\
      It saddens me that it's likely we never see that sequel \"Space Travesty\" for\
      \ this game because it didn't get enough kickstart funding. I really really\
      \ would've wanted to see that one, especially because this project had some\
      \ veteran game designers like Steve Ince working in it."
