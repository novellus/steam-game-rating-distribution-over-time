    review: 'As a nearly life-long fan of this series, something I''ve been unable
      to play is The Red Odyssey. However, thanks to Rebellion, TRO has been updated
      and remastered, and the result is great. The campaigns contained in TRO are
      extremely difficult as the developers expected you to have played and mastered
      the original campaigns in the first game, but the challenge is still satisfying
      and entertaining. When the original missions in the game have become commonplace
      for you or too easily completed, TRO gives you more meat to chew on. Strategy
      plays a big factor (as does the new cloaking ability) and the Chinese units
      are interesting and fun to play as.


      Unsure of the reason for so many of the negative reviews. Just because it is
      "hard" does not make it a bad expansion. Certain missions have annoying sections,
      but the point of this port is to provide BZ players a remastered and improved
      copy of an expansion pack many missed out on playing. And the size of this expansion
      isn''t negligible either. You''re given two full-sized campaigns including an
      entirely new set of units. This is a bargain for the asking price (especially
      in the BZ98R + TRO bundle Rebellion has provided), nearly doubling the content
      of the original game.


      I highly recommend The Red Odyssey expansion to any fan of Battlezone, just
      be aware that it requires you to understand the deeper mechanics of the original
      game.'
