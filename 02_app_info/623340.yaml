    developer_response: "\nHey Outphased, thanks for the feedback!\n\nYour comments\
      \ about Stars End were really helpful to our team. You gave us valuable insight,\
      \ and we\u2019ve used your comments to make many changes. We\u2019d like to\
      \ ask for your help once again-- Stars End is almost at the Alpha stage of game\
      \ development and we finally feel like it\u2019s almost ready.\n\nThe new version\
      \ of Stars End includes a lot of changes: the environmental and character graphics\
      \ are SO much better than they were back when you first played the game. The\
      \ weird textures and animations have been completely re-vamped. In addition,\
      \ we\u2019ve added new enemies and creatures for you to interact with. Also,\
      \ we\u2019ve fixed many of the game\u2019s most frustrating glitches. \n\nFinally,\
      \ the horse-hoof sound is waaaaay more quiet (and realistic). A surprising number\
      \ of players complained about that, lol. \n\nAs I mentioned last time I contacted\
      \ you, our game dev team is really small. In the past we have struggled to keep\
      \ up with major studios due to our small size, but I finally feel like Stars\
      \ End is beginning to come together. In the coming months we\u2019re hoping\
      \ to figure out what direction Stars End will go in terms of storyline/focus,\
      \ so keep your eyes out for that!\n\nI really hope you\u2019ll consider joining\
      \ us again-- we\u2019d love to see you back in the game and hear your thoughts\
      \ on the latest & greatest Stars End build yet!\n\nCheers! Shoot me a message\
      \ if you have comments or concerns :) \n"

    review: "UPDATE Jan 5, 2021:\n\nPlayed this more than a year ago, devs constantly\
      \ asked for additional review of the title and I have to give them props for\
      \ the changes they've made. So this is for them, mostly.\nWe'll start with the\
      \ good. I will check back in periodically, and I\u2019ve decided to keep it\
      \ rather than refund. I did not play this long enough to see everything, as\
      \ it is there are enough issues from the beginning to fill a couple pages.\n\
      \n- I want to like this game. It scratches an itch that I think a lot of people\
      \ need scratching. The game plays much better, and I appreciate the change in\
      \ starting experience. It's a survival game, and that's how it starts, nice!\
      \ I entirely get the Firefly and space-western thing they've got going. I LOVE\
      \ that talking to the NPCs actually yields useful items, but those items should\
      \ be available through other means as well. If they're going for a mixed RPG\
      \ and survival game like Fallout or something, that's exactly what everyone\
      \ will compare it to. \n\n- Devs should be identifying what those games did\
      \ well, and integrating those mechanics or improving on them. It\u2019ll be\
      \ essential for success.\n\nTLDR; Overall, I do not recommend incomplete games\
      \ just because I see potential. The game could be arguably in an alpha state,\
      \ but fails at a lot of basic game design. Don't buy it unless you are cool\
      \ with funding the continued development of an indie title.\n\nOPPORTUNITIES:\n\
      \n- The game suffers from a \"what's the point\" style of gameplay. I start\
      \ in a beautiful, completely useless landing pod full of technology. Subnautica\
      \ did this better. \n\n- Looking around, I can scan for ALL resources immediately,\
      \ but I can literally see them in every direction for what feels like miles,\
      \ regardless if they're currently useful to me or not. Do I need to see sulfur?\
      \ What's the tech tree look like? Tutorialize me a little more, please. I don't\
      \ want to sit and read how to play your game for 20 minutes. That menu with\
      \ all the windows and instructions? TLDR.\n\nSOUND:\n\n- Music is wonderful,\
      \ but still no master volume controls? \n- Environment ambience is EXTREMELY\
      \ loud, and not just in volume. Rustling leaves and other intermittent sounds\
      \ do not meld with the music hardly at all, and drown it out all the time. \n\
      \nGRAPHICS & ART:\n\n- Oh boy, it is not optimized.\n\n- I have to be honest,\
      \ craftsmanship on the art assets is still more than a decade out of style.\
      \ Another review called it retro, which is putting it nicely. Using textures\
      \ which aren't tiling on something as massive as a spaceport structure is just\
      \ never going to fly. \n\n- You need to be using tiling textures and trim sheets\
      \ to maximize your resolution on these assets, while keeping texel density consistent\
      \ across the board. It's really underwhelming when something that looks like\
      \ it's supposed to be impressive... looks like it came from 2001.\nGo get up\
      \ to date on current environment art techniques.\n\n- LIGHTING & COLOR CUES!\
      \ Basic game design these days.\n\n- I ran into another massive window. It's\
      \ getting dark, and it's all lit up through some insanely huge window with no\
      \ glass. Took a second to see the itty-bitty unlit door right next to it. \n\
      \  - It's an airlock? cool. Not sure why, though. I'm not wearing a EV suit\
      \ and neither is anyone else. Think about WHY something is there.\nFrame rate\
      \ cut in half while looking at some structures. \n- This rich and perfectly\
      \ clean, MASSIVE spaceport is surrounded by old, rusted, abandoned and unmanned\
      \ ruins. I don't get that. It's also mostly empty?\n- The street signs are 4x\
      \ the size of a human being? Proportions are not normal.\n- Texel density is\
      \ all over the place. \n - Metal ruins textures are at least half the resolution\
      \ of the tree smashed right into the middle of it. Consider intersection points.\
      \ The spaceport ring is just... coming out of the landscape grass.\n- Lots of\
      \ issues with ground clutter. \n  * Foliage appears to be arranged in a grid,\
      \ which is obvious at range. The wilds look like sowed fields.\n  * Break it\
      \ up more, decrease the density. More rocks, other things on the ground with\
      \ clusters of foliage will look more natural. Look at a reference landscape.\
      \ Witcher 3 handles landscapes really well. \n- Rock detail-normals are strange,\
      \ they look like leather almost. Very loud up close. Things at eye level should\
      \ receive more attention, especially if you can harvest/interact with them.\n\
      - Looks like the entire environment is 100% procedural, which lacks polish.\
      \ Tree are clustered in forests, but all other assets seem to be spread out\
      \ evenly.\n\nOther random stuff:\n- NPCs cannot just be standing in one place\
      \ doing nothing. Unless you\u2019re making Pokemon. Or some other JRPG. \n-\
      \ Basically zero interpolation of animations. My character is not always walking\
      \ on a flat surface in a straight line. \n- Dialogue camera shift is jarring.\
      \ Just use something other games have done well, don\u2019t overthink it.\n\
      - Mining Pick hit and animation don't line up.\n- Minimize the dialogue spread\
      \ over the screen. Look at any other RPG with subtitles. NO ONE wants to look\
      \ from one side of their 32\" screen to the other to read something.\n- There\
      \ are small tool boxes and things that you can't open or interact with, but\
      \ are obviously things I should be able to loot from. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
      Original Review:\n\nAmbitious game! Good on the devs for trying their hand at\
      \ this. Honestly though, it's not ready for Early access. I enjoy the inventory\
      \ system and the overall idea. Seems like it could be really fun once there's\
      \ a truly playable build.\n\nGameplay:\n- Very buggy movement and interaction.\
      \ Waiting a full second before accessing a loot box is an odd mechanic. \n-\
      \ Got off my horse and was launched into space. \n- The Voice acting is cute,\
      \ if difficult to understand. The heavy use of country-folk colloquialisms seems\
      \ overdone.\n- VERY long runs through confusing space station-levels. Why do\
      \ I need to run all the way around a structure with hallway-sized windows that\
      \ have no apparent glass? Rethink your level design and consider more use of\
      \ lighting cues. \n\n\nSound:\n- Everything is SO LOUD, and the horse-hoof sound\
      \ effect cannot be shut off, even when all sound controls are put to \"0\".\n\
      \nGraphics:\n- Some areas look decently fleshed out, like the prologue area,\
      \ while much of the seems to lack environmental polish. \n- Craftsmanship on\
      \ a lot of the texture work feels incomplete, and poorly implemented. Cut lines\
      \ don't flow together. \n- The animations need a lot of work, and do not read\
      \ well at all. \n- Characters look very young, and feel disconnected from their\
      \ mature-sounding voices. \n\nAs it is right now? It's not in a place that I\
      \ would consider paying money for. It's a great idea and I personally hope to\
      \ see it get further. The current state is extremely rough, and a LOT more needs\
      \ to be worked out before I'd add it to my library."
