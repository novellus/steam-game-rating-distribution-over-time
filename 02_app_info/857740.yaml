    review: "What to say about Ludicrous Speed..\n\nIts damn AMAZING.\nGamers want\
      \ consistency, fluidity, functional controls, regular updates, and most of all,\
      \ a challenge which grows with their skill. Ludicrous Speed seems to have all\
      \ of these attributes present. I love that the player environments react to\
      \ whatever music I want to play. Keep in mind that this game is still in its\
      \ early stages, yet is still at the top of its performance in this genre. \n\
      \nDefinitely keep your eyes on this one. I can see some sweet advancements in\
      \ the near future. Regardless of which, Ludicrous Speed will not fail in providing\
      \ hours of challenging entertainment.\n\n-OG"
