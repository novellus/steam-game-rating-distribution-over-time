      \ Social Isolation!:</strong></h2><br>Hi, everyone!  The VR Health Institute\
      \ is shut down because of COVID19 (all the SFSU labs are closed), and so a group\
      \ of us inside the project have banded together to experiment with exercise\
      \ games. We want to work with the VR Fit community to explore interesting exercise\
      \ ideas in mini-games!  Hackathon, COVID19 style!  So try our free builds, and\
      \ then give us feedback and ideas - either here or at the r/vrfit subreddit.\
      \ <br><br>We're calling the project vrFit Adventures, a free platform we're\
      \ using to explore ideas for exercise games. It will start very small, with\
      \ an experimental 2D game experience called Reckoning Ave. Our goal is to be\
      \ simple, fast, fun, and creative.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Reckoning Ave:\
      \ COVID! Edition:</strong></h2>The first mini-game in vrFIT Adventures is still\
      \ in its early stages, ready for us to mold it in almost any direction based\
      \ on your feedback. Intended to eventually be part multiplayer action game,\
      \ part puzzle challenge, COVID! Edition is a 2D platformer in VR with 1-to-1\
      \ controls between you and your character. Move your head, body, and guns to\
      \ avoid coming in contact with obstacles, forcing you to move around, squat,\
      \ and dodge. Use bullet time, your guns, and your teleport ability to save the\
      \ world from a variety of levels and scenarios.<br><br>Expect the gameplay to\
      \ evolve rapidly - our goal is to incorporate community feedback as we get it.\
      \ :)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Current State:</strong></h2>This build is in\
      \ a deliberately raw state, with only a single mini-game as a placeholder to\
      \ build off of. Our goal is to put out a very early build and get quick feedback,\
      \ and then talk with the VR Fit community to figure out what to add next. Let's\
      \ take this social isolation and build a game together! The current game is\
      \ designed to be playable, but not robust. It has probably 5 minutes of typical\
      \ gameplay that is hopefully fun, and designed to be played repeatedly for a\
      \ 15 to 30 minute exercise session.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>What is built:</strong></h2><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Dodge mechanics designed for ducking and squatting, laying\
      \ the groundwork for different difficulties.<br></li><li>Basic gameplay mechanics\
      \ for dodging<br></li><li>A single gun weapon type<br></li><li>Teleport mechanics<br></li><li>Bullet\

      \ Project We Work On:</strong></h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>1. Gameplay\
      \ Comes Before Exercise:</strong> A good exercise experience is fun to play.\
      \ Never create crap gameplay because it's better exercise.<br></li><li><strong>2.\
      \ Utilize Our Expertise:</strong> Our expertise is in gaming and exercise, not\
      \ large development projects. Our focus will be on gameplay and creating fun,\
      \ engaging, and effective content that is also good exercise. Simple is better\
      \ than complex. Lots of Unity Store assets so we can make it pretty but not\
      \ perfect. We are failing if our scope gets too big.<br></li><li><strong>3.\
      \ Listen to Feedback:</strong> We want to invite the VR and exercise community\
      \ to participate in building these games together. Do you have ideas you wish\
      \ you could play while exercising, but not a developer? Feel free to join our\
      \ Discord and we'll be super enthusiastic to explore. :)<br><br>The trade-off\
      \ for being able to give small feedback is that the games will be shown off\
      \ while still being built.<br></li><li><strong>4. AI-Perfected Exercise:</strong>\
      \ One of the things that has us the most excited about VR and AR exercise is\
      \ the idea of games that know your physical state, and change on the fly as\
      \ a result. We'll talk more about this as we build it. But it's going to be\
      \ really cool. :)<br></li><li><strong>5. Engaging, Long-term Gameplay:</strong>\
      \ Good exercise comes from consistent use over time, and that comes from engaging\
      \ gameplay that keeps you connected over time. Explore ways to keep players\
      \ engaged, through storylines, exploration, diversity, and whatever else we\
      \ can think of.<br></li><li><strong>6. Explore Creatively:</strong> Don't be\
      \ afraid to try out things that fail in hope of finding something that unexpectedly\
      \ succeeds. </li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>How Can You Help?:</strong></h2>We\u2019\
      re glad you asked. This project is both an emerging area of academic research\
      \ and a passion project for most of the team members. Various graduate students,\
