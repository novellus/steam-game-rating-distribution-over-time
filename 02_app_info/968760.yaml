    about_the_game: "Dark Mist is a card game that combines elements of the roguelike\
      \ deckbuilder genre with enemies that appear in waves. Defeat monsters and level\
      \ up during battle to keep yourself going.<br><br>About this game: <br>\u25CF\
      \ Your health is equal to the number of cards in your deck. Every time you take\
      \ 1 damage, the enemy takes 1 card. If your deck is exhausted, the game ends.<br>\u25CF\
      \ Enemies come in rows of three (and later four). Carefully plan your attacks\
      \ to line up enemies and knock them down. Otherwise you may be overwhelmed.\
      \ You need to carefully determine the order of killing monsters, which will\
      \ impact on your later actions. Defeating enemies in a wise order will make\
      \ your later battles easier. Failure to do so may result in your sudden defeat.<br>\u25CF\
      There are three types of cards in the game: attacks, skills, and curses. Being\
      \ defensive is not an option against the the evils of the mist. Attack quickly\
      \ and desperately to survive.<br>\u25CF Gain exp and level up to add new cards\
      \ to your deck as you defeat monsters.<br>\u25CF We have prepared five classes\
      \ for you to experience. Each class has a different way of fighting, and each\
      \ requires exploration and experience to use effectively.<br>\u25CF More than\
      \ 300 cards, 20 events, 15 bosses, and 80 different kinds of monsters are available.<br>\u25CF\
