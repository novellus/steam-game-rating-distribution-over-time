      \ Inc. And in this world, where one company rules over video games with an iron\
      \ fist, it's up to one person to determine the fate of the world. Will you guide\
      \ Duncan on his way up the corporate ladder, bringing reform to this massive\
      \ monopoly? Or will you join the indie developers attempting to take them down\
      \ from the outside? Either way, you'll hack, slash or shoot your way through\
      \ a mysterious world, set in the future but living in the past. Explore and\
      \ interact with the dystopian residents, and fight using a modern turn-based\
      \ hack-and-slash system that will keep you in the fight. Allies follow your\
      \ commands most of the time, but they do tend to have a mind of their own. For\
      \ a wacky take on a classic genre, look no further than Coffee Runner 2.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nKey features:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Explore one of two different\

      \ to control 3 people anyway?<br />\r\n- Zany world to explore!<br />\r\n- Exclamation\
      \ points at the end of every feature!<br />\r\n- 0 Goats! We've finally done\

    review: It's rough around the edges but the charm shines through! Have only made
      it to the sewer level so far but I'm excited to keep playing. Has a very interesting
      idea with the two storylines!!
