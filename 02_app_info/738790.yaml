      \nImmediately hooked by the technology and its creative potential, we were eager\
      \ to produce the first VR short film at the Filmakademie.<br />\r\nAdvancing\
      \ our workflow for VR productions, we updated the project in 2015 to high-resolution,\
      \ omni-directional stereoscopic 3D and 60fps as well as spatial audio. <br />\r\
      \nIt was released shortly after our Sundance premiere in february 2016 on the\
