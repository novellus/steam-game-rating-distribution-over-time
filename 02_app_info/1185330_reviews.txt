The polish and little details really give it a charm that makes you want to replay it over and over. The mechanics of the game itself are similar to fighting genre games that reward footsies/neutral play. You should also understand that this game is DIFFICULT. The bosses take different strategies to defeat and you have to think about how you're going to approach it or you WILL die.\n\nThis is also a great game if you're into speedrunning! It has a good run time for a speedrun and lots of interesting visuals for the viewer. Getting the mechanics of the fights down feels very rewarding in the context of a speedrun. There are some speedruns on youtube that you can check out if you're interested. \n\nOverall I would rate this game a solid 8/10.\n100% worth your money!","timestamp_created":1609608462,"timestamp_updated":1609608500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwspKJ4vYCcbDlvwI="}
