You die here and there.  \nStory is meh. If you expect a great story this one is not for you.\n\nOverall I had fun, totally worth it on sale and if you want to support the devs, you can buy it for full price of course.\n\nP.S.: I recommend you to play with a controller because playing with keyboard can be a nightmare.","timestamp_created":1607900244,"timestamp_updated":1607900244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgtWUr/YCfKP8uQI="}
