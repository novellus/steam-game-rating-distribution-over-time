It's short. There's little variety from run to run. Most of the enemies in the game do the same thing. Most character builds play largely the same way. Still, that doesn't mean it's bad. If you go into it expecting a good coffee roguelike you can win on your third or fourth attempt and have a lot of fun playing, you'll likely have a good time. The design is tight and a few ideas like the vampire/human transformation and the light affecting you and enemies is interesting. Buy it. Give it a try. If you don't like it after 1.5 hours refund it.","timestamp_created":1606637930,"timestamp_updated":1606637930,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4ajFifYCccuFtQI="}
