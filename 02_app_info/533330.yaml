    about_the_game: "A childs mind can be quite innocent and yet troubling. Take control\
      \ of a young child as she spends the week away from her parents in a place away\
      \ from home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeep her safe and awake, as things there may\
      \ go bump in the night. These toys are out to play, but the question is are\
      \ they real or is this just the innocent mind of a child.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      You play as a young child, who is away from her parents as they are on a much\
      \ needed holiday. The young child has suffered from anxiety most of her life,\
      \ which leads to confusion and an      over active imagination. <br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nWhich leads to trouble for the character when the light goes out an\
      \ the moon comes out. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou must survive the nights an keep\
      \ your aniexty down, as through out the night you will experience the mind of\
      \ an over active childs imagination. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach night you may\
      \ encounter different types of creatures. But don't let their cuteness fool\
      \ you. As the higher you aniexty goes the harder things become. <br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nKeep her calm. Keep her safe. Keep her in the light."
