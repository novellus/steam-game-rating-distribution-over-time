The caverns themselves are fun and exciting. Tunneling to new caverns is slow paced, but relaxing. The game has improved frequently and the devs quickly fixed a couple bugs I was having.\n\nGameplay tips:\n\n1. Use stat points in the beginning on strength for capacity.\n\n2. Save often.\n\n3. Prioritize crafting pick axes and then weapons before any other items. Always carry at least a few spare pick axes because they break fast.\n\n4. Find a torch before tunneling to fully appreciate your tunnels.","timestamp_created":1559962200,"timestamp_updated":1560295763,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4w/23pOsCeOz7wgE="}
