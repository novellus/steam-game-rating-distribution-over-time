    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Welcome to Rico-Jump!</h2><br>Rico-Jump is
      a single-/multiplayer 3D-Platform racer, where you try to beat the leaderboard
      by skillfully maneuvering through a futuristic obstacle course.<br>The movement
      mechanics are similar to the popular e-Sport title &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;
      and should therefore be familiar to most people.<br>The concept of using the
      jump-pads and maneuvering mid-air is easy to learn, but be assured, it is hard
      to master.<br>A map editor offers the possibilities to create your own Rico-Jump
      courses to challange your friends and the world.<br><br>Additionally, it offers
      3 extra game modes, where you are able to throw balls at one another trying
      push other people off their platforms.<br>This is implemented as a Deathmatch-Mode
      as well as a Battle Royal-mode, with falling platforms.<br>The third game mode
      is a coop-based team-game.<br><br>This game is in early &quot;Early Access&quot;
      as I am developing it besides my full-time job as a hobby.<br>So expect some
      bugs and unpolished UI.<br><br>I hope you enjoy it and feel free to hit me up
      with your opinions and suggestions. :)<h2 class="bb_tag">Current Features</h2><ul
