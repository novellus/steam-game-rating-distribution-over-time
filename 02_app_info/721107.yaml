    review: "Since no one actually reviewed this Costume... \n\nI'll be the first...\
      \ \n\nAnd even though it's the Superior Spiderman's Costume... \n\nIt's a very\
      \ good one, love all the colors in it, but my fave was the final Color, the\
      \ Gold one... \n\nThe Gold one was suppose to be considered to be called the\
      \ Iron Spider, ^_- \n\nAs it's the one given to Peter by Tony Stark durring\
      \ the Civil War Arc., that sadly never \n\nmade it, into the movies, o_@ \n\n\
      I forgot if it was in Infinity War, but I do remember Peter getting a new Suit\
      \ by I think Tony Stark \n\nin that movie, I just can't remember if it was this\
      \ one, or not, o_@"
