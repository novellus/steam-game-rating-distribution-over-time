    review: "I like the idea of this game.  However, there's several frustrating things\
      \ about it.  First and foremost, the gameplay is very clunky.  It seems that\
      \ nothing snaps into where it should be.  I did several puzzles where the shapes\
      \ were put haphazardly in the general area where it was supposed to be but looked\
      \ very little like it should and the game indeed took it as a solved puzzle.\
      \  The VR environments (different rooms), were generic, but since you're focused\
      \ on the puzzle that really doesn't matter too much in this type of game.\n\n\
      And I never found a way to make things look nice (the finished puzzle).  I couldn't\
      \ turn without physically turning as the only options I saw in the conroller\
      \ was to teleport, grab and see the menu.  I would often have trouble grabbing\
      \ items.  The most frustrating part of the game was that sometimes I was just\
      \ getting a puzzle piece close to the others and it caused the whole thing to\
      \ collapse.  Plus puzzle pieces would fly back to their original placements\
      \ at the start.  \n\nI never found the puzzles themselves difficult, just the\
      \ process of putting them together because of the clunkiness.  I wasn't having\
      \ fun.  I have no idea why these puzzles are even put on the floor.  Why not\
      \ on a table so they are easier to grab and put down.  And you can grab items\
      \ at a distance, but I didn't see how to bring them closer to you.\n\nSo the\
      \ game is currently on sale for $2.39.  It's a very tough call.  I think this\
      \ can be a very nice game.  It's just not there yet.  Sorry, but I hope to change\
      \ my review with future updates that improve the gameplay.  \n\nRate 4.5/10"
