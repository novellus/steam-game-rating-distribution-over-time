That being said, It was a great concept and at the time was an advancement in the gaming world. I have tried several times over the years to revisit this and maybe run a round or 2 but everytime I would get into the lobby there was never anyone else playing, so a waste of my time. there isn't any solo option and as I just realized the game has been dropped from steam. so at this point the only purpose this game has is to add another number to my collection of games that just sit in my steam library never to be opened again.","timestamp_created":1301296138,"timestamp_updated":1603906694,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt72SuPUCdN3sDg=="}
