    review: The Neptune Pack wont please everybody. With it's tracks having a heavy
      emphasis on Aerial control, many players will find themselves frustrated when
      they don't land on target. On the upside, the Buran Team is a welcome addition
      to the limited ships on offer. Even with all of it's content though, I'd still
      get this one for sale unless you really wanna play with some new ships.
