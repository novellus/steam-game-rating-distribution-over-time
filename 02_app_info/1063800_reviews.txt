While the general idea of catching male bodily fluids with your character remains, it has little else in common with that. This plays far more like Kaboom as we control a single character and the gameplay is far faster.\n\nThat increased speed, alongside using a keyboard instead of a paddle does make it significantly more challenging than Beat 'Em. However, unlike that, our goal is not to shoot for the highest score possible. Our task is simply to survive 20 waves of throat yogurt, with only three being allowed for you to miss throughout.\n\nEasy mode has simple patterns and is something you'll be able to master relatively quickly if you have experience in this genre. The professional mode, on the other hand, is a far greater challenge and where you will be spending the majority of your time.\n\nAs for the sexual content, that is entirely separated from the actual gameplay. There is no nudity while lotioning our faces with baby batter and surviving all waves gets you nothing but a black screen saying congratulations. \n\nAll of the H aspects are found in the Gallery mode. They contain both static images and fully animated short clips. There is a decent amount, with more scheduled to come according to the devs. Nearly all of them feature your character and some previusly unseen red-headed female. For some reason, the male model is not used. It as all female on female intercourse here.\n\nYou get a good amount of content for a single dollar and it does scratch that Kaboom itch without having to break out the ol 2600 or fire up an emulator.  All of the H content is unlocked from the get-go if that is your main consideration for purchase. Not better than the originals by any means, but a fun distraction to waste an afternoon on.\n\nFor my full review, be sure to check out [url=http://www.336gamereviews.com/sexyhub-r18-review/]336GameReviews[/url]","timestamp_created":1587598792,"timestamp_updated":1587598931,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.634380578994750977","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w6aR0vECe5/nggI="}
