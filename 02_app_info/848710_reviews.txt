The Developers are very helpful as well, so we will look for more games from Dilly Frame in the future.  I got hung up on 21 Wave, but the developers showed me the reason, and I was able to complete the game afterward.  They still fix bugs in the game when you reveal them to the Developers.  This game appears to be bug-free now, so it can be completed without issues.\n\nAlso, there is a lot of depth to this game, and it is well worth the full asking price.  You can expect several hours of enjoyment before actually completing the game.  Replay is also fantastic, because you have several achievements that you can go back to unlock.  Superb game, guys!  Keep them coming.","timestamp_created":1579368919,"timestamp_updated":1579953098,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0eGi7u8Cf/nV7AE="}
