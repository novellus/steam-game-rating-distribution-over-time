      you play as a strong, independent left hand. Utilize your fingers and magical
      power of flight to complete different tasks: turn off the alarm clock, make
      a toast, get rid of secret documents, etc.<h2 class="bb_tag">Current features:</h2><ul

      happy) </li><li>Fly around and interact with different objects. </li><li>Different
      ways to complete every level. </li><li>Physics based gameplay. (May get wacky
      at times)</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Early access:</h2>Handy is not in its
      final form just yet. Plenty of content will be added to the game before it leaves
      early access and you can help make it better by: <br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Reporting
      bugs that you might encounter, </li><li> Giving your opinion on the current
      state of the game and what you would like to see in the future. </li><li> Telling
