Fits the game so well!**\n\nThis game is so good. From the cool graphics to the mechanics! Slaying elves this time of the year is something I always wanted to do and now I can within this game!\n\nThe overdrive weapons are amazing, Each of them are really unique and cool! The weapons you get, upgrade and find better ones makes the game go at a good pace!\n\nAnd I love the distraction items. The TV to the blowup dolls!\n\nbut lets not leave out the best part (To me)... The headbutting! Or as I like to call it, Headbanging!\n\nThis game is well worth the price and you will get lots of fun out of it :)","timestamp_created":1608651805,"timestamp_updated":1609649675,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r5um4/YCcMaZvAI="}
