    review: 'The basic gameplay involves reaching revenue targets to attract new salespeople,
      who are used to dominate new regions.  Eventually competing companies try to
      acquire your regions and you theirs, and research plays a factor in product
      superiority.  I like the tension created by reallocating salespeople to take
      over areas.  Then there are cards to play which aren''t immediately accessible
      until requisite resources from certain regions are built up.


      I bought this on sale for about $5.  No disappointment here!  Even without having
      read the manual, there are gameplay elements that are enjoyable and the basic
      premise has a great hook.  I can see continuing to play this for a while.  Yes
      of course the game could use improved graphics - but the gameplay is enjoyable
      and has a nice level of tension.  Recommended, though because the graphics are
      such crap and you might have some doubts whether the game is a keeper, wait
      for the sale price.  If you like economic sims already, it might be worth full
      price and hope for a refund if you don''t get hooked within the first hour of
      playing.


      - Game has bugs.  For example when winning an NDA lawsuit, getting a settlement
      larger than I think any company could have available  (2 orders of magnitude
      over).  Either this is a bug or the AI cheats very badly.'
