    review: This is an odd game I literally never would've found if I hadn't gotten
      a coupon crafting badges. This is a super simple high score based twin-stick/top
      down shooter. And it does what it tries really well and literally nothing else.
      It looks like a prototype unity game before it gets it's final graphics, considering
      what it is it's surprisingly difficult defiantly worth the 99 cents and especially
      so for the 34 or so cents I payed for it.
