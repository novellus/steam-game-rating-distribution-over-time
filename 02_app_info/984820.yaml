    review: "This game could be fun. But it's too heavy. It lags sometimes and the\
      \ controller has been missing quite a lot. I played all counter fight and this\
      \ one is the only one lagging a lot and I dropped alot of plates because the\
      \ grips just release or just wont hold. The tutorial is even worse lagging like\
      \ crazy. \nFor a reviewer that asked how to make cheese pizza, it actually quite\
      \ easy, just pour the cheese about 3 times as long as usual. \n\nGet the other\
      \ counter fight if u must. Just skip this one."
