The systems all seem straight-forward and quickly rewarding, which is exactly what I look for in this kind of game. The progression seems obvious once you spend a couple minutes with it, and it's easy to get off the ground. \n\nUnfortunately, there are two major flaws to this game that require me to recommend people stay away from it:\n- The planet never stops rotating. This is frankly quite annoying, because it becomes impossible to find the specific buildings you're looking for. It was really difficult for me to keep a mental map of what I had constructed, because there was no regular visual structure for me to remember. Honestly, it's a bit nauseating as well after a while.\n\n- There's no summary of your production and consumption per cycle. Even food focuses solely on consumption, rather than giving you an overview of your consumption vs production. This kind of thing drives me crazy, because it makes it impossible to optimize systems like that at a glance. This is even more glaring as you being to create more complex resource chains. Will my buildings be able to infinitely produce at an efficient rate? Guess I better click through several (difficult to locate due to aforementioned spinning) buildings and run some mental math.\n\n\nEven at the 50% sale I bought this game at, I can't justify continuing to play it, because the experience is more frustrating than not.","timestamp_created":1608784724,"timestamp_updated":1608784724,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgtjCyfYCeZbWvAI="}
