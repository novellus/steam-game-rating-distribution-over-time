    review: "So usually, i don't write reviews but considering this is one of the\
      \ best VNs i've played and it doesn't look like it got that much attention,\
      \ i really felt the need to.\n\nFirst of all, this first episode (which i hope\
      \ there will be more of) of Grand Kokoro has the perfect length. The story is\
      \ paced really well and the 5 hours passed very quick. This game doesn't have\
      \ many choices and none of them are affecting the progression - which is great\
      \ because i really grew tired of these VNs making you brute force all possible\
      \ paths for tens of hours to finally get the \"real\" ending.\n\nThat being\
      \ said, i completed this episode in one session because the story was really\
      \ engaging. Grand Kokro tells a story about friendship, love and trust, along\
      \ with metal illness and the \"bigger plot\" going on. It's a mix of great,\
      \ wholesome and sometimes funny moments, as well as the dark ones which - not\
      \ only once - managed to make me shed way too many tears. \n\nSome characters\
      \ are a bit on the stereotype-y side but never to the point where it gets annoying\
      \ and luckily these traits mostly are getting dropped as the story progresses.\
      \ Most characters are really well written, the dialouges feel like actual people\
      \ talking and their motivations are understandable. The protagonist - Elijah\
      \ Grand - was very relatable to me on a personal level and i was always feeling\
      \ what he felt (hence the tears).\n\nThe VN-framework Seram Studios have used\
      \ has a lot of flaws - for instance you cannot enable fullscreen, if you resize\
      \ the window, the texts and controls are buggy. This was only a minor inconvenience\
      \ for me, because i played it via Steam Link (which basically scales the window's\
      \ content to the tv's resolution). Otherwise you would have to find a way to\
      \ scale the VN to fullscreen without affecting the actual window's size - i\
      \ wouldnt know which software you could achieve that with.\n\nGiven the price\
      \ and the length, there are few reasons to not play/read Grand Kokoro, if you\
      \ are remotely into (BL) visual novels\nOne of the perfectly valid reasons to\
      \ not read it is that the VN is everything but light-heared and some its themes\
      \ may trigger you - please read the developer's description if you have known\
      \ triggers.\nI absolutely loved Grand Kokro (Ep. 1) and all that's left for\
      \ me now is waiting and hoping for the second episode."
