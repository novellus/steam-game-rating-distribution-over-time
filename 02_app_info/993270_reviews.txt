Most software I come across; comes with claims of what it can do, some of which bear out, some of which don't.. Usually I find myself happy if it even approaches what it implies it can do.\nI had seen a few tracks that looked as if they were spline created, but that also contained the terrain and sides of the road built exactly as far as tolerances and doing good UV work on them. I didn't know what they were created with., but I knew there was the possibility of good software that could do that. This is it.\nBuild your road, add your terrain sides, or walls, and then you can go further and add houses, trees, grass, and on and on.\nExcellent piece of software that will speed your game making times up. Love it. Great job.","timestamp_created":1609780485,"timestamp_updated":1609780485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uJuZ5/YCebC5wAI="}
