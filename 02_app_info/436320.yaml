    about_the_game: "Neo-Shinjuku - 2271. The massive and seemingly benevolent Eden\
      \ Corporation owns the world. The elite hacker resistance movement SyndiK8 has\
      \ unearthed the sinister reality behind Eden Corp\u2019s newest line of robotic\
      \ products. As one of SyndiK8\u2019s elite operatives, your mission is straightforward:\
      \ infiltrate Eden Tower, steal as much <i>Raw Data</i> as possible, and get\
      \ out alive--bringing Eden Corp down in your wake. <br><br>However, as the secrets\
      \ behind Chairman Shiro\u2019s new \u201CPromotion\u201D program becomes clear,\
      \ the reality gets much more complicated. Does it really grant immortality?\
      \ What is Eden truly collecting? It seems that Eden\u2019s corporate veneer\
      \ may be just a thin facade for something much, much worse.<br><br>Built from\
      \ the ground up for virtual reality, <i>Raw Data</i>\u2019s action combat gameplay,\
      \ intuitive controls, challenging enemies, and sci-fi atmosphere will completely\
      \ immerse you within the surreal environments of Eden Corp. Go solo\u2014or\
      \ team up with a friend\u2014and become the adrenaline-charged heroes of your\
      \ own futuristic technothriller. You will put your wits, boldness, and endurance\
      \ to the test.<br><br>Active VR gameplay turns you into a controller, with instant\
      \ reflex access to an arsenal of advanced weapons and cutting-edge nanotech\
      \ powers. Shared spaces with avatars and motion tracking encourage players to\
      \ physically communicate through body language and environment interaction.<br><br><u>Cool\

      \ Data: Hostile Takeover</i> lets you battle it out in up to 5v5 matches across\
