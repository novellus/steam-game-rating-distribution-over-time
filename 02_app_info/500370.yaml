      \ />\r\nThe new Orbit sector needs astronauts in order to build and populate\
      \ a huge space station. Players have to place the new Orbital Institutes in\
      \ their cities, as well as in the Arctic and Moon sectors to train their inhabitants\
      \ so they are ready for space. The three types of astronauts, Biologists, Physicists\
      \ and Engineers are important for the individual main focuses of the different\
      \ space station areas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nModular Space Expansion<br />\r\n\
      When entering the new Orbit sector, players will only have the station\u2019\
      s main module at hand. The more they progress; up to 12 different module types\
      \ can be unlocked. Each module has different requirements and fulfils different\
      \ needs. Build laboratories like the Agriculture Chambers and support them with\
      \ maintenance modules such as the Artificial G-Lab. The possibilities of building\
      \ the space station are numerous and challenging and players must once again\

      \ all other regions in the game. There are around 75 bonus effects to be explored,\
      \ and players can\u2019t use all of them at the same time. Thus, finding the\
      \ best combination is crucial in order to be a successful city-planner."
