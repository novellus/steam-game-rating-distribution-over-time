    review: Slow as hell and the puzzles are irritating. Old school point and click,
      you move around the map a frame at a time which is a pain when you need to move
      between rooms. I swear that of the 3 hours of game play at least 2 hours is
      just clicking and waiting for it to move forward an inch.
