    review: "Much too hard for its own good. I don't see it being a game I get back\
      \ often. I thought it would be cool to play on my arcade cabinet but it's just\
      \ too hard to control. Even on a keyboard the game is uncontrollable.\nI like\
      \ the concept and for a dollar it's ok to get just to try it but don't expect\
      \ more than 30 minutes of trying to get somewhere. \nI dislike the lack of options,\
      \ no monitor or graphical settings, cannot rebind your controller keys (you\
      \ can use Steam's controller configuration at least), cannot play on a vertical\
      \ monitor. That means the playfield is very small because of the cabinet around\
      \ the game. \nI like the graphics and simple layout but that's it."
