    about_the_game: "Electro-Motive Division\u2019s powerful SD50 comes to Train Simulator\
      \ from Digital Train Model.<br><br>The SD50 from General Motors Electro-Motive\
      \ Division was produced to counter increasingly tough competition from GE Transportation\
      \ Systems\u2019 Dash 7 line, which was proving to be successful with US railroads.\
      \ Whilst EMD\u2019s SD40-2 was more reliable, GE\u2019s line included locomotives\
      \ up to 3,600hp (2,685kW) with more modern technology.<br><br>EMD\u2019s had\
      \ already established a track record for producing 3,600hp locomotives, with\
      \ the SD45 and SD45-2; however, demand for these gas guzzlers dropped sharply\
      \ after the 1970s fuel crises. The SD50 was heavily updated, with a new V16\
      \ engine uprated with more horsepower. Unfortunately, this proved to be an unsuccessful\
      \ move as the 50 series models were plagued by engine and electrical system\
      \ problems.<br><br>The SD50\u2019s long hood saw changes from previous EMD models;\
      \ the overall frame length was increased, and the long hood was made substantially\
      \ longer. Resistors for the dynamic brake grid were also moved to a new, cooler\
      \ location in front of the engine compartment air intakes, thereby simplifying\
      \ the prime mover maintenance procedures, and the electrical system as well.<br><br>The\
      \ EMD SD50 for Train Simulator, developed by Digital Train Model, is available\
      \ in Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad livery and features engine start/stop,\
      \ dynamic brakes, front and rear headlights, numberboard lights, class lights\
      \ and step lights.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving\
      \ you the freedom to drive the D&amp;RGW SD50 on any Quick Drive enabled route\

    review: '- In-cab dynamic brake ''running'' sound starts immediately instead of
      after the ''power-up'' sound when the handle is engaged. No external dynamic
      braking sound, or it at least doesn''t play consistently.

      - Livery looks pixelated on the ends, like it was drawn at a very low resolution
      and scaled up.

      - Top speed of 64.2 mph. In reality these were geared for at least 70 mph.

      - Headlight flare disappears when the camera moves close to it.


      ~ Horn sound has an abrupt transition between the ''start'' and ''loop'' sound
      clips, but it doesn''t sound bad, just like it has a high pressure threshold
      before it ''opens''.

      ~ No extra stock and no loco variations (including no snowed-over model in winter);
      very sparse for a DTM release but not abnormal compared to other developers.


      + Excellent engine sounds.

      + Opening the engineer''s door affects outside noise.'
