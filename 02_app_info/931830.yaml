    review: 'edit: this game still rules if you need to chill and are also not a big
      baby


      this is really something. i feel like this is more like i wanted out of Proteus
      but never got - still tons of music, but lots of little interactables everywhere
      with which to fiddle until you get the environment Perfect. you will probably
      accidentally click through a sound you thought was great and can''t find it
      again, but it''s okay, there''s always more.


      a fun thing: try to retrace your steps. You can click the sun to stop all the
      music (the sun gets lower in the sky for each pedestal you activate making it
      easier to find), but when it''s time to move on, try figuring out the order
      you turned the pedestals on, deconstructing the tune until you''re back to the
      first sound you chose.
