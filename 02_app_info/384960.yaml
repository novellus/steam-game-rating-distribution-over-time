    review: I am positive that this game could be an amazing but it needs TONS of
      work. Gunplay is pretty good, Visuals are ok but I noticed that sometimes player
      models would go stiff while sliding around, spawns on small maps are god awful,
      and TTK is a little high but that seems to be a counter for the spawns being
      so bad. Oh and the game is dead. when I first opened the game there was a single
      server with only 1 human player. Bot enemies were ok at best.
