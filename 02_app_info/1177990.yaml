    review: This one is a good time managment. Story is quite good too, it's about
      two girls who meet under  funny circumstances. Turns out that they have the
      same surname. Later they end up in a remote small city where that particular
      surname is very well known. The only sad thing that story end on a cliffhanger
      and I have doubts we'll see the end of that story.
