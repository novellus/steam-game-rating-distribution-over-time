    review: 'I am late...


      i see a nice kingdome ahead


      all so polished and so glorious


      yet now is night

      the end has come

      they say we need a miracle


      i love this dimension i keep it treasured within my heart


      sad that i should let go


      it is in such galore such shineing armor yet


      noone can reatch it


      it is empty holow


      only some reside here


      out of all my heart dont give up


      use all of the embers you have all of the ash can remain


      just dont let it die out.


      when time tells you night is here


      just light up the night like your life depends on it.


      this is my review a story some insight of my vision

      i''d sell my soul for an update'
