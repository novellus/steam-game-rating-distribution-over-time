    review: "I would feel bad writing a bad review, since he/she's an indie developer,\
      \ but I've not enjoyed the game.\n\nBasically, you're paying someone to offend\
      \ you.\nThe offenses and curses remain in part even if you specify in the settings\
      \ that you don't want that.\n\nThe game simulates some complex mechanics, but\
      \ the pixalate interface doesn't make playing very comfortable.\n\nJust to unlock\
      \ basic functions you have to play for days, or take loans with absurd rates.\n\
      \nI feel like 10\u20AC is too much, but for 2\u20AC it would be a cool game."
