    review: 'I actually got recommended this game by my college tutor. One of his
      former students made this as a project for HIS class with his father. I kept
      my standards low with that knowledge, but the game''s unfortunately bad even
      by those.


      -The window formatting is hot garbage on any resolution besides the max; the
      screen just crops out, rendering some menu buttons unusable on a low-enough
      setting.

      -The combat is way too unfair even on Easy. I only made it as far as the third
      major "boss" in the game before dying, on my FIFTH TRY. They also show an intro
      (as well as admittedly-funny names and grave pics), but never where they come
      from. I usually just resort to button-mashing in their general direction when
      they''re already on me.

      -Visuals and audio aren''t the best. I mean that as in; they seem to be patchwork.
      Just stock assets slapped on there without enough care, and sub-par voice work.
      This is a minor gripe, though.

      -THE WORST PROBLEM: ABYSMAL FRAME RATE!! Because you''re essentially FORCED
      to play at max resolution, even if on Windowed mode, my game only consisted
      of (est) 3-5 FPS. The button-mashing was caused by that problem, and I couldn''t
      properly see where I was going or what I was doing AT ALL.


      As a fellow Game Design Major, I WANT to like this game, even if it''s just
      a college project. And I hope the student got a good grade on this. But as a
      marketable game, this is an absolute joke. The guy definitely has admirable
      passion, but REALLY needs to get more experience before he can even HOPE to
      put something on Steam properly. Good thing it only costs $3 USD, so it''s not
      much of a waste.


      1/5 Stars from me. I wish the guy luck in his career, but PLEASE REFINE YOURSELF
      BETTER FIRST!!'
