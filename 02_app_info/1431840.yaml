    review: SUPER fun Match 3 game!  It has all of the standard eFunSoft Match 3 mechanics
      set inside a mystery to solve.  Instead of solving levels to upgrade your Castle/Village/etc,
      you solve levels to get access to clues that will hopefully help to solve the
      mystery.  Getting clues sometimes leads to fun mini-games like HOG or Match
      pairs.  The mystery solving aspect really makes the game interesting.
