    review: "it was a good game but i do have some slight critizims \n\n1 put more\
      \ batteries in the house or make it more apparent that you only need the flashlight\
      \ for EXTREMELY dark rooms, i had to restart the game because i couldn't progress\
      \ without the light\n2 consider putting in the warning that this game does contain\
      \ mentions and depictions of s*icide even though it is a pixelated game. \n\
      beyond that i bought this at a discount and thought it was worth the price,\
      \ the atmosphere is spooky and disconserning as hell and the story was great.\
      \ would love a sequel"
