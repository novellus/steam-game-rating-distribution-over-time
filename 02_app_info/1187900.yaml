    review: 'A fun game about the quest to get our free milkshake back.

      I like a lot the animation of the player rays and the bosses design, the normal
      enemies are ok but too many t-rex

      the game music works well with the game too

      Stages are  very open so you  usually have some good routes to follow, even
      some secret ones


      funny game'
