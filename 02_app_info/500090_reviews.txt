For example, there are multiple types of locomotion that I've never seen implemented in other VR games (hamster ball, throwing a hammer, riding a dragon with reigns).  I applaud the creativity and bravery to explore untried things in VR than to make tried and true things. This reminds me of the VR scene from the Oculus DK1 days when devs would make interesting things just to make interesting things. I miss those days. I'll gladly support experimental things like this over the \"safe\" stuff any day. \n","timestamp_created":1587859701,"timestamp_updated":1587859701,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40If02fECcKPAgwI="}
