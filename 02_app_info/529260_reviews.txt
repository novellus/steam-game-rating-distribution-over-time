The Mixed Reality feature is working and looks perfect in this game, as you freely move around in your roomscale area, shoot robots, hide behind objects and defend yourself in constant action. I really think Robot Incursion deserves more attention!\n\nRobot Incursion is a single player game (so far) and you play as a soldier defending your base, your teammates and of course yourself agains evil robots, space ships and creatures in a beautiful future-inspired environment. Being an early access title, Robot Incursion already contains plenty of different areas to play within, all of them with unique atmosphere, weather conditions, varied enemies and som impressive and detailed graphics and physics.\n\nThe control system in Robot Incursion is really awesome, as you manually pick up, reload and hold the weapons with the Vive motion controllers and that really gives you total feeling of presence in VR. Standing and controlling the big turret weapon, or fireing off the Assault Rifle is something you just have to try out! \n\nRobit Incursion includes a simple training tutorial that lets let you practice your weapon handling before you move out and start playing this VR experience. AI and level of difficulty is quite high, and it really is a challenge to make it more than a few minutes on each wave/map/level. Well, I like this game and I hope more content, weapons and maps will be added soon. \n\nI will update my review when more time is spent on the game, and when more content is added. For now, Im recommending this game for all of you that likes wave-shooter FPS games, just give it a try - it IS nice! :)\n\n","timestamp_created":1480082242,"timestamp_updated":1480082242,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493575423955917358","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwndfxzdgCcrjfaA=="}
