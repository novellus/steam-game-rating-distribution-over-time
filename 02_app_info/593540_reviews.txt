The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGame Audio\n\nI want to mention that the audio in the game is well done even if it is simplistic and somewhat repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThis is a time management strategy game, where careful planning is required, due to the limited amount of resources that are available; hence the words \"management\" and \"strategy.\"\n\nThere are three game difficulty modes to choose from: Relaxed; Normal and Professional. The difference between these game difficulty modes: timer speed and scoring. In relaxed mode there is no timer and scoring. In casual mode, there is a timer and scoring, but the timer is slow to drain and scoring is low. In expert mode, there is a timer and scoring, but the time drains rather quickly and scoring is much higher.\n\nThe star and score rating depends on a couple of factors: How fast the level was completed. How much resources are leftover. This only applies to the casual and expert mode. The star rating system: Three Stars (Gold;) Two Stars (Sliver) and One Star (Bronze.) There is an opportunity to replay all the levels for better scoring and star rating.\n\nThere are a few special bonuses: Freeze Time; Worker Movement; Worker Speed; Additional Worker and Addition Resources. All of these special bonuses have a time limit. But they can be used once the bar has been filled up. These bonuses are extremely useful when the game is being played on expert mode.\n\nThere are twenty-eight different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need to be completed before they can be unlocked.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThere is an extra feature included in the game: Wallpapers. There are six different wallpapers; they can be accessed through the game's main menu screen.\n\nThere are eight different trading cards to collect. Only four of those trading cards are given out by the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading cards: Purchased from the Steam's Community Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and its Booster Pack Creator.\n\nFinal thoughts: I do not think that this game has much of a replay value to it. If you are into time management strategy games. Then you might find this game somewhat enjoyable to a certain extent.","timestamp_created":1602004656,"timestamp_updated":1605749193,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546723663806915283","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4koeH7/UCeZ2gpgI="}
