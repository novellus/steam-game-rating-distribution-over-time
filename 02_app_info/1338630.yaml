    review: "Original take:\n\nThis is a fun idea that is executed poorly.  The AI\
      \ on these is somehow even worse than regular dwarves.  The hover-guy routinely\
      \ gets stuck on everything - which is absurd since he can fly.  The werewolf\
      \ is somehow a worse fighter than regular dwarves, and regularly gets stuck\
      \ trying to find his way to... anything.  I've had to manually save him from\
      \ basic things like spiders on more than one occasion.  I've only tried one\
      \ other so far, a mage, and I ended up restarting the game for an unrelated\
      \ reason, so I don't have any way to tell if they're any better than the other\
      \ two I've tried thus far, but I somehow doubt it.\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nSome of the\
      \ heroes are so over-powered they make this worth the two bucks, even though\
      \ there are some heroes you'll NEVER want to make.\n\n    Example 1:  The guy\
      \ that makes portals will cast the spell that gathers up all the materials on\
      \ the floor - that's insanely useful.  \n\n    Example 2:  The dryad that walks\
      \ around and makes trees is really handy as well.\n\n\nI still haven't crafted\
      \ them all, but for the price, the amount of stupidly good utility they provide\
      \ does make it worth it--provided you either NEVER craft some of the heroes,\
      \ or you are prepared to babysit the stupid ones."
