The hidden object scenes are okay, but the point and click adventure part has some pixel hunting and there is no instant travel map or even a regular map. The setting is 19th century New Orleans where you have to save the city from evil forces that use voodoo. Fortunately, you have begun learning voodoo yourself and are able to pick up a few spells along the way. It’s an interesting premise, but I’ll go with a thumbs down because the story is incomplete. The game ends on a cliffhanger and they never made a sequel. \n\nThis game was released in 2011 and runs okay under Windows 10. The version sold on Steam is the ordinary edition, not the collectors’ edition with a bonus chapter. The bonus chapter was added in the middle though, so both versions have the same cliffhanger ending.","timestamp_created":1604313362,"timestamp_updated":1604313362,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540636062622070313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5eWhxPUCdqPiqwI="}
