Jump, roll, kick the ball and even your foes to achieve the victory. Dive in a frenetic match with your friends!","supported_languages":"English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain","reviews":"“Improbable Soccer is still in its infancy and shows something to file. In any case, it can potentially be a really interesting title because it offers a light-hearted version of football. The gameplay suitable for everyone is simple, immediate and direct. You don't have to be a football fan to enjoy this title: the rules are simple, run, move, roll, jump, hit the ball and score.  The title offers the best of itself when played in the company both in presence and online and it is clear that with the necessary precautions, Cyberlab Studios can aim high. It goes without saying that we await further updates on gameplay and content. We are sure that with some adjustments we could talk about something sensational.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.ilvideogioco.com\/2020\/07\/12\/improbable-soccer-e-disponibile-su-steam\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >IlVideogioco<\/a><br><br>“The gaming experience at the moment is limited because it is a bit cumbersome to have fun in company, but the good thing is that with remote play it is not necessary for everyone to have the game. Undeniably, it's still an incomplete product and needs some tweaking (and updating), but the base is good and has a lot of potential. Playing alone can become a bit repetitive in a matter of minutes, but if you have someone to involve, laughter and fun are guaranteed, even if you miss an empty goal or score an own goal.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.gamingitaliano.it\/2020\/07\/12\/improbable-soccer-provato\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gaming Italiano<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1314500\/header.jpg?t=1599733797","website":"https:\/\/playimprobablesoccer.com","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br><\/li><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows XP\/Vista\/7\/8\/8.1\/10 x86 and x64<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel Core2 Duo E6750 (2 * 2660) or equivalent | AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core 6000+ (2 * 3000) or equivalent<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 1 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> GeForce GT 740 (2048 MB) or equivalent | Radeon HD 5770 (1024 MB)<br><\/li><li><strong>Network:<\/strong> Broadband Internet connection<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 500 MB available space<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br><\/li><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> 7\/8\/8.1\/10 x86 and x64<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel Core2 Quad Q9300 (4 * 2500) or equivalent | AMD A10-5800K APU (4*3800) or equivalent<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 2 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> GeForce GTX 460 (1024 MB) or equivalent | Radeon HD 7770 (1024 MB)<br><\/li><li><strong>Network:<\/strong> Broadband Internet connection<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 500 MB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>"},"developers":["CyberLab Studios"],"publishers":["CyberLab Studios"],"price_overview":{"currency":"USD","initial":399,"final":319,"discount_percent":20,"initial_formatted":"$3.99","final_formatted":"$3.19"},"packages":[458859],"package_groups":[{"name":"default","title":"Buy Improbable Soccer","description":"","selection_text":"Select a purchase option","save_text":"","display_type":0,"is_recurring_subscription":"false","subs":[{"packageid":458859,"percent_savings_text":"-20% ","percent_savings":0,"option_text":"Improbable Soccer -
