Starting of with the game i could not even hit the ball at first when it seemed like i was hitting it to fix this i slowed my self physically playing  and slowed the ball speed which really helped now im loving the game, The actual mechanics of batting is awesome my whole family loves this game. The graphics are ok, You can defentley  see whats happening and can actually play But There not good graphics by any means just ok, \nI truly do love this game because of the simpleness of it and the fact you can bat and hit balls, its fun And most importantly its cheap, 8/10 \n(I play this game when i have no idea what to play on VR next and for the little time i play it i have a blast)","timestamp_created":1589177556,"timestamp_updated":1589177556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwqOXgfICcrz+hgI="}
