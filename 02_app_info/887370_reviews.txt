Well that would be ok I guess, but you only do 10 damage and leave cover. Leaving the next turn for all the enimes to do 20+ damage each to your character.  This is a far cry from any tactical game I have played, don't want to play this game ever again.","timestamp_created":1609719430,"timestamp_updated":1609719430,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt6ew5fYCdu6ewAI="}
