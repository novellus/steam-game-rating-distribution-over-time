It's basically an old-school text adventure just like Infocom used to make them, except with weird pictures and cool music (so maybe a bit more like Level 9, Legend or Magnetic Scrolls used to make them), a ton of jokes, some violence and a strange & somewhat grindy RPG-lite cryptid-fighting minigame. I don't think I'd recommend this to complete newcomers â€“ it's got some rough edges and tricky puzzles, so you should probably be somewhat comfortable with the genre before trying it.\n\nBut I played it for almost 20 hours, had a ton of fun with it, and now I'm sad that it's over. Oh well.","timestamp_created":1539802224,"timestamp_updated":1539802224,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.623279154300689697","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2KrXweYCd/HtrAE="}
