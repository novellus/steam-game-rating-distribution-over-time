    about_the_game: "The Galaxicus MMO is equal parts space exploration, space combat,\
      \ and planetary and empire building. The universe resets every four weeks, making\
      \ it possible for you to play and succeed across successive campaigns regardless\
      \ of your skill level. You play along with up to 10,000 other players, each\
      \ managing colonies while battling seamlessly across about 2.6 billion square\
      \ light years of space. Your ship can travel through normal and hyperspace.<br\
      \ />\r\n <br />\r\nYou and every other player begins each four-week Galaxicus\
      \ war the same: you use a scout-class spaceship to explore the galaxy. By leaving\
      \ the safety of the Imperial system, you build your own unique empire by exploring,\
      \ establishing planetary colonies, and capturing colonies begun by rival players.\
      \ Anyone you encounter within the game will become an ally, a rival, or possibly,\
      \ in time, a vital teammate.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nGalaxicus has three regions\
      \ and each defines your level of commitment to the game:<br />\r\n <br />\r\n\
      1.      In CORE SPACE, you play a game that requires minimum commitment (ideal\
      \ if you have a life outside of Galaxicus).<br />\r\n <br />\r\n2.      In RIM\
      \ SPACE, a lot more happens. Weapons are hot, ships can attack you, and you\
      \ can pillage planets, but not capture them.<br />\r\n <br />\r\n3.      In\
      \ FRONTIER SPACE, you\u2019re ALL IN. Leave your free time at the airlock!<br\
      \ />\r\n <br />\r\nRegardless of the region you choose to play in, there\u2019\
      s a universe of stars to explore and each contains planets that you can orbit\
      \ (or bypass). You can colonize or mine planets; maybe do both. It\u2019s up\
      \ to you. You can trade goods, rebuild your ship, and bank resources at any\
      \ of the four Imperial bases that exist in each region.<br />\r\n <br />\r\n\
      Your ideal goal is to balance space combat and colony building. That\u2019s\
      \ how you build your empire. You balance your fleet of ships by using modular\
      \ components to construct combat ships, freighters and carriers. Your registry\
      \ of ships lets you carry fighters and personnel to plant your banner on distant\
      \ star systems. However, don\u2019t forget to leave builders, miners, and harvesters\
      \ back home or your attackers will run low on vital resources.<br />\r\n <br\
      \ />\r\nYou will quickly find that playing Galaxicus as a team makes it the\
      \ best game going. Teams can more quickly explore space and evenly distribute\
      \ the diverse knowledge gained. Strong members help less experienced colleagues\
      \ to rapidly pick up valuable skills. History shows that a well-balanced group\
      \ playing the game as a team stands a much better chance of entering and winning\
      \ the annual War of the Galaxies competition."
