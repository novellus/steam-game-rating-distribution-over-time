Simple in design, elegant in execution. Explore a small grid of connected rooms - scavenging weapons and items to take on the great evil lurking within. The easiest games are when you don’t find the Maleficus until late in your exploration; but the most exhilarating game is when you find it early. Heart pounding as fast as your fingers on the keyboard, moving from room to room as the beast lurches after you, finding just enough items to defeat the lesser monsters in your way as you frantically flee, until you’ve scavenged enough to turn and fight.","timestamp_created":1603887446,"timestamp_updated":1603887446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513618707656860352","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/4bJt/UCcsTQqgI="}
