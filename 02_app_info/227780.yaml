    review: 'What is Serious Sam Classics: Revolution ?


      Revolution picks both of the Classic versions (not the HD remakes) of the first
      two serious sam games and combines them into a single game with a few changes
      and more customization, thats pretty much it, the thing is I see no reason to
      waste your time with this version, if someone wants to try the first two serious
      sam games the HD version is still pretty good and the improved visuals just
      make it more modern and better-looking overall plus its much easier there to
      set your server to play with a friend but for someone who just want to experience
      the older style of the Classic versions they can go just play them instead because
      they still stand out pretty well even today, this standalone release is just
      useless and sometimes even more glitchy, I also found that setting servers here
      to be much more unstable, I was getting DCs all the time or having other weird
      issues while I never had any trouble with any of the other Serious Sam games
      when playing online and Ive played all of them, the only thing that this standalone
      release brings is a new campaign called bright island that just sucks with horrible
      level design, poorly designed enemy encounters and crappy balancing which I
      dont recommend playing at all when you have so many better fanmade maps, Revolution
      is just a useless release that should be skipped, pretty much that.'
