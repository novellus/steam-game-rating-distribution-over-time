I gotta hand it to Beomgi-nim for doing such an ethusiastic playful performance, you really feel that having fun with Tei.\nSo if you want experience what it is like going on a date with Tei and see more of his amusing and teasing sides, you would be thoroughly satisfied with all the crazy stupidly doting advance [spoiler] yanDERE [/spoiler]  things we love about him. \nSadly no implied naughtiness involved but  we can all imagine ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\nI very much recommend this DLC to people who love Tei as a character or his voice XD","timestamp_created":1531103881,"timestamp_updated":1531105814,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw35TBvuQCfqrOpQE="}
