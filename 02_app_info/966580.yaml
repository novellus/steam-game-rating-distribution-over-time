    reviews: "\u201CZquirrels Jump is a cute arcade indie game, its challenging (dexterity\

      A cute arcade game that makes you sweat. You're playing as a squirrel, trying\
      \ to save as many nuts as you can before they hit the ground. Very stylish art\
      \ graphics,a bunch of levels. Pleasant pastime.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33823615-Worldwide-Reviews/\"\

      I was surprised how a casual game like this could be so relaxing. It was like\
      \ you watching a cartoon and trying to avoid the obstacles at the same time.\
      \ Nothing hardcore here.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32983008-Biggest-%24team-Mafia/\"\
