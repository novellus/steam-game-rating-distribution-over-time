    review: 'I wish I''d discovered these games sooner. This is a really fun combo
      of final fantasy tactics inspired job/class progression, turn based combat and
      giving you a world with multiple pathways to explore in the order of your choice
      with little to no handholding (but hints on which area is next on the difficulty
      ladder if you specifically ask NPCS for it, otherwise they just let you explore).


      The world has some pretty unique interaction that I don''t see very often in
      RPGs. I think it''s fun to discover what and how so I don''t want to spoil it
      with too many examples, but the skills, weapons and items you find can be used
      outside of combat to interact with the world and help you make new pathways
      through the various areas you explore. Some of the hub areas also competently
      loop around into themselves with unlockable shortcuts.


      The story is very light but it''s competently written and clear and given the
      game is more about exploring and fighting I think this is the right fit.


      This game really creatively uses the things that have inspired it and I highly
      recommend it if you enjoy turnbased rpgs or FFT style mix and match job progression.
      :)'
