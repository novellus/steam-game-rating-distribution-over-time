    review: "The devs have just announced that they intend to use deliberately unfair\
      \ matchmaking to \"allow for more comfortable gameplay\" for people who purchase\
      \ \"Battle Hardened status\" (previously just an economic bonus) for their vehicles\
      \ with premium currency.\n\nYes, they actually publicly announced deliberately\
      \ broken matchmaking and they are trying to sell it as a feature.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/games/ArmoredWarfare/announcements/detail/2753341279118232121\n\
      \nOn a more personal note, after sinking more than 800 hours and a huge amount\
      \ of money into Armored Warfare (buying premium tanks for both myself and others)\
      \  I was permanently banned from the forums politely pointing out that the Community\
      \ Manager made some mistakes in his very sloppy article about the Korean K2\
      \ tank.\n\n\"Silent Stalker\" the Steam Community Manager wrote a very bad article\
      \ about the Korean K2 tank which contained clear factual errors (such as his\
      \ claim that the license-built Rheinmetall gun was NOT a licensed design but\
      \ was actually designed in Korea.)\n\nhttps://aw.my.games/en/news/general/black-panther\n\
      \nWhen I politely pointed out that this was incorrect since the gun was actually\
      \ licensed from Rheinmetall in Germany, he doubled down on his mistake by adding\
      \ that the American M68 cannon used on the M-60 was an indigenous American development\
      \ rather than a modification of a Royal Ordinance L7. \n\nAfter I politely pointed\
      \ out this mistake making sure to praise his other articles, he became very\
      \ hostile and started rudely locking all the threads I posted in. He also deleted\
      \ all the comments on his bad article about the K2 though I saved a screenshot\
      \ of myself correcting him before he did so.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2126034055\n\
      \nAfter I made a post pointing out that it is kind of rude to just post \"no\"\
      \ and then lock the thread when a customer suggests something (I had suggested\
      \ adding the T-34-85 to the game) he perma-banned me for \"spamming.\"\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2125956158\n\
      \nA live-service game is only as good as the people working for the company\
      \ and now that I know the caliber of the people working for this particular\
      \ project, I wouldn't recommend it.\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nThe ban was removed... from\
      \ Steam by someone working for Valve... but I am now banned from the AW Discord\
      \ after I made the mistake of asking the mod \"Soren\" for help with the Steam\
      \ ban. Soren is not even pretending to be decent as you can see. He even brazenly\
      \ put \"Thanks for the feedback\" as the reason for the ban.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2127547497\n\
      \nSo yeah, Steam is good but My.games is staffed by morons who treat their customers\
      \ like dirt... That means that their games probably won't last much longer.\
      \ Save your time and money. \n\nOld Review:\n\nI originally bought this purely\
      \ because I wanted to support the devs. If you like the way it looks, get it.\
      \ If not, don't get it because you can't change the paint.\n\nIn terms of gameplay,\
      \ it's exactly like the T-72A you get by playing the game.  I guess that's kind\
      \ of a good thing but you can't use it to unlock other tanks since it is outside\
      \ of the tech tree so in practice, I rarely use it since I feel like I am wasting\
      \ my time if I am not progressing in a tech tree."
