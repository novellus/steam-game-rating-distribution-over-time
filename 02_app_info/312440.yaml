    review: 'A turned based, tactics game set in the future with a very Space Hulk
      vibe, but fighting against machines instead.  It has some pretty cool mechanics
      with force grenades, suppression fire, auto fire, leadership, running/walking/standing
      still, etc.  So the tactical battles had a lot of potential but is let down
      with a very random feel.  I have no problem with random but this just feels
      more random than most games.  High odds are basically 50% or maybe 66% only
      so you will be missing a lot and so will your enemies.  With the small number
      of units involved, you will often feel like you win or lose more because of
      luck then because of good tactics unfortunately.  This really hurts the game.


      Beyond that, the game is extremely short with almost no story to hold it together.  Steam
      says I played almost 10 hours but that is incorrect as I forgot and left the
      launcher running a few times, 2 of those were pretty long.  So maybe 8 hours
      only and that is with the very long 2-3 hour tutorial (which is needed).


      Not much to say beyond that.  Just that there is not much variety with with
      only 2 enemy unit types and objectives of basically kill stuff, move to an area
      or carry something to an area.


      The game isn''t bad or anything, but I can''t recommend this with the short
      running time and very random feeling scenarios.'
