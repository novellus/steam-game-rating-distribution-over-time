Once you've assigned or guessed three entities correctly, they're verified and locked in. It's essentially a very limited form of the guess mechanic in Return of the Obra Dinn, though Senna obviously doesn't have the story, atmosphere, or polish of that game.\n\nI liked that the puzzles were of moderate difficulty while still often requiring note-taking to solve. Conversely, I was a bit annoyed that it seemed like I had to guess slightly on quite a few occasions, though I think this was intentional, since the number of required guesses was always very low. As in: here are two trees, and I have two names to assign, so I just have to try both combinations. Also, there's only a skeleton of a story, but it has no real payoff; the ending to the final chapter 4 is very abrupt, with no epilogue.","timestamp_created":1609525863,"timestamp_updated":1609525863,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pfTN3/YCcPe8vwI="}
