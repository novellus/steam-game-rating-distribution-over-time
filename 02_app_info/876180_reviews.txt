It is not at all similar to Sudoku except for the fact that they both use numbers. \n\n[code]PUZZLE INFO:\n- Each row or column can never have a building with the same height\n- Numbers outside the grid tells you how many buildings can be seen from that side\n- Taller buildings block shorter ones\n\neg. in a row 21453, \nviewing from the left you will see 3 buildings (245)\nviewing from the right you will see 2 buildings (35)\n\nAll puzzles can be solved with logic alone. There is never a need to guess. [/code]\n\nWhat you see from the screenshots is what you get. The layout is really that simplistic but it does includes all the basic yet important features one would require in a puzzle game:\n- notation system\n- mid puzzle progress is saved automatically\n- handcrafted puzzles\n- windowed mode is possible\n- turning off sounds & music is possible\n- extra: random level generator = unlimited puzzles\n\nI was actually surprised to find a digital adaptation and on steam to boot. This game however added in a (really redundant) visual novel on the side. To be honest, I skimmed through as the plot was crap. The puzzles on the other hand are great. \n\nNote: You do not have to play the vn in order to play the puzzles but you have to finish most puzzles in order to progress through the vn.\n\n[i]If you yearn for more, there is a much more challenging variant known as [u]High Rise Suguru[/u] which can be found in 'Beyond Sudoku' published by Puzzler.\n\nIf you like such (obscure) Japanese logic puzzles, do check out [u]Hashi[/u], [u]Siltherlink[/u], [u]Hitori[/u].[/i]","timestamp_created":1576336513,"timestamp_updated":1576509045,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.588459610939025879","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kN/Qh+8CcMei5AE="}
