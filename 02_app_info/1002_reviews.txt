I used to play the demo a bunch when I was a kid, back when Counter-Strike: Source was the only game I owned. This and Codename Gordon, the Half-Life 2 demo and Lost Coast are some of the oldest memories I have from gaming in my childhood, and I'm happy this game still works so well despite the passage of time.\n\nNot surprisingly, my current computer's way better than whatever I had back in the day, so I get to experience it in 1080p at a silky-smooth 60FPS. The gameplay is niche and the networking's dated (not sure if anyone even plays the multiplayer anymore), but I mainly grabbed it for nostalgia's sake. Doesn't feel right not to own it. If that's a reckless use of my money, I honestly couldn't care less. You can't get any more OG with steam games than this ancient title.\n\n\nWould I recommend it? Definitely. I see some people whining about the game length and all that, but this game's singleplayer wasn't meant to last for days on end. Ten bucks isn't much to get something unique, compared to the regurgitated, buggy trash released on a yearly basis in the Triple-A industry for 60 dollars a pop.","timestamp_created":1585127732,"timestamp_updated":1585128273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547679364681243896","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xr7AiPECfpPy+gE="}
