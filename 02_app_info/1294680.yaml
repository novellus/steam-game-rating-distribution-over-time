    review: 'Ok so- I would give this a mixed rating if I could, but that''s not possible,
      so I''m gonna go for a thumbs up, since I DO honestly believe a lot of the reviews
      of this game are outdated. I have not completed the game YET, but I feel that
      I have encountered everything that I need to make a decent review.

      For starters: Most of the bugs complained about are patched out at this point.
      I didn''t encounter any major bugs or issues. Occasionally the fades to black
      when the scene changed would cause a half-second lag, but I''ve encountered
      this in other games as well and it hardly detracts from gameplay. Ok, on to
      my thoughts about the game.

      The art is pretty. REALLY PRETTY. I would put it up there as one of the most
      visually appealing VNs not coming from a major company like Otomate. The cgs
      were lovely and the sprites were very pleasant to look at as well.


      The story was... meh. I can''t say it was particularly amazing or particularly
      bad. There were some points that definitely caught my interest, but sadly not
      many of them were followed up on. I''d say it falls into the same hole as many
      other games with about the same length: Too little time to get the story across.
      With a little work I think this game could be great, but sadly it didn''t really
      get that time. One big gripe I see with most of the reviews for this game is
      the politics which were... honestly not a big deal to me. If you are an American
      liberal, I can totally understand why the game could offend you (since it does
      take a fair few jabs) but otherwise... it''s honestly more funny than anything.
      It''ll be all serious and then go "Oh those damn Liberals" And I can''t help
      but laugh at how random it is. So really I can''t say it detracted from my experience
      that much, especially since it really didn''t tie into the narrative at all,
      in the sense that they could just as easily be right wing, or any other political
      party tbh. It was just there, easy to ignore, or laugh at.


      The characters were... decent. I loved their designs, but some of their personalities
      were a bit lacking, and a tad inconsistent. Even so, they were likable enough
      that I was interested in how things would turn out for them.

      Other than that, the music was fine, the sound effects were fine, if not a bit
      silly at times, and that''s about it.


      In conclusion, if you want this game, get it one sale. It''s good in some ways,
      meh in others.

      [spoiler]On a side note Ron is 100% based off of Katsuya Honda from Fruits Basket.
      Which pleases me more than it should.[/spoiler]'
