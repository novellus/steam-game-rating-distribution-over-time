While being able to buy weapons is nice, I would much rather have to pick them up from the enemy instead of having to search for an ammo box.\n\nA noble attempt but as is kinda frustrating.","timestamp_created":1609721001,"timestamp_updated":1609721001,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wqa25fYCecqfwAI="}
