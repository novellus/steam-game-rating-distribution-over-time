It takes some time getting used to them but once you get the hang of it game becomes quite fun. You can move the organism in 3D space, up/down/left/right and forward/backward. With these controls you solve puzzles in the game to reach the end point of the level. Organism needs air to survive and if air runs out you die. You have to be alert when it comes to traversing the levels because you have a limited supply of air and you can add on to that air supply to a certain limit, that limit depending on the difficulty you play, by being close to tiny blue orbs. These orbs are finite however so you have to manage your air supplies well enough to finish the levels.\n\nThere are enemies that'll damage your air supply, make you slower for a short amount of time and there is one enemy type which'll instantly kill the organism if it touches it. You can evade these by being quick to change your direction of motion.\n\nFirst few levels are easy, very easy to teach you the basics. But as you progress life gets hard real quick and I have a problem with this part of the game. Levels get really long after a while, like 5-6 minutes each and if the organism dies you have to start all over again, this is not fun because later levels can be really hard and doing the same stuff from earlier parts of the level over and over again is boring, the game could definitely use a checkpoint system. The last level is the worst when it comes to this, a level where you escort another being, have to watch your route so it doesn't kill itself following you by tripping over some laser, have to watch for your air supplies, to top it off the level takes a good 10-15 minutes and there's no shortage of traps and challenges. Just pure insanity I dropped it there before finishing it.\n\nThe puzzles in the game are mostly going from one place to another in mazelike levels to open the next part but there are a few that needs you to think and those are really well thought out.\n\nArt of the levels are fine but i feel like it could use different styles for later levels, like the variety would help it.\n\nTLDR:I'm still going to recommend it because puzzles are fun, OST is great and once you get the hang of the controls it's fun to guide the organism through the levels. Just be aware that it's a bit on the harder side on the difficulty scale.","timestamp_created":1589363269,"timestamp_updated":1589386294,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr8azh/ICfoi3hwI="}
