While the meta storytelling convention can wear a bit thin at times, it's a rich story driven game filled with viscerally striking moments, beautiful illustrative art direction, quirky characters and charming music. If you're a fan of Night in the Woods you'll certainly appreciate this similar, albeit shorter and delightfully Nordic, effort (although with an antagonist cheekily named 'Leeroy Brown' there's still quite a smack of Americana - turns out the US hasn't cornered the market on post-industrial melancholy).  Have a feeling this one will stay with me for a while with its darkly humorous atmosphere of tragic tales.","timestamp_created":1609920553,"timestamp_updated":1609925938,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtYnE6/YCe4/4wAI="}
