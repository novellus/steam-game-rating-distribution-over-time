I guess it's down to personal preference whether you like this or the dragging method more, but the way clicking works here is a bit problematic because when a card is clicked that can go to one of the foundations, it won't wait for you to choose a destination but automatically go there, so if you wanted to move it somewhere else, you have to click on it again on the top, then move it elsewhere. on the other hand, if you want to send the top drawn card to a foundation, a single click won't work there, so it's inconsistent as well.\n\nshortly after release the game was already recommendable with a few caveats, but all fixed up and even expanded, [b]it's a definite two thumbs up[/b], looks good, plays well and doesn't cost much, even though the price doubled after the additional game modes got patched in for free for existing owners.","timestamp_created":1595698874,"timestamp_updated":1609780584,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.660217761993408203","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5MuZ5/YCeerAlwI="}
