    review: 'My wife and I both enjoy this game a lot. We bought it when it was still
      under development, but since then a whole lot has happened and the game runs
      much more smoothly now, with fewer glitches.

      The concept is also great - a bit of hidden objects, combined with some puzzle
      solving, combined with a bit of shoot ''em up action, all set in very beautiful
      environments.

      This is also one of the few games where your character is a full person, not
      just a floating head and hands. My wife is 4''11" in real life, and in the game
      she actually feels the right height in relation to me, being 6''1", thanks to
      the pregame height sync. The female character is very pretty, and according
      to my wife, the male character is quite handsome too, all of which gives the
      game a lovely dream-like feel that I don''t get from any of the other 20+ VR
      games I own.

      The story line seems rather intriguing, but we haven''t quite reached the end
      yet as we keep running out of time, which also makes it more exciting.

      The only negatives are that here and there, there are still a few glitches with
      the one weapon (magic wand, which sometimes goes flying off the handle, literally!)
      but other than that it''s just really good fun for when you''re neither in the
      mood for all-out action, nor just sitting on the couch, but instead just a nice
      romp in a beautiful world with good puzzles that get progressively more difficult.'
