Missed messages is by far one of the most beautiful, touching, relatable and amazing game I have ever played and owned. I saw this game thanks to Jacksepticeye, and it has been one of the first games I have ever owned and played, and I will never forget it. The artstyle is gorgeous, beautiful and incredibly smart, mariachi g perfectly with the story and showing the darkness and lightness with ease. The story and characters are incredibly heartfelting, in which I mean you instantly fall in love and want to protect them. And as for the story it is incredibly realistic and heart wrenching as it shows life realistically. The gameplay also heavily helps this. So in the end, this game is a must get, and I highly recommend you get the dlc as well as its incredibly worth it. I will never forget this game","timestamp_created":1606210561,"timestamp_updated":1606210561,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4voTn/PUCf+6asAI="}
