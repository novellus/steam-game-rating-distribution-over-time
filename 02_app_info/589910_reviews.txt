Those issues make me not recommending the product:\n- This is not the full season 2 of SAC. It's just a mashup/cut of some relevant parts. This is hard to spot since the only clue I could spot is the runtime.\n- The voice actors are really bad compared to the original season. The main problem is that the voices are far less distinctive which makes it quite unpleasant to watch.\n\nIf you watched and liked the original SAC seasons this one is most probably not for you.","timestamp_created":1492214040,"timestamp_updated":1492214040,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":37,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.809033811092376709","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3Oi4t9sCffnndg=="}
