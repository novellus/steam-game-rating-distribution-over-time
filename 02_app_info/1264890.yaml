    review: 'Like most 2D space games made in Unity found here on Steam, this one
      just has what I call really "floaty" controls which means that your space ship
      feels like it it weightless and insignificant when you play.


      Watch my first play of this game starting at 6 minutes into this livestream:

      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gf_cT6KCogA


      The game is NOT good however, an it goes much deeper than how the controls feel
      in my opinion...


      1) If you go to the settings, and change the volume sliders and then immediately
      go back into the settings they reset themselves all back to max levels.  The
      game doesn''t even save your volume settings while in the game, much less if
      were to close the game and come back later.


      2) When your game is over, the game like old arcade games will ask you to put
      in three initials.  Then if you play another game right after that, the game
      won''t remember your previous initials and ask you to set them again.  Ugh.  Why
      did the developers choose this three initials route anyway when they tell us
      the game will save the high scores to the Steam leaderboards?  Wouldn''t it
      be much better for the game to just automatically save our high scores with
      our Steam name?


      3) Enemies and even high bosses just immediately vanish when killed leaving
      the game feeling extremely unsatisfying.  A Boss would have tons of explosions
      at the very least but instead just vanishes.  Blip!  Gone magically.  This doesn''t
      only look lazy and bad, but it make the game not fun at all to play


      I could go on and on.. but honestly it doesn''t really matter.  I highly doubt
      the developers care enough to update or fix anything here and I base that on
      the fact they can''t even be bothered to make sure volume sliders don''t even
      stay where you set them for ten seconds while in the game.


      While the developers brag about there being over 1,000 waves of enemies to survive,
      that''s all really meaningless when the first wave feels this gaudy, this lazy,
      and this cheap.  It''s just not fun.  Why would we want to play more than one
      level much less pay any amount of money for this low effort game?


      Refunded.  Not Recommended.  You can find at least a thousand space shooters
      for free on itch and gamejolt for free that show more effort and care by the
      developers and that are much more fun to play than this.


      2 out of 10.  - And trust me when I say that is over-rating this game and giving
      it the benefit of the doubt.'
