No where on this page does it inform people that all that's available is a set of tutorial levels with a vague promise of future chapters.\n\nA tutorial is not a game.\n\nGraphics suck, music is dubstep so it really sucks. Combat is hardly complex, just use the Thor and spam Space bar and Q. The only challenge is spotting enemies since once they appear, the background gets this red distortion stuff which makes the enemy ships difficult to see since they're all red. This sad excuse for a game isn't fun in the slightest and it's nothing but a joke. Just look at the recommended specs.\n\n4 years and $17000 later and all I've got to say is \"Where's the game, Slade?\"","timestamp_created":1465611641,"timestamp_updated":1562024148,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":31,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.676544725894927979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwp/51+sCdfTPWQ=="}
