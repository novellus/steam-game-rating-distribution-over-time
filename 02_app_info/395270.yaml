    about_the_game: After escaping from a locked shed, a young girl finds herself
      in the middle of an idyllic autumn forest.  At first her surroundings seem peaceful,
      and she's comforted by her mother's voice coming through a strange tin device.  But
      gradually, things begin to turn disturbing and sinister.  And the distant howling
      of wolves begins to move closer...<br><br>A Wolf in Autumn is a dark, surreal

    review: The most solid game of the three thus far mainly due to its presentation,
      though the puzzles and pickup mechanics can feel a bit difficult at times. It
      is, overall, a satisfying game to play for half an hour.
