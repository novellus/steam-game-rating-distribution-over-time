It's one of my childhood games. \n\nIt's adorable, the morphing blob concept is great, and some parts are really fun. But man... does it have some of the most annoying platforming I have ever experienced. If your position is off by a fraction of a pixel or your timing is a millisecond off, you will plunge into spike pits and get eaten by evil blobs over... and over.. and over. It does not help that the controls are not particularly responsive (at least, I do not find them to be). To say nothing of the boss battles, which are even more tedious.\n\nIt gets really frustrating. If you like cute things and have lots of patience, it can be fun. Or you might just give up after having to repeat the same section ten times in a row.\n\nIt's one of those games that I hesitate to give either a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down because the first half is really fun, but as the game progresses I feel like the frustration outweighs the fun.","timestamp_created":1607770244,"timestamp_updated":1607770244,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuuCkq/YCe4+4uQI="}
