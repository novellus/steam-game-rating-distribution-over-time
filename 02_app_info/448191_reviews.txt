This loco is a very bad steamer, very unrealistic and not PRO at all but rather the opposite. EVERY adjustment you make results in loss of steampressure. Very annoying and frustrating, so NO recommendation from me and a waste of money. Only the Southern coaches that come with it have some value.","timestamp_created":1604878980,"timestamp_updated":1604879655,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hYSS1fUCdfOfrQI="}
