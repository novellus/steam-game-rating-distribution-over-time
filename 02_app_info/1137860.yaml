    about_the_game: "In Fowl Magic, you play as a hapless chicken who finds itself\
      \ trapped inside a wizard\u2019s tower. This wouldn\u2019t be so bad, except\
      \ for one crucial detail: the tower is burning. That means you\u2019ll have\
      \ to jump, glide, and dash your way past hungry ghosts, hungrier spiders, flying\
      \ bombs, perilous traps, and more to avoid getting roasted by the encroaching\
      \ wall of fire! Legend also tells of larger, more dangerous beasts lurking within\
      \ the tower\u2019s innumerable floors, so stay on your guard\u2026<br />\r\n\
      You won\u2019t have to rely on your wits and feathers alone, though: magic potions\
      \ have been left strewn about the tower, and drinking them will grant you wondrous\
      \ powers, such as fiery breath, lightning blasts, or even invincibility! The\
      \ monsters who inhabit the tower have a strange fondness for bottles, so you\u2019\
      ll have to fight for them, but the struggle is well worth it. Then, if your\
      \ goose ever gets cooked, you can keep track of your furthest distances on the\
      \ leaderboard and try to outlast your past self, or even compete with your friends!\
      \ How far can you make it? How tall is this tower? Will it ever end? What\u2019\
      s an ordinary chicken doing in a place like this? Who knows?!"
