Soundboxing, Air Tone, Audio Shield, Music Box (free!), Beats Fever, Holodance, I like them all, and I probably missed a few and I didn't even count Rockband VR or the drumming VR games. Beat Ninja could be up there with the best of them. However, it has some serious issues that make it just recommendable for VR music rhythm fans like me.\n\nThe core gameplay is awesome and different from all the other music rhythm games. I'm surprised nobody has stolen this formula and improved it. I would buy that game in a second. When this game works, it is a lot of fun and quite the workout. However, it doesn't always work, at least it doesn't work consistently enough. You have to overlook various issues to enjoy this game.\n\nEven on medium difficulty playing a local song from my PC that isn't really all that fast (Lightning Crashes by Live), it seemed that the notes were going by really fast, almost as fast as I could swing at times. And that's when the problems start. You do have to align your sword correctly to get a swing to register. But it seems that sometimes they just don't register. When it's slow it's never a problem. But when one note is right next to another one, it seems it's very inconsistent in registering.\n\nAnother big issue is YouTube integration. It doesn't work at all. It says error downloading after you pick the song and then nothing works. You have to quit the game and restart even to select your own songs locally. \n\nI think that medium difficulty needs to be reworked with faster songs to go easier on the person. I'm not even sure how anybody could get hard difficulty. I coud barely finish 2 songs on medium difficulty before starting to break down in sweat and my arms feeling tired.\n\nRate 6/10. Buy on sale. I had fun, but I also had a lot of frustration. I hope the dev polishes the game because it's a blast to play when it is working as intended.","timestamp_created":1524267080,"timestamp_updated":1524267256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545970499515533447","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjJHa8uICeZLWngE="}
