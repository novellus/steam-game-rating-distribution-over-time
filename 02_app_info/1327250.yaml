    about_the_game: <strong>Builders of Egypt</strong> is an <strong>economic type
      of city-building</strong> taking place in the valley of the Nile. The story
      starts in a little-known protodynastic period in which you will be able to observe
      the birth of the Old Egypt and finished with the death of Cleopatra VII.<br><br><img

      /><br><br>The most important aspect is the skillful management of urban planning
      by shaping the grid of streets, placing buildings and their mutual relation.
      Well-designed city will greatly improve economic efficiency which may convert
      into city income. <br><br><strong>Diplomacy and politics:</strong><br>The governor
      will face very difficult<strong> choices</strong> to be made in a constantly
      changing political environment. Costly expeditions, Pharaoh and other cities
      requests, military threat and a mixture of different cultures will be a commonplace.
      A series of wrong choices can cost the loss of trading partners and low interest
      in the city by settlers. Moreover, the total lack of obedience to the rulers
      may <strong>end up with a civil war.   </strong><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1327250/extras/steam_main_02.jpg?t=1602089391"
      /><br><br><strong>Religion:</strong><br>Deity will be able to interfere with
      daily life but it will be done implicitly. The main aspect of religion will
      be satisfying the need for access to the places of worship, providing supplies
      for temples or organizing festivals. Neglecting this sphere may result in a
      dangerous social unrest on a par with e.g.<strong> famine</strong>.<br><br><strong>Trade:</strong><br>Trade
      is the<strong> most important element in royal treasury</strong>. Without it,
      it is very difficult for economic stability built solely on taxes. Therefore,

      be able to change dynamically depending on the geopolitical situation, will
