[b]/EDIT[/b] \n\nA fun little sokoban, with emphasis on little. The game contains only five levels, and took a mere 10â€“15 minutes to complete. It also didn't launch properly at first on Linux, and left a processor lingering, which I had to kill manually.\n\nThis is one of the kinds of games that make me wish for more granularity in Steam user reviews. It's definitely not a solid recommendation, in spite of the thumbs up, but for the low cost, it's not a bad way to spend your money and time either.","timestamp_created":1573628119,"timestamp_updated":1607328877,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575468063354492188","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1576899469,"developer_response":"EDIT 2: \nAre you still having trouble with the linux version? I pushed a package. If you don't see changes then you may need to delete your cache. I can help with that if this is the case. Just let me know.\n\nEDIT: I have uploaded a fixed version for windows, and removed linux support temporarily. Once I get a proper build I will add the linux version back in. In the meantime feel free to keep using windows or the browser version.\n\nYou are correct in that there are only the five levels, and the linux version is wonky. I packaged it all using electron and it was a terrible experience.\n\nIf you want to play the full game, I would recommend heading to \nhttps://pocoman.sleepless.com/production/?pack=classic.pmp\n which is what the game is supposed to load.\n\nI'm still working on fixing the packages for steam."}],"cursor":"AoJ4nImRnvYCed3h2QE="}
