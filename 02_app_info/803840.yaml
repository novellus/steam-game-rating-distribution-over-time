    review: "[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift[/h1]\n\nYou can view my gameplay +\
      \ review here: https://youtu.be/N-TbTTKDP18\n\nThere's always something special\
      \ about Oculus Rift exclusives on the Steam store and this game / app is no\
      \ exception. It's really out there. First of all, it's dealing with immigration\
      \ and the stories of immigrants from Afghanistan on their journey to Sweden.\
      \ Secondly, it features rap from Emilia Carapic aka Bac Nini (you can find her\
      \ stuff here): https://youtu.be/ffYnctd01jY  Lastly, it has some of the weirdest\
      \ visuals I have seen in VR and even though it says English language is not\
      \ supported on the Steam store page, it is, in fact, supported.\n\nUnfortunately,\
      \ the visuals while experimental, are still pretty bad. I mean I don't mind\
      \ experimental stuff and seeing trippy stuff. I consider myself a very open-minded\
      \ individual who is open to new experiences. However, these visuals are so bad\
      \ that they detract from the immigrant stories. It's not just the poor visuals,\
      \ there's just some odd design choices like a giant chocolate bunny statue just\
      \ standing in the middle of the Afghanistan environment. There's also just some\
      \ poor textures, along with poor placement of objects (some are just hovering\
      \ in in the air and others are like clipped off or run into other objects).\
      \ The interactions are also rather poor. You can only teleport in some select\
      \ scenes. There is no smooth or snap turning. You're supposed to grab some items\
      \ and then put them in a backpack to start the specified mostly cinematic experience.\
      \ \n\nSo there are many different immigrant stories here through each of those\
      \ objects you collect & put in your backpack. Unfortunately, you really have\
      \ to be interested in the subject matter to be able to look past the poor visuals\
      \ and bad interactions. Getting to the stories is a lot more difficult than\
      \ it should be. Honestly, the best thing about this game / app is the rapping\
      \ from Emilia Carapic (Bac Nini).\n\nThis is a pass for everyone but those strongly\
      \ interested in the subject matter. Although, IMO, they would have been better\
      \ off just filming the telling of these immigrant stories on YouTube. Unfortunately,\
      \ experimental in this case just meant they weren't very experienced in making\
      \ a good VR experience. Still, it was amazing they got 80 people to show up\
      \ for the Night of Culture in Lund ... the free punch and pie must have been\
      \ part of the advertisement.\n\n[b]Rate 5/10. I got this on sale for .89 cents,\
      \ it really is free to play quality though. The stories may be compelling though\
      \ ... if you're strongly interested in the subject matter and willing to look\
      \ past all the game's faults.[/b]"
