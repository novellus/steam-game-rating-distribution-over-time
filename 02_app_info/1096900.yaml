      \ make a game myself.&quot; Programming, however, is a huge obstacle that stands\
      \ in your way. Coming up against such a challenge, perhaps most people have\
      \ given up due to the difficulty involved.<br><br>That becomes quite a loss\
      \ for the entire game industry, because from among the ideas discarded, there's\
      \ bound to be creations that could lead to huge, earth-shattering hits.<br><br>The\
      \ RPG Maker series was created to answer the wishes of all kinds of people who\

      \ This signifies that RPG Maker is a tool that is designed to make games. Within\
      \ RPG Maker, we have already programmed the basic operations that support RPGs.\
      \ Making an RPG is as easy as putting in the stats for your heroes and villains,\
      \ drawing up some maps, and using a simple eventing system to drive the story\
      \ to it's finale!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Create an Original Game with Ease!</h2>Included\
      \ with RPG Maker MZ, we have prepared a wealth of resources consisting of the\
      \ visual art and music that are needed to make games. All you need to focus\
      \ on is giving shape to your own ideas. On top of that, for anyone looking for\
      \ something beyond the materials that are already provided, we have a vast collection\
      \ of additional downloadable content intended for the RPG Maker series.<br><br>By\
