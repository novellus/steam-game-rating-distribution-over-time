It's in alpha, so I guess that's okay?\n Keyboard mapping feels bad. Hard to re-map. Don't buy without a controller. \nPros: \n Retro, fun, and moves well\n Characters are unique but should be intuitive for most fighter players\n Toejam and Earl? Love it. \n\nBiggest Pro:\n Even with high ping, I was able to play competitively with friends online. This is huge for players that want to play with friends that are in other countries/ time zones.","timestamp_created":1609587266,"timestamp_updated":1609587266,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwnZK44fYCdqPZvwI="}
