There are a ton of different obstacles and as the game progresses the loadout of the obstacles gets progressively crazier and crazier. \n\nThere is a progress meter on the bottom of the screen that shows how close you are to beating the level and respawns are lightning fast, these 2 things give this game that addicting, \"just one more time\" feel that is necessary for games like this.  I died a ton on the later levels but finally completing a really tricky series of jumps  after dying 40 times on it is immensely satisfying.  \n\nThe game took me about 2 hours to complete.  Each level also has 3 stars that you can try and collect as you play through as well as 2 unlockable extra difficulty levels for each level, I am nowhere near good enough to even think of attempting them but if you are into it I would imagine that trying to unlock and playthrough these extra modes would add a good amount of time to your playthrough,\n\nPurchasing this game is a no-brainer, it is 3 dollars, has precise controls(including controller support), and offers a really addicting and challenging experience.","timestamp_created":1520011743,"timestamp_updated":1520011743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48dHw8+ECcr3GmgE="}
