Basic and simple overall. Make a prisoner, explore a  dungeon with same shade enemies and find all 6 chests to increase stats of your choosing, kill boss and then make your next prisoner to do the next level.\n\nThere is nothing else to loot besides the chests and keys to open doors.\nThe story is interesting enough to want to keep playing it.\n\nThe combat feels clunky.\nIf the game feels too hard or  too easy you have options to change  it  such as choosing your attacks to use less stamin or enemies to attack slower, you can choose multiple options and can make it harder also as in enemies have more health etc.\n\nAnd if the weapon you have chosen doesn't feel right to defeat the boss you can restart the level and choose a different weapon and traits.\n\nThe only problem is it seems like the devs have abandoned it. As they never reply to any of the discussion posts. And there are  broken achievements that would probably never be fixed.\nI'd rate it 6/10  as it has  broken achievements and no trading cards. But I did like playing this fun little adventure.","timestamp_created":1598862553,"timestamp_updated":1598862553,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+s3oofQCc83zngI="}
