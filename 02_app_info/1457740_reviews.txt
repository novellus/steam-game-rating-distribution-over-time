This game is absolute amazing and I'm going replay it for the other endings. The story is pretty cool, I love the graphics which remind me of the good old playstation 1 games. The music is fitting and I just stood there and was listening to it, because I enjoyed it a lot.\nYou can make many decisions even when it's really short. I highly recommend the game if you like a good and interesting story.","timestamp_created":1609613646,"timestamp_updated":1609613646,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi+Oc4vYCfsLovwI="}
