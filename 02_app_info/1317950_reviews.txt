With the 8 characters you're given control of, I did stick mainly to 4 for most of my time playing with occasional dabbling in a few others (my main 4 being Anna, Sakia, Reiketsu and Natsume). The game is very grind-focused in terms of combat so finding a team you like and optimising your style of play feels like one of the main aspects of the game to me, and giving options to expand the characters more via the use of bonding events (of sorts) to upgrade their stats, and also the spirit system was a nice touch. \n\nThe game did appear to be a standard RPGMaker style game which all tend to clash together for me, but something about this one stuck out long enough for me to give it a shot and it did end up hooking me for a while as I found the battle system to be enjoyable and satisfying when finding the combos you like to pull off. It follows a standard turn-based approach but I feel it does it well with a combination of little mechanics that tie together the moves you can use at any given time. The gameplay loop in general feels rewarding and also just very relaxing to play, the kind of thing I can grind away at whilst watching something on another screen.\n\nThere were a few things I thought would've been nice were they to be implemented. One is that I wished there were more chances to develop your characters in terms of skills and strength, as past your stat upgrade of choice on a bonding level-up, it felt like I was mostly just hoping for good drops at the end of the combat rounds. Perhaps a small skill tree, or choices every few levels for more prominent upgrades could be cool to opening up wider character customization and how you want to build your party. It also seemed like once you learn your character's 5-6 skills, there aren't any more for you to learn later, only level upgrades to the skills (I could be wrong as I haven't progressed to the end content yet, but it's my impression after around 10 hours or so).\n\nIt could also feel a little slow at times, as it only seemed to give you loot and XP when you clear a full round of enemies, which could range from 4 and more encounters in a row depending on the difficulty of the area you're tackling. This could be a little frustrating when one person gets KO'd unexpectedly (keeping in mind reviving party members isn't really an option, with one sort-of exception) and you're forced to end your run, as being one or even two members down really halts your progress particularly on the boss rounds. \n\nI had other minor complaints such as how small the bonding event talks last (only a few lines or so), no clarification on stats gained on level-ups or just a general feel of lack of progression, which could just be part of the issue with grind-heavy games in general. I imagine a lot of these things would be ironed out or more expanded upon in the final release, but who knows.\n\nEternal Dreamers has some fun and relaxing grind appeal and a lot of potential, and I'd be curious to see how the game grows and gets polished and more refined over the coming months. If you're looking for some solid grindy gameplay loops and don't mind the general RPGMaker aesthetic, I'd say it's worth looking into.","timestamp_created":1604782218,"timestamp_updated":1604782218,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwsaue0vUCdYf/rAI="}
