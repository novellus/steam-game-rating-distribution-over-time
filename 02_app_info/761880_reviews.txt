Currently the controls can be a bit wonky, and the advantage is definitely with the redneck (as opposed to the the \"superior\" aliens).  There isn't much to do at this point, only two maps and gameplay is repetitive but after refinement this would be an amazing party game. \n\nThe alien needs a buff badly, quicker teleport and most importantly, better aiming.  There were a few times I would put the line right on the redneck and the laser went BEHIND me :(.  A ground marker for the laser would be helpful.\n\nCan't wait for updates to this game!","timestamp_created":1514859388,"timestamp_updated":1514859388,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.594594597816467285","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1514891447,"developer_response":"Thanks for the detailed review. We are working hard on refining the controls and gameplay. The game will keep getting better as we push out more updates. I would also suggest you to switch on the \"Arcade\" mode, it has faster teleportation and attack times. Thanks again."}],"cursor":"AoJwxvup2uACdM/OlAE="}
