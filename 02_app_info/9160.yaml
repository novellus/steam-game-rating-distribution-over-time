    review: Definitely some of the hardest levels I ever played from a classic commercial
      doom game, much harder than plutonia! If you're playing this in modern day,
      I highly suggest using the Eternity Engine or Prboom+, and use a launcher of
      your choice so you can load in levels easier.
