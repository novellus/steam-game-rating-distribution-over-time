Yes my computer is a potato but hey it can run dota, portal 2, paladins, and rocket league, so it's not THAT bad to not be able to run a puzzle programming game. Also the UI is too simple and lacking (feels like a flash game). If you have an old computer like me, go buy a Zachtronics game instead","timestamp_created":1609707366,"timestamp_updated":1609707366,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw56SC5fYCdcyYwAI="}
