This game really feels like a beta if I am generous, an alpha if I'm not. There just isn't very much content, the plot is forced with no decision points, everything is prescripted with little direction on how to proceed (which sounds peridoxical but is not, trust me), and there are further problems. The heroine automatically loses her combats and has forced adult interactions...the automatic losing is my point of annoyance here. Even if someone likes this genre-which lets be honest, can be very questionable at times-the automatically losing just takes the game play element right out and makes a proper horror story out of it. Now, the pros to this game are the following-the sound track is actually kind of creepily enjoyable, the protaganist is really cute, and well designed the cut scene art and animation is good. And as said, the premise was sound. Just didn't deliver. The world seems static and dead, there are hardly any NPCS to interact with and they are all less than one dimensional. I hope this game creator doesn't give up, but I am sure they can do better. Making games is very challenging and is an art form. Better to more slowly release games than make ones that just don't live up to their promise.","timestamp_created":1588773331,"timestamp_updated":1588773331,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g6SR9fECcoX9hQI="}
