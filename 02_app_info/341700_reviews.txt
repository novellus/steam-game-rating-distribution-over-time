You do this by selecting from a multiple choice of 3 events each month, each with an already prescribed plus and minus values attributed to 6 different attributes. If any of these attributes fall under score 25 then Valentin has a chance of dying. After you have a made a choice, the game then automatically prescribes an additional event which has a further minus or positive value connected to it. After several years when Valentin turns 68 a combination of more vexing and taxing algorithms are added making a complete chore to keep the 6 attributes evenly spread. \n\nYour then presented with the question if longevity is really worth the aim, especially now that the quality of life has diminished. Your starting goal of wanting to keep him alive, will soon be replaced by the lack on new experiences, instead constantly reliving negative already experienced events. The earlier reminiscent and cherished memories of your wife pulling you through troubled times, your parents setting up the man you are today and your sense of accomplishment as you come to your relatives aid, has now completely vanished to loneliness, to sorrow, to abandonment. An originally priced $2.00 game that banquets the longevity vs quality euthanasia issue to you.\n\nHowever thoughtful Brazilian developer Locomotivah thought he was, his propaganda seems extremely one-sided. I went to a party once in real life and was surprised that amongst the middle age was a 99-year-old there. On the table, drinking 'Peach Schnapps', entertaining us with jovial tales of the war. Even when she turned 100, she was still adventurous enough to travel in a hot air balloon. Discussing with her at that party she told me her motto to life. She never focused on the things that she could not control like that negative algorithm of ageing, or the negative events of her life that she could not control. Instead she focused on the things she COULD control, that is, 'the way she viewed things,â€™ choosing to embrace everything as new experiences. Regardless if it was something mundane like Vegemite on toast or a new song she could hum to and carry with her outside.  It was the new experiences she herself kept creating that made longevity a noble pursuit. On the flip side with this game having very few events attached, unfortunately that noble inspirational message is missed with this very thinned somewhat pessimistic view.\n\nBelow full game from me...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BQCxJ4Air-g\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review feel free to subscribe to my curator page.
