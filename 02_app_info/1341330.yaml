      is a cooperative survival game with action RPG elements, where players travel
      across different worlds in order to save their own. Explore procedurally generated
      worlds, face hostile inhabitants, face challenges like extreme weather conditions,
      toxic atmosphere, lack of water and more.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key features:</h2><h2

      /><br>As a Gatewalker, one of the chosen few, you can go through the Gate and
      explore the worlds that lay on the other side. Team up with up to 3 other players
      in this team-based survival. Fight terrifying monsters, survive extreme weather
      conditions, follow the orders given by the Guild, and most importantly, stay
      alive!<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1341330/extras/Ancient_Constraction-600x200.gif?t=1609627727"

      /><br>Explore the procedurally generated worlds with unique terrain features,
      plants, and creatures. Discover new resources and crafting materials. Face various
      environmental hazards: toxic or unbreathable atmosphere, terrifying darkness,
      penetrating cold, and much more. Each world type introduces a unique survival
      mechanic that forces you to adapt. Finding food, water or wood to start a fire
      may be impossible. Consider carefully what to bring with you on the expedition,
      as no one really knows what  awaits on the other side of the Gate.<h2 class="bb_tag">TEAM

      /><br>Surviving alone in an unknown world is really hard. But with teammates
      at your side, you at least stand a chance. Share the responsibilities: start
      a fire to let others warm up, build a tent to let your mates rest, warn them
      about the dangers lurking in the night. The key to surviving is cooperation
      between you and your team.<h2 class="bb_tag">SKILL BASED COMBAT</h2><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1341330/extras/Skill-based_Combat-600x200.gif?t=1609627727"
      /><br>Isometric skill-based combat without auto targeting. Your skills may miss,
      and you can dodge enemy attacks! Good positioning during combat, balanced use
      of skills, proper timing and team synergy are all crucial to victory.<h2 class="bb_tag">CRAFTING</h2><img

      /><br>Choose an item to craft. Discover the appropriate recipe. Raid different
      worlds to gather required resources. Find or create a crafting station. Finally,
      build the item and use it!<h2 class="bb_tag">YOU ARE WHAT YOU WEAR</h2><img

      /><br>There are no predefined character classes. Each item gives you a unique
      set of skills, so try tinkering with different builds. Take heavy armor and
      a healing staff to support your mates in the front line by tanking and restoring
      health. Remember, you are, what you wear!<h2 class="bb_tag">PROCEDURALLY GENERATED

      /><br>Each time you pass the Gate you will land in a different, procedurally
      generated world. This gives you countless opportunities, offers constant challenges,
      and forces you to adapt in order to win in changing conditions! Always stay
      cautious, modify your strategy, make fast decisions and face their consequences,
      because you never know what waits around the corner.'
