    review: "I got OhShape expecting a fun, interesting and immersive scenery and\
      \ gameplay, but don't let that fool you.\nThe game is very strict on the movement.\
      \ When you move into place you can accidentally touch the wall (very slightly)\
      \ and fail because it's a tight spot to put yourself into. With the walls it\
      \ can be very hard to dodge, (not sure if tracking problems but even moving\
      \ my hands and body far away from the wall it can still think you hit it, bug?)\
      \ \nI think putting on Small Room or what-not helped but it still happened commonly\
      \ even with the setting on.\nI personally don't enjoy the game, but I do see\
      \ potential with others who are interested. \nI don't think its worth the price.\
      \ Maybe could drop it to 10 or under, or wait for a sale.\nIf you are interested\
      \ in this genre, look into investing into Beat Saber, the game is less strict\
      \ on arm movement and overall more fun."
