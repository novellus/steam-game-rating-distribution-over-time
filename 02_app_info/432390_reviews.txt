After a while the Long road gets boring, the Final survival is challenging and fun at the same time, what i think long road needs is more variety and random events. Obviously this isn't going to happen for a while because of there being one person working on this which is impressive, I just want to offer my opinion on this. This game is worth the buy if you want to see it grow overtime while it's basic now, it has potential. One problem i found was balancing between the different factions while the ordinary zombie is far weaker than a normal alien, the mothership always loses to the Mega zombie i don't know if this is intentional or not but I think it should be even. This is all just my opinion...(add a faction of bugs it would be cool ;)","timestamp_created":1552735446,"timestamp_updated":1552783201,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.628438055515289307","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1552765511,"developer_response":"Thanks, that's really good constructive feedback for me to work towards :)"}],"cursor":"AoJ4rurFxOkCco2WvQE="}
