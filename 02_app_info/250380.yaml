      a laboratory and a dwelling for three generations of Lodgers.<br><br>But as
      of late the latest Lodger has been noticing weird changes in familiar surroundings;
      things are missing, noises and rattle heard. Something odd is coming out of
      the woods. Come night, it seems like someone's made himself at home in the twilight
      of rooms, attics, and cellars. <br><br>You need to stay awake and sane till
      dawn.<br><br>The Lodger is wandering the rooms, evading the unknown, counting
      minutes till morning. But it's only in the night that he can solve the main
      puzzle and find the answers. What's going on? Are the Guests real, or are they
      just figments of his insomniac imagination? What'd happened to the forest? What's
      happening to the cabin? Is there a line between reality and imagination?<br><br><strong>Gameplay
