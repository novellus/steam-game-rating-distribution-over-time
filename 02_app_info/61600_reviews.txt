It's a sort of neat little puzzle game, you rotate an object tied to a rope, and the rope paints the area it touches. Unique concept, and it's pretty relaxing to just tie a little statue with a strand to color it. Check it out if you like puzzle games.","timestamp_created":1609383682,"timestamp_updated":1609383682,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/cOv2/YCe7/9vgI="}
