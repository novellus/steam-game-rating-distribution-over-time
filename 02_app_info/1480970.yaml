    review: Flash back to the 90s. The familiar puzzle game "Lights Out" but with
      more variety.  Puzzles are pretty easy to start but you'll still need to think
      through them to get perfect scores as they get harder.  Challenge mode puzzles
      are more difficult but don't seem to have a "perfect score" so you'll need to
      be content with just solving them.
