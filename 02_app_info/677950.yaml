    about_the_game: "The drama and challenges of classic American heavy steam railroading\
      \ in the 1920s roars into your collection with the extraordinary Bessemer &amp;\
      \ Lake Erie route!<br><br>Masterfully created by G-TraX, the Bessemer &amp;\
      \ Lake Erie route brings to life the B&amp;LE during the heart of the steam\
      \ era and includes the B&amp;LE\u2019s rugged line from the shores of Lake Erie\
      \ at Conneaut, Ohio to North Bessemer, Pennsylvania, as well as a variety of\
      \ important B&amp;LE rail yards, secondary lines, rail interchanges, and coal\
      \ branches! The entire route has been refined to give 70 miles of the most entertaining\
      \ and exhilarating experiences this railroad has to offer.<br><br>The Bessemer\
      \ &amp; Lake Erie was a railroad created to serve the steel industry and deliver\
      \ iron ore from Great Lakes freighters docking at Conneaut Harbor to steel mills\
      \ located around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. B&amp;LE complemented its ore movements\
      \ with the haulage of bituminous coal from the mines of western Pennsylvania,\
      \ and the railroad also totted its share of general freight and operated limited\
      \ passenger services.<br><br>Conneaut Harbor was the essence of America in the\
      \ industrial age. Great Lakes freighters laden with iron ore arrived at Conneaut\
      \ and gigantic Hulett unloaders transferred ore into B&amp;LE hoppers. The Bessemer\
      \ &amp; Lake Erie route for Train Simulator re-creates Conneaut in remarkably\
      \ authentic fashion, right up to including fully functional Hulett unloaders!\
      \  <br><br>Conneaut is one of five major yard and terminal complexes featured\
      \ in route. Albion, Ohio; Butler, Pennsylvania (home to three yards and key\
      \ railroad interchanges); and North Bessemer, Pennsylvania (where the B&amp;LE\
      \ interchanged with Pittsburgh\u2019s Union Railroad), each host railroad facilities.\
      \ At B&amp;LE\u2019s hometown of Greenville, Pennsylvania, the railroad\u2019\
      s expansive facilities include the line\u2019s erecting, car, and locomotive\
      \ shops, highlighted by a transfer table and 17-stall roundhouse. And on a route\
      \ rich with lineside industries, among the most important is the massive Standard\
      \ Steel complex at Butler, home to steel production, rail car-building, and\
      \ automobile production.<br><br>To move its tonnage (and passengers), the Bessemer\
      \ &amp; Lake Erie route includes two authentic steam locomotives \u2013 the\
      \ B&amp;LE\u2019s venerable 0-6-0 steam switchers constructed by the Baldwin\
      \ Locomotive Works in 1909, and the railroad\u2019s powerful D-1-A class 2-10-2s\
      \ built by Baldwin in 1919. And the Bessemer &amp; Lake Erie route includes\
      \ an extraordinary selection of period-authentic rolling stock, with boxcars,\
      \ flatcars, gondolas, hoppers, refrigerator cars, tank cars, pickle cars, cabooses,\
      \ crane cars, and heavyweight baggage, coach, and commuter coaches all included,\
      \ many in various liveries and with multiple loads.<br><br>It\u2019s time to\
      \ experience the famed B&amp;LE \u2013 and the memorable and captivating era\
      \ of 1920s American steam-era railroading \u2013 with the Train Simulator Bessemer\

      and Freight Cars. Along with  Different interchanges .  I Even have my own Railroad
      that runs on this Route Called the Southern and Erie. We use EX SP Motive Power
      !  NS Also Helps us move Shipments of Ore and  Coal .  Sadly I Have one complaint
      though.   I Noticed i started hearing Crackling sounds from the  Locomotives
      and Freight cars.  I Thought  it was  my Earbuds. But then I discovered that
      its the game.  Some of my other Add On s have the crackling noises to.  I Never
      had this issue when getting other Routes . If anyone  has had this problem  please
      let me know.  I Give this route 8/10!
