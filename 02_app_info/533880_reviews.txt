It is absolutely killer...bouncing hooks, an infectious beat, and the ability to listen to them over and over again; I can't say enough awesome stuff about these songs.  To be fair, I bought the game/soundtrack bundle, having heard nothing of Raygun, because of all the tracks by FantomenK, who I love.  If I had to give the soundtrack any dings at all, it's that it didn't come with 320kbps mp3s and FLAC files; it's not the end of the world, though.\n\nUnrelated side note:\nFantomenK released an Ultimate Collection of his work back in 2012, as part of a bundle, long before I know he existed.  Not the easiest thing to find (I'm still looking).  If you come across it, listen to it, and spread it far and wide, and also, to me.  Amazing.","timestamp_created":1530242810,"timestamp_updated":1530242810,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550172984600067139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiYjlpOQCdZ3LpAE="}
