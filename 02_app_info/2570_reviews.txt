Second is important videos that should play and give you clues - well, f**k you, if you have a newer PC, those just refuse to show visuals, and everyone is doing whisper speak, instead of speaking english.\nThen there is changing camera like in Resident Evil, but you move with mouse, meaning that you can click on a god damn chasm and die, making you repeat the act.\nLastly there are bugs that softlock your progress, I for example couldn't open the bookshelf in Act 2 at any point.\n\nSince it's a point'n'click game, I watched some dude who played it on an old rig in 2011 with all videos actually showing, and I'd suggest anyone interested do the same. The setting is kinda weird, almost EYE Divine Cybermancy weird. Some citadel of grand masters of their chaos religion, operating in space and commanding slaves, when a force they call evil started striking them down, flipping the power dynamics on their head. Visuals are 2-tone, something like Fotonica or Music Machine (second also being a weird adventure game). Music is minimal and ominous, fits the setting. The story itself is not really amazing, the focus is mostly on lore and worldbuilding, the whole thing lasts like half an hour, if it's not breaking for you of course.\n\nPS\nThey mention \"Sin City\" in the visuals description, and list \"Set up multiple player profiles\" as a feature worthy of note XD","timestamp_created":1601811343,"timestamp_updated":1601811710,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535452306270599365","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg+Da+fQCf8znpQI="}
