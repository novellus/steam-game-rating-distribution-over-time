    review: "[h1]You should not expect too much from this game.[/h1]\nTo be honest\
      \ after playing for like an hour this game feels like it's a demo version or\
      \ just a little teaser for whats to come. There are plenty of ways how you could\
      \ improve this game but does this mean it's a bad game? No not at all! \nIf\
      \ you consider that this was made by a little indie studio, which (as of now)\
      \ has only created one more game called \"Monstrum\" https://store.steampowered.com/app/296710/Monstrum\
      \ I think it's a pretty solide performance. (sidenote; Monstrum itself was also\
      \ a very good little game!) \n2 games and 2 times thumbs up I can't wait to\
      \ see what Team Junkfish is going to create in the future ;)\n[h1]PS: can confirme\
      \ the game is funny, it's almost worth to buy just for the lol's[/h1]"
