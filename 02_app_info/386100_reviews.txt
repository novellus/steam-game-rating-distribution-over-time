Graphics aren't bad, but there is no much better to say about it. The store page info is a lie: isn´t a Roleplaying game, even an action one, is a simple Hack and Slash game with permadeath. There is no story or true campaign: only sucesive little arenas, with option to loot or buy few items. Mechanics is too basic: there are 4 characters to choose, they haven´t scores and only have four parameters: damage, life, moviment and armour. No leveling system, no dialogues. Combat system only have 4 kind of combos, player can´t carry health potions; and so on. Surely this product would have been wonderful in 90's arcades, but never today. Only can be recommend for hardcore fans of arena fighting and this genre. its good rating just discredits the veracity of Steam reviews and votes.","timestamp_created":1583956392,"timestamp_updated":1584057541,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mPzL6PACeJC/9wE="}
