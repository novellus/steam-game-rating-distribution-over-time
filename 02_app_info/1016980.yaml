    review: "UPDATE: 02 Jan 2021\n\nAfter a year away from the game, I came back and\
      \ decided to see if I could finish it.  Observations are as follows:\n\n- While\
      \ the story is somewhat 'open', I have reached a point in the game to where\
      \ I have no solid idea what to do (e.g., I'm supposedly in a race to get back\
      \ to my ship, to prevent something bad from happening, but when I get there,\
      \ the other crew member is saying 'I took care of it' (and I'm thinking to myself\
      \  ????????). It feels like I have the option to finish the game there, but\
      \ I still have open objectives, and the option to leave the station goes nowhere.\n\
      \n- This game was relatively decent over a year ago, but its core mechanics\
      \ are behind what I would consider 'standard' in VR games these days (almost\
      \ like going back to the original Resident Evil 2 after playing Resident Evil\
      \ 4).\n\n- This game has some good ideas and ambitions, and could be made better\
      \ with a facelift on User Interface, basic controls, and of course, graphics.\n\
      \nAfter a year away from the game, I think I've come close to finishing it,\
      \ but am confused on how to proceed, and I doubt I'll go back to the beginning\
      \ to try to remember everything I forgot.  A Game Guide would be very useful\
      \ right now.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
      \n\n\n\nIt's Nice to Discover a Game I Didn't Know I Needed\n\nPlaying on Valve\
      \ Index, i7-8700, GTX 1070Ti, 16GB RAM\n\nI haven't played much of the Sci-Fi\
      \ RPG known as Mass Effect, but what I have played so far of this game reminds\
      \ me of it.  Now, Mass Effect has a lot more resources behind it, but this game\
      \ makes a valiant effort in taking you on a story where your choices impact\
      \ the the outcome (I think....from what I have experienced so far).\n\nEssentially,\
      \ you're playing a Space Trucker (or Captain of a cargo ship, if you're feeling\
      \ sensitive), and upon making a delivery at a space station, things go south\
      \ real quick, due to the intentions of evil men (I'm okay if it's evil women,\
      \ too).  The game is part adventure (exploring), part action (gunfights), part\
      \ RPG (talking with characters where you have multiple choices).  Pros and Cons\
      \ are as follows:\n\nPros:\n- They allow you the choice of smooth locomotion\
      \ based on hand or head orientation.\n- A very good menu system, which allows\
      \ you to save at almost any point in the game.  I didn't notice where you could\
      \ delete a saved game if you want.\n- Your main enemies are flying drones. \
      \ They largely act as bullet sponges at first, but they do have a weakness which\
      \ takes away their spongeness.  The problem is that is you need to create the\
      \ situation which activates this weakness (this provides a little strategy).\n\
      - Your resources/ammo cost credits, but fortunately everybody at the space station\
      \ loves to leave their credit cards out in the open.  \n- You have a utility\
      \ belt to place most of your equipment on, and you have the ability to adjust\
      \ its position on your body.  I still run in scenarios where I've wound up reaching\
      \ for the wrong thing (in the middle of a battle).\n- Interactions with the\
      \ NPCs is fun, and you do have some choices in what you say/respond.  Since\
      \ I'm playing through this for the first time, It is difficult to say how my\
      \ choices are affecting the gameplay.\n- The game's story develops slowly,and\
      \ while not convoluted like a soap opera, requires some paying attention to\
      \ (e.g., without paying attention to the story, it's just mindless wandering\
      \ and random shooting). The story gives a wonderful sense of scope and purpose.\n\
      - No one of the game's components (action/adventure/RPG) is mind-shattering\
      \ stellar, but the combination of these components works in a way to create\
      \ a greater whole of a game.\n- The difficulty of the game is decently balanced.\
      \  Although some will certainly think it is easy, it enables a feeling of steady\
      \ progression each time I play.\n\nCons:\n- Snap turning only.  Smooth turning\
      \ would be very welcome.  Physical turning works as well, but I'm lazy.\n- Your\
      \ arms in the game look like someone attached them to a torture rack, and forgot\
      \ to ease up on the stretching (try 2-hand holding the space rifle).  You easily\
      \ get used to it after the initial shock of wondering when your arms took a\
      \ hit of LSD without telling you.\n- Use of your credit card to buy things is\
      \ straight forward, but I often run into 'alignment issues' when 'swiping' my\
      \ credit card.  Not a deal breaker, but often annoying.\n- There is one part\
      \ in the game where I got stuck. and had no clue what to do.  Fortunately, someone\
      \ had the same problem as I,and a solution is posted in one of the Discussion\
      \ threads. In getting through the problem, though, the game wound up crashing\
      \ on me, and I had to restart (save often).\n- After getting through the first\
      \ level (A), I got into the elevator to go to the next level (B), the elevator\
      \ does a 90 degree rotation that for  a second, made me think I was falling\
      \ off the earth.  The first two times I used the elevator,the game wound up\
      \ kicking me back to Steam Home.\n- Fighting the robots reminded me of fighting\
      \ a sun-burned C3PO.  The robots were unremarkable, and boring to fight.\n-\
      \ Although it is in the 'Pros' above, all the elements come together to create\
      \ an enjoyable game, but no one of the elements is particularly strong (e.g.,\
      \ exploring is fun, but pretty basic).\n- You can store a lot of things on your\
      \ belt, but health packs are not one of them.  A bit of a bummer, given you\
      \ can carry copious amount of ammunition on you.\n\nAlthough the developer states\
      \ 3 hours worth of play time, I'm at 4 hours, and I have no real idea of how\
      \ long I have to go.\nThe $20 price tag seems steep at first, but what the developer\
      \ was offering is different compared to most other VR games I've played, and\
      \ so I took a gamble.  Outside of some initial frustrations with the controls,\
      \ and some bugs (before you leave your space ship to go on the space station,\
      \ place your space gun in your holster. Do NOT carry it in your hand), I feel\
      \ the proce is fair. \nThe only thing that would yank my crank about the price\
      \ is if it goes on sale during Thanksgiving (I know I'm cheap!).\n\nOverall,\
      \ I am enjoying the game because it is offering something different for myself\
      \ compared to other games I've recently bought.  There are some bugs in the\
      \ game tha thave the potential of sucking the fun out of it, but fortunately\
      \ rhe developer has been responsive in answering questions.\nI'm not sure where\
      \ the game will end up taking me, but I'm enjoying the ride so far."
