      notes: There are two adult content options for this game. With adult content
        ON, the game contains some very strong language, as well as nudity, gore and
        bloody violence (all drawn in a low-detail pixel art style). With adult content
        OFF, all of these elements are toned down, but the game still deals heavily
        with themes of horror, crime and murder.
