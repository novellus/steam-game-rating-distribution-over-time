It has a ok start, a really solid middle, and a very confusing end.\n\nPlayed four hours and got a single ending, went back one choice and got a different ending. Yet how I got to these two different endings was unnerving. The middle was fine since I could follow along with the story, yet I think my choices screwed up the order near the end. I just jumped to doing some trial thing and beat the game. It was weird. How the heck did I even get there. There was a single scene about a random X on the map, and boom I'm at a library, then boom I'm trapped, I escape, and couple choices later it ends... I was like ok... That felt Super forced! like no build up or ready for the climax kinda thing. \n\nAll in all I thought it was very well done, even the voice acting. Though if you play I recommend going into settings and dropping the SFX and Music a bit, then turn up the TV/Monitor volume. the voices in some scenes are quiet, VERY quiet.\n\nI would like a scroll back function with the mouse wheel. sometimes I click to fast and skip a piece of dialogue.\n\nI do think some characters are a bit much. Like what is up with that choice in the beginning. \"I'm giving you a direct order\" ahhhh Dude I had what three scenes with you and you start ordering me around? I know there has to be something to give the characters a \"choices matter\" kinda feeling, just what the hell man. I have known the guy for five minutes and he starts ordering me around? Yes I had to iterate this scene twice since it was SO forced!\n\nAs far as Visual novels go, its pretty decent. Definitely not the best I have seen, yet every one has their own idea's on what is the best. I thought it was pretty good, just the choices feel kinda put in weird spots and the choices some times are way off the marker in what you think you want your character to say.\n\nSo first ending I got was one queen to rule them all.... or that's the feeling I get. Changing one choice at the end got me let have a for the people ending and talk things out. which in my book didn't end well. LOL I think the princess maker type games do a bit better in that regards to being an epilogue on your choices.\n\nall in all I say decent. :)","timestamp_created":1609591798,"timestamp_updated":1609591798,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj7fJ4fYCcMfbvwI="}
