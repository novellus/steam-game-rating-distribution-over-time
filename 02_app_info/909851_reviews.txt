This was originally released as a 2xCD release back in the day which is how I've listened to it over the years, but this version adds 10 additional tracks that really flesh out the soundtrack.\n\nOnly slight gripe is that they have shortened some of the tracks, cut off a lot of the silences between tracks and generally have different edits to the CD version. The edit of 'Geopolitics' sounds incredibly different for instance (for the worst).\n\nStill, Killer7 is a great game and this is a great soundtrack.","timestamp_created":1599853251,"timestamp_updated":1599853251,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548022627830505371","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m+mrv/QCea2ZoQI="}
