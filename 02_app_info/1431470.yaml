    developer_response: You are right, though, that this was the first time we directly
      mentioned they were Enby. We can and should do better in the future with actually
      verbally acknowledging representation. We also have added new endgame date scenes.

    review: 'A very short  uhm "Dating Sim" with a wide and eclectic cast of characters
      to interact with.  TBH for me its was much more of a head scratcher than anything
      else.  It was hard for me to really find and keep up with any real kind of story
      line, as there seemed to be several all playing out at once, with a steady rush
      of decisions to make on things that arnt really fully fleshed out enough to
      know exactly what you are making the decision about, nevermind guess as to what
      sort of out come any decision will have (in advance of making it that is, everything
      gets wrapped up in the end, even if you have know idea what you were doing as
      you played)

      All in all i tend to like the works of this particular Developer, even if alot
      of them leave me feeling a bit confused as to WTF i just read ; )  The characters
      are always interesting, and some are always just Over the Top, bringing a good
      amount of laughs to be had along with some serious subject matters that get
      meta''d in.  Also [strike]not sure if this is a first for this Dev or not but[/strike]
      there is a non binary character to get to know in this story, which caught me
      off guard cause I thought "he" was kinda interesting and spent a good deal of
      time getting to know them, even after they corrected me about my miss assumption.

      All in all i''d have to honestly say this is a really bad dating sim, as there
      is no scene that plays out other than the person you ask out on the date saying
      yes (or I guess no if you choose someone you didnt get rep up with?), it literally
      just jumps to the end of the game.  Which honestly was even more disappointing
      than the usual, jump to a scene somewhere with the whole group in a party setting,
      with a few unique moments/lines with your "date" this dev/publisher usually
      has in their games.  I was hoping since they were selling this one as an actual
      Dating Sim, and nothing else, that they would have put some real effort into
      your chosen relationship with these strange and whacky characters (who are strangely
      overly deep when you least expect it).  But alas that is not this game.

      So if your actually looking for a Dating Sim I''d say this is a hard pass, but
      if you like crazy settings and interesting / bizarre characters that leave you
      trying to figure out whats going on and whats Being Said, go for it!

      edited 11/02/2020 after speaking with a dev and finding out that the afor mentioned
      non binary character was not the first one to appear in their works.  Still
      bonus points imho for continued support and inclusiveness in their games.'
