    review: 'I recommend this game to everybody who likes FNAF-style games.

      The story isn''t understandable (maybe we''ll get to know more in the second
      game), but the gameplay is impressive.

      It may have been inspired to FNaF, but they got rid of a lot of FNaF stuff,
      and replaced them with a lot of SLS elements. In fact, so much SLS has been
      put in there that it''s much more than "a poor attempt at copying FNaF".

      The jumpscares are not the best, but they''re still alright. The atmosphere
      already makes the game scary, plus figuring out the best strategy to send the
      puppets away.

      The levels have a nice game design, in the earelier floors, they are pretty
      easy, but at the lower floors, they are much harder, so you must try new strategies,
      as I said before.

      I recommend this game to everyone, especially with this price.'
