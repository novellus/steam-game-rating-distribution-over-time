    review: I bought this game for the memes, but sadly those memes did not reach
      their full fruition. From the get go you can play any of the eight levels, so
      their isn't anything to really unlock. the controls are pretty wonky which after
      you play it for a bit is forgive-able. The game difficulty is also pretty strange.
      levels 1-7 took me about 6 minutes with the rest of the 29 minutes of gameplay
      towards beating the last level. It was crazy how easy the first few levels were.
      The game has surprisingly good graphics, but honestly it would feel more fitting
      if they used simpler graphics with simple designs. All that being said the spoon
      is really nice. if you have a spoon fetish this is the game for you.
