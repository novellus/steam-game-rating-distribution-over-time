Some of the monsters in the encounter IMO aren't... balanced for small parties. Unless you have A LOT of spellcasters.\nTrying not to be TOO SPOILERY but this dungeon is definitely designed for parties made heavily of Spellcasters, and the group I DM'd it for didn't know that, so we had an ineffective fighter, and rogue for the whole dungeon and it was pretty un-fun. :/ Just my 2c. But eh, at least it was only 3 dollars spent, and lesson learned.","timestamp_created":1482030889,"timestamp_updated":1482030889,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gpf7h9kCcpO+bA=="}
