    review: "[h1] Game Summary: [/h1] \nI will say that this game doesn't do a great\
      \ job of putting its best foot forward.  The title card is fan-service, with\
      \ a late-game character overshadowing the heroine all to put cleavage at the\
      \ fore-front.  It seems like a really cheap way to bring attention to the game,\
      \ which is especially foolhardy as there's nothing remotely like that in the\
      \ game itself.  Distractions aside, this RPG Maker game does begin clumsily\
      \ and there are flaws throughout holding the game back from what it could have\
      \ been.\n\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1] \n\u2022\tIt begins slowly, but the story does\
      \ become fairly engaging if you're able to stick with the game.  For those 10%\
      \ of people who give the game a few hours, 8% wind up playing through 'til the\
      \ very end.  Clearly though, people do give up on the game quickly, as about\
      \ 20% of people boot it up and don't play it at all.\n\u2022\tI prefer this\
      \ style of game where enemy encounters are represented by avatars you can either\
      \ choose to fight or avoid, as opposed to random encounters.  I know I didn't\
      \ wind up being as powerful as I could have by the end, but I wasn't in the\
      \ mood to keep fighting random peons.\n\u2022\tYour defense tends to be pretty\
      \ high, so though you may not easily kill enemies, you tend to be hard to kill\
      \ yourself.  That varies, especially in the latter half of the game, but if\
      \ you keep your equipment in good shape, your defense will be solid.\n\u2022\
      \tIt's hard to explain succinctly, but I found the characters and story enjoyable.\
      \  Admittedly cliche, but I did get caught up in what was going on and wanted\
      \ to see more.\n\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1] \n\u2022\tThe game has problems with its\
      \ walls and boundaries, as there are multiple areas where you will walk through\
      \ tiles that should represent a cliff-side or wall.  This is mostly a non-issue,\
      \ though it can get annoying when you're simply trying to navigate an area and\
      \ randomly get held up or stuck.  However, while traversing through Glenweln\
      \ Forest, I passed the boulder by walking through the walls, and skipped past\
      \ content where you get both Renee and magic.  As I went to the next area, Renee\
      \ arrived to trigger the next story segment, but the characters had no magic.\
      \  I only tried it because of the ironic word choice the protagonist had.  If\
      \ I hadn't saved around that time, I could have really screwed myself.\n\u2022\
      \tNear the end of the game, there's equipment for sale that is well beyond what\
      \ you can afford at that time.  Sure, you could buy one incredibly expensive\
      \ item with all the money you have, but to equip everyone in the party somewhat\
      \ evenly, you have to get items two or three levels below that.  I fail to see\
      \ why the equipment sold at the end is so unbalanced like that, especially since\
      \ the location and narrative don't support it being such stellar gear.\n\u2022\
      \tThe main reason I avoided fights towards the end of the game was because many\
      \ regular enemies make use of annoying status effects that either increase their\
      \ defense or evasion, or make your characters miss their basic attacks.  This\
      \ really drags out fights with peons you should be wiping out with relative\
      \ ease.  It's not interesting or challenging, it's just irritating.\n\u2022\t\
      There's a random \"cutscene\" halfway through the game, and it includes a very\
      \ poorly drawn picture.  Compared to the rest of the game, this sudden picture\
      \ is out of place and jarring, which seems odd to include at all since it's\
      \ so brief.  This was an anomaly in the game.  \n\u2022\tWhen Lytan comes into\
      \ your party, he he woefully underequipped.  His equipment is weak, and two\
      \ slots are totally empty.  He was a fair fight against you earlier, has a unique\
      \ flying ship, and raids places frequently, but can't get basic defensive gear?\
      \  \n\u2022\tHidden rooms and areas don't only hide secrets and treasure, but\
      \ sometimes require you to find them to progress in the game.  That can be annoying,\
      \ since there's not always a clear indication where a fake wall is.  \n\u2022\
      \tDespite moving through different areas and facing new enemies, the HP of enemies\
      \ don't increase as often as I'd expect.  For instance, much of the early game\
      \ consists of enemies with 40-50 HP.  \n\u2022\tWhen going through the Black\
      \ Snake Base area, you descend the same exact room TEN TIMES, with no indication\
      \ anything is happening.  I thought it was either a puzzle or a glitch at first!\n\
      \n\n[h1] Conclusion: [/h1] \nThis game has several design flaws, with little\
      \ sense as to why these mistakes were made by a developer with this many titles\
      \ already under its belt.  Even the title seems to be an error, since the game\
      \ is clearly called Wind Child Black, and the sequel is supposed to be Wind\
      \ Child White.  The sequel is in theory a WIP, but very little information is\
      \ available now.  Frankly, though I enjoyed the characters and story as I played\
      \ through the game, I can't recommend it with the various mistakes and flaws\
      \ it has.  Personally, if the sequel is released sometime soon, I would want\
      \ to play it just to see how the story wraps up.  However, having finished this\
      \ game, I feel invested.  For those who haven't done so, I see no reason to\
      \ get this game, whether the sequel does or doesn't get released."
