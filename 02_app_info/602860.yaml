      \ The house of Tokugawa launched a military campaign to seize the emperor's\

    review: "This covers the Japanese civil conflict that ended the Tokugawa Shogunate\
      \ and brought the Meiji Reformation into power. You might be familiar with it\
      \ from Total War: Shogun 2\u2019s Fall of the Samurai\u2026 or Tom Cruise\u2019\
      s movie The Last Samurai. Gameplay is not that intuitive, and without some guides\
      \ likely to be frustrating at times. Still seems a decent enough game. Also,\
      \ I got it for $1, so, I\u2019m not too disappointed\u2026"
