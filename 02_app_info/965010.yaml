    review: 'There are times when you take a chance on a seemingly overlooked title
      and it pays off. I found Trinoline on VNDB by investigating all VN''s with the
      highly animated sprites tag. Although there are moments when the story dragged
      out or got a little too serious about some "deeper meaning" nonsense, overall
      it was very entertaining.


      The main focus is about memories defining "who" someone is, the meaning of life,
      death, and happiness, and the role of sentient AI. Yes it is a bit over the
      top with philosophy, but the characters are interesting enough to make that
      forgivable. If you liked SOMA and enjoy lengthy VN''s, then you will probably
      find enough enjoyment to make this VN worthwhile.


      The adult content is extremely vanilla and honestly skippable, but it is free
      on the publisher''s web site.


      Shirone best waifu. AI waifus for the win!'
