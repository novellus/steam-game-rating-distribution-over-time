I take my photos, enlarge them and then edit them as required.  Many photos can really be 'enhanced' by cropping them (I may rotate them a few degrees first in another application), then enlarging them to the max. my system can handle (I have 2 to 32GB RAM depending on which system I'm using) to enhance details.  Very easy to use controls, handy \"MB/GB\" indicator based upon zoom level, many options for the models used for the 'zoom' as well as many options (I usually select mine to decrease noise).\n\nI save them then use photo editors, makeup programs and photo-story applications to get my desired output.  A 'must have' for those travelling taking family, nature and other photos.\n\nNote: I paid for this application with my own funds.  It's solely based upon my experience with it; I do not work for that company or know anyone working there.","timestamp_created":1562266794,"timestamp_updated":1562266956,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjr6X3+sCcMmozAE="}
