The only downside is shared with most VR puzzle games- it is fairly short compared to its 2D cousins. My first playthrough was about 80 minutes, and I found the play very smooth due to playing a lot of similar games, so that is likely on the shorter side. Determine for yourself whether that means this is a full-price or on-sale buy. I am about to play it again, despite the fact that I know it will be the same puzzles, for what that's worth. Enjoy!","timestamp_created":1608873573,"timestamp_updated":1608873573,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qM+VzPYCeoT7vAI="}
