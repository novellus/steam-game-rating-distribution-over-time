    reviews: "\u201CIt\u2019s as close to living The Blue Planet as I\u2019m going\
      \ to get...While the game has a clear mission structure, exploration is encouraged,\
      \ often leading to hidden secrets that provide more information and background\
      \ for the story. The ocean is beautifully realized with waving kelp forests,\
      \ open expanses of water, deep sea caves, and plenty of sea life. In the first\
      \ stage I felt an overwhelming feeling of exposure, like I was somewhere I shouldn\u2019\
      t be. It\u2019s very effective.  The best learning experiences are often those\
      \ where you don\u2019t know you\u2019re learning, and Operation Apex\u2019s\
      \ conservational message is sufficiently subtle to not be the sole reason for\
      \ the game\u2019s existence, while at the same time provoking thought. It\u2019\
      s a complex juggling act that Curiscope has managed well.\u201D<br><a href=\"\

      Where Apex really sets itself apart is with its bait system. While some wildlife\
      \ can be scanned with ease, others need to be lured over with the relevant types\
      \ of food. You create the bait using holographic projections known as mimics,\
      \ which you\u2019ll gain when you scan creatures. To attract a tuna, for example,\
      \ you\u2019ll first have to scan a smaller swarm of fish that look tasty, like\
      \ sardines. Crucially, the mechanics behind Apex are simple fun. Scanning a\
      \ group of fish means maintaining a distance close enough for your scanner while\
      \ also far enough away not to scare the fish, and you\u2019ll have to scan multiple\
      \ specimens very quickly, otherwise you\u2019ll need to start over...Operation\
      \ Apex is a great example of how VR can be used for good, make an impact and\
      \ yet still provide the same simple thrills of a solid videogame. Fallout 4\
      \ VR may be about to drop hours of content onto your HTC Vive but, in many ways,\
      \ this is a much better demonstration of what VR is really capable of.\u201D\

      Even though I\u2019ve now completed the \u201Cquest\u201D I can see myself going\
      \ back and just enjoying the experience some more\u2026 there\u2019s a sense\
      \ of peace to be had in the depths away from other concerns. Sitting on the\
      \ floor of the ocean watching the fish school above you.\u201D<br>76/100 \u2013\
