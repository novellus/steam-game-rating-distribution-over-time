    about_the_game: "Company of Crime is a criminal empire-builder featuring tactical\
      \ turn-based missions. It<br>takes place in 1960s London, the cultural capital\
      \ of the world and home to a plethora of<br>subcultures and businesses. Your\
      \ task is to build a company that will own<br>the criminal underworld, or if\
      \ you play as the chief inspector of Scotland Yard\u2019s famous Flying Squad,\
      \ tear it down piece by piece. In the process you will go to pubs, clubs, vets,\
      \ tailors, harbors and many other locations as you expand your influence over\
      \ the city. Your team consists of either gang members possessing the different\
      \ skills required to pull off criminal tasks, or detectives that have mastered\
      \ the art of investigation. The big question is ultimately this: who will take\
      \ London?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features:</h2><br><u><strong>Tactical turn-based\
      \ melee combat</strong></u><br>With a focus on melee combat and tight spaces,\
      \ Company of Crime sets itself apart from other tactical turn-based strategy\
      \ games. Units have a zone of control that makes them tied to the choices you\
      \ make. Block enemy movements, build superiority in numbers, and gain flanking\
      \ bonuses by attacking from behind. You can even kick enemies where the sun\
      \ doesn\u2019t shine to create safe passageways to units that would otherwise\
      \ get free attacks. If someone grabs a gun, either find cover or go after them\
      \ to wrestle it away before the bodies start piling up.<br><br><u><strong>Heat\
      \ mechanics</strong></u><br>When doing your dirty business, you\u2019d be wise\
      \ to silently extort your way through the underworld. Loud gunfire or shooting\
      \ enemies will only attract more opposition, and a criminal empire that blows\
      \ its cover won\u2019t go far. Fighting the outcome of too much heat is always\
      \ more difficult than avoiding it, and if things get too tough, you better have\
      \ some leverage to get the cops off your back.<br><br><u><strong>Level progression</strong></u><br>This\
      \ is more than just cops and robbers. Whatever the mission is, there is level\
      \ progression beyond just hit points and stamina. Beating up the owner of a\
      \ pub is one thing, but you can\u2019t just bail before the police arrive. You\u2019\
      ll have to first assemble any evidence that will prove it was you at the crime\
      \ scene before jetting.<br><br><u><strong>Building legit business with criminal\
      \ means</strong></u><br>Building a criminal empire requires a legitimate cover.\
      \ Progression of the game takes place as you\u2026 ahem\u2026 \u201Cconvince\u201D\
      \ people to sell their businesses and homes to you at a bargain price, or at\
      \ least turn a blind eye to what you do in their back room. Owning more locations\
      \ will unlock more items, features, and elements, but will also potentially\
      \ expose you to a surprise attack from the police or a rival criminal family.<br><br><u><strong>Not\
      \ just your own story</strong></u><br>While your task is to create an empire\
      \ of crime or to tear it down, this is not just your story. This is a story\
      \ of 1960s London with beatniks, mods, lemonheads, rockers and every other cultural\
      \ identity of the time. It\u2019s also a story of a falling empire. The Cold\
      \ War UK is shining in the cultural world, but is facing ever-increasing pressure\
      \ from inside and out. There is a mysterious order trying to tear down the British\
      \ Empire from the shadows, and who better to fight it than experts of the underworld\
      \ and the famous Flying Squad.<br><br><u><strong>Reactive Police</strong></u><br>Shady\
      \ business takes place in obscurity, so police gameplay is more reactive. You\
      \ get the call only when violence takes place, but that\u2019s not the best\
      \ way to find evidence against the criminal families. Assign sergeants to discover\
      \ shady places, speak with informants, and apply for search warrants to raid\
      \ questionable locales. Make sure they don\u2019t burn the evidence before you\
      \ manage to arrest them, or they\u2019ll walk free as quickly as they were taken\
      \ in."
