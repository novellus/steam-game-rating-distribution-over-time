    review: "Yes you'd think that with not far off 200 hrs gameplay it would get a\
      \ thumbs up from me but, There's no guides & as far as I can tell nowhere to\
      \ get info on several achievements I have no clue how to get, It's beyond annoying.\
      \ \n\nAnother thing I have an issue with is how it keeps asking you to rate\
      \ the game while you're in game but if you decide to do a review while in game\
      \ it blocks you from giving negative reviews."
