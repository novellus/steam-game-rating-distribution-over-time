    about_the_game: This session lets you jump straight in and drive the Southern
      Pacific GE CW44-9 in 'easy' or 'realistic' mode.<br><br>For the full experience,
      select 'Realistic Mode' and start driving this beautiful locomotive!<br><br>The
      GE C44-9W is a 4,400 hp (3,281 kW) diesel-electric locomotive built by GE Transportation
      Systems of Erie, Pennsylvania. Keeping in tradition with GE's locomotive series
      nicknames beginning with the Dash 7 of the 1970s, the C44-9W was dubbed the
      Dash 9 upon its debut in 1993. The design has since proven popular with North
      American railroads. Because of more stringent emissions requirements that came
      into effect in the United States on January 1, 2005, the Dash 9-44CW has been
      replaced in production by the GE ES44DC.<br><br>Many North American railroads
      have ordered the C44-9W. They were originally ordered by Chicago &amp; North
      Western Railway, Santa Fe, BNSF, CSX, Southern Pacific, Canadian National Railway,
      BC Rail, and Union Pacific Railroad. Norfolk Southern purchased the very similar
      Dash 9-40CWs.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features Include</h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Full
