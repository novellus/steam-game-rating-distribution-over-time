I can see the value in purchasing this game to play by yourself or with a friend. However, I also see the game (potentially) getting a bit stale if you are mostly maxed out on the upgrades. But without the upgrades, the game will probably be too hard to complete. The levels do get harder with new enemies, but if you plan your upgrades according to how you play and how you want to play, you'll be okay.\n\nThe graphics of the game are very pretty for a 2D game and not tremedously difficult to see what is going on. IE: no color confusion as the enemies are brightly colored. One thing that does meld is the ammo crate where you get the lazer gun. That can be easy to miss if you are focused on shooting things as the crate is gray like the ground. Also, not too sure how you get between the freezing grenade vs the stimulus, not sure how one gets provoked vs the other.\n\nOverall, still a fun game to enjoy.","timestamp_created":1487391577,"timestamp_updated":1487391767,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nafdp9oCd6O4cg=="}
