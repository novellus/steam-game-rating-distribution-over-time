Maybe some quick battles, but that was it.\n\nBut with the addition of Warhammer and monsters, magic and other cool things, this Total War is just so cool that I literally couldn't stop playing it!\n\nDiversity on races and factions, all of them with their strengths and weakness from which you have to create an strategy and plus the epic battles of humans vs green skins or undead armies, or wood elves or whatever. This is just way too cool!\n\nOne complaint , however, is that the grand campaign is equally overwhelming and tiresome as the previous Total War games (however, the addition of RPG elements like quests and collecting magical items for your lord or Hero characters is really well done and I like it); some of the factions will literally get too strong for you to beat while facing others ones, which is not really cool after some weeks of playing a particular saved game.\n\nAnother complaint (and this is one that really upsets me) is that if you want the special regiments of renow (which is supposed to be free DLC) you are forced to subscribe to Total War website in order to get it, and even then I was only able to get the DLC packages for Total War: Warhammer ll. To summarize, I was never able to play with regiments of renown, even though they are being used by CPU on the grand campaign. This is especially frustrating for me.\n\nBut overall, the game is really fun! Very rich on European culture from the Warhammer franchise and if you are a fan of J.R.R Tolkien or fantasy in general, you will love this game! ( Despite the flaws with its pve gameplay and \"free\" DLC.)\n\nI recommend it! \n\n","timestamp_created":1609900326,"timestamp_updated":1609900326,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx6/i6vYCerLxwAI="}
