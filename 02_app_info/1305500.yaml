    about_the_game: "Sleep walking through an open StarGate isn't the best of ways\
      \ to end up on a distant moon, especially when the StarGate closes behind you\

      \ finds himself in - not all, however, is as it seems; there is a greater purpose\
      \ at work here.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith innumerable references to classic adventure\
      \ games, science fiction and of course Pink Floyd, Captain Disaster in &quot;The\
      \ Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is a freeware, fully-voiced, light-hearted point\
      \ and click adventure game which will exercise both your grey matter and funny\
      \ bone. It's the first full adventure game to feature the Captain Disaster character,\
      \ who also stars in Captain Disaster in:  Death Has A Million Stomping Boots\
      \ - and hopefully many more games to come!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShould run okay\
