    review: "I've played quite a lot of horror games and this is one of my favourites.\
      \ Although the gameplay can be considered repetitive to some, I don't quite\
      \ agree, the house is constantly changing and you have to find something different\
      \ every day, this only helps to heighten the atmosphere of the game. \n\nI don't\
      \ often get uneasy at horror games but this one certainly did a goodjob, the\
      \ sound design is top tier especially. \n\nMy only complaint is in the later\
      \ end of the game you have a lot of the house to look around for the specific\
      \ item of that day and it can take a long time, however your character does\
      \ eventually say \"I heard something in the bathroom\" for example and this\
      \ gives you a clue as to where to go, but this can take quite a while to trigger."
