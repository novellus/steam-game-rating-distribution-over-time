    about_the_game: 'Jackie Shields wakes up to find everything in her world a little
      different than she remembers it. Trapped between her own dimension and a parallel
      one, she soon realizes that nothing can remain unchanged in her life. Not her
      friends, not her plans, and especially not herself...because the other dimension
      has a Jackie of its own!<br><br>Refraction is a visual novel by Universe Zero.
      Take on the role of Jackie as you try to navigate two parallel worlds, come
      into conflict with the alternate version of yourself, seek justice for a corrupt
      university president, and develop your relationships with your two best friends,
      Paul and Jun. Choose between two romantic routes--or no romance at all--and
      find a way to understand the nature of your transfer between dimensions...as
      well as what might be causing all of it. Will you be able to stop the worst
      from happening? Or will you be the cause of it?<br><br>Make a choice.<br><br>Content
      Note: Refraction contains references to incidents of sexual abuse as well as
      references to figures of authority utilizing their power to extract sexual favors
      from others. Player discretion advised.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1366060/extras/logo_01.png?t=1598615012"

    review: Refraction is a good visual novel with an interesting story line and a
      unique art style. The game has multiple endings and branching pathways throughout
      the game. This visual novel didn't contain any voice acting and while that wasn't
      an issue for me I know some players are picky about that sort of thing so I
      figured I would mention it. The game has icons at the bottom of the screen for
      saving loading and that sort of thing that initially had me confused but fortunately
      there is a help section that will tell you what the buttons do.  I'm a bit surprised
      this game hasn't gotten more attention. Hopefully people will read this review
      and give the game a chance like I did.
