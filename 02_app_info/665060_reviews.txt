I thought a tetrislike game with a triangle theme would be interesting. But it is a drag, there is no way to do combos or anything. The most interesting thing is that you can build upside-down triangles. A single level takes forever and fixing a mistake takes ages. After you cleard the black at the bottom, you have to build an ugly base, just to reach higher areas. All in all, playing is very unrewarding. \n\nThe controls (xbox controller or mouse and keyboard) are not even close to being snappy enough. It's like the gaming equivalent to a stutter: You have to repeatedly tap a direction to move a piece. And do you remember how you can rotate tetris pieces into place? Not here! \nThe graphics are between bland and ugly. The presentation is all over the place and reminds me of the 90s. Also, I found no way to increase the teeny weeny window size. \n\nThe music is not as bad though and there appear to be around a dozen tracks.\n\nThe \"how to play\" page leads me to think this is a port of a mobile game. The credits say, it was a one man project - Brian, I don't want to crush your spirits but this is not a game to be SOLD on steam. Please, keep on learning what makes a game interesting. Take Peggle as an example. The idea behind that game is not very hot but the presentation makes you come back for more. \n\nI'm going for a refund.","timestamp_created":1512649418,"timestamp_updated":1512649418,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.605409562587738037","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0cy7mOACe/K4kQE="}
