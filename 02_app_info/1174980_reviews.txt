Played around with Mutant for a bit and worked out some of it then with assistance from the developer/support & the user guide that recently got included even managed to get two computers rocking mutant in sync quite nicely producing some good sounds. (I have 2 computers with 22inch/23inch touchscreens and a dj mixer here so can also mess around dj'ing with various elements of 2 looping compositions). The recent update looks to have made it even better with the added sampler instrument and quantisation features - i can get drums played in time much easier now as  my timing is terrible (thank you for adding that in the update, still investigating new features but did also notice some sound editing parameters such as drum pitch/amplitude options are now included greatly increasing the sound palette - very nice touch thanks)  Looking forward to any future updates, was worth having when i first purchased it, now its even better.","timestamp_created":1593898044,"timestamp_updated":1593898044,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpsHujfMCdunrkgI="}
