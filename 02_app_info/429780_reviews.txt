However, that 350 hours was generated by a child that liked literally any game you gave them. And the appeal in the game to me was that I got to play with my friend.\nSo getting that out of the way,\n\npros:\n\nits a game\n\nbhop is cool right?\n\nuh it looks nice ig\n\nhas some pretty good maps\n\nmakes a good hide and seek platform if you have spent 350 hours finding problems with the maps\n\ncons:\n\nyou cant make maps.\n\nthere is no online leaderboard function.\n\nyour personal bests are stored in a file that is not easy to open with something like notepad.\n\ncheating is literally as simple as going into the game files and changing the gravity setting. which is in a simple .txt file.\n\nmovement is just horrid in many places.\n\nthe game basically thinks every edge is a massive slope causing random boosts both vertically and horizontally, which can cause you to not be able to beat your personal best and end good runs.\n\ninput lag problems beyond belief, the game is basically unplayable unless you turn down the resolution and play in a lower resolution.\n\nthe entire community was made up of about 30 people, which has been reducing since last time i was able to figure that out. which was probably 2 years ago.\n\nthe game is completely discontinued and its sequel was canceled.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nSo. CS:GO, C:SS, and soon to be Momentum Mod (public beta is pry good too) OR LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE, sound like a better option right? Yeah. So don't buy this. But if you really want to play it, go ahead and take every world record. Because you wont be proud of it, you probably wont enjoy it, and nobody will care because there is nobody to care.\n\ngood childhood game tho\n\nedit: just for extra clarity, \"there is nobody to care\" is not an exaggeration. the population of people who play this game is so small that it is rare to find someone in the (public) multiplayer lobbys. not even a joke, the PUBLIC MULTIPLAYER LOBBIES, is literally 0, on average. no exaggeration. reduced to atoms.","timestamp_created":1520284032,"timestamp_updated":1609406818,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7eSH3PYCfK3tmgE="}
