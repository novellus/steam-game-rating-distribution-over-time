    review: 'I like the expansion but there are 2 critical issues for me;


      For trading posts expansion we should always see requested bonuses for each
      power and their effects. Everytime clicking on trading posts card doesn''t make
      sense. Already visible area on the top can be used.


      Also when we get "1 gold token acts as any 2 chip" power there is a flaw. Assume
      I need 4 green to purchase a card, and I have 3 green and 1 gold chips. Game
      takes all the green chips then the gold chip. But instead I may choose 1 gold
      chip (which stands for 2 green chips because of power) and 2 green chips. So
      I still have 1 green chip available.'
