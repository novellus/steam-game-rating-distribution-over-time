    review: "This is more of a light adventure with some hog scenes. The adventure,\
      \ story part takes precedence  with some very unique puzzles thrown in . \n\
      It features  an engaging story about an often misjudged hero, of the 20th century\
      \  Tesla  and some parts of this story are true(well except for the time travel\
      \ etc.) \nI really enjoyed it, but it is a tough one. \nThe puzzles are not\
      \ exceedingly hard but really make the player think .\n I really tried to avoid\
      \ the skip button and it was so satisfying to succeed!  \nThere is a map but\
      \ no fast travel and indeed not much guidance , which is what adventure gamers\
      \ are used to! \nYou have to pay attention to what you find and read. \nThe\
      \ hogs are sporadic and not junk piles. \nHeartily recommended."
