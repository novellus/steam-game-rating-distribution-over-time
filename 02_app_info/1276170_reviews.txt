You don't get time to prepare, the enemies start spawning after seconds, and you need to get moving.\nThe enemies are just the right amount of bullet spongey to be difficult in groups larger than 6 or 7, but not soft enough that you can just swat away one or two. \nThe soundtrack is an energetic synth which I would consider using for a pleasant alarm in the morning.\nThe chaos in this game gives it hours of play time just in trying to learn the map's layout, and the common spawn points of the pills you need to collect to keep going.\nIt's an endless game, so get ready to keep trying to beat your best.\n\nSince originally writing this review, a new map has been released as an option - which completely changed up how I played and saw this game (for the better) by instead of being tight corridors was a wide open area. \nDon't let that fool you, though, there are two new enemies trying to get you to keep the intensity at max.","timestamp_created":1601549431,"timestamp_updated":1606376260,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514705896377563477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmpDfgfYCf5uXpQI="}
