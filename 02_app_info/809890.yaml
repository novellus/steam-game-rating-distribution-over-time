    review: "Impossible!!!\ncan this truly be the legendary review... from legend?!!!\n\
      such impudence!!!\nah ha ha ha, this is only a small fraction of the review,\
      \ prepare yourself for my final form!\nancient legendary shining resonance refrain\
      \ legendary special review!!!!\n\nThis is the kind of dialog you get.  Very\
      \ hokey and childish.  If you've never played an RPG before in your life, this\
      \ might have something new and exciting for you.  the story isn't groundbreaking\
      \ or even original.  so maybe it's about the characters.\n\nThe characters are\
      \ bland and deliver their lines like they're in a school play.  \"i am the shining\
      \ battlefield maiden of the purple orchid of the bloom in the grove of ancient\
      \ mystery, which uses forbidden techniques passed down through the corpowitz\
      \ family for 100 generations.\" or some such nonsense.  The characters try to\
      \ seem cool and confident, but it is a shallow facade as every one seems to\
      \ be surprised at any small developement they hadn't accounted for.  \"i am\
      \ certain i will emerge victorious at the hotdog eating contest, but what's\
      \ this?! they are using ketchup and not mustard?!  impossible!!!\"  \n\nStory's\
      \ not great, the characters are flat, but what about the verisimilude? well,\
      \ in the opening section of the game, the lady introduces herself as a knight\
      \ of someplace to a guard, after he fails to recognize her or her heraldry.\
      \  after he is killed and the next cutscene begins, having no witnesses remaining,\
      \ the offscreen guard says that's her the knight from the obscure place where\
      \ no one recognized her.  shortly after we meet the main character who is reluctant\
      \ to use his \"power.\"  Not because it comes with a price, but because he is\
      \ a cowardly baby.  we see his resolve crumble as he is in a most dire situation.\
      \  \"just this one time...i'll use my maximum force, because it's hopeless and\
      \ my life depends on it.\"  paraphrased, of course.  then you proceed to fight\
      \ 4 enemies with 2 people on your team.  so a 2 vs 1 fight is enough to make\
      \ his will crumble.  zero respect earned.  having moments earlier fought in\
      \ a 7vs1 fight as another character.\n\nThe graphics are low end, but not trash.\
      \  imagine a PSP game's graphics.  That's the quality here.  empty corridors\
      \ with pretty walls.\n\nthe audio is nothing special, but twice within an hour\
      \ of play, i encountered alarms that triggered in dialog where the annoying\
      \ sounds repeated for as long as dialog was on screen.\n\nIf you love cheesy\
      \ dialog, nonsensical logic, and much ado about nothing, this game is for you.\
      \  Otherwise, steer clear of this steaming pile."
