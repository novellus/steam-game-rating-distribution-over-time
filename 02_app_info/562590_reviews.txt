[/h1]\n\nAfter playing this game for a while, I discovered one thing:\n[u] This game is one of the most addicting games I've played in a long time! [/u]\n\nLet's take a look at some Pro's and Con's:\n\nPro's:\n[*] Very easy to use editor, but sadly, the hotbar is very small.\n[*] You dont have to buy anything more than once. You buy it for a sorta high price, and you can use it as much as you want.\n[*] The crafts control feels very good, it doesn't feel like youre sliding all over the place.\n[*] The Noob-Ship class doesn't feel underpowered at all. Of course, the specialised classes are better, but you can easily take down a shielded Battleship with a beginner ship.\n[*] No pay to win. Most ingame purchases are for skins only. The rest is Premium and \"Space Whiskey\" for more XP and Currency.\n[*] Class-specific abilities are surprisingly well balanced for a 2 week-old game, which is something a lot of dev's struggle with at first.\n\nCon's:\n[*] OMG the balancing is awful. Definetly something that has to be improved.\n[*] As of right now, the Gauss Cannons are very overpowered, especially using the Destroyer class.\n[*] The only gamemode so far is TDM, which is kind of a bummer, but I'm certain that that will change very quickly.\n[*] Leveling up in the higher levels feels very slow to me personally, but in the end, it extends the fun, so it isn't necessarily that bad.\n\nLong story short, this game hooked me really quickly and i cant wait to see it take off, 'cause it has a lot of potential. I can't wait to see it develop and get more fun after every update! It's definetly more fun if you play it with friends though, cause you can attack more efficiently. It's also very addicting. I keep telling myself: \"just one more game and I'm done!\", but that mostly just ends in me playing through a whole night (which totally didn't happen to me last night). \n\nNOW GO! This game won't download itself!","timestamp_created":1485801538,"timestamp_updated":1606828703,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.613785505294799805","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40Yedj/YCeL3wcA=="}
