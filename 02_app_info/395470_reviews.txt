I played on linux, and enjoyed it. Five chapter, that you have to go through begin to end (since there are no checkpoint saves). The story is ok, the journal logs unfold the story as the player proceeds through the chapters. The audio/music compartment is minimal, but the space ship atmosphere is preserved. I enjoyed the the fact that someone on the ship used to listen for classical music...Was tha Mozart? Boh.. The game is not very long I think one can finish it in about 3.5-4 h. My rating: 7/10, go play it.","timestamp_created":1604250533,"timestamp_updated":1604250533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yI+ywvUCdo7NqwI="}
