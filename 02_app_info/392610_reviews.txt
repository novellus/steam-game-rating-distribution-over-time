There are 5 levels of difficulty and the level is indicated for each puzzle. New bio-logic mechanics are introduced as you progress. \n\nEven though there is not much current activity in the discussion forum, Josh, the developer, still monitors it and has recently provided me with a hint at solving a puzzle I was having particular difficulties with.
