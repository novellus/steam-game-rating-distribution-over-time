    review: "this game is really incredible , great graphism , immersion and ideas\
      \ \nfirst great thing it is compatible too with the Oculus rift and the Oculus\
      \ touch\nsecond thing there is amazing mission where we are on a horse and first\
      \ it is like a beats em all but the best part is the bosses  it become like\
      \ a pursuit on our horse and where we can cross the spear swords \nand we can\
      \ use a wonderfull absolutely wonderfull magic \n this game is one of my best\
      \ experience in vr so i recommand a lot \nthe only things i would like would\
      \ be about adding three things would be really the welcome to do this game as\
      \ the best action pursuit game \n1) it seems or i have not seen in the option\
      \ of steam the playing area appear under the horse i will try to see in the\
      \ option of steam if i can not disable this but if no it decrease the immersion\
      \ \n\n2) only three spear swords but there is no big swords it would be great\
      \ to can have few big swords too\n\n3) the game need to have a follow the content\
      \ with coming soon seems abandonned since the game has been released there is\
      \ two years so only one character four stages and two spears \nbut if not in\
      \ the genre i think it is the best this game could easy to be a wonder and is\
      \ really close to be \nanyway i recommand and i don't understand how this incredible\
      \ experience have not a lot of feedback it is really strange since the great\
      \ quality of the game and isnce it is the only to propose such experience"
