    about_the_game: "Crystal core is a first person combat game made by individuals\
      \ who use unity3d engine to learn programming and modeling by themselves in\
      \ their spare time. This game has a higher degree of freedom and a larger map\
      \ than the former homeland game.<br />\r\nIn this game, players can freely explore\
      \ 9000000 square meters of the open world, and in subsequent updates, I will\
      \ continue to reduce a few blank areas in the map.<br />\r\nThere are all kinds\
      \ of boss here, such as stone man, tentacle monster,, mushroom man, giant dragon\
      \ and so on. They have different combat mechanisms, which are carefully designed\
      \ by me.<br />\r\nAlthough the plot line of this game is very short, only about\
      \ two hours, which tells the story of our protagonist changing himself after\
      \ a series of changes from an ordinary person who always swears, but in addition\
      \ to the plot of the main line task, you can explore the world by yourself and\
      \ walk out of a plot line that belongs to you!<br />\r\nIf you have just entered\
      \ the game and feel that this game is not fun, please don't rush to refund,\
      \ try to calm down and play for an hour first, and turn around on the map, maybe\
      \ you will find that this game is not so bad.<br />\r\n\u25C6 about this game:<br\
      \ />\r\nIn terms of modeling, I have adopted lowpoly style models, which are\
      \ all made by myself rather than downloaded from unity mall.<br />\r\nAfter\

      \ can upgrade your weapons and make them stronger. After upgrading weapons,\
      \ you can unlock skills.<br />\r\nIf the hunger value is 0, players will continue\
      \ to decline. You can go to restaurants or milk tea shops everywhere to buy\
      \ food to improve the hunger value.<br />\r\nEven if the weapon is upgraded\
