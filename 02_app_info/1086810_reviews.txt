In a good way of course! The game puzzles don't just grow in being harder but the images actually progress and change scenes while still keeping the same girl. From what I heard from the background, the music was pretty OK. The moving puzzles you can do at the end are a very nice plus as well. Would recommend this game!","timestamp_created":1606917142,"timestamp_updated":1606917142,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw37bukfYCdvbgtgI="}
