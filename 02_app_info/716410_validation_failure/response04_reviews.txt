The topic was well chosen, models done well, computer generated narrator was good.  However, there just isn't enough here to warrant $3.  I think this should have been more of a $1 experience.  There was not quite enough detail in the environment, and not enough area to explore.  Really just needs more of the same and a price reduction and this would be an easy recommend.  I'm still recommending it now to support the dev and encourage them to work on this more and develop more experiences like this.","timestamp_created":1518064864,"timestamp_updated":1518064864,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsPHtueECcLKlmAE="}
