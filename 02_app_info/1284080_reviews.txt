However i have played SPARTAN on retail version many hundreds of hours.\nLEGION is what I expected it to be, similar to SPARTAN in gameplay, interface, and visuals. I has less depth than SPARTAN, as the latter has a more elaborate diplomacy, more and different types of resources, a trade option and a  tech tree.\nBuy it on sale though, scenarios are limited and there is no grand campaign feature to conquer the ancient world.\nMore feedback to come as I push though the different scenarios","timestamp_created":1609883748,"timestamp_updated":1609883748,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6pCj6vYCfLDqwAI="}
