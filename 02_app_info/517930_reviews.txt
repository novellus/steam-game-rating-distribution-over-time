Being obsessed with all things antiquated, I had to give Castles of Dr. Creep a try. This game is NOT easy. Unless I'm just notgood at puzzleplatformers. Most likely both. I turned infinite lives on (conveniently available on the menu screen) and it stilltook me ninety minutesto beat the first castle.\n\nThis game requites patience and memorization as well as logical thinking. The pacing is slow, with a good amount of backtracking and repetition. It could take hours to beat all the casltes even with infinitelive lives. I enjoyed what I played of it so far and expect to return to it, preparing myself for some frustration when I do. That only makes it more satisfying when you finally win!\n\nI would recommend Castles of Dr. Creep to clever and devoted puzzle fans and to nostalgic gamers who remember it from its original release It's a faithful port of a well-made game, though it may not hook you when you first dive into it the way some games from the period do.","timestamp_created":1604488777,"timestamp_updated":1604488777,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40vm+yfUCe5+drAI="}
