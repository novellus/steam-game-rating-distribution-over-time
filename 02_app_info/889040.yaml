    about_the_game: FPV Air 2 is a quadcopter racing simulator for serious FPV racing
      pilots wanting a tool for meaningful flight practice. Don't let rain or lack
      of daylight keep you from practicing!<br>We have listened and learned from the
      mistakes of the first version of FPV Air, this sim addresses the major issues
      and solves all of them!<h2 class="bb_tag">Most realistic flight physics</h2>Through
      closer involvement in the FPV racing scene and inceased flight practice using
      the latest FPV quad's we have come up with a flight model that matches the feel
      and physics of modern FPV racing better than any other sim<h2 class="bb_tag">Most
      customizable flight physics</h2>Depending on the power and weight of quad a
      pilot is used to flying, a realistic flight experience can vary greatly from
      person to person. The flight model has been made accessible to users via an
      array of variables and parameters which pilots are free to tune and tweak. This
      allows pilots to match perfectly the expected performance. No other sim allows
      users to alter the physics of the flight model in such depth and magnitude<h2
      class="bb_tag">Best possible performance on low-end machines</h2>The sim has
      been tested and runs with a steady framerate on a US$200 laptop! Many FPV racers
      don't have high-end gaming rigs, so unlike all the others, FPV Air 2 is not
      super resource intensive, this sim aims to allow players on huge range of computers
      to fly smoothly!<h2 class="bb_tag">Configurator</h2>Rates, expo and other flight
      controller settings are all done through a familiar configurator interface based
      on the popular Betaflight interface. The sim uses the same rate calculations
      so there's no need to convert figures, simply enter the values into the menu
      as they appear in Betaflight and you can expect the sim quad to behave just
      like your real quad!<h2 class="bb_tag">Quick easy Control Setup</h2>The radio
      control configuration step of FPV sims is natoriously problematic, using a combination
      of input methods and automatic device detection we have tried to make that step
      as easy as possible (if even nescessary at all!)<h2 class="bb_tag">Online Multiplayer</h2>Easily
      host or join online games with the push of a button, no need to forward ports
      or perform any complicated setup<h2 class="bb_tag">More!</h2>Best lap recording,
      race against your fastest self.<br>Online global leaderboards<br>Lens warping/distortion
      aproximation<br>Realistic analog video effects<br>Diverse tracks to test and
      improve a wide range of racing manoeuvres<br><br>FPV Air 2 is the definitive
      quadcopter racing simulator for professional flight practice!

      even mentioning I''ve tried the Taranis, TGY I6s, xbox and  ps4 controller.
      None will work.

      Don''t waste your time and money.'
