    developer_response: Thanks for taking the time to write a review despite your
      brief experience with the game! Reaching Chapter 2 in 6 hours is quite unexpected.
      We've tried to address some of your questions in the forums, and we hope you
      give the rest of Exogenesis a chance and let us know what you think of it. :)

    review: "So I want to start out by saying that I don't think this is a bad game\
      \ by any means. I'm simply posting this because the most recent review was back\
      \ in like May of this year, 2020, and I thought it was important that any browsing\
      \ people have a more up to date idea of where the game was at after more than\
      \ a year of early access. I'm not a professional by any means, so I apologize\
      \ for anything that's not clear.\n\nI have played a lot of visual novels though,\
      \ so I have some good standards to compare to. However, I was aware that this\
      \ game wasn't a fully polished one when I bought it, so I went into it not expecting\
      \ perfection-I was prepared for a few glitches to pop up. I think there were\
      \ definitely some great aspects to it that I saw. The visuals seemed pretty\
      \ neat, the character models had a charm to them. I liked most of the voice\
      \ acting, and it matched up with the speed of the actual scrawling lines consistently.\
      \ These might seem small and obvious things, but again since this is isn't really\
      \ a complete game I entered really wary. I enjoyed the Prologue a lot. For me\
      \ the idea of a room to solve with the mini puzzles inside of them was a big\
      \ reason I did buy this since I really miss Zero Escape, and in that section\
      \ the puzzles seemed fun. \n\nHowever, Chapter 1 is where the cracks started\
      \ to show. The voice actor overlays started to disappear, first the side characters\
      \ and then the main ones, until the only sounds were the background music and\
      \ the environment-interaction responses. This made me a bit sad, but I kept\
      \ playing on anyway because I liked the game's potential. The solvable room\
      \ in Chapter 1 was also fun. However, the one in chapter 2 was truly an awful\
      \ experience. I'm keeping this an overview to avoid spoilers of course. In any\
      \ sort of solvable room like these things are, there are puzzles and clues to\
      \ how to approach them. However, almost of all the puzzles in the room had almost\
      \ no clues on how to approach them. A broad example-there are a lot of jumbled\
      \ up letters, and you need to write out the correct words from them. However,\
      \ there were absolutely no clues in the room that could have led me to the solution.\
      \ Things like that-most of the puzzles were like similar. One of them had a\
      \ clue associated with it but it was such an obscure hint that I still couldn't\
      \ make heads or tails of it. One of the puzzles gave you a clue but the clue\
      \ didn't directly match up correctly with the solution so you still had to work\
      \ on it confusedly afterwards. I only solved the room by looking up a guide,\
      \ which I despise doing, and even the person that I watched explained how it\
      \ was all not clear, and that he only solved it by trial and error. These are\
      \ of course my personal opinions, entirely possible there was something that\
      \ I missed or that it would make more sense to you.\n\nAnyway, that's a long-winded\
      \ way of saying that I didn't feel like that puzzle room was fair, which is\
      \ a big necessity for me with these types of games. Aside from that and the\
      \ voice line disappearing issue, there was one other big frustration for me.\
      \ Close to the end of chapter 2 it felt like-how do I put it. Like I'd hit a\
      \ checkpoint and the game assumed that because I'd hit that checkpoint that\
      \ I'd acquired all the information before it when I actually hadn't. Characters\
      \ started to talk about topics that I hadn't ever discussed with them, and they\
      \ did it in such a way that it was clear they were revisiting a previous conversation\
      \ we supposedly had had. I was left scratching my head trying to figure out\
      \ what I was supposed to know. And to be clear, it wasn't one of those moments\
      \ where a game intentionally makes things confusing for the sake of the plot\
      \ or mystery, it didn't feel like that at all. It genuinely felt as if the plot\
      \ was moving forward assuming that I knew something that I didn't. And not a\
      \ small detail or anything, but a very big plot point. This happened more than\
      \ once, so not an isolated event.\n\nI couldn't really continue at that point.\
      \ Again, I don't think this is a bad game, and it's entirely possible that the\
      \ dev's will reach out and fix the things I've brought up here. Since I did\
      \ stop at Chapter 2, it's also possible that the rest of the game is bug free\
      \ and wonderful, and that by stopping at 6 hours I'm missing a lot. I can't\
      \ really comment on the plot for similar reasons, just didn't experience enough.\
      \ I just wanted to share that as of this review, the game doesn't feel like\
      \ a complete enough one for me to recommend it to anyone or say they should\
      \ buy it for full price. Hope my experience helps any prospective people out\
      \ there. Make sure to decide for yourself whether you'll take a chance or not.\n\
      \nEDIT:  It has been brought to my attention that the voices disappearing  might\
      \ not have been a bug, but merely a result of extremely limited current voiced\
      \ lines in the game. Whether or not that changes your perspective is up to you.\
      \ Also, I'm an extremely fast reader so even though it took me 6 hours to get\
      \ through a large chunk of Chapter 2, it'll likely take most people a few extra\
      \ hours FYI."
