This helps to rectify my prior feelings about being locked out of the game, thank you. I will edit one final time if/when I get around to trying out YOSE.\n\nEDIT June 2016 - So this developer basically STOLE MY MONEY at this point. I went to check if any updates have been made, and they've completely removed this game from the Steam store, and replaced it with a \"Remastered\" version. And of course Steam won't give me a refund for this THEFT because it's more than two weeks old.\n\nI will never touch another game from this developer, EVER.\n\n(Previous review below.)\n\nThe game is promising, but was nothing like I was expecting when I bought it.  The biggest issues I have are related to game mechanics that waste the player's time:\n\nIf you have to quit the game in the middle of a mission, when you reload your save you will end up back at your base.  For missions with a time limit, this likely means you will fail because A) you can't get back out to the location and finish it before time is up, and B) something else will come up to prevent you from getting back out there, like another damn horde attack as soon as you load your game.\n\nGood luck taking care of a horde attack early in the game.  Gunfire just attracts MORE zombies, and melee weapons break too fast to do much good.  Zombies scale walls instantly even if barbed wire is on top, and barriers on doors and windows DISAPPEAR after an attack.  This makes reinforcement useless and stupid.","timestamp_created":1393352659,"timestamp_updated":1610003616,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502475738525390625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkLLs7fYCe76pIw=="}
