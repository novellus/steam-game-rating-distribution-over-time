And, well...\n\nMy initial thought is that it's painfully obvious how low-budget this game was. It's pretty clear to me that Krome Studios was probably in a pretty low place when they made Ty 4, and it shows. I don't think Krome was [i]trying[/i] to put out a low-quality game, they just didn't have the resources for something more ambitious. Blade Kitten didn't get as much as attention as Krome would've liked, I'm sure, and that one mobile game... I'm probably the only person here who's even heard of it. I'm amazed Krome even stayed afloat long enough to port the Ty games to Steam, though I'm glad they did. But Krome definitely wasn't ready to try to tackle a sequel. \n\n\n\nLet me at least get the positives out of the way. \n\nThe soundtrack is as wonderful and unique as ever, at least in my opinion. I always love the feel of Ty's music, the instrument choices, the motifs, it's always a delight. Even here, I still feel like they did a good job. \n\nThe art is pretty to look at, character designs are as interesting and unique as usual. You can actually pick from multiple characters and outfits if you're willing to buy them, which is a nice touch even if they don't do anything different. The way the designs mimic the concept art is actually pretty neat. But I have more to say about the art overall. \n\nThe level design is... usually pretty solid, at least as far as I've gotten. It still feels like there's a lot of secrets to dig up, even despite the restricted 2D environment. I'd argue it might've even done this better than the GBA games, though to be fair my memory of the GBA ports is shaky as it's been probably a decade or so.\n\n\n\nOn to the negatives, of which there's quite a few, sadly. \n\nThe rest of the sound design, other than music, is rough. A lot of it feels... jarring? I don't know how to express it exactly. One notable one though is the outhouse sound effect, which often sounds like it's... clipping? I think that's the word for it, but I'm not a sound design expert. \n\nWhile the art itself is nice, the actual [i]animation[/i] looks very cheap, like a bad After Effects puppet. Movement is stiff and sluggish, expressions are exaggerated weirdly. It all looks very fake, like you can tell it's individual static images being moved around. It can also be hard to separate foreground and background at times. \n\nWhen the level design is bad, it can be really bad. I think one good example is an invulnerable crab that you can't attack normally being right in front of a flamethrower so that you get punished for jumping over something you can't kill normally, and you can't hit the flamethrower guy either because the crab is in the way. There [i]is[/i] a way to kill the crab, but that's another issue I'll go into in a bit. There's also several platforms that you're supposed to be able to reach, but are juuuuust far enough away that you need to pretty much do a pixel perfect jump to reach, but also have a massive pit below so that if you screw it up you have to go all the way through half the level to reach it again.\n\nThe writing is very... bland. The interactions between characters were probably the biggest selling point to me in Ty 1-3. I loved the cheesy dialogue Ty had with the others. I feel like it's a lot more bland here. Mostly just telling you what you need to do, and that's it. Maybe it gets better later, but I can't really get through more than the first hour or two of the game due to its various problems to tell if the story overall is any good. \n\nThe gameplay. Well, it's pretty much standard fare for 2D Ty, but even though it's been a while, I still feel like the GBA games had a better feel. Switching rangs is obnoxious, as you can't scroll wheel through rangs. You have to press a key to bring up the menu, then key through them, THEN click the one you have selected. Even the radial menu in the 3D games feels better with keyboard and mouse than this. The midair controls are very sloppy. You have to constantly flip left and right if you want to just fall straight down. There's no deceleration when you release or switch directional keys, it just keeps or instantly switches your direction and momentum, making precise jumps a pain in the rear. Gliding is also a lot more of a pain as you tend to start dropping quickly. Oddly enough, your glide even works when you're short a rang or two, which is incredibly weird considering Ty always used the rangs to glide, so now it just looks like he sorta floats for no real reason. Speaking of floating, falling in this game is really slow. There's no weight to Ty when he impacts the ground and makes fall damage hard to believe, plus it's just annoying. Movement in general feels slow, in fact, and coupled with the sluggish animations, it makes the whole game just feel really slow and not fluid at all. The game also gives you a power attack that briefly slows down time (too much, again making the game feel sluggish) and lets you aim even in midair, but there's a problem... for some reason, it costs money to use. While it's not an extreme amount, it still chips away at your cash, and enemies killed with it rarely, if ever, give back enough to compensate. It can definitely chip away at your funds in levels with a lot of sturdier enemies. It also doesn't really make for a very strategic limitation. As long as you do have the cash, you can spam it all day if you really wanted to, though honestly the start-up time should be restriction enough, but if they had to add one, just use a cooldown.\n\n\nOverall, I find Ty 4 just too rough to recommend, unless you just want to support the developers, which I can understand. Still, I'd only recommend for that reason, and not to actually play. For that reason, I know Krome Studios wants to move on from Ty 4, but if they make another 3D game, they should really consider remaking Ty 4 from scratch in 3D so that people don't get utterly confused when they see Fluffy show up again, or alternatively ditch Ty 4 entirely and have the next game retcon it. Considering only perhaps a few hundred people have played Ty 4, a large majority of the audience would just end up confused otherwise. Heck, the FAQ has even asked several times when Ty 4 is coming out, if there's plans for it, etc, with the devs having to explain that Ty 4 already exists. Ty 4 was a complete and utter market failure, and trying to continue off of it just feels like setting oneself up for failure. Reworking it from scratch in 3D both in terms of writing and gameplay, or making an entirely new Ty game that retcons it, after the attention from the remastered ports, seems like a much more viable option right now. But there is definitely reason that this 2D Ty 4 game did not sell well, and I just cannot recommend playing it.","timestamp_created":1607721006,"timestamp_updated":1607721019,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45/zoqfYCeYicuQI="}
