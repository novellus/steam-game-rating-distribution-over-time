    review: "I cannot stress that the Synthwave mix with Retrowave music in this game\
      \ is phenomenal. The composers did a wonderful job, of making this on the verge\
      \ of a dystopian future world, feel like there was weight to every choice. Highly\
      \ recommended.\n\n[h1] Music [/h1]\n[olist]\n[*] Welcome to Neo-SF: A start\
      \ to what the soundtrack will be, a slow, somber vaporwave start, with electric\
      \ trumpets to boot. Possibly theremins. \n[*] Main theme (Neo-SF Streets Mix):\
      \ A remix of the commercialized song. Pretty up beat and and with great snares.\n\
      [*]  Turing's Theme: Cute theme for the best robowaifu, better than Whisper,\
      \ has little water drop sounds going on in the background, as the Turing's head\
      \ does look like a water drop.\n[*]  Scrubbing For Clues: Funky synthwave mix\
      \ that you'll be listening to quite a bit, this is one of the prominent songs.\
      \ Pretty catchy.\n[*] Club Stardust: Another prominent song in the game, you'll\
      \ get used to this song if you're trying for a 100% run, synthjazz primary instrument\
      \ is an electric wind instrument.\n[*] Home (Not) Sweet Home: One of the first\
      \ songs you hear once in control of our player character. Reminds me of a Synthblues/jazz,\
      \ primary instrument is an electric sax, and it makes sense. The player-character's\
      \ house is a disgusting mess.\n[*]  Both Sides Of The Law (TOMCAT's Theme):\
      \ I can't not think of Springman's theme from Megaman 7. It makes sense, first\
      \ lawbreaker we meet who is one of the more lawfully good characters in the\
      \ game.\n[*] Step Careful (Lexi's Theme): The first character that things could\
      \ go wrong with, and Lexi's theme has a beat that I feel is supposed to represent\
      \ a racing heart. She is a cop after all, all cops are bastards. The electric\
      \ guitar is a great addition to the song.\n[*] Read Only Memories (Piano Theme):\
      \ Great song for when the party loses their lead, and things seem at their worst.\
      \ The single electric piano playing Streets of Neo-SF is great.\n[*] Intimidation\
      \ Tactics: The repeating beat is increased in volume, speed, and eventually\
      \ instruments, as this song reaches its end.\n[*] The Park, Dayside: Very mallsoft\
      \ sounding, like those shopping malls in California that have hidden speakers\
      \ in the bushes and rocks.\n[*] ROM User Setup: About 30 minutes or so in the\
      \ game, we get our character customization, which in this game is more attune\
      \ to selecting NPC dialogue options, as you don't ever see or hear your character,\
      \ the only thing that changes is the pronouns used. This funky jam is quite\
      \ fun to listen to.\n[*] Stardust Hybrid Night: Very upbeat hip-hop song for\
      \ the club, its sad you hear this one once, as it's one of my favorites.\n[*]\
      \  Catch Me First!: Nostalgic for me, reminds me of those third scenario in\
      \ the original Megaman Battle Network, having to stop the bus that's gone off\
      \ the rails by manipulating the stoplights. In fact...\n[*] Hassy Bar: Another\
      \ mallsoft snyth song, very good shop song for a video game, however if I'm\
      \ not mistaken, you don't ever buy anything there.\n[*]  Troublemakers: Classic\
      \ FM synth jam that has quite a mellow rhythm.\n[*] Distant Scenery: Great transitional\
      \ song, with what I presume to be a real saxophone, accompanied by the use of\
      \ some electronic sounds to emphasize the night sky.\n[*]  Saving The World\
      \ (Jess' Theme): A harsh fast tempo song, accompanied by an electric guitar,\
      \ symbolizing this characters brutal and angry outlook on an equally brutal\
      \ and uncaring world.\n[*]  Neo-SF Medical: Interesting mysterious and anxiety\
      \ riddled beat, reflecting the position of the game at this moment.\n[*] Street\
      \ Action: Song features some up front electric-chimes, and a beat that once\
      \ again feels like it could be in a Megaman level.\n[*]  Strange Developments:\
      \ A sad slow song, as harsh mysteries are solved with unpleasant revelations\n\
      [*] Tell Me Your Story: one of my favorite songs to start off a sleepytime playlist\
      \ with. An electric harp and piano are prominent here, as the fog begins to\
      \ clear on some mysteries the player wasn't even aware of.\n[*]  More Than Words\
      \ Can Say: This is a slow melancholy song.\n[*]  Turing's Sadness: As if to\
      \ continue on from the previous song, this song features more synth instruments\
      \ with a very slow melody.\n[*]  Media Blues: More relaxed from the previous\
      \ 2 songs, it features a nice conjecture into a more upbeat and inspired set.\n\
      [*]   Office Politics: Strange song, as tensions rise the song seems  to be\
      \ off note intentionally to raise stress.\n[*] Tension: As the previous song\
      \ lead into, this song is fast, it doesn't follow a solid beat, and a lot of\
      \ electric distortion accompanies the main instruments: snare, piano, some sort\
      \ of electric bass.\n[*] Flower of Decadence: This song features an avant-garde-esque\
      \ take on classical bougie music with a cast of completely synthetic instruments.\n\
      [*]  RAP ONLY MEMORIES: A rendition to Welcome to Neo-SF, Main Theme (Neo-SF\
      \ Streets Mix) with a funky mix, a lot of classic hip-hop tropes, including\
      \ disk scratching, voices used as background instruments, etc etc.\n[*] Do It\
      \ 4 The Moolah: \"I got shots ya'll and they don't stop, I got beats ya'll and\
      \ they don't stop\" Another funky hip hop song featuring a lot of theremin and\
      \ electric pianos\n[*]  There Would Be Thousands (Main Theme Higher Mix): Another\
      \ rendition of Welcome to Neo-SF, Main Theme (Neo-SF Streets Mix), and RAP ONLY\
      \ MEMORIES. This version is a bit slower, and features a higher tone electric\
      \ guitar as the primary instrument.\n[*]  Data Heist: This song is a real kicker,\
      \ starts off somewhat scary, turns into a bop.\n[*] The Final Run: This is one\
      \ of my favorite songs, it's very romantic jazz, featuring a sax and bass, beautiful.\n\
      [*]  Lead The Way Into The Heart: Interesting song title for this one, very\
      \ psychedelic vibes, weird warping of the sound track, probably musical terms\
      \ I just don't know the definitions of.\n[*]  Tunnel Battle: This song takes\
      \ me back to the Turtles in Time game for the SNES, a loud electric organ leads\
      \ this fast tempo song.\n[*]  Player's Choice!: An actually scarey atmospheric\
      \ song, it has what sounds like metallic breathing, distant chattering, accompanied\
      \ by a beat that sounds like a heart beat, some off-putting laughing and whirring.\
      \ Quite a good thematic song.\n[*]  Turing's Way: This song features what sounds\
      \ like a heavenly chorus of voices singing a hymn if said voices had been shoved\
      \ through a computer, and it reflects the tragedy in the game.\n[*]  WINTERMUTE.LIP:\
      \ Continuing from the previous song, this song is distorted uneven and has the\
      \ sounds of whirring machines crashing, exploading, and shortcircuting.\n[*]\
      \ Epilogue (Easy Way): Nice synthbeach jam, acompaneid by what I believe to\
      \ be an electric pedal steel guitar.\n[*] Epilogue (Hard Way): Sadder version\
      \ of the previous song, featuring a lot of the same instruments, but accompanied\
      \ by a lot more base than anything else.\n[*] Love Me Better (ft. S A M M U\
      \ S, Heather Plunkett and the Neo-SF Choir): Another remix of the There Would\
      \ Be Thousands (Main Theme Higher Mix), Welcome to Neo-SF, Main Theme (Neo-SF\
      \ Streets Mix), and RAP ONLY MEMORIES. This is no joke a great and well composed\
      \ theme, this song features 2 primary singers, whom give this a nice Black Eyed\
      \ Peas style rendition, just funky.\n[*] You're The One Who's Spoiled Everything:\
      \ Once again we have a remix of the Love Me Better (ft. S A M M U S, Heather\
      \ Plunkett and the Neo-SF Choir), There Would Be Thousands (Main Theme Higher\
      \ Mix), Welcome to Neo-SF, Main Theme (Neo-SF Streets Mix), and RAP ONLY MEMORIES.\
      \ This time we have just a completely off tone version of the song, accompanied\
      \ by amazing doots and deets, makes my skeleton just jingle.\n[*] 2064 Theme:\
      \ We know what it is, you know what it is, another remix of You're The One Who's\
      \ Spoiled Everything, Love Me Better (ft. S A M M U S, Heather Plunkett and\
      \ the Neo-SF Choir), There Would Be Thousands (Main Theme Higher Mix), Welcome\
      \ to Neo-SF, Main Theme (Neo-SF Streets Mix), and RAP ONLY MEMORIES. This time\
      \ we have a high pitched electric sound, feels like they were\n[/olist]"
