    review: 'This game is basically inFAMOUS: First Light, but way less polished (in
      terms of gameplay).


      Pros:


      - Good concept

      - Good core gameplay, but nothing you can''t experience in other games (again,
      First Light most notably)

      - Decent OST



      Mid:


      - The story isn''t boring, it''s just... not that exciting, tbh. Same with the
      voices.



      Cons:


      - Forced combat is always a nono for me (for normal enemies I mean)

      - Some jumps are freaking annoying to make

      - Last but not least, I had to give up on the RAM boss (was it? the big guy
      with the axe? idk), waaaay too unfair and slow paced. Hitboxes suck everywhere
      too. Sometimes he''ll take attacks, sometimes he won''t, he can easily stun
      lock you with his axe throw, and the list goes on. And yeah, he just takes forever
      to kill. It''s not fun, it''s straight up tedious.


      Edit: I was able to kill that stupid boss above. Now in the second RAM level
      (the middle one) and it has a really stupid puzzle I can''t figure out for the
      life of me. So yeah, that''s me done unless someone tells me how to do it I
      guess.



      Overall I''d definitely say the game is at least worth a shot. That price point
      though... a bit too much imo. Go for it if you have some disposable cash I guess,
      eh.'
