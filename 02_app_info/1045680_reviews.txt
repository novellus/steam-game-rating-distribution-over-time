I'd like to choose wether I want to get married, to have children, or to divorce. Oh my, the divorce event is the worst in the whole game.\nWhy do I have to upgrade a category to its end to see what's best to invest in? That's all lost time.\n\nIf you want to break the game, it's as easy as getting a professional job (alright, that's realistic, but you get old in the meantime).\nOr just get an unskilled job, while you mine crypto (with the same hardware for decades, that never breaks down, and that's always up to the task), and use Penny stocks or any commodity. Yes, because both will give you an average 23/27% return year over year, making the whole game very repetitive at that point.\nCome on, everybody knows that you can't earn so easily from Penny stocks, even if you spend 90 months of your life studying them.\n\nThere are a few bugs: if you edit the music/effects volume changes, and then you go to the menu, they go back to default; if you go to the menu, the game window resizes itself, every single time; there is no fullscreen.\n\nBut, honestly, there isn't much more on Steam for people who enjoy finance game, and it's fun and easy to play.\nI think its price is perfectly reasonable.\nOverall, I'm glad I bought it.","timestamp_created":1597752019,"timestamp_updated":1597752019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g6HcgPQCc4manAI="}
