    about_the_game: In Armoured Commander II, you play the role of a tank commander
      in World War II, leading your crew through a campaign in one of the major conflicts
      of the war. ArmCom2 features over a dozen campaigns set between 1939 and 1945,
      and over three hundred vehicle, gun, and infantry unit types. The terrain map
      for each combat day and the types of enemies you encounter are randomly and
      procedurally generated, which means that each playthrough of a campaign will
      bring new and unexpected challenges. Your commander and crew gain experience
      and can improve their stats and gain skills over time, but they are also vulnerable
      to injury and may be seriously wounded or killed during the course of a campaign.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Visual Style and Gameplay</h2><br>The visual style of the game
      follows the roguelike approach of using a character set rather than bitmap graphics.
      All in-game displays are rendered using a modified and expanded Petscii character
      set, as used in the Commodore 64. This keeps the focus on the gameplay rather
      than on graphic effects. Sound effects are also generated using samples from
      the C64's SID sound chip.<br><br>The gameplay is turn-based, so you can pause
      and consider your options at any point in the game. You can also save and continue
      your game at any point, and can have one saved game per campaign type. You can
      choose to take on the role of your Commander, meaning that if your Commander
      is killed in the game your campaign ends (Permadeath), or you can continue playing
      through an entire campaign, replacing your tank and crew as needed.<h2 class="bb_tag">Early
      Access</h2><br>Armoured Commander II is currently a playable game, but I do
      want to continue to refine and expand the game further. I have continued to
      develop the game since its Early Access release, adding new campaigns, nations,
      and so on. All future additions to the game will be free to anyone who has purchased
      the game.<h2 class="bb_tag">Roadmap for the Future</h2><br>Moving forward, I
      plan on adding campaigns covering all the major theatres of the war, including
      appropriate historical unit types, and new game mechanics for them where appropriate.
      After the game leaves Early Access, I'd also like to expand the range of campaigns
      beyond this, to include the Pacific and South-east Asian theatres, and perhaps
      one day, earlier time periods like the Spanish Civil War, and later ones such
      as the Korean War.

    review: I am constantly on the hunt for a great tank sim and, while other games
      have done certain elements better (mainly by the grace of being 3D), this is
      the best I have found for that 'on the ground' feeling. If you can look past
      the graphics, you basically have a campaign in the same vein as something like
      IL-2 where you have a real sense of being a participant in a much grander campaign
      than you're witnessing firsthand. This is a game that revolves around critical
      choices, and this adds a level of authenticity I wasn't expecting. The first
      time I realized this wasn't a cute little tank game was when I was trading AP
      rounds with some German tanks in the open deserts of Tunisia when my main gun
      went down for the day, forcing me to make the decision of allowing my wing tanks
      to finish the fight or retreating before we took casualties. I opted to stay
      put and fight it out, which prompted two enemy Stukas to dive-bomb my position
      and kill my driver outright and wounded my loader, critically. As the tank filled
      with smoke and flames my TC hammered the enemy with suppressing fire and the
      gunner did his best to pull the loader to safety as the enemy continued to fire
      on our position, hitting my TC and killing him dead right there in the hatch.
      In just the nick of time the gunner ejected, hoping to assist the loader from
      the exterior. The fire was really burning by then, and I should have made the
      gunner run to safety (but no man left behind!), so he tried (and failed) to
      pull the loader from the open hatch as the stores of HE rounds ignited and sent
      my boys straight to hell. 10/10 will probably get hurt hundreds of more times
      before I am done with this game, well worth the $8, I wouldn't have been mad
      if I had paid $30 or more, and this dev has earned my respect for life.
