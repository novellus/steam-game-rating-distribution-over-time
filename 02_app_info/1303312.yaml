    review: 'The game is quite easy even at the most difficult level. It is also repetitive.
      A lot of time is spent taking over weakly defended rackets. This ends up just
      being a not very enjoyable grind after a while.


      The game is quite buggy. I think that loading the game is broken and it messes
      up the character stats to some extent. The game sometimes gets stuck and the
      only way around it is to load the saved game before it got stuck. The side missions
      sometimes cannot be completed because of bugs in the game too e.g. I was not
      able to find a character I was supposed to talk with in the building they were
      supposed to be in, Also, the computer characters make some very strange moves
      in combat e.g. the enemy boss sometimes runs up to a character to punch them
      instead of using its devastating special skill from distance.


      I am not sure I would recommend the deluxe pack as it provides very little over
      the base version. It gives powerful weapons from start, making the game even
      easier and less enjoyable. I wouldn''t strongly recommend the base version either
      - the game is very easy and very buggy.


      All that said, I did play it through with several characters and I enjoyed it.'
