You scroll through your library looking for a game that's a bit more on the easy side since it's getting fairly late at night. After scrolling through your library you come across a game that you haven't played in years. You remember it being easy, but for some reason you never got all of the achievements for it. Deciding to go back to it, you realize why you never finished.\n\n~~~~~~~~\n\nYes, I know you can [b]no longer purchase this game on Steam[/b] however, I still felt the need to review it for some unknown reason.\n\n[b]Spoiler-free[/b] review I guess? There really isn't a story to begin with.\n\nHonestly I don't know what possessed me to purchase this game in the first place. It's basically just a typing game with the [b]illusion of needing to type quickly[/b] to get far, however you can go too fast and not get a word prompt which will cause your rhythm to falter. Sure, if you aren't able to type fast enough for that to happen then it's not really an issue, however I found myself starting off fine but as I kept going I would hit this issue more and more frequently.\n\n[b]The graphics of the game look fine.[/b] The game itself looks like it should belong to a visual novel rather than a typing game. If that were the case, then it might've done better since it would [i]hopefully[/i] have a story, or at least [i]something[/i] to keep your attention. I found myself zoning out in the small break between stages and then realizing that I am, in fact, still playing a game. Even the graphics stop looking that great after you see the same monster or teammate 100+ times.\n\nI had [b]deleted my game when I stopped playing years ago, so I had to start from level and stage 0.[/b] According to Steam, I had played this game for [b]2.7 hours[/b] tonight. In that time I had done: [b]3 runs (deaths),[/b] gotten to [b]level 153,[/b] and gotten to [b]stage 375.[/b] I only kept playing for so long since my third run took ages for me to finally die. [b]I wanted to try until the very end despite my fingers hurting.[/b] I thought that it would help me when I [i]unfortunately[/i] return to the game tomorrow to finish the achievements. Yes, the achievements are the only reason why I have gone back to this game. I simply want to complete yet another game, even if I'm in physical pain by it. Am I a masochist? Perhaps. [b]Do I regret returning to this game? Definitely.[/b] If I had just chosen a different game then I wouldn't feel the need to finish it, hell I probably wouldn't have even regarded it. \n\nHonestly this game is just bad all around, the only exception being it's art looks fine. [b]If you have this game from a previous purchase don't return to it unless you're like me.[/b] It's really not worth it.
