    review: "To properly talk about this game, you\u2019re going to need a brief history\
      \ lesson. Around the mid-2000\u2019s, Starfish-SD got the license from Taito\
      \ (yes, the Taito that made Space Invaders and Bubble Bobble) to make a sequel\
      \ to an arcade game made by them called Kiki Kaikai, which is best known overseas\
      \ by its SNES adaptation, Pocky & Rocky. Things were going fairly swimmingly\u2026\
      \ until Square-Enix acquired Taito as a fully-owned subindustry. For whatever\
      \ reason, Square-Enix had a problem with it, and revoked the Kiki Kaikai license\
      \ from Starfish-SD, as well as other Taito licenses that other developers had\
      \ their hands on at the time (Balloon Pop on Wii/DS was a similar case, as that\
      \ was going to be a Pop\u2019n Pop sequel). After a bit of rocky development,\
      \ the game was finally released in 2007 as the game that you see here, albeit\
      \ called Heavenly Guardian (or Legend of Sayuki, if you\u2019re in Europe),\
      \ on PlayStation 2 and Wii. Learning about this and seeing gameplay of it, I\
      \ thought, \u201CMan, Square were a bunch of dickheads for not letting this\
      \ be a Kiki Kaikai sequel.\u201D And the pedigree that Starfish-SD had supported\
      \ my agenda, as it is made up of former Hot-B developers. If you go back even\
      \ further, Hot-B had a good business relationship with Taito, developing quite\
      \ a few games on Taito arcade hardware (one of these games, Monkey King: Master\
      \ of the Clouds, is also on Steam, even), and developing a couple ports of Taito\
      \ games (The Fairyland Story on MSX, Ka-Ge-Ki on Mega Drive, etc), so it sounded\
      \ like a good idea on paper that Starfish-SD had their hands on the Kiki Kaikai\
      \ license. 12 or so years later after its debut on PS2 and Wii, the game quietly\
      \ appears on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Steam. And now finally playing\
      \ the game via this new port\u2026 I think maybe Square-Enix and Taito were\
      \ right in revoking the Kiki Kaikai license.\n\nThe game\u2019s plot revolves\
      \ around a snow goddess, Sayuki, falling in love with a boy in a village. However,\
      \ the boy fell under a curse that puts him to sleep permanently, and it is up\
      \ to Sayuki to find the cure for the boy\u2019s curse. \n\nThe game should be\
      \ very familiar if you\u2019ve played Kiki Kaikai, but it lacks the finesse\
      \ of that game. It's a top-down shooter where you can shoot in any direction,\
      \ get the power-ups to improve your shots, etc. With all that aside, the gameplay\
      \ doesn\u2019t need much explaining. What does need explaining, however, is\
      \ some of the issues this game has.\n\nWhile the game might be adequate if you\u2019\
      ve never played any of the Kiki Kaikai games, it\u2019s pretty bad if you\u2019\
      ve played them. Cheap deaths, spotty hitboxes, and uneven diffitculty are just\
      \ a few of these problems. It stings even more that (from what I can tell) these\
      \ issues were also in the original PS2/Wii version, and they didn\u2019t bother\
      \ to fix it for this new version. The OST is also very forgettable unlike the\
      \ Kiki Kaikai games, which have pretty good OSTs, and the graphics themselves\
      \ are alright, but they could be better. The worst issue of all, and the one\
      \ that turns an average game into a pretty bad one, is the lack of any save\
      \ features. While this is an understandable design choice, given the nature\
      \ of most shoot-em-ups, which are usually meant to be beaten in under an hour,\
      \ it's pretty bad in this case. Mostly due to the game\u2019s difficulty, the\
      \ length of the levels, and the fact that you have to beat it twice to get the\
      \ best ending, a la Ghosts\u2019n Goblins. It does save high scores, but it's\
      \ rather pointless, as there's no stuff like leaderboards and whatnot anyways.\
      \ And again, this is something they could have added in this new port, but didn\u2019\
      t bother to, from what I can tell. \n\nSpeaking of the port, it\u2019s an awful\
      \ PC port. The game was ported over from (what I assume to be) a custom engine\
      \ into Unity, and while that isn\u2019t bad per se, it doesn\u2019t feel polished\
      \ like other ports that have done the same thing, like Final Fantasy IX PC.\
      \ The default Unity startup window is the only way you can configure your graphics\
      \ and controllers, and once you\u2019re in the game, you can\u2019t configure\
      \ them anymore until you quit out of the game (only via Alt-F4, lol) and start\
      \ it up again. The game is also presented in a 4:3 with boarders on the side,\
      \ and while that also really isn\u2019t an issue by itself, you can only use\
      \ 16:9 resolutions, with no way to play the game on 4:3 monitors without windowboxing.\
      \ \n\nOverall, while you might have some fun if you\u2019ve haven\u2019t played\
      \ a top-down shooter before, this game is really only worth looking at for the\
      \ history behind it, and even then, I\u2019d say wait for a sale.\n\nEdit (7/8/20):\
      \ The game apparently does have a save feature, at least in this new version.\
      \ Still doesn't solve the levels being too long though, as you have to beat\
      \ a level in order for it to save."
