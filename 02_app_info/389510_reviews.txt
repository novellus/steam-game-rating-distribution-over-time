Nowadays, it's very difficult to find a game that isn't bloated and filled with unnecessary crap! \nAlthough this game is very rich with features and eye candy, it never becomes too overwhelming. The controls are simple and the rules are clear. \n\nDespite its simple concept, the game has a lot of original features you can discover. The part I was most pleased with are the movies you can unlock after collecting a certain amount of points. This is where the artist in Paul really shines through. You can FEEL how much LOVE and PASSION went into this. This is what separates a work of art from a regular game. The movies kept me going even when times were tough, because I knew I had to see them all. They are well worth the grind.\n\nThere is one thing that irked me a little, though. I really wanted to collect all of the achievements, and I have them all... but one. While I do appreciate that there is a split-screen mode that encourages spending quality time with friends, I have not found a use for it. I tried playing both sides at the same time to get the achievement, but it is just too difficult. Please consider adding online matchmaking.\n\nAnother thing I would like to suggest is adding a way to learn more about the animals themselves. I am really interested in the lore of W.A.R. Maybe you could consider making a Dating Sim... or something like that, because I want to get to know them individually. \n\nAll in all, it was well worth the price. I got this game for 2,67â‚¬ on sale, what a steal!","timestamp_created":1609859243,"timestamp_updated":1609860445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tJ7K6fYCfdTcwAI="}
