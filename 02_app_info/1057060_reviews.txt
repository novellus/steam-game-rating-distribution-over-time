Own units regularly traffic jam and block each other, don't attack clearly visible enemies. UI is not even 1990s standard, lacks any remote feedback of what your orders do or don't.\n\nLooks extremely nice, but gameplay is nothing to enjoy. \n\nShould note i took my time viewing and playing the tutorials and use the game manual. But that won't help if your units don't excute what you order nor show any sign of remote intelligence.","timestamp_created":1609674257,"timestamp_updated":1609674257,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pv6D5PYCfcaFwAI="}
