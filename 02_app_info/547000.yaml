    developer_response: Wanted to thank you for your comments and review. We've addressed
      the speed and torpedo issues that you mentioned (including damage output), and
      we've also added new torpedo types that make killing enemies much easier. We
      are also working towards overhauling the Campaign Mode (which is what it sounds
      like you spent most of your time on). We agree that this particular aspect of
      the game is still lacking, and want to work to make it as satisfying as the
      endless Arcade Mode. We're glad you enjoy the theme and artwork and we really
      appreciate the constructive feedback. I'm glad to be able to say that we at
      least have some of it fixed now!

    review: I just got this game for PC and have played it for maybe an hour total.
      While it seems like it could get fun, the initial play is very slow, as in your
      little submarine moves very slowly. And many common enemies require a TON of
      damage before they die. So you're basically just pounding away with your very
      weak starter gun with no weapon upgrades. Some small bad guys take like 20 hits
      to die. The first boss is just a war of attrition for you to hold down your
      shooter and steer, bouncing around in this little room with the boss and your
      pea shooter. Boring. Not hard per se, just tedious. Also, there seems to be
      a bug where when you return to a saved game, if you hit the A button on your
      pad it freezes and you have forcibly shut down the program to get moving. All
      that being said, I like the graphics and the scatalogical theme. Just wish it
      were more fun.
