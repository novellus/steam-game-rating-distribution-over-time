    review: "Fofura de jogo! Recomendo 100%. O jogo consiste em combinar criaturinhas\
      \ em uma sequ\xEAncia de no m\xEDnimo tr\xEAs iguais, para que assim as mesmas\
      \ evoluam. Cada fase possui um objetivo diferente, e \xE0 medida que voc\xEA\
      \ passa, a dificuldade aumenta, e ao inv\xE9s de somente evoluir as criaturas,\
      \ voc\xEA ter\xE1 que evolu\xED-las para que elas matem os monstros de slime\
      \ que surgem. Para quem \xE9 f\xE3 de Bejeweled, este jogo vale muito a pena!"
