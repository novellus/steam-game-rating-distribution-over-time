      /><br>Jump into speedy hazard-packed robo battles with up to 15 other players
      where random series of synchronized events destroy the fighting arena. Everyone
      zooms around the level bumping, drifting, and flipping to become the ultimate
      winner by being the last one standing in an ongoing stage of madness. Join a
      sumo-inspired experience with a rush of energetic motor buzz where even the
      hardest hits and coolest tricks might not save you from the mayhem on the screen.<br><br>There
      is no lack of insane collisions in Robosquare! From a massive pile-up at the
      start of a sumo match to crazy 1v1 controlled clashes, the gameplay is nothing
      short of electronic warfare. Grow your momentum and deliver that deafening blow
      to anyone standing in your way.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>GAME MODES</strong></h2>Enjoy
      variations of two main game modes, sumo and race. Within each match, the core
      gameplay of thrusting others out of the map doesn't change. Yet, different tasks
      within each game mode will get you customization currency known as scrap. While
      racing, hit epic jumps, maneuver around obstacles, and take caution of dangerous
      timed events to reach the finish line first. If fate spawns you into a sumo
      deathmatch, navigate the actively changing platforms with the might of your
      driving skills. Keep in mind; only one bot will be victorious. Do not be surprised
      when among the mayhem of constantly dropping platforms, other players will ram
      you from all directions hoping to knock you off into the abyss.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>CUSTOMIZATIONS</strong></h2><img

      /><br>Show your style with your very own customization! Catch your enemies off
      guard with an aggressive art style calling them into battle. Receive honorary
      items only the most elite robot drivers possess through the earning of scrap.
      From a Zen garden body to snow-globe wheels, you may use this in-game currency
      to completely redesign the look of your rig.
