    review: "October 2020 update to my review at the bottom, keeping the original\
      \ review for context:\n\nThis used to be my favourite Premium module available\
      \ for NWN, but something in Beamdog's port has completely broken it. As other\
      \ reviews have mentioned, there is a problem with entering Hawklin Castle, a\
      \ plot-relevant and unskippable location about an hour into the story, which\
      \ is a huge pain to get to in the first place. From what I've seen, this doesn't\
      \ seem to occur for absolutely every player, but if it does happen to you [b]\
      \ there is absolutely NO way around it and you WILL NOT be able to progress.\
      \ [/b]\n\nI submitted a ticket for this issue back in January and haven't played\
      \ the game since out of sheer annoyance, and only heard back from Beamdog earlier\
      \ this month, which for some reason I went completely unaware of (no notifications\
      \ at all) until I got an email saying my ticket had been closed due to my lack\
      \ of response to it. Nice.\n\nThe replies I got to the ticket were, in order,\
      \ a reply telling me they had a fix in an opt-in beta patch and that I should\
      \ try it, and then a later reply saying that the patch was now live in the game\
      \ and they were convinced I would have no more issues. I really appreciate their\
      \ hard work, of course - but I would a lot more if their claims of a fix actually\
      \ were true.\n\nFor clarity I tried loading up the save where I originally had\
      \ the issue - no dice. That's fine, I thought. The save is likely configured\
      \ to the old patch and most likely wouldn't work anyway, and I'm silly for trying,\
      \ so I started a new game. \n\nAlthough I did see some of the other issues they\
      \ fixed at work (Your jousting horse that you borrow doesn't disappear upon\
      \ spawn-in anymore which was a nice touch, because that was nearly unavoidable\
      \ before unless you've been playing this dumpster fire of a beautiful game for\
      \ as long as I have), I reached Hawklin Castle with a spring in my step and\
      \ a fire in my belly - only to be immediately yeeted to my desktop screen with\
      \ the EXACT same crash notification as before, with not even a hint of anything\
      \ different. Even the crashlogs were identical.\n\nI'm currently attempting\
      \ to re-open my ticket, but at this moment, it's still listed as closed. I'm\
      \ willing to give them the benefit of the doubt with the current real-life situations\
      \ happening, and I understand they might be a few men down just now. But I am\
      \ seriously fed up. \n\n[b] TL;DR - DO NOT buy this now. [/b] The chances of\
      \ you not even being able to progress in the module are far too high to waste\
      \ your money, no matter how tempting it might seem especially if you're in lockdown\
      \ and looking for cheap stuff to play. While normally I would say that they\
      \ were undercharging for this module - it's not worth anything in its current\
      \ state. If you want a module to play, look at the other options, but leave\
      \ this one well alone for now.\n\nIf they confirm that the castle actually gets\
      \ fixed, I will edit this review, but in the meantime, take this as a warning\
      \ to stay away and check out NWN's other options.\n\nEDIT OCTOBER 2020: After\
      \ months of having this issue with no response to my appeal to reopen my ticket,\
      \ I finally took matters into my own hands and tried to fix the game myself.\
      \ I figured out how - it basically involved deleting everything in the Documents\
      \ folder and forcing NWN to redownload it all (several times for some reason)\
      \ but eventually I got it working, so I at least have a little evidence that\
      \ the issue was either on my end or the update that carried the fix for my issue\
      \ got a botched install and I never noticed. Either way, problem seems to be\
      \ fixed now. I won't be taking my review off negative simply based on my experience\
      \ with Beamdog which I honestly found disgraceful - I needed further help or\
      \ at least prodding in the right direction and was ignored, which is honestly\
      \ disgusting. \n\nSo, to summarize - great game, AMAZING module, terrible customer\
      \ service. I genuinely hope I never have to interact with the customer service\
      \ again."
