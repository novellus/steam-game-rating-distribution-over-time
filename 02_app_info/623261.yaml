      \ routes such as B&amp;O Kingwood Branch: Tunnelton \u2013 Kingwood with the\
      \ Baltimore and Ohio GP30. General Motors\u2019 Electro-Motive Division introduced\
      \ the new generation GP30 that was later to become a hugely successful diesel-electric\
      \ locomotive for many US Class I railroads.<br><br>At a time when US locomotive\
      \ builders were vying for more horsepower, this loco was seen as the answer\
      \ to competitors\u2019 more powerful diesel locomotives. General Motors\u2019\
      \ EMD GP30 was considered one of the first so-called \u2018second generation\u2019\
      \ diesel locomotives produced by the company. General Electric had already stolen\
      \ the march on 2,500hp locomotives with its U25B, and although the GP20 was\
      \ only rated at 2,250hp, EMD traded on its reputation to sell units to US railroads.<br><br>In\
      \ total, 948 models were built between July 1961 and November 1963 for railroads\
      \ in the US and Canada, including 40 cabless B units for the Union Pacific Railroad.\
      \ Some elements of the earlier GP20 were carried across, although the GP30\u2019\
      s trademark \u2018hump\u2019 and cab roof profile made it stand out from other\
      \ similar diesel locomotives.<br><br>A number of GP30s remain in service today\
