And a cherry on top of it is a name of this game's steam badge. That's sounds like defenition of tone deaf for me. The only part of this game I like is from the \"second\" story when perspective shifts to another character's point of view. We're must go throught almost same days, but the story now has a more topics and views on racism, descrimination and other stuff. Throught dialogues of girls we're see how this topics could be viewed. Our new main character now goes through changings and almost has an arc. So taking all of this to account I'm really don't like my time wasted on the first story, it's has no moral core, no meaningful choices (only few choices in the literaly last hour of the game leads you to instant bad endings) and main character there feels like an observer.\nAnd story isn't finised, there is info about 2nd and 3rd chapters on vndb, but that's about it. No screenshots, no videos and I didn't found where to buy/download them. So I don't recomend you to spend time on boring first character just to figure out that second one is more interisting, but still end up with unfinished story","timestamp_created":1608207169,"timestamp_updated":1608430618,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535281598567962646","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2fD7vvYCcML2ugI="}
