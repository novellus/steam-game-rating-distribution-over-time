    about_the_game: Politicking is the best way to prepare your self for the election
      year, by bringing you the chance to settle your political views. You no longer
      have to feel helpless with only casting a single vote. You can finally log into
      Steam and do something that really makes a difference.<br><br>With a gun in
      your hand and you as your favorite politician, the game play will feel a lot
      like all those retro type shooters you remembered playing as a kid. There are
      several weapons to choose from and a lot more planned. The maps have been carefully
      designed to provide a different strategy for each map. Currently planned game
      modes are Death Match, Team Death Match, Capture The Fag, Advance And Secure
      and Gun Mode.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Play
      as several famous politicians from around the world and from the past.<br></li><li>Up

      class="bb_tag">Future Plans</h2>The plan is to add more characters and even
      comical ones. The game will also add over the years new political candidates
      that arise at the polls. A bunch of fun weapons to use against your political
      foes is also planned to be added. There are currently 5 arenas to play on during
      early access but there are at least 30 planned.<h2 class="bb_tag">Disclaimer</h2>There

      political views are, don't worry. This game wasn't created to send or push any
      sort of message against any political party on players. (Please Note) The only
      reason Trump is in the center of some pictures is because he is currently president
      and that will be updated when that changes.<h2 class="bb_tag">Playable Politicians</h2><ul
