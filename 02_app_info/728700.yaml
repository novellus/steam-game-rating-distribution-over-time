    review: Boston is a great airport for Tower!3D Pro and I really recommend it if
      you're bored by the usual cookie cutter parallel runway majors. Boston Logan
      is one of the world's busier International airports and It handles diverse traffic
      from huge A380s,747s A340s and 777s & also small sight seeing & local commuter
      jets from Cape Air & loads of business travelers in private jets hopping the
      45 mins to NY or a bit more for DC. The two things that  make Boston stand out
      imho however are the runway configurations & it's location. It's one of the
      few airports adjacent to the city's downtown with it's skyscrapers right next
      to the field and also is right on the ocean. KBOS has touchdown zones lower
      than 20' ASL. You can look out over Boston harbor the Atlantic and turn slightly
      as see the urban center. As far as game play, however it's the multiple crossing
      runways that make this one of the best. There'are 2 04/22s, an 09/27, two 15/33s
      including a short GA 2557' one. Six total options yet only *one* that has no
      runway intersecting it. It's tremendous fun and can provide so many different
      arrival & departure scenarios so it can feel different every time you play it.
      I found myself not getting bored unlike what happens to me fairly quickly with
      the large parallel airfields. With Boston a wind shift can make a drastically
      different experience with complex taxi routes to also ponder as you shift traffic.Turn
      on some snow and it's awesome.  Give it a shot & I don't think you'll be disappointed.
