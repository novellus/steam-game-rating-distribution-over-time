    about_the_game: P-3 Biotic is a twin-stick shooter where you must pilot your nano-ship,
      the MK4s, inside a petri dish to defend an entity growing at the center of the
      dish, the Nucleus, from hordes of invading bacteria. In most other shooters
      in this genre, you only have to look out for yourself. Well that's too easy
      we say. In P-3 Biotic, if the Nucleus dies, then it's game over. You'll find
      yourself switching from frantic defence to all out attack as you fight a desperate
      battle to keep the Nucleus alive. It doesn't help that you can use the energy
      stored in the Nucleus to over-power your weapons, turn your ship into a projectile,
      or release a devastating AOE shockwave, tempting you to walk a fine line between
      success and failure. Collect energy dropped by dead bacteria to keep the Nucleus
      powered up, but never forget it's defenceless while you're away.

    review: The game play ideas in this game are so good. The way your "ship" moves
      is so bad. I tried to get used to it, but it's so imprecise that you will always
      run into something and die, and lose your gun power-ups. It's like trying to
      fly in gel, and I think this was done on purpose, but it shouldn't have been
      done this way. It makes this game unplayable.
