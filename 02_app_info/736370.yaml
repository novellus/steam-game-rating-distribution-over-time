    review: "While I enjoy the aesthetics of the game, and enjoy the gameplay, the\
      \ problem is that the game was ultimately unsuccessful because of how it was\
      \ marketed and how it was structured. \n\nThe game if Free to Play, but few\
      \ people play. To make it worse, the game is more enjoyable with a larger army,\
      \ but you need to unlock the slots for it. So you dish out a few bucks for the\
      \ extra slots, but then you notice that even fewer people are playing with larger\
      \ armies. \n\nTo make things worse, it you dare point this out to the developer,\
      \ you get banned from the discussio forum, even if you make a respectful and\
      \ constructive criticism of the game.\n\nI would have loved to give this game\
      \ a thumbs up, but can't, and being banned from the discussion forum encouraged\
      \ me to give a thumbs down review."
