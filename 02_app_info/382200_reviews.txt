Unfortunately, I just can't.\n\nI'd like to separate two things, the story and the module. The story itself is pretty good, with rich lore and a fair amount of backstory pertaining to the quest.  However, the [i]module[/i] is put together rather haphazardly. \n\nWe've been trying to get this campaign off the ground for the last couple of weeks. We started with the Adventures in Red Larch side quests to get us leveled from 1-3 before the main adventure. Unfortunately, unless you know the entire campaign as the GM, it's nigh on impossible to navigate the module when your party makes a choice about where to go.\n\nFundamentally, it comes down to poor linking and searchability. The module might tell you that your players main choices are to investigate A, B, or C. However it doesn't link to A, B, or C, and when you find the generic entry for those places it is without context and often doesn't provide the information you need to continue the adventure. The general excuse I see for this is that it's a \"player driven\" investigation. But my experience is that the players get burned out very fast without some level of direction. \n\nFurther, many of the NPCs are not built correctly. Attack and Damage rolls don't function properly (can't target the party) so the outcome of said rolls has to be manually reconciled. This module simply does not provide the GM the tools needed to succeed.\n\nIt's a module that require the GM to be intimately familiar with the story, which is scattered throughout various chapters  and exceptionally hard to follow in any coherent manner. We're one session into the main quest, and even after investing all of this effort I think we're going to have to scrap it and start something else. \n\nI cannot recommend this module in good conscience.","timestamp_created":1458051300,"timestamp_updated":1458577317,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580973684787750244","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yPP+zNMCf5WuUw=="}
