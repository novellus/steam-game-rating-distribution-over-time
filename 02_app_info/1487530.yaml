    developer_response: "This information is objectively incorrect. \n\nThis DLC includes\
      \ 2 characters using canonically \"He/Him\"; 1 character who uses \"She/her\"\
      ; and 1 character who uses \"they/them\". \n\nNot that it would be an issue\
      \ if the distribution was any different, in our opinion. But we wanted to reply\
      \ since -although this is a complaint on something we humbly deem irrelevant-\
      \ it is just objectively inaccurate. \n\nAdditionally to that fact, player can\
      \ -as it has always been the case- choose the pronouns for the characters. \n\

    review: 'THERES ONLY ONE MALE


      UPD: I know that you can choose pronouns in this ''game'', I wasn''t even talking
      about that. Pronouns don''t really matter when one character looks obviously
      male, two characters look obviously female and the last one looks like some
      extremely unattractive alien jelly blob.

      So yeah, my information is OBJECTIVELY correct. Only 1 male. Numbers are not
      equal. 2-1-1 (2 females, 1 male, 1 it) instead of 2-2 (2 females, 2 males) like
      it was with original characters. It''s not about pronouns it''s about how they
      look. I repeat to anyone who wants to buy it: there''s only one male character.'
