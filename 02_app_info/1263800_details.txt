But it's not always that easy! Sometimes there will be obstacles in the way that you'll have to pick up and throw first, other times you'll need to build a bridge with some of your crates so that you can get to the zone. But don't take too long, each level has a time limit!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWith 20+ Levels of puzzle action and retro styled music that will get stuck in your head!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis is our first ever game with zero previous coding knowledge, so its been a lot of fun learning how to code and make a game.
