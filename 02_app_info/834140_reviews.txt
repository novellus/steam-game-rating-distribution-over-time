I still recommend supporting indie developers in EA but I can't recommend this game. The content hasn't really grown and there isn't much support from the devs. I'm gonna have to advise others to save their money. \n\nI know a lot of time and money goes into making a game so I hope the devs don't get discouraged, it's a fun idea it just needs some polish and QA.","timestamp_created":1587559790,"timestamp_updated":1587559790,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw2/770PECevzYggI="}
