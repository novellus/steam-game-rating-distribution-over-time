    review: 'Can''t play it for me no controller support and mini map is horrible
      wasted 40 minutes of my life until I requested a refund

      Nice graphics big map and under 300mb size that is strange as I got another
      game that is less and is 8GB in size...

      For me it''s a no was gutted if it handled like gta and had a gps to follow
      with control pad options the game would be ace but too much to mess with in
      order to sit and relax collecting garbage

      Not for me'
