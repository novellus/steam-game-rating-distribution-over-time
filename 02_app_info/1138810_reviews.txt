It's horrible.\n\n* no (or broken) controller support, store page falsely claims full controller support\n* same music keeps playing over and over again, starting at the beginning of the loop every time you beat a level\n* extremely repetitive\n* cloud jumping is absurdly clunky\n* tries to be a puzzle platformer but you can easily brute force your way through puzzles without even doing what was obviously intended\n* no polish to speak of\n* has a 'new game' and 'continue' option but both of them start a new game\n* I paid $10 for this\n\nYou can get much better games for $10.  In fact, go look at the main landing page and ctrl+f for \"under $10\". There, there's a list.","timestamp_created":1576543758,"timestamp_updated":1576597792,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549839258193969727","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0KSjiu8CfZPu5AE="}
