Love the graphics. There is no story line except for the brief description gave on the page. Controls took me a while to figure out since there's no tutorial and the menu isn't labeled, and I don't remember finding the controls in there either. You can leave the train and walk in a seemingly pointless corridor, and there's no loading screens, instead the game just freezes while loading the next scene. All in all it feels like a very unpolished game that's not worth its price tag.","timestamp_created":1588188784,"timestamp_updated":1588188784,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539007067680358887","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2LTb4/ECeZCxhAI="}
