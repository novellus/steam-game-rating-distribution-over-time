The collection appeared in 1981 after the final copies of the original adventures had gone out of print.

They were the fourth and fifth standalone adventures ever published by TSR.

The original D1 adventure was not used in the tournament, but was instead brand-new for the adventure publication.

Most notably, the adventure introduced the Underdark -- a civilized land beneath the earth. Note that the name &quot;Underdark&quot; isn't used here yet: that term originates later in the <i>Dungeoneer's Survival Guide<\/i> (1986).
