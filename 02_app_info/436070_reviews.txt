Another major bonus is that there are no random encounters, and the game does not waste your time with very slow fade in/out screen, battle transistions, and attack animations that you often see in jrpg's 1000x.\n\nOverall, so far into the playthrough, I really like the game and it fixes most issues I have with jrpg's.\n\nIf I had 1 con it would be that the walking speed is just a tad slower than I would like, and as of 2 hours in, the combat is still a bit on the easy side (but still much more interesting and fun the the usual jrpg system)","timestamp_created":1609725447,"timestamp_updated":1609803109,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws8ac7fYCd7+hwAI="}
