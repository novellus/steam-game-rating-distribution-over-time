The game is really well made and the story lines are creative and fun, a lot of work went into the game I can tell. Some of the secret story lines require crazy out of the box thinking so be prepared for that lol. Highly recommend.","timestamp_created":1601244237,"timestamp_updated":1601244237,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zIHm6PQCcczCpAI="}
