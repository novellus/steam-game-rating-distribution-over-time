Good concept and I like the variety of weapons. It's definitely early access though - voice acting is all one person from china talking in a heavy accent, and the tracking for the bow and arrow is pretty bad. \n\n\nI wish there were health bars on creeps as well. As it is I have no idea how powerful any thing is on the map. The PVP aspects are a lot of fun though - dodging arrows and using your shield is really a lot of fun.","timestamp_created":1490232968,"timestamp_updated":1490232968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56204378604888916","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwtNCz/NoCcdODdQ=="}
