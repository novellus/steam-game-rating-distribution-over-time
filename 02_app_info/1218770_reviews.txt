This one  offered has not worked our the kinks.  One of the basic things is does not do is sometimes it doesn't let you pick up the pile. you want.  Sometimes too many cards laid down get in the way of others. You can try to ignore the problems and play on through, but it is not really very satisfying. I would recommend Carcassonne and Ticket to Ride as good games.","timestamp_created":1601023569,"timestamp_updated":1601023569,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xp2c4vQCcML1owI="}
