You would expect this game to resemble a game like Risk of Rain, where your power is determined by your build and you are focusing on optimizing your moves and builds, but this game has many flaws with it's gameplay and you don't even want to go through those. With it's many flaws of game design, even though rarely I review, I have to warn it won't be that of a nice experience.\n\nMany obvious bugs and things that make you upset, I'll skip over those because this is a cheap and small title. Even when the teleporter can't take you in because you are falling faster than it pulls you (they forgot to make portals reduce gravity, lul) or teleporter doesn't let you go when you want to go see what that interesting thing is or loot a thing. Let's say whatever right?\n\nI won't skip over an arpg game attempting to create build-like game mechanics in a fun action but fail miserably. There are many flaws with how game plays. The skills don't serve to a greater playstyle, they are just there. Not the mention them being clunky in a game of action. You take damage, you have to wait a while and get your skills back if you don't wanna die. Enemy movement's are not readible, so a random beam of DEATH could sneak up on you. You are the most powerful and blaze through everything? Not this lil dude with a shield. Just skipping the enemy is so much better than trying to deal with it.","timestamp_created":1609883519,"timestamp_updated":1609883519,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gaGi6vYCdqLqwAI="}
