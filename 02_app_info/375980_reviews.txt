Maybe I could launch into gameplay on infant mode and see what happens, but that has different controls from what I did see in that, at the least, all attacks hit all of the body, so there aren't multiple attacks? I don't know, the game has less clear with its interface than the older monster hunters. OH AND I ALMOST FORGOT, there is no way inside the game to actually close it, so I had to alt tab out, close it and now I can't relaunch or uninstall as it is still running.
