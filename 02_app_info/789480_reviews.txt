Was a little frustrated at first because I kept trying to aim with the circle in front of the ship instead of the two blue markers but once I got the hang of it, I increased the x and z axis and locked in the trigger within the settings menu in order to increase the ships responsiveness. This made the experience much more enjoyable. Highly recommend it to all space shooter fans.\n\nWorks fine on my Lenovo Explorer WMR headset.","timestamp_created":1603419908,"timestamp_updated":1603420336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+JXTqfUCdLfEqQI="}
