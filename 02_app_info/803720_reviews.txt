This company is severely under-recognized in my opinion.  I played Plague Road on the Playstation and loved that game as well.  Only complaint is that the game is very laggy and crashed once, but the artwork is great.  I would recommend for the programmer to make it run a bit smoother.","timestamp_created":1604808643,"timestamp_updated":1604854781,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xJKz1PUCf9KHrQI="}
