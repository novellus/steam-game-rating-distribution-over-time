Arms race is the biggest snooze fest of a mode iv'e ever played. If you take action skills, guardian ranks, and our personal builds (which the game is based on) out of the equation, you're left with a VERY slow paced and boring looter shooter.\n\n\n\n\n4th skill tree's: Some are good, some a bad. (looking at you Fl4k) Also shouldn't of been behind a pay wall. \n\nFinally to my first and most important point. WE NEED MORE END GAME CONTENT. You give us a 4th new skill tree, some new weapons and shields, then leave us to run the exact same runs we have done over and over again. How long do you think we can keep entertained running either Minos prime, maliwan takedown or the slaughter shaft? There needs to be more of those type of things to actually give us a reason to build towards a strong build, other wise what is the point?","timestamp_created":1609760207,"timestamp_updated":1609760207,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ie7L5vYCf8auwAI="}
