THE WAIT IS OVER.\n\nThis game is a seriously good way to kill an afternoon. Lots of subtle references to classic NES games like Dragon Warrior. Great mechanics. Very balanced so far.\n\nThis may be in my Top 10 games of the last few years. Grab a fren and have a go!","timestamp_created":1589057520,"timestamp_updated":1595030383,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mYXOr/MCeNbahgI="}
