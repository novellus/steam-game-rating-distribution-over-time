    review: "SK8 is a physics-based hardcore 2D platformer with a punishing difficulty\
      \ curve\nwhich encourages a careful approach\u2026Which I kind of wish it wasn\u2019\
      t. I\u2019ve got\nno problem with it being a physics-based 2D platformer because\
      \ the whole\nphysics system this game has is great and has a lot of potential,\
      \ but the issue is\nthat whole \u2018hardcore\u2019 thing. \n\nIf you fail a\
      \ level instead of just restarting the level\nlike a normal game, it instead\
      \ sends you back to the previous level and then if\nyou fail that back to the\
      \ level before that. If you are simply stuck on level 3 for\nexample you keep\
      \ having to complete level 2 before you even get a chance at\nlevel 3 again.\
      \ It\u2019s frustrating because I really like the way this game plays, I just\n\
      think that the game should have a casual and hardcore modes instead the it\u2019\
      s\nmore accessible to everyone. \n\nLike I said I really do like this game and\
      \ its physics\nbut can\u2019t recommend it due to being yeeted back to the previous\
      \ level all the\ntime. If it changed that and added some general options like\
      \ changing\nresolution or turning off music (not that I don\u2019t like the\
      \ music, it\u2019s actually\npretty good) then I would say it\u2019s one sk8ing\
      \ game everyone should try.\n\nMaybe put them in the game and release it as\
      \ SK8 2 or\nsomething. SK8: Great Skating Mate would be a legendary name xD"
