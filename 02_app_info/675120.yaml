    review: 'Tough, but really good game. If you want to play it, prepare yourself
      for a challenge.


      Positive:


      + Unlimited continues (you will need them)

      + Challenging, hard but not impossible to beat

      + Many different enemies, which increase in difficulty

      + 8 Different locations

      + Every boss is different

      + Good Soundtrack and fine graphics

      + Controls are very accurate



      Negative:


      - Sometimes a little bit too unfair and frustrating

      - Loot is random (and you always get only treasure when you really need a potion)

      - Some bosses are easier to beat than the stages before him

      - No recovery time (on the last levels are traps which can cause a chain reaction
      because of that)

      - "Start new game" comes before "Continue", so watch out. :D

      - Ladders feel a little bit slipery



      Overall, it''s a good, enjoyable game and for that price, you shouldn''t think
      twice.

      But don''t say i haven''t warned you about the difficulty. :P'
