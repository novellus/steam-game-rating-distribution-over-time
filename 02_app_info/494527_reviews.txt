In Default FSX my road isn't visible (Day), but in night DLC it is, although they added a bit more lights. I wish they had a day version. I flew to the NY PA boarder and there are some lights in PA, thou not as detailed. This DLC is a bit pricey but very nice, especially considering you have the entire state of New York. FSX alone may not look good but the night dlc made a huge difference","timestamp_created":1515362809,"timestamp_updated":1515362809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yq6q6eACePOzlQE="}
