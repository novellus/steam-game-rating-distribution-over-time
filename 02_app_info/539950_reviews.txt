Sunglasses, coat and lingerie. U get the coat and sunglasses, but the lingerie is missing... I have tried to send an email to the official owners said by steam support. The mail was sent about an month ago and no response is even out. I do not know but this might happen in other DLC sets aswell. Atleast do not buy this one!\n\n^ Old review ^\nV New review V\n\nAs I investigated furtherer down into the issue I realized ive gotten a heart pillow item wich was not there before i bought this DLC. So i went through every single DLC they offered to see if that heart pillow was in any of those DLC's. And there i found it, the heart pillow in the 'sexy ribbons' DLC. So the DLC's have been mixed up giving you the wrong item from a DLC purchase.","timestamp_created":1493793934,"timestamp_updated":1577523258,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.626828312873840332","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqdTtpe8CfKCeeA=="}
