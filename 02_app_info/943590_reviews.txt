Right when you think you have the mechanics figured out there is a twist. A room with a new type of puzzle, a monster that looks harmless then fires ghosts at you, or its time to change my hero in order to beat a specific room, and then you die. Yay for infinite lives! But you need to start the dungeon over again. Reminds me of old school mario games where you get half way through, then die, and have to run the level over again until you unlock the secret of the level you are on. I like farming gold, but then i get stuck because he has no boost!","timestamp_created":1540446174,"timestamp_updated":1540446174,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJws+fv1OYCd4KmrQE="}
