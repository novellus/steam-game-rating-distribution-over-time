Personally i didnt mind the length of it. Key features of this game noted, the adaption for people who are visually impaired was an interesting feature but the key part of this VN that i was most fond of was not only does the story touch one physical impairment, but mental impairment also and how both can be equally damaging on a relationship if not nurtured right. Did notice a couple of errors in grammar but not enough to take away the enjoyment. Insightful.
