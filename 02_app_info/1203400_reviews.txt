No cards or achievements so far. Lots of \"trace this figure without crossing an used line\" type puzzles. The graphics are pretty without being lavish (hello Artifex) and the HOG scenes are not difficult except for when language issues arise, using hairbrush instead of comb for example. The last part of the game has you solve riddles to access areas AND to figure which item to find in the HOG scene, a rather enjoyable change of pace. There is no bonus content, but it's only @$5.00, which is very economical nowadays (hello again Artifex, and hi Big Fish.)\n\nThe story is pretty standard and shallow, as is the norm in HOGs. One plot point I'm not sure of could be due to a translation error ...or did they really [spoiler] imply the Crow Witch was not just the Feline Wizard's sister but his love also (before their transformation?!) If so, WOW, HOG's are getting rather telenovela! xD  [/spoiler] \n\nSo a 7/10 due to no cards, cheevs, or bonus content.","timestamp_created":1586473049,"timestamp_updated":1586473246,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.678662598133087158","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw05PLsPECf8vE/wE="}
