You awaken from a nightmare and find your city of River Lake devastated by a chemical plant explosion that turns animals and humans into flesh eating monsters. Your rations are running low and you decide that it's time leave.\n\nThe story is pretty bares bones, you do get notes scattered around and they try to explain the story slightly, but not by much. It's really not that good and only is there to set up the puzzles you solve. \n\nGraphics:\n\nThe graphics are absolutely awful. Paradigm Shift is an adventure game and you know that looking for items is a big part of games like these. The environments look really low resolution and there's these really ugly scratch marks across each screen, which sometimes obscures crucial items you need to pick up.\n\nEnemies also look stupid, they have these really weird photoshop stuff on them, that makes them look funny instead of scary.\n\nAudio:\n\nSince this game is basically a flash game, the audio is super compressed and crunchy. The sound effects are all awful and are actually quite hilarious, like the zombies attacking you. The only good thing I can come up with the audio design is the end credits song that actually sounds pretty good (probably a hot take of mine).\n\nGameplay:\n\nAs said before, Paradigm Shift is an adventure game where you pick up items and use them to solve puzzles. As I said before, the crucial items are impossible to see in certain sections because of the dark environments and film grains.\n\nLet's talk puzzles, as they are the meat on the bones of these type of games. The puzzles are awful and barely make any sense. Most of them are pretty easy, but there are a few puzzles that are so stupid that I got stuck for quite a while. There's also combat, but it's so barebones that I just want to mention it that it exists. Every so often an enemy will pop up and you press on them to take them out. \n\nVerdict:\n\nParadigm Shift is awful in every way. Terrible graphics, awful puzzles and just overall low quality, make this game a waste. It's roughly 20 minutes long and it's just not very good, yes it's cheap, but so are so many other games, so just get one of those and skip this. \n\nFinal Rating:\n1/10\n\nPros:\nN/A\n\nCons:\n- Puzzles are awful\n- Horrible graphics\n- Terrible audio design \n\nIf you liked this review please consider joining https://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog and https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews","timestamp_created":1603671852,"timestamp_updated":1603758465,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.632093131542205811","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/oPds/UCfaSUqgI="}
