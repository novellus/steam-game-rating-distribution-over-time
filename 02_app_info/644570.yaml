    about_the_game: "Sakura parents used to give her only a little money for her living\
      \ costs. Now they don\xE2\x80\x99t give her money anymore, so Sakura has no\
      \ choice but to find a part-time job. She has to work part-time to earn money\
      \ and meanwhile goes to school. All of her classmates think that Sakura doesn\xE2\
      \x80\x99t like talks, and they don\xE2\x80\x99t know what she is thinking about\
      \ at ordinary times. In fact, there is always a dream in Sakura\xE2\x80\x99\
      s heart, that is, to get out of poverty and become rich. She has been striving\
      \ to realize her dream all the time.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nCV: Lianggui<br />\r\
      \n <br />\r\nShe usually has worries in her mind, and doesn\xE2\x80\x99t speak\
      \ often. Therefore, her classmates believe that she is unpredictable. As a born\
      \ beauty, she is busty. She could have become a popular beauty in the school.\
      \ However, she is not so popular, because she is not good at social contact.\
      \ She only has some fans who admire her secretly. She is able to peacefully\
      \ accept things unacceptable to ordinary people, which probably results from\
      \ her father\xE2\x80\x99s job, a war photographer. She often followed her father\
      \ to many places when she was very young, and also encountered dangerous situations.\
      \ Therefore, she has excellent physical fitness, which is enough for her when\
      \ she deals with hooligans. She is somewhat insensitive, so it\xE2\x80\x99s\
      \ hard for her to understand how others feel. A neighbor, who is a childhood\
      \ partner of her, often comes to her house to have dinner with her, but she\
      \ has never perceived the boy\xE2\x80\x99s admiration for her."
