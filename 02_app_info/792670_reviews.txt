I wasn't able to play it properly due to the severe bugs that are within the game. I even tried to get a refund, but was also unable to do that. So, I decided I'd wait a while and let the game devs try to fix it or whatever needed happen. Now, on Feb. 22, 2019, the game still has the exact same problems and bugs as last time. The killer(s) still just follows you and only moves when you move. Also, the map is very empty, however, this does (in my opinion) add to a spooky atmosphere. I just hope that this game gets the treatment that it deserves. Until then, I must say DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!","timestamp_created":1550900078,"timestamp_updated":1550900078,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw26S2jOkCcrLJuwE="}
