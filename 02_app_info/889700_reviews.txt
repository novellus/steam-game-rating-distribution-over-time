There are some good stories and downright pointless ones. The achievements are pretty memey as well, great for profile showcases. Found the VN to be a tad too short, finished the game in about 9 hours.The extra time put in was purely for idling. That said, I enjoyed Meiya and Sumika side stories in the Muv-Luv extra universe. The alternative side stories on Captain Isumi and Sergeant Jinguuji were pretty good as well, just prepare yourself for a bit of self-reflection after playing them.","timestamp_created":1610112139,"timestamp_updated":1610112329,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40oyL8fYCdt/EwQI="}
