However, given the utter lack of any change notes or patch logs I've seen, I think it's safe to say this thing's abandoned and the $20 I paid was to snag a sucker for some quick cash.\n\nPros: \nDecent enough foundation for an early access.\nCustomization is a good personalization feature.\n\nCons:\nBuggy as hell.\nVery user unfriendly\nLack of dev response or communication indicates dead game.\nCombat is confusing and contradictory at times.\nBad time invested for experience curve meaning growth is slow at best.\nSkills are all over the place.\nWay too much money for what's here.\n\nIf the devs are listening, finish your game. It could actually be worth something someday, but it's worth exactly $0 in this state, and I'd return it if I didn't burn through over 2 hours on customization and attempted to polish the turd for the rest of my time spent.\n\n1/10","timestamp_created":1512538331,"timestamp_updated":1512538331,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53583061695098877","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ49+qTleACcMOpkQE="}
