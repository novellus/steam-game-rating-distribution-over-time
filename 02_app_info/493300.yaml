    review: "So just bought this pack. All tables reviewed on DX11. Surprised no else\
      \ did a review. Lets start with Indy 500. This is a great table and a very good\
      \ challenge.  Its not an extremly hard table. However I have yet to complete\
      \ an entire race. A good table. Next up the Dr. Who table. This is a hard table\
      \ but fun to play on. I enjoyed this table a lot but its not the easiest table.\
      \ \n\nFrank Thomas' Big Hurt is a easy table to play.  Not many cheap drains\
      \ and the sound effects are good. Lots of fun to play on. I had no issues with\
      \ the table. Bone Busters. I just dont care for this table. Drains are common.\
      \ The ball moves to fast. Its just an annoying table to play. Table is blah.\n\
      \nEight Ball Deluxe is a hard but enjoyable old school table. The ball does\
      \ like to drain down the sides a lot. Overall though I enjoyed this table. Centigrade\
      \ is a hard but old school table and its not easy. That being said I do enjoy\
      \ this table even though I am not very good at this table. Fun but hard. Following\
      \ that is another old school Jacks Open. A fun and enjoyable table and slightly\
      \ easier then Centigrade. Both tables are fun and generally I am not a fan of\
      \ old school pinball tables.\n\nGladiators is a very strange but unique pinball\
      \ table. I enjoyed this table and its generally a easy table. You fight dragons\
      \ and other things. Its a nice addition to this group. I enjoyed this table.\
      \ This pack does include the new Dr Who pinball table made by this company.\
      \ Its a good pinball table but not great. There is supposed to be one more table.\
      \ So far a majority of the tables I really enjoy. My favorites from this batch\
      \ are Indy 500, Big Hurt, Dr Who, Centigrade. For $30 bucks I consider it a\
      \ good value for real pinball tables. \n\nUPDATE. New table Als garage rock\
      \ band goes on a world tour. Fun table to play on. . the table is very fun to\
      \ play. The next table up is Cactus Jack. This should be a good addition for\
      \ the pack. Hope they fix the initals thing. The high score glitch has been\
      \ fixed according to farsight. Just got the update.\n\nCACTUS JACK IS HERE!\
      \ Loads of fun. Love the sound effects and its a easy table to play. The last\
      \ table will be Swords of Fury. I am really loving this years tables."
