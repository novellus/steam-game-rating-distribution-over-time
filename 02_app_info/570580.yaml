    review: These types of games aren't as popular as graphics-based games, but if
      you enjoy reading in general, then perhaps you would like text adventure games.
      I played this game originally back in the 80's, so for me it's rather retro-style
      game play - brings back lots of memories. To me, the entire Infocom series is
      underrated as they are truly some terrific games to play. It is my hope and
      wish that eventually all the Infocom games will be published on Steam.
