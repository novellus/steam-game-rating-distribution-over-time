(still)\n\nI am almost 22 yet I feel 90 years old or something. This game feels like the past and I greatly enjoy that; I had studied some bit of their (Japan's) take on medieval times, this fox having Kitsun√© powers would fit my fantasy.\n\nThis fox isn't neotenic enough for my tastes. The music LOVE.","timestamp_created":1544597738,"timestamp_updated":1609194255,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472440958023071289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qfbc1fYCeomOtQE="}
