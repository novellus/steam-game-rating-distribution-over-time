    review: 'An excellent OST and one of the favourites of mine, perfect background
      music for all sort of occult or otherwise odd things and a mainstay of my tabletop
      RPG sessions.


      This OST contains most songs in the game, with the exceptions of:

      "Impending Glory", the victory theme

      "Nocturne", the Mansus theme (Karol Szymanowski''s Nocturne and Tarantella,
      Op. 28, luckily easy to find otherwise)

      "Witch and Sister Sparer", alternate version of "Those Pearls that were her
      Eyes"

      Few alternate versions of the main menu theme.


      This OST also contains two songs that don''t appear in the files, those being
      Apollo and Marsyas (Imo the crowning jewel of this track) and June the 28th.
      (an alt version of the main menu theme, yet again). There seem to be minor changes
      for some songs compared to their in-game versions in general.'
