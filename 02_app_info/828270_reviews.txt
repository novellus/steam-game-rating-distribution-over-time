Jelly Bomber will probably remind you of Dr Mario.\n\nOverall a very fun game. Addictive even. Highly recommended if you're into Tetris, the aforementioned Dr Mario, Columns and the likes. The music is great, too, which just adds to the fun. Having several themes to choose from would've been a nice option, though.\n\nIf I recommend this?
