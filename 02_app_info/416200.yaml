    review: 'There are a slew of caveats for this game, but there''s something about
      it which just grabs me.


      It''s essentially a walking simulator/exploration game. It''s set in a world
      where agents in robot bodies run Ministries which control aspects of reality
      (e.g., Sound, Colour, Light). And administration agencies like the Ministry
      of Order police them. You are Bixby of the Dept. of Correction Pending; in exchange
      for your efforts to cut through the Ministry of Order''s bureaucracy, you are
      not only the last agent in your department, but trapped in the Lounge District.
      The Lounge District is a labyrinth of glossy lobbies, bars, suites, malls, parks,
      and bus lots -- all abandoned by the Ministry of Order agents when you interfered.
      It''s up to you (and your trusty radio operator Stiggs) to troubleshoot all
      the weird happenings that go on.


      The game is divided into ''cases'', each with a description of the gameplay
      (e.g., navigation, security evasion) and a time estimate. You are directed from
      place to place by placard or clues, and the plot moves a step further with each
      stop. Lore is scattered through the district by radio, info booth, and talk
      show, but the case storytelling is entirely dialogue. Your time will be spent
      hovering through the Lounge District (at a good clip) getting lost while you
      zone out to the pretty great Vangelis-style soundtrack.


      The game is best approached as meditative and atmospheric. Because there IS
      a real atmosphere here. The Lounge District is a Neo Art Deco delight, with
      no two rooms alike and many shrouded in shadow or odd corners. The world-building
      is vague and the District is deserted, but in every room there''s a reminder
      of the backstory (including portraits of the ex-Ministry of Order dictator),
      so paranoia builds. Later cases go a little farther afield, exploring new areas.
      As for the cases themselves, the most relative word is ''surreal'' (they have
      names like, ''High Frequency Corn Syrup'' and ''Dogs With Shoes.'') There is
      an insistence on analogue, throwback touches, a la Bioshock. You get the feeling
      all business is conducted by pneumatic tube.


      Now for the caveats -- and there are several. Repetition is one; almost all
      the gameplay is navigation-based (although I guarantee you will NEVER learn
      your way around -- if getting lost is the point, then the game definitely delivers
      on that). Some people will find the emptiness of the world off-putting, although
      some crumbs of backstory explain why the District is abandoned. Some of the
      clues are unclear, so you will end up wandering around; this is especially difficult
      when you forget what exactly you''re looking for, as the game has no quest information
      to refer back to. You can skip around the case list, but you cannot save mid-case.
      The biggest problem, though, is the dialogue -- especially unfortunately, as
      the plot is built on it. It''s cleanly recorded but the actors are often muffled,
      so you have to crank up the sound to hear. More, it''s very dense, and employs
      a lot of in-house future slang. You MUST pay strict attention. To their credit,
      the dev responded to comments on this and attempted to install subtitles, but
      the engine wouldn''t allow it. The dev also came back quickly on bug reports.


      The whole game is clearly a labour of love by a single developer. The graphics,
      the programming, the music, the writing -- all one person. And that really shines
      through, as the game is undoubtedly a cohesive whole, and infused with the enthusiasm
      of creation. If you loved Myst''s atmosphere but didn''t like the puzzles preventing
      you from wandering around, or if you love dark ambient music and want a surreal
      way to jam along with it, give it a go!'
