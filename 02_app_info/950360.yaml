    review: 'I have mixed feelings about this game, but decided to give it a thumbs
      up. I just as easily could have given it a thumbs down, but I decided it had
      enough good about it spare the developer.


      The graphics are good, as one would expect, and I enjoyed the Egyptian theme.


      Some of the puzzles are quite challenging with no obvious solution to work toward,
      so a couple of them I solved as a matter of pure luck. Some of the puzzles,
      on the other hand, are mere tasks because  you''re give the answer in front
      of you. In general, though, the puzzles were standard fare.


      My biggest problem with the game is that the timer cannot be turned off. It
      seems basic to me that that should be an option, and I don''t reckon it would
      be a monumental coding task.


      The other big issue is that there is no way to save your progress or to pause
      the game. That, for me, is usually an automatic thumbs down. During my last
      play-through, when I actually managed to escape, my wife spilled tea on an extension
      cord and popped the main breaker. It was after dark, so I had to deal with it.
      I had to leave the clock running, which could have been a disaster with respect
      to finishing the game. Fortunately, I had plenty of time because I''d run through
      most it several times.


      Not having the option to turn off the clock or to pause/save the game is the
      mark of an amateur. I hope the developer does better next time.'
