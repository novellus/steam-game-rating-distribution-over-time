    short_description: Future Snooker is a futuristic snooker game. Players take turns
      to shoot a cue-ball on a circular snooker table. Score points by potting red
      then colour, just as in normal snooker. A compelling mix of tactics and skill
      for one or two players with a selection of computer opponents.
