      \ by the greatest leaders of the most dominant ancient civilizations in Central\
      \ America. Legends state that whoever possessed the artifact would be granted\
      \ divine wisdom and eternal life. Scolars even claim that without it, the Aztec\
      \ Empire would have never came to flourish. <br />\r\nWhile most academics considered\
      \ it to be a myth, a world famous archeologist Tomb Jack recognized there could\
      \ be some authenticity to the story. After years of research, shrouded in secrecy,\
      \ he led an expedition to prove the artifact's existance and bring it back to\
      \ the civilized world. He was able to discover an ancient crypt which led him\
      \ and his companions to a place none of them could have imagined, even in their\
      \ wildest dreams. Unfortunately, after many months, none of them returned and\
      \ soon, all were proclaimed dead. <br />\r\nYears later, Tomb Joe, renowned\
      \ archelogist and a fearless adventurer recieved a mysterious letter adressed\

      \ a golden medallion engraved with the symbol of the Sceptre. While the medallion\
      \ piqued his interest, it was the map that made him act. For the first time,\
