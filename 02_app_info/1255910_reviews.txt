Many weapons and enemies. And you need to use tactic and think faster.\n+Good visual effects- exsplosions, blood burst.\n+The music is well matched for various context.\nNegative\n- It is not AAA. Maybe levels don't have a many detailes.\n- Optimization. But this game have graphic quality like AAA games from 2010. \nAnd in 2010 you need use 4gb RAM and 1 gb videocard. But now it works perfectly in 8gb RAM and 2 gb videocard. \nI think 8gb RAM and 2gb videocard it is minimum for gaming PC now.\nFinal- now we don't have many FPS, and modern \"classic\" FPS have many unnecessary parts \n(Hello repetitive melee in DOOM)\nI think play GANZWORKER good idea if you like FPS.\n","timestamp_created":1585597809,"timestamp_updated":1585597809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527897000312805176","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ltC/lvECdp3A/AE="}
