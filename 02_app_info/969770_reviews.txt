As I've mentioned in my review of The Music Box, it's highly subjective what songs you end up finding useful, and I must mention again that I'm no music expert (barely even an amateur) but personally I think this one has some more fresh tunes that cover a wider range of areas you could use the tracks in. Also the BGS's are pretty great.","timestamp_created":1577046836,"timestamp_updated":1577046836,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsqDUl+8Cfq2Y5gE="}
