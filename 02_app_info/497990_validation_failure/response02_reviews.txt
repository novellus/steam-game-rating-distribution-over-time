It's just too bad that the game doesn't support the Vive Controllers - moving with the classic pad can make you sick, even if there are some settings to lower that a lot. If you can use some supersampling on your VR headset it's even better, the reading in the game isn't always easy due to low resolution. The game itself is quiet beautiful in VR though.","timestamp_created":1477303588,"timestamp_updated":1477303588,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyvqJ+9cCfoL3Yw=="}
