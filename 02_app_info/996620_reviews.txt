Also there is no selection to pass/run like in the old coleco version.  During the opponents first play, it just crashes and gives and error message.  Hope the devs will fix it!  I have received no response to my post about it on the discussion page.\n\nedit: The devs contacted me today with a response to the problem.  They say they will look at it.  It's good to know the devs care about such things!","timestamp_created":1575529055,"timestamp_updated":1575947149,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47KPx9u4Cc/yJ4gE="}
