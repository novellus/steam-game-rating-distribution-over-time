Shiny is a challenging amusement but fortunately it is not \"the-impossible-to-finish-game\". ;) What is most important, Shiny has a cute, hypnotizing graphics with an amazing, unforgetable soundtrack. I am pretty sure you will spend a great amount of time if you give it a chance. :) I did! And I do not regret it! ;)","timestamp_created":1602956127,"timestamp_updated":1602956127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sa3om/UCd/m6qAI="}
