    developer_response: "Sorry you had a bad experience with the game. Bingo Hall\
      \ is not meant to be a single player game. It is not \"dabbing\" the numbers\
      \ for you, that is the summary screen telling the players which numbers have\
      \ been called. \n\nIf you choose \"local\", you are responsible for providing\
      \ players with physical (or virtual) cards to play along with and a way of validating\
      \ numbers when BINGO is called (similar to a normal bingo hall that you would\
      \ go to). \n\nIf you choose \"online\", there is a companion app (https://remotegoat.games)\
      \ that all your players can join your game with and is a great streaming option.\
      \ The companion app will provide them with virtual cards based on the number\
      \ of cards you selected. When a player believes they have won and presses the\
      \ BINGO button, the game will auto validate the numbers and pattern based on\
      \ what you have selected as a host. If they win it will stop the game and announce\
      \ the winner, otherwise they will get a \"strike\" for not actually having a\
      \ BINGO (3 strikes and they can no longer submit for that round). "

    review: 'Ok as one of the few bingo games on Steam and was rated positively, I
      was expecting a lot of fun from this.

      The trailer video is literally all you get, a number gets call and it automatically
      dabs it for you, you are literally just sitting there waiting (or pressing enter
      if you have auto play off) to press your bingo button.

      I would at least have liked an option to dab the called number myself, as that
      is just taking away half the fun.

      The game doesn''t display your board for very long before it goes onto the the
      ball screen again, it would be nice to have a hotkey to check your board while
      numbers are being called.

      Also, the default board you get is massive, I would have expected to be able
      to customise the size of your board you are playing on, for example the board
      it shows you when you choose your pattern to win by, a smaller board for shorter
      games for example.'
