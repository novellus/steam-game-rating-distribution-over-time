    review: Pretty dang fun, involves some forward thinking (and/or timetravel...
      but you say the future doesn't exist yet, right?... but yes, it does, so by
      judging what is most likely to happen in the near future, you are actually travelling
      through time, which means that all time exists simultaneously, and therefore,
      everyone lives for all eternity, but now that you know, what will you change?)
      er, what was I on about... oh yeah, this is really fun :)
