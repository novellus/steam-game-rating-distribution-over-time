    review: "Don\u2019t get me wrong, this game has a lot of problems.\n -The world\
      \ is blunt and non-original (basically late medieval/early Renaissance Europe);\
      \ \n-Elizabethan English, in which it is written, adds little even to atmosphere,\
      \ but makes reading it a chore;\n-Author\u2019s attempts to insert his LBGTQ+P^HX*_insert_letter-friendly\
      \ ideology over what essentially is a late medieval Europe are laughably at\
      \ best \u2013 and immersion breaking at worst (Really?.. \u201DPrinxe\u201D\
      ?..REALLY?!..);\n-Stat system is somehow both overly simplistic  and incomprehensively\
      \ complicated (It took me up to an endgame to understand that to play a \u201C\
      wise jester\u201D stereotype I really need not \u201CSagacity\u201D, but \u201C\
      Repertoire\u201D; swearing and restarting game at this point was particularly\u2026\
      unpleasant); \n-And, probably worst of all, there is a lot of times then you\
      \ feel more like a modern clown (a paid entertainer, who should entertain without\
      \ crossing certain borders), not a \u201Cjester\u201D, let alone \u201Cfool\u201D\
      \ (archetypical trickster, who\u2019s JOB is to break social borders).\nSo\u2026\
      \ why, despite all of this, I\u2019m still giving it a thumb up?\n\u2026because\
      \ of a caravan cart on a rainy road. Cart which a lonely fool, just \u201Cgifted\u201D\
      (sold, essentially) to the king must share with a scared monkey, held in cage.\
      \ That moment when this to lonely souls connected, touched each - other almost\
      \ overwhelmed me; it will remain with me for the rest of my days.\n I cared\
      \ more for this god-forsaken monkey then about the fate of kings and kingdoms;\
      \ trained him and played with him despite at the expanse of building relationship\
      \ with \xABprinxe\xBB that was supposed to be my best friend and romantic interest.\
      \ Yeah, it was foolish; but if this game taught me anything \u2013it is that\
      \ \u201Cbeing foolish\u201D sometimes mean \"being right\""
