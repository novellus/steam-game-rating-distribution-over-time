    review: "[h1] Bloody gay \n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 - 10 / 10[/h1]\n\u26A0\
      \ BEFORE YOU PURCHASE \u26A0 \nI strongly [b]don't recommend the Steam version\
      \ [/b]of this game since it's broken and censored. In order to get full experience\
      \ you must to purchase the [u][url=jastusa.com/sweet-pool-dlc] uncensor patch[/url]\
      \ [/u], but it has no guarantee of work properly, so you might be throwing your\
      \ money out. I only played 6 hours of Steam's, i couldn't go any futher because\
      \ the game was crashing oftenly.\n\nSo, this review's mostly from [u] [url=jastusa.com/sweet-pool]\
      \ Jast Blue's version [/url][/u] \nOverall, i got 34 hours of game time and\
      \ i reached 5 out of 6 endings.\n\n[b] Characters / plot [/b]\nI simply enjoed\
      \ this game dispise of its depressing atmosphere. It's basically a twisted romance\
      \ that will shake your guts inside out. \nAll characters concepts work like\
      \ a charm, there's no waste, if they exist, they're useful and quite interesting\
      \ in their own way, even the tagged as \"evil\" ones are lovable in my opnion.\n\
      I apreciate the unpredictable factor, the plot itself is intriguing and rich\
      \ of content, based on certain reviews i was expecting only tragic outcomes\
      \ from it, but there is a good ending and it made me even more satisfied, on\
      \ the other hand there's a ending that made me even more curious about what\
      \ will happen next...so mind blowing!\n\n[b] Visual / audio content [/b] \n\
      I love the characters designs, such good-looking cast (specialy Kitani and Tetsuo)\
      \ and the voice acting makes the perfect match to each one in any single context,\
      \ the unique detail that bothered me a little was when i confused Youji and\
      \ Tetsuo voices during certain dialogues.\nAll CG's are so beautiful, i like\
      \ how the scenes are discribed and how it zoom in and zoom out in order to focus\
      \ certain spots of a same image, giving the static scenary a motion feeling\
      \ afterall. Prepare yourself, sweet pool's full of strong content like non-consensual\
      \ sex, gore and cannibalism.\nThe sexual events aren't much but wild, Youjii's\
      \ voice actor is certain way competent for the role.I couldn't help by noticing\
      \ that Youji x Tetsuo reminds me Taki x Klaus from [i]Maiden Rose[/i] in terms\
      \ of rough sex. \nIn general, the dynamic elements (quality voice acting, sound\
      \ effects, soundtrack and visual effects) conbinated throughout the narrative\
      \ give to the player a sample of how the scene would taste like. \nA minor point\
      \ that bothered me was some design elements included at pop-up windows (Save,\
      \ load, quit etc) and text box's sprite that are kinda retro and glitched looking\
      \ when compared to the whole game quality, but after knowing the sweet pool\
      \ content, i believe it was made on purpose to give us a disturbing vibe.I also\
      \ think that the main menu design looks so basic for such quality VN.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\
      \ \nThe first time i've played sweet pool was from demo and i found it unconfortable,\
      \ the decision making system isn't like regular visual novels i've played -\
      \ Out of expectations, there's no text options, it's all about a red and blue\
      \ dichotomy which are presented as instinct and reason respectively. It may\
      \ be confusing for absent-minded newcomers.\nThe choices tree is robust, except\
      \ for the multiple endings, the core storyline won't suffer major changes.\n\
