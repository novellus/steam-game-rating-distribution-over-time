This is a shame, because for all it's potential, it needs a lot of work, most of it in the explaining department.\n It also has weird bugs, like the splitting and enhancing towers are mislabeled pretty much every where.\nThere re also a lot of things you can spend resources on that have no explanation or noticeable impact. \nIt seems to have had fans in the past, but none felt it worth putting up a guide, which sadly would have made a lot of difference, making up for the designers lack of effort in that department.\nThat said, the idea is interesting, if you don't mind playing something that seems unfinished and broken, you might have some fun playing with the core mechanism. Me, I am having a blast with it. \n ","timestamp_created":1604732215,"timestamp_updated":1605583850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoamQ6vUCdLbsrAI="}
