    about_the_game: Return to the Arc Islands for The Last Stand! Lume activity has
      increased exponentially and you and your fellow Core Guardians find yourselves
      more outnumbered than ever. Even out the odds by Utilizing the new Orbital Strike
      Relay tower and smash down a lazer from the sky into their FACE! Defend the
      Core on four new maps, one of them being a remake of the classic old Arc map.
      To help you face the new enemies in The Last Stand, the Bright Foundation has
      placed the most powerful weapon you've seen so far on three of the four new
      maps - The Rolfinator Defensive Turret, a turret that you can actually jump
      inside yourself and control to obliterate the enemies from afar.<br><br>Of course,
      you'll have other new weapons as well, such as the high-tech Smatterband, an
      industrial weapon that fires sticky bombs that erupt into 10 smaller explosions
      each, and you'll get to unlock 8 new perks!<br><br><strong>Note:</strong> The
      Last Stand is included in the Sanctum 2 <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/237190/"
      target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"  >Season Pass</a> and is part 4/4 in a series
      of DLC for Sanctum 2
