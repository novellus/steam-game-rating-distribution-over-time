Then the game was over, and I did not have the chance to craft and research all weapons, completing research tree etc and I was a bit disappointed. Game looked short. but then i found out there is another completely different game mode with a different map, different missions, and this looks promisingly long and challenging, so I am looking forward to start this new mode and continue my adventure. \n\nCons: \n- I encountered few enemies types and few bosses in the story mode, I hope there'll be more in the other modes\n\nI bought this game on christmas sale and for now I feel that is definitely worth the price. Props to the developers for such a polished, funny, immersive game that brought me back the feeling of old X-Com playing along with my favorite Lovecraft moods. \n\nGame is 8/10 to me, a must have if you are fan of the genre. \n","timestamp_created":1610028509,"timestamp_updated":1610028509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49KzL7vYCfvSjwQI="}
