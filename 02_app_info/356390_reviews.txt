With pixel style design? About The Ripper? Three things I LOVE so this game is like made for me!\n\nHighly recommend The Slaughter! It's not just beautiful and funny but also fascinating, intriguing, suspenseful. When Act I ended, I immediately wanted more. I need to know what's going to happen next!\n\nPlease buy Act I and support the developer so we can have more of this captivating murder mystery!","timestamp_created":1606508654,"timestamp_updated":1606508654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw25XYhfYCdebzswI="}
