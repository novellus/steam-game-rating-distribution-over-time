The 133 included monsters are just around 20 actual models that have been slightly tweaked and coloured differently as if just done through the game's hue slider. The faces are also awful, and very low detailed. The monsters themselves are generally very creative and cool, but not cool enough that a copy pasted version of one in every colour is to my liking. Not recommended, not worth the price","timestamp_created":1577312397,"timestamp_updated":1577312397,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.588235259056091309","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47KTJn+8CfaH/5gE="}
