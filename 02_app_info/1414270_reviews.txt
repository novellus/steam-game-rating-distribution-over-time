If you RMB on a tile you placed, you remove it, instead of highlighting the \"paths\" your tile blocks. Very annoying. Please, just let me draw!","timestamp_created":1609357611,"timestamp_updated":1609357611,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609768944,"developer_response":"Thanks for the valuable feedback.
