    review: "Was a fucking stupid movie. But funny. Still fucking stupid. \n\nPlot:\
      \ Everyone works in a cinema and each one has their own points / things / paths\
      \ that they have to do to survive / become a better person. \n\nDefinitely worth\
      \ a rent, and a buy if on sale with other indie movies. Otherwise I'd pass on\
      \ it."
