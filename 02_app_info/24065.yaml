    review: "This route is controversial to say the least, and it doesn't take long\
      \ to see why:\n\nRoute:\n- Incomplete and inaccurate scenery and buildings\n\
      - Incredibly short route\n+ Good for a quick drive and for basic route knowledge\n\
      \n380:\n- Wrong sounds, eg doors \n- Wrong max unit speed (125 instead of 100?!)\n\
      - Inaccurate QD consists, eg no 3 car but a 9 car?!\n+ Adds realism for other\
      \ routes, and is included with this route\n\nOverall - even though I bought\
      \ this on sale at \xA36.49, I still feel ripped off. It lacks accuracy, detail\
      \ and has so many fundamental errors. It either needs a major revamp (eg extension\
      \ to Gourock, Wemyss Bay) or discontinued."
