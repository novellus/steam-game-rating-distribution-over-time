      \ turn order, no shuffling, and multiple win and loss conditions make this a\
      \ deck building experience like no other!</strong><br><br><i>\u201CThis is not\
      \ the end of the world. That already happened. This is what is left: us, gravehold,\
      \ and the Nameless. For generations we have taken refuge in an ancient and haunted\
      \ place. It has taken our mages an aeon to hone their craft, but they are ready...\
      \ and they are lethal. The breaches, the very conduits through which the Nameless\
      \ travel, have become our weapon.\u201D</i><br>-Yaleesa Rhykk, Gravehold survivor<br><br>The\
      \ situation is bleak. The final city - <strong>Gravehold</strong> - needs the\
      \ power of the breach mages to hold back the Nameless. Join the fight, and maybe\u2026\
      \ just maybe, Gravehold will live to see another dawn.<br><br><strong>Aeon\u2019\
      s End</strong> is a deck-building game where you create a team of up to 4 mages\
      \ who will fight cooperatively to defeat whichever Nameless nemesis has come\
      \ through the breach today. You begin with a starting deck of 10 cards, 5 in\
      \ hand. Each turn you play <strong>gems</strong> to gain <strong>aether</strong>,\
      \ which is used to buy new gems and <strong>relics</strong>, learn new <strong>spells</strong>,\
      \ and increase your casting potential by opening additional <strong>breaches</strong>.\
      \ You can also play relics to give yourself or your allies a boost. Then <strong>prep</strong>\
      \ spells to your opened or focused breaches to be ready to <strong>cast</strong>\
      \ them on your subsequent turns. <br><br>What makes Aeon\u2019s End unique is\
      \ how it uses <strong>randomness</strong>. Unlike other deck building games,\
      \ players do not shuffle their deck when it runs out. The order in which you\
      \ discard is preserved so plan your discards carefully to set yourself up for\
      \ subsequent turns.<br><br>Instead, randomness in Aeon\u2019s End comes in the\
      \ order of turns. At the start of each round, the <strong>turn order deck</strong>\
      \ is shuffled to determine the order of play. Will the nemesis go twice in a\
      \ row, pushing back the mages\u2019 defense? Will the mages get 4 turns in a\
      \ row to set up for the coming onslaught? It can be hard to know what\u2019\
      s coming next when you are deep in the melee!<br><br>Finally, there\u2019s the\
      \ city of <strong>Gravehold</strong>. The breach mages of Aeon\u2019s End are\
      \ not just fighting for their own survival, but the survival of all of humanity,\
      \ and the Nameless know it. If Gravehold is ever reduced to 0 life, the mages\
      \ have lost and humanity is but a memory. Protect the city at all costs!<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">What is included:</h2><br>Aeon\u2019s End includes the following:<br><br><u><strong>8\
      \ Breach Mages:</strong></u><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Adelheim<br></li><li>Brama<br></li><li>Jian<br></li><li>Kadir<br></li><li>Lash<br></li><li>Mist<br></li><li>Phaedraxa<br></li><li>Xaxos</li></ul><br>Each\
      \ Mage has a <strong>unique starting card</strong> and a <strong>unique ability</strong>\
      \ that can be charged to use in the fight. For example, <strong>Kadir</strong>\
      \ has a gem that allows her to heal herself or an ally, and an ability that\
      \ allows an ally to dig for and prep spells. <strong>Xaxos</strong> has a spell\
      \ that allows him to reveal the top card of the turn order deck and an ability\
      \ that helps allies charge their abilities.<br><br><u><strong>The Market:</strong></u><br>You\
      \ build your deck with player cards from the market. 3 gems, 2 relics, and 4\
      \ spells allow you to grow your powers to hold back the nemesis. The market\
      \ is constructed from 27 unique gems, relics, and spells. Either take a randomly\
      \ generated market, or build the perfect one yourself during setup.<br><br><u><strong>4\
      \ Nameless Nemeses:</strong></u><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Carapace Queen<br></li><li>Crooked\
      \ Mask<br></li><li>Prince of Gluttons<br></li><li>Rageborne</li></ul><br>Each\
      \ Nemesis plays differently with unique mechanics to keep even the most powerful\
      \ breach mages on their toes. <strong>Rageborne</strong> lays on the damage\
      \ in a more frontal assault using the <strong>Strike Deck</strong>, whereas\
      \ the Prince of Gluttons fights more of a war of attrition, devouring player\
      \ cards from the market.<br><br>Aside from their unique mechanics, the Nemesis\
      \ deck is created before each game from a combination of basic and nemesis-specific\
      \ cards. You may encounter the same Nemesis many times, but it will never attack\
      \ you in exactly the same way twice.<br><br>Expand your gameplay options with\

    review: 'I have been playing One Deck Dungeon for over a year now on the iPhone
      and also in real life, and I kept seeing adverts for Aeon''s End, especially
      when I used Mist, of course. I was therefore very tempted when I saw this is
      the Winter sale and thought that I would give it a try. I am glad that I did.


      Just like ODD, the encounters on this game are tough, without being impossible
      one you understand how things work, and they are also infinitely varied, as
      you can use different combinations of spells, heroes and nemeses. I am looking
      forward to other expansions becoming available, and will be buying the War Eternal
      box for ''real'' in the near future.'
