Kinda expensive at full price, wait for a 50% off somewhere else.\nThe soundtrack as a whole is nice and ties the whole X series together, but the meat of the soundtrack is the X Challenge boss themes. In Maverick Hunter X, the X1 soundtrack was just revamped into some futuristic techno stuff which was really dissapointing. In this soundtrack, the arranger understood what was great about each boss theme and worked off of that, expanding upon the great song that was already there and making it better. The jewel of this soundtrack is of course the original instrumental boss theme RE;FUTURE, which matches the music of the soundtrack and shows off what an X soundtrack should be on modern platforms.\nThe issue I had with this soundtrack was when I bought it, I wasn't able to download it. I tried everything, looking at fourms on steam and contacting Capcom support. After a month of concacting support they found that there was an error with steam's download and I could finally listen to it in all its glory. I would say that I might just be unlucky but I am not the only person with this issue, so unforutnately I cannot reccoment that it be downloaded on this platform. If you enjoyed the soundtrack in the game please support Capcom and buy it on another platform.","timestamp_created":1546495073,"timestamp_updated":1546495073,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":26,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.743040680885314941","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rsOSiegCe7ertwE="}
