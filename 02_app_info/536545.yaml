    review: Unhappy with this, the best crop duster of them all, included in the pack,
      doesn't install properly. It's completely unavailable in free mode, is an option
      from FARM AIR missions, but it doesn't load the plane, it inserts whatever you
      flew last and places you several feet in the air with zero speed. Very disappointed
      with this.
