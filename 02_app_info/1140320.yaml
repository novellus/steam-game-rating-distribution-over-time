      Deities(1998), by Eric L. Boyd, is the third deity book for the Forgotten Realms.
      It was published in November 1998.<br><br><strong>Origins (I):</strong> Yet
      More Realms Deities. Faiths &amp; Avatars(1996) detailed the majority of the
      major deities from the Realms, then Powers &amp; Pantheons(1997) delved into
      demipowers and more far-flung faiths. So what do you do as an encore? The series
      returned with Demihuman Deities(1998), which reveals the pantheons for the drow,
      dwarves, elves, gnomes, and halflings.<br><br>Like the previous volume, this
      one is thanks to Eric L. Boyd; unlike the previous volume, it''s largely unpadded,
      full of gods and not much else.<br><br><strong>Origins (II):</strong> A History
      of Demihuman Deities. Demihuman deities didn''t get any love in Supplement IV:
      Gods, Demi-Gods &amp; Heroes(1976). That changed with D&amp;D''s first adventures:
      the Elder Elemental God of the drow was first mentioned in the &quot;G&quot;
      adventures (1978), then Lolth was similarly referenced in the &quot;D&quot;
      adventures (1978), before actually appearing in Q1: &quot;Queen of the Demonweb
      Pits&quot; (1980).<br><br>The deific floodgates broke in Advanced Dungeons &amp;
      Dragons''s Deities &amp; Demigods(1980), which revealed numerous nonhuman deities
      for the first time ever. This included many evil humanoid''s gods and revisited
      the drow''s Lolth. Lawrence Schick also introduced several gods for the more
      socially acceptable demihuman races, including: the dwarves'' Moradin; the elves''
      Correlon Larethian, Deep Sashelas, and Rillifane Rallathil; the gnomes'' Garl
      Glittergold; and the halflings'' Yondalla. Roger E. Moore then followed up with
      a pivotal series of articles running from Dragon #58(February 1982) to Dragon
      #63(July 1982), each of which investigated the &quot;point of view&quot; of
      a demihuman or humanoid race, then examined their gods as well. Moore''s deity
      lists were muchexpansive than the Schick originals, usually adding four to six
      deities for each race.<br><br>In the AD&amp;D 2e era (1989-2000), Legends &amp;
      Lore(1990) omitted all the nonhuman deities, but supplements quickly made up
      for that lack. FR11: &quot;Dwarves Deep&quot; (1990) revealed the dwarf deities
      for the Realms, many of whom derived directly from Schick and Moore''s work,
      though Greenwood supplied some of his own as well. Greenwood similarly created
      a few new drow deities for FOR2: The Drow of the Underdark(1991). However, the
      avatar rules were changing rapidly in those early days of AD&amp;D 2e, so these
      supplements'' crunch would soon be outdated by the upcoming biggest-ever look
      at nonhuman deities.<br><br>That was Carl Sargent''s DMGR4: Monster Mythology(1992),
      which featured about 25 pages of demihuman deities (and many more monstrous
      nonhumans). Once again, Schick and Moore were the major sources, but Sargent
      also offered several demihuman newcomers. There was one more Realms racial splatbook
      of note, FOR5: Elves of Evermeet(1994). However, it largely revisited known
      deities from Monster Mythology, and its new deities were considered problematic
      enough that most were retconned in this volume.<br><br>Monster Mythology''s25
      pages remained the main reference for demihuman deities for the four years,
      until Demihuman Deitiessaw another vast expansion ...<br><br><strong>NPCs of
      Note.</strong> Though this is a Realms deities manual, many of the featured
      characters have a longer history.<br><br>The major gods of the demihuman races,
      Correlon Larethian(elves), Deep Sashelas(sea elves), Garl Glittergold(gnomes),
      Moradin(dwarves), Rillifane Rallathil(wood elves), and Yondalla(halflings) came
      from Deities &amp; Demigods(1980).<br><br>Two years later, four issues of Dragonmagazine
      vastly increased these deity rolls. Abbathor, Berronar Truesilver, Clanggedin
      Silverbeard, Dumathoin, and Vergadaindebuted in Roger E. Moore''s &quot;The
      Gods of the Dwarves&quot; in Dragon #58(February 1982); Arvoreen, Brandobaris,
      Cyrrollalee, and Sheela Peryroylare from &quot;The Gods of the Halflings&quot;
      in Dragon #59(March 1982); Aerdrie Faenya, Erevan Ilesere, Hanali Celanil, Labelas
      Enoreth, and Solonor Thelandirasprang forth from &quot;The Gods of the Elves&quot;
      in Dragon #60(April 1982); and Baervan Wildwanderer, Flandal Steelskin, Segojan
      Earthcaller,and Urdlenwere discovered in Dragon #61(May 1982).<br><br>In other
      words, about half of the Realms demihuman deities were created by Lawrence Schick
      and Roger E. Moore five to seven years before the Forgotten Realms became an
      official AD&amp;D setting! In fact, these two sources provided the exact lists
      of demihuman gods found in the original Forgotten Realms Campaign Set(1987).<br><br>However,
      new Realms-specific deities soon began to appear, especially in the two aformentioned
      sources for drow and dwarves. The dwarf gods Gorm Gulthyn, Haela Bright Axe,
      Marthammor Dain, Sharindlar, and Thard Harrall turned up in FR11: &quot;Dwarves
      Deep&quot; (1990) Then, Ed Greenwood invented three new drow deities for FOR2:
      The Drow of the Underdark(1991): Eilistraee, Ghaunadaur(a version of Gary Gygax''s
      Elder Elemental God), and Vhaeraun.<br><br>The final clump of new, generic demihuman
      gods appeared in Carl Sargent''s DMGR4: Monster Mythology: Baravar Cloakshadow(gnomes);
      Callarduran Smoothhands(Svirfnebli); Dugmaren Brightmantle(dwarves); Fenmarel
      Mestarine(elves); Gaerdal Ironhand(gnomes); Kiaransalee(drow); Muamman Duathal(dwarves),
      who is said here to be the same as Marthammor Dain; Laduguer(duergar); Nebelun(gnomes);
      Sehanine Moonbow(elf); and Urogalan(halflings).<br><br>Some of these deities
      had interesting antecedents: Sehanine Moonbow had been off-handedly mentioned
      in PHBR8: The Complete Book of Elves(1992) and Urogalan had been alluded to
      in both &quot;The Gods of the Halflings&quot; from Dragon #59March 1982) and
      Unearthed Arcana(1985); obviously, Sargent had been working hard to be inclusive!
      Meanwhile, Kiaransalee would go on to fame as the killer of Orcus in Planes
      of Chaos(1994)<br><br><i>The remaining deities have more varied origins:</i><br><br><ul
