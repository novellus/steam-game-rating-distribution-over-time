      \ /><br>In Miriel Saga, evil creatures known as Dreadlings are fast approaching\
      \ to threaten the world balance and mankind. In a world of might and magic,\
      \ engulfed in conflict since centuries past, it\u2019s your role to stand up\
      \ for all, gather your allies and solve the remaining mysteries to unfold in\
      \ this story-driven, action packed RPG!<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1148710/extras/Img1.png?t=1608825969\"\

      \ /><br>For eons, Miriel has existed, brimming with life and mana. With mana,\
      \ came the power to bend reality at will. This widespread ability has been called\
      \ \u201CMagic\u201D to this day. Those who wielded magic are called \u201CEvokers\u201D\
      <br>However, once upon a time, magic entered into collapse. A young evoker,\
      \ sought a way to harness mana, corrupting it in the process. Evokers started\
      \ losing their ability to use magic and this one evoker became more and more\
      \ powerful. For the first time, the whole world united itself against one enemy.\
      \ This was known as the \u201CAge of Darkness\u201D, until the corrupted mana,\
      \ the Miasma, was sealed away at the southern continent, after a grueling war.<br>After\
      \ the war was over, people were lost and frightened. Afraid to share the knowledge\
      \ and power over magic and give birth to another nemesis, the remaining evokers\
      \ started living in isolation,over the eastern continent, Linnah.<br>Ex-Evokers\
      \ started studying mana and its properties, unable to wield mana normally, except\
      \ when discovered that Mana is raw, wordly, vital energy, one\u2019s life could\
      \ fuel a magic\u2019s need for mana; Thus, the Arcanists of the northern continent,\
      \ Kristi, were born.<br>The ones who now didn\u2019t have magical talents, now\
      \ as the majority of the population, began to live in fear of a possible persecution\
      \ from Evokers and Arcanists alike. Their sense of unity grew and inflated over\
      \ the decades. The Manaless developed technology, industry and weapons to defend\
      \ themselves. It was the beginning of the Military State of Boleslava, on the\
      \ western continent.<br>It was not long until instability grew among the nations\
      \ and conflict began once again, on the central continent. All of them were\
      \ equally matched and had no winner. However, the clash made the area unstable,\
      \ and chaos rose anew as the once sealed evil began to show it\u2019s gaze\u2026\
      <br>Once again, humankind was faced with an overwhelming enemy. Once again,\
      \ they set differences aside and united against one common enemy. Once again,\
      \ their efforts bore the fruits of victory. The new country, Zefral, was consolidated\
      \ on the old battlefield, with Accord as it's capital, to remember what unity\
      \ brought to all nations: Victory, glory, peace. This marked the end of the\

    review: So the voice acting is great some names of certain characters don't fit
      at some points. The gameplay is awesome but the mapping system, the input before
      you launch the game if you don't know, could be simplified a little bit. The
      characters are charming and everything. I know this is early access so I'm not
      judging it too bad cause its an Early Access, there's bound to be some issues.
      Also first boss was easy due to a glitch where it couldn't harm me XD
