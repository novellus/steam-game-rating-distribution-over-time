At some point, while you're crafting ornaments and putting them on your tree, something you grab won't let go. It happens every time. Too bad cause I like the concept and the execution, but when you get stuck because you can't let go of the last thing you grabbed, it all goes south. Please  fix this issue, so I can change my review to positive.","timestamp_created":1575255370,"timestamp_updated":1575255370,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwka2i4u4Cc+T+4AE="}
