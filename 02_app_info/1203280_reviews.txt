I dont know how he got verified still, but he put together a pretty fun game. Watching how it was made and then playing the game adds a little something extra to it. I look forward to seeing how he updates it in the future. Specifically, I hope to see some sort of in game scoreboard so I can tell if I am winning or not and also maybe some moving platforms. Simple game play, but i can see myself killing a lot of time on a game like this, especially when it comes to mobile.","timestamp_created":1577925116,"timestamp_updated":1577925116,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwhtDqse8CcNGK6QE="}
