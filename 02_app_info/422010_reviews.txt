And this, Reader -- this, I think, is a great work.\n\nI always appreciated literature; perhaps it was a way of finding representation that for me was not available in most instances of mainstream culture. Sometimes, I would find a fragment so relatable, so viscerally true, that I had to read it out loud.\n\nWith most of Porpentine's games, I found myself reading aloud more often than not. 'The parasite has spun a palace of my stolen years.'  'But it hurts, being faceless.' 'I returned, woefully, to myself'. 'Branded heretic accross the forehead'. I found the games seven years ago: a meaningful, hopeful melody in a terrible place. In spite of offering this hope, Porpentine never offers the platitudes that so often go with it. It's the experience of someone who has really been there, converted into hypertext, the collective voice of a non-normative experience lived at the fringes of society; of how perilous this experience is not only emotionally, but also socially or economically. The pain is acknowledged. The fall is acknowledged. The ability to stand up and go on after that fall is acknowledged; so is the fact that often, to stand up will be impossible -- and because of that, her message is empowering.\n\nThe prose is evocative, melancholy, whimsical, often just plain weird. But this strange juxtaposition is a perfect fit for her chosen medium: hypertext.","timestamp_created":1562528182,"timestamp_updated":1562528182,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.616117954254150391","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1573683905,"developer_response":"thank you <3 to be read out loud is special. seven years ago was a very hard time for me, and platitudes have never helped me. but things are a lot better now than they were, for which i'm grateful."}],"cursor":"AoJw7/375usCeJvkzQE="}
