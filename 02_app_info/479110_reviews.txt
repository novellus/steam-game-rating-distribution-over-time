Some of the characters seem like they're on catnip and they add a lot to the light-hearted humor. The graphics are sharp and gameplay smooth; boss fights may get frustrating at times since some try to mimic the toughness of old-school bosses in arcade games. The music in the earliest areas was headache inducing, but other than that, this game is worth its price. This is probably one of the nicest games of our times and the least publicized. Try it.","timestamp_created":1472668951,"timestamp_updated":1599378321,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.475521385669708252","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45o2YsfQCcb20YA=="}
