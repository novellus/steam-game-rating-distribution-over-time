    review: There isn't a lot to this experience but I think it would make a nice
      intro to what VR can do. The various displays are just scenes that have been
      given depth by separating the various parts kind of like a pop-up novelty greeting
      card, but the effect is good. The museum is very nicely done. It only took a
      few minutes to race around and have a quick look at most of the displays, and
      I don't know about replay value, but it does seem like a great way to introduce
      guests and friends to the ability of VR to take you to places and let you experience
      some cool stuff. I'll definitely go back in to see it in more detail.
