I have to admit I don't quite like the story. I think it is a little bit poor-written, and the English translation aren't good. Also, the end of the plot is kind of unclear...\n\nNonetheless, the social problems posted in the story are quite real, both in the age this got originally published (2002) and today. [spoiler] Also, the China problem isn't getting any better ... [/spoiler]\n\nAs for the music... The music pieces are fine albeit unpolished. But in my humble opinion, it would be a lot better if some dynamic range compressors are applied to the background music.","timestamp_created":1529756983,"timestamp_updated":1576315654,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw94Hvge8CddLzowE="}
