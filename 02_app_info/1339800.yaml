    about_the_game: "Content:<br />\r\nOver 50 levels<br />\r\nTest your speed with\
      \ an all-new timer and challenge your friends to see who is the fastest.<br\
      \ />\r\nLeaderboard system with a weekly refresh<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhy I made\
      \ this game:<br />\r\nI made this game because I wanted to expand on Seeker\
      \ my first game released on this platform. I took the base game and expanded\
      \ it by having more levels but keeping the core gameplay the same. I added new\
      \ levels for everyone to enjoy and explore. I wanted to see if I could make\
      \ another great game for everyone to enjoy. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat this game\
      \ expresses:<br />\r\nSeeker 2 features a relaxing story where the player can\
      \ enjoy playing the game without worrying about competition. Seeker 2 is a great\
      \ singleplayer game where the player can take as much time as possible to explore\
      \ old and new islands. The Content for Seeker 2 will have more updates than\
      \ Seeker. I want to keep growing Seeker 2 over time with new levels and a new\
      \ system that this game hits milestones. This will either be small or large\
      \ updates. The game is for those who want to relax and enjoy a video game that\
      \ is easy to pick up and fair.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverview of the\
      \ game:<br />\r\nSeeker 2 like the original Seeker in terms of gameplay value\
      \ and fun. Seeker 2 is a stress-relieving game where you can play for the story\
      \ or seek out adventure and discover the map. Seeker is about a stranded alien\
      \ named Alfie who needs to find five stars to power up the spaceship. Help Alfie\
      \ find the stars and get back home! The game is set on an island where Alfie\
      \ is set up for an adventure to gather the stars of power. Alfie is from another\
      \ solar system and in his solar system, the gravity is much denser than our\
      \ own. Alfie can use this to fly around the level looking for the stars that\
      \ are on the ground waiting for him to pick up."
