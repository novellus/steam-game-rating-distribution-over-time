Now it's free to play. Am I upset? Nope. This is a good game and I want players playing it. You can play several PvP games (TDM, CTF, objective, etc.) or coop or PvE. You can build your own maps easily. You can customize your character. You can spend hours just building worlds. There's all kind of weapons, building blocks, ramps, teleports, balloons, chests, plants, modifiers of all kinds. There's a huge amount of variety available in the gameplay.\n\nAll that is worth a lot more than $2.99. The game runs smoothly and the different game modes are fun. I experienced no crashes or bugs. There's really only one problem. Almost nobody plays it. I don't know why other than it's VR (although you can play non-VR). Anyways, tell your non-VR buddies to play this. Let's get people on this game.\n\nBTW, the game has PvE bots so even with nobody on you can play a wave based mode. It's still fun and you get to see what the community made as far as maps and get some inspiration to build your own world!\n\nRate 7/10. I would rate it higher, but with no playerbase it's really hard to do that. But this is a quality VR game that people need to start playing! Download it now!
