Its a simple but fantastic game. Its nostalgic of very old classic adventure RPGS which I used to play as a kid, which gives it a nice feel; As if I were back at home playing in the good old 90's as a hero to defeat evil. The sound track is pretty awesome, but my favorite part about this game would have to be the different bosses. I enjoyed their unique designs. Overall, its a good game which I recommend people give it a try and play it and experience it for yourself. For some reason, it felt like the game mother aka earthbound, I am not sure why XD. The main character reminds me of Ness. Its a really cool design. Great job, keep up the good work! Im excited and look forward to future developments. :)","timestamp_created":1517721734,"timestamp_updated":1517721734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.298045724630355835","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt/nQr+ECdaf6lwE="}
