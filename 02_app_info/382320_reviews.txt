That, and the fact there doesn't seem to be a new chapter of the game, despite the game finishing on a cliffhanger.\n\nSo first, the positives.\n- Graphics are nice, though admittedly they are asset store purchases.\n- Battle system is adequately balanced\n- Has the seeds of a good story\n\nThe negatives:\n- In the dialogue, there are case issues and a few spelling issues\n- The dialogue seems rushed, especially in the second half of the game\n- There don't seem to be any real stakes in the story. At one point both characters die, and then they are resurrected and continue on like nothing happened\n- The game only has one boss, really, and I didn't even realise it was the boss until after the battle was over. There should have been some different music or something.\n\nSorry to be so harsh. I didn't feel like my time was wasted playing, but I hope if you ever release the next chapter, you will fix some of the issues that prevented this from being a great game.","timestamp_created":1533875996,"timestamp_updated":1533875996,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1siIkeUCdL/9pwE="}
