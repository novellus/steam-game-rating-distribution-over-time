Really poor quality models, 4x3 cockpit with crude and low-res detail. Some of the aircraft (Nieuport and Pup) have no roundels or markings. The flight models are completely unrealistic, with no prop torque modelled, no drift on takeoff or any of the expected characteristics of a WW1 rotary-engined aircraft. All three aircraft seem to fly the same.\n\nEven at sale price, don't bother. This pack is far worse than some of the free DLC you can find if you search the net.","timestamp_created":1569328733,"timestamp_updated":1569328733,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563388049602508545","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tIPSse0CdOzl0gE="}
