    review: "I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019ve been avoiding this one. I picked it up\
      \ around its original release because I\u2019m a pretty big fan of the developer\u2019\
      s previous game, Spaceport Hope. The pitch is good, the game looks expansive,\
      \ and so I had high hopes for digging deep into External Visions. But it didn\u2019\
      t take me long to start running into roadblocks to my enjoyment, more and more\
      \ until I decided to put the game down for awhile. Maybe I wasn\u2019t in the\
      \ mood for an off-beat metroidvania, I thought. I\u2019ve tried to get back\
      \ into it several times since then, and each time has only solidified what I\
      \ already knew\u2026 It\u2019s not me, game, it\u2019s you.\n\nExternal Visions\
      \ ostensibly takes place in the mind of a regular everyman struggling with depression.\
      \ His battle has turned his mental landscape into an actual battlefield, rife\
      \ with grotesque monsters and oppressive entities. If he is to have any chance\
      \ of escaping his pain, you\u2019ll need to guide him through the vast halls\
      \ and labyrinths to do battle with the beasts that inhabit them. You\u2019ll\
      \ meet some helpful folks along the way, presumably positive parts of his psyche\
      \ or memories of people that have survived the darkness. Ultimately you\u2019\
      ll be questing for a whole little society in here, which only makes the stakes\
      \ higher.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s a good pitch for a game, but the mind is forever\
      \ a perilous place to place your game. Surrealism and symbolism aren\u2019t\
      \ as simple as putting cracks or mold on your floor tiles, after all. Every\
      \ part of the game\u2019s design needs to be informed by the decision to set\
      \ it in an unreal place, making sure to consider the meaning of every enemy\
      \ placement, color palette, and sidequest. To put it bluntly, External Visions\
      \ doesn\u2019t do that. You know this is all inside your character\u2019s mind\
      \ because people tell you, not because there\u2019s any clear symbolism that\
      \ reveals his traumas and coping mechanisms. There\u2019s also no significant\
      \ character development OUTSIDE your character\u2019s mind, which gives less\
      \ context and less reason to care about whatever happens INSIDE it.\n\nThat\
      \ wasn\u2019t even what hung me up on the game, though. External Visions plays\
      \ like a solid enough metroidvania, giving you a vast map of interconnected\
      \ rooms to explore and items to find among them. However, your primary means\
      \ of overcoming obstacles is not in the items you collect, but in weapons you\
      \ essentially borrow. There are terminals all over the game with numbers 1,\
      \ 2, and 3 on them. Each is a ranged weapon with a special purpose, like 3 which\
      \ fires yellow blasts that solidify into blocks you can jump on. You must find\
      \ a terminal to use that weapon, and you can only use one at a time. I know\
      \ what you\u2019re thinking, and yes, those terminals are not terribly numerous.\
      \ So to solve many of the puzzles in the game, you\u2019re going to be backtracking\
      \ just to pick up the weapon you\u2019re supposed to have at the moment.\n\n\
      It\u2019s an absolutely inexplicable design decision, and one that kills the\
      \ pacing of the game. I\u2019ve absolutely had moments where I had a choice\
      \ between two weapons, picked one, and progressed for 5 or 10 minutes just to\
      \ reach a roadblock I should have picked the other for. It\u2019s hardly the\
      \ only issue with the game, either. The difficulty is all over the place, starting\
      \ out even enough for the first hour or two and then spiraling out of control\
      \ from the library. Controller support is limited and may require manual bindings\
      \ to get it working, and some of the choices for sound effects can seriously\
      \ grate after awhile. These are mostly small complaints but the add to the big\
      \ ones in a way that\u2019s hard to ignore.\n\nI know a lot of heart went into\
      \ making this game, which is why I hate having to describe it in these terms.\
      \ But there\u2019s no getting around it, External Visions doesn\u2019t come\
      \ together in a satisfying way. The core themes are not as fleshed out as they\
      \ need to be, and the core gameplay has serious deficiencies that make it hard\
      \ to stick with. It makes it that much harder to see decent art direction and\
      \ level design go into such a flawed game, but no matter how much I want to\
      \ enjoy it, I can\u2019t. I hope this title has been a learning experience for\
      \ team BitClub, and that their next game is every bit the success I wanted this\
      \ one to be.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly\
      \ hope you'll check out more of them at https://goldplatedgames.com/ or on my\
