    review: "This game doesn't deserve the low score it's been getting as far as a\
      \ finished product its absolutely competent. And as far as its format, it's\
      \ easy to get into and have fun with despite the boardgame mechanic. If you\
      \ already enjoy games like GO or Reversi, then this game is a must.  I feel\
      \ that a lot of people gets turned off by this especially during a period where\
      \ games are more \"direct\" and \"action oriented\" rather than cerebral and\
      \ at times abstract. \n\nThis game is absolutely worth that. And for someone\
      \ like me who's rented games like Ogre Battle, JRPGs and thought FFT was the\
      \ second coming of Odin, its sense of aesthetic and play was a refreshing discovery.\
      \  There's a lot to be found in the classic mechanics of the game it was based\
      \ on that this game has accomplished in its attempt to dress it up for a retro\
      \ crowd:\n\n+ Gear ,Equipment, Loot ! \n+ \"Deck building\" your armies and\
      \ pieces as they get placed on the board and perform various tricks. \n+  Interesting\
      \ limits and parameters that aren't just reduced to \"hit them until they die\"\
      \ \n+ Colorful Spritework, Animations, and a classical art style \n+ High intensity\
      \ reversi violence ! \n\nOften have I wondered if RPGs would have been more\
      \ interesting if they were based on Chess or distilled the anxiety of choice\
      \ like poker did. It's good to know that there are daring devs out there that\
      \ pulls off works of art like this one.  \n\nCons: \n-As of now I've yet to\
      \ finish the game but I'm glad it exists and I can pick it up whenever I get\
      \ the itch for fantasy / tactics games again \n- I honestly went into this blind\
      \ and was surprised at how good it actually was. I know some people will be\
      \ caught off guard by the abstracted game space but it's all worth it if you\
      \ don't mind the grind. \n- The challenge will probably piss people off too,\
      \ but I'm not a weak piece of shit so ... \n"
