Bella, now in age and learning about her lineage, is ready to deliver her parents from their fate though her godmothers got kidnapped and jailed by the evil witch...\n\nThe plot is still the same from the previous games: you have to purge scenes of all evil or to reconstitute portraits to save people in it (here, you have mainly the godmothers). You have also a magic wand to break stuff and also acquiring powers thanks to the fairies once free. You can also use a music instrument to call the dragon to lift heavy items.\n\nThe gameplay is very classic though, with HO scenes and some puzzles (well the portraits mainly). While I loved the first part, when on the beach or in the castle, I felt a little bored.\n\nThe graphics are quite good, I loved the little mandragores though I hated the spider, too big for my taste. The voice actings for the dragon, the fairy or the witch are correct but the godmothers... Not only they looked like the same but I can't say I was charmed by their voice.\n\nAnyway, the problem with this third game is that after a while, you're getting bored. You're trying to defeat the same witch since the first game, there is no real new magic trick....\n\nIt's not bad but not a great game too. So, I'm still recommending it as I've enjoyed a part of it, more than some other games.","timestamp_created":1449089028,"timestamp_updated":1449089028,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593271374702453613","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+vmbstECfOiWSg=="}
