The environment is unfinished, the character models are unfinished, the animation is unfinished, the sound effects are stock sounds, what little story is there makes no sense, the voice acting sounds like it was done over cheap PC headsets...Literally nothing about this game is actually finished.  This the weirdest thing I've seen in a long time.","timestamp_created":1604097106,"timestamp_updated":1604097106,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhezovfUCerOVqwI="}
