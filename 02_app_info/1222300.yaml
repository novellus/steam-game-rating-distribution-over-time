    review: I think this game is an extremely good SIMULATOR side of the firefighting
      games out there. This is a good game overall and I like to play it, the only
      thing I see is I would like a tactical command view and AI. I saw something
      with emergeNYC and they have a tactical view where you can have AI trucks drive
      themselves to where you tell them to go. This would really help with players
      like me who don't really favor the multi player experience, and it could also
      help in multi player to. I also would like AI firefighters that you can command,
      for example, I send an Engine Company from a station to a scene, and in tactical
      view I select the Engine and click something like "Quick Deploy" and all the
      firefighters hop out and grab their gear. Then you get a firefighter with a
      hose and get them into a fire. I understand this could take time (before anybody
      gets angry) and money, just a suggestion. Overall a really enjoyable game with
      updates almost every week. This is a game worth getting if you like really sim
      firefighting games.
