It might be a funny joke but should not be for sale.\nI don't even think the play time tracker is working for this, good maybe I can get a refund!\nIf you have companion hold position they don't use their ranged weapon.\nIf you get damaged you can't rest properly in a settlement to recover. \nIf you don't top the mauradurs  in the starting quest they become a large party you can't beat as you cannot recruit anyone at that time.\nThe unarmed zombies can block.... why? \nSo you expect a player to wack all these zombies with hoe for 12 exp and take 0 damage to survive the muarader quest before being able to get any more equipment or troops?\nFunny, yes hah hah your arrows don't come back after battle, oh so hardcore.\nThis shouldn't be sold.","timestamp_created":1602728993,"timestamp_updated":1602729081,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ip+GlfUCfen3pwI="}
