It's basically a tally of your tasks, and if you do more tasks per mission such as destroy or collect objects; that will be the total which you can deduct or add from. You will never spend any of the currency and run out. Likewise, you can not save up for parts. You can customize the legs, arms, body and the paint for them. There is no paint all parts at once option, and you can put an emblem on each part if you want. The weapons sound and look good, the story is your good versus bad dichotomy. All the bosses are annoying as hell, it's really just, how can you trap them in a corner long enough to deplete the bullet sponges they are. The end boss moves lightning fast compared to the rest of the game, and is very agitating. I only played to the end so far, and have not completed it entirely, but for five dollars on sale I would say this game is great for the mecha fanatic. This is an action installment of a very good strategy game and it falls short for Front Mission Fans, but that is not to say that I don't enjoy it.\n\n","timestamp_created":1609132050,"timestamp_updated":1609132050,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5dDv0/YCdrP/vQI="}
