Staff did not respond to my post asking for help getting to run\n\nThe game is ridiculously on rails and most of your choices do not matter. It does a decent job setting up the atmosphere but the characters are generally flat and do not develop, most of the game is aimless faffing around. There's one genuinely interesting plot twist but it comes up so later that it feels more like sequal bait than anything else.\n\n","timestamp_created":1609203068,"timestamp_updated":1609203068,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxsX+1fYCecikvgI="}
