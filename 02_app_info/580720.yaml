    review: I think it's ironic that this is essentially a touchscreen smartphone
      app that kinda gets carried by the decent audio.  There is no engaging story
      mode.  There is simply a pre-scripted sequence of events for each level, and
      you can score perfect points if you simply practice and memorize the correct
      sequences of commands.
