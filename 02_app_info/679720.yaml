    short_description: Any day being eaten alive does not seem like a joyous activity,
      especially when you are up against a reckless animal that can devour you with
      ease. There are more than enough animals for zombie uprising and this farm dispatched
      the first of the undead. Are you ready to enter this madness!?

    review: Honestly not sure where to start here. The trailer looked intriguing,
      so I purchased the game. No refund for this dude. I freaking love this game.  BLOOD
      AND LIMBS FLYING GALORE! Also a lot of work has been put into it between release
      and now. The maker(s?) is/are very responsive to addressing problems with the
      game. While I've found a few funny glitches here and there, I cannot praise
      the game enough. Essentially you just enter the game and after selecting which
      mode you want to play, youre thrown right into the chaos. I just got right into
      the story mode. The 'story' is pretty much nonexistent, but it's still a very
      immersive game. I blinked a few times as various critters jumped virtually in
      front of my eyeballs. The environments are really cute and fun, and there's
      a good variety of weapons; slingshot/dynamite thing (haha), bow and arrow, chainsaw,
      and axes. There's a few other little addons I found once I got past the farm,
      but I won't spoil it for you cause its fun to figure out how to use them and
      to figure out what they are. Although there was one time I got out of the farm
      area, and the goodies did not spawn at all. Probably just a glitch. Anyhow,
      this is basically a wave shooter. You don't really move around at all, which
      is the ONE thing I wish I could change about the game. There are some really
      neat environments here, and it's a shame that I don't have the option to move
      around freely with the thumbpad button to enjoy them more fully. I can't even
      explain how amazing it'd be to move around the environments while fighting off
      the waves of zombified farm animals. Anyway, for the price I feel that it's
      a fair price to ask. It's one of my personal favorite games for the VR, and
      if free movement is added, this will be an absolute STEAL of a price. Congrats
      to the makers though, this game is amazing.
