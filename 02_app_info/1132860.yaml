      \ there is a progressive evolution of the things you can do throughout the game.\
      \ First, the basic mechanics of walking and jumping are given to the player\
      \ on the first area, the Village. There is where you will be able to talk with\
      \ the different NPCs making use of a dialog system. There is also where the\
      \ player is given the first power, the Earth, granting you the ability to swim\
      \ in mud, being able to reach places you couldn\u2019t otherwise. With this,\
      \ the gameplay becomes more agile and dynamic, but not as much as when you are\
      \ granted with the Fire power a bit later, a fire dash. <br><br>That is the\
      \ moment in which the gameplay becomes the fastest and funniest. Then, the player\

      \ game is fast, but more importantly, dynamic. The enemies and level design\
      \ of the areas create interesting situations, and the art always stands as something\
      \ pleasing to see while playing the game. There are some cinematics in the most\
      \ important parts, and at the end, there is a final boss battle in which the\
