    review: 'saw this game on the store and the videos looked like a decent vr game.
      it was on sale so I got it. this game is just frustrating for me. I''m 6 feet
      tall and have decent arm length, but when I tried the tatami poles I found that
      I wasn''t able to cut the poles by swinging my arm without taking a full step
      towards the pole when the poles can appear all around you which gets frustrating.
      then there''s the fruit. granted the fruit are thrown towards you which makes
      reach a non-issue, but when I cut one fruit and then the edge of my blade bounces
      the second and third fruits across the room, and I haven''t slowed my swing
      down, I''m going to get frustrated.


      to anyone who reads this review: the game isn''t worth your time. there''s only
      a small amount of content and what the game does have is poorly designed and
      buggy. the only reason you might buy this game is if you buy it solely for the
      aesthetics, which are the games only redeeming quality, but if you want a game
      and not art then go buy something like fruit ninja vr. heck even if you want
      art you can easily find better than this on the steam store.'
