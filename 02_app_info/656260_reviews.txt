I've always stayed away from VR for fear of the motion sickness issues so frequently talked about and encountered by many users, but with this game I didn't experience any of those things.\n\nThis is a very fast-paced game, and playing it in a fully immersive VR setting is an amazing experience. When I play CS:GO or other PC shooters, I tend to subconsciously shift in my seat the direction that I want my character to go, but often times my in-game character is moving either in a direction I don't actually want or too slowly. With this game I actually feel like I'm in total control, which is super neat.\n\nI encourage everyone who owns a VR headset to try this out.","timestamp_created":1513727888,"timestamp_updated":1513727888,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.409605652093887329","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwqNHNuOACcqPSkgE="}
