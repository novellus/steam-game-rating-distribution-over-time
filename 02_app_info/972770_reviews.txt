You are the mail man and have to deliver the mail. You can do a lot of other quests as well, mostly fetch quests or knocking somebody out for attacking/insulting somebody. The relationship-system tracks all your deeds, good and bad, so if you kill and rob, people will be hostile towards you.\nHowever, you can turn on peaceful mode and enjoy a day in nature, exploring the world, bringing gifts to people or trade with them. \nIn encountered some glitches/bugs, but nothing really annoying. (Dead wolves and bears tend to growl when you approach them) This is clearly a labour of love and I loved playing it. The only thing that was a little disappointing were the last two regions, which were a little bit too empty for my taste.","timestamp_created":1609623665,"timestamp_updated":1609623665,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lv/C4vYCfcPuvwI="}
