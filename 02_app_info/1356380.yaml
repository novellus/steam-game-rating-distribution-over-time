    review: "Pendelum is such a neat concept. Although I admittedly don't have much\
      \ experience with physics-based puzzle games, I've never played anything like\
      \ it. The level design is quite good, in general. I liked the feeling of simply\
      \ moving the pendulum (as it has a certain weight to it), and in trying to maintain\
      \ enough height to maneuver with some precision. I decided to pick up Pendelum\
      \ so that my co-op partner and I could play through the three sets of levels\
      \ designed specifically for co-op play. \n\nHowever, I do have a few gripes.\
      \ First of all, it's just a bit too punishing for my tastes. Levels come in\
      \ sets of four, and if you don't complete the whole set in one go, you'll have\
      \ to start again from the first one in the set (even if you've made it to the\
      \ final level). There are also no checkpoints in the levels themselves. This\
      \ omission is more forgivable - however, some of the levels are quite long.\
      \ My co-op partner and I failed repeatedly on the penultimate level within the\
      \ second set of co-op levels, and then put the game down until the following\
      \ week. We picked it back up again, made it to the final level, but again failed\
      \ repeatedly until we became exhausted with the game.\n\nWhen you play a level\
      \ as many times as we did, certain things begin to grate. The pleasant & chipper\
      \ music becomes obnoxious, you realize how some of the levels require one player\
      \ to just sit around while the other performs a task (rather than playing simultaneously),\
      \ and you notice how certain level obstacles can be a bit unpredictable (like\
      \ the rows of fans). When you fail when navigating obstacles like this, it can\
      \ be difficult to tell exactly what you've done wrong.\n\nI can't say that we\
