    review: "It is quite an interesting experience, which requires an open mind and\
      \ high tolerance for failure, particularly the first few times you play it.\
      \ Once you discover the hidden mechanics (e.g. you can create boxes of your\
      \ own), it takes a completely different angle. \n\nSurprisingly good bang for\
      \ the buck :D"
