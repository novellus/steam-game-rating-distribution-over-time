    review: "[h1] Review zu Kyle is Santa - Kyle is Famous Holiday Expansion DLC [/h1]\n\
      \nDieses DLC bietet 11 Neue Endings die auch als Erfolge gelten. Kyle wird zu\
      \ Santa Clause bzw Er denkt er w\xE4re Santa Clause und will Freude & Geschenke\
      \ unter die Leute bringen. Wie auch schon im Hauptspiel gibt es viele Absurde\
      \ Humorvolle Dialoge bzw. Endings. Der verlangte Preis ist schon gerechtfertigt,\
      \ da das Hauptspiel schon Kostenlos angeboten wird und wirklich gut ist\n\n\n\
