It shows the rarely explored but incredibly thrilling world of surviving a society where status is literally life and death, and currency isn't just a matter of coin. It definitely avoided info dumps, but at times this could be more confusing than not.  However you can click the grey box options to review your stats, definitions, and generally get additional intell. I would highly recommend checking your stats often while still taking risky or even out of field choices. What the game does well is it doesn't just reward you for choosing the \"right\" answer as a player, but the complex answer as your character. Just because you're good at something doesn't mean other characters immediately yield. If I was to compare this to a AAA game experience it would be Dragon Age: Inquisition's The Winter Palace quest and the Dragon Age flash game \"The Last Court\". This game does an excellent job of showing that wars are fought and won in a conversation as often as a sword fight, while still indulging in compelling action.\n\nThe weakest part of this game is the spina system. It doesn't feel completely worked through. For the limited resources you have the cost of Spina exceeds your opportunities to get it if you play a character relying on cunning. This  doesn't really sink in until the end game where I, one of the most respected and influential among the gentry was shunned at 0 spina. It's not that it should have been easier to get spina, but that the definition of what earns spina is unclear or inconsistent. Bold actions can gain you spina, but subterfuge is not inherently in conflict with boldness. Several points in the game you can make potentially life ending choices and have to rely on either a particularly brilliant lie or speak out and risk everything. So with this in mind how far must one go to earn spina. It says willpower is a determinate hence boldness, but both are more than overtly risky actions like a duel or race. They are risky lies. They are pushing your influence to the extreme. It should be hard to earn spina but my first play through never gave me the opportunity not because the text didn't support it, but because it seemed like the game had a very specific thing in mind.","timestamp_created":1608700853,"timestamp_updated":1608700853,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sN+Cx/YCdpKuvAI="}
