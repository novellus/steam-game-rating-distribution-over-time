    review: 'Easily the most disappointing DLC I have purchased from Tabletop Simulator,
      Warfighter is a game with complicated rules and extremely poor explanations
      to dictate how this game plays.


      The idea of this game is that you are engaging in modern warfare, dealing with
      modern day soldiers in modern day settings. You deal with modern day situations
      that may arise in third word nations, looking to achieve some mission objective
      or another in a hostile environment, using modern day military equipment, and
      fighting modern types of enemies.


      To say that the premise for this game is excellent is an understatement, but
      it is totally let down by getting players into the game.


      Not recommended.'
