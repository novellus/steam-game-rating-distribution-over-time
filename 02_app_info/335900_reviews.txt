People about the online part that gives you the option tbh I'm just as confused as you lols :D I mean why... why? like seriously why Does \"Angels of Fasaria\" even give you the option to go online, here at first I was thinking Fasaria World was a cliche or code name for a server so I was like you and clicked it tried to sign up and only after 30 mins later of exhausting all paths to why the Steam Key was not showing it's ugly face in my direction, it then clicked in there was 2 games... like wtf lols seriously? anyways a simple \"If\" statement in the code to check if that specific game file was on your computer and if it existed then yes suggest for heavens sake, but please don't suggest if the game is non existent on our PC's like what's wrong with ya lols! Seriously what language is the game programmed in and what is the game file's name for the online and I seriously can write up a working code that will save all of us some time! If you think the wild goose chase is entertaining I'm sorry to break it, \"It's a big fat NO!!!\" but people please listen here the programmer needs to go back to programming school there is no such thing as a Key or Online mode with just a \"Standalone\" version of Angels of Fasaria, as that's just an offline mode game, I mean I have in the past seen games with retro rpg graphics that were also online like runescape and maplestory but anything from RPG Maker as a whole is gonna mostly and or always be just purely offline! I looked into their 3D online game and was eeks so this the game that's online... wow... :P anyways now i have the job to write up an honest review from what I seen an saw and experienced :D oh yes my pleasure! Cracks fingures... so look this game is alright as in Offline basic RPG style game, I can tell you as it stands collect and use items, questing, be sure to save a minimum of once when creating a new game and before you leave the King about your odd dreams you had, cuz as all RPG Maker games for most part if you die you get sent back to title screen and literally have to start a new game, so scrap the auto saving features lols, I would play this casually but not as a full on game, if you want a casual game you play a few mins here or there then yes this is Otay, but I wouldn't say this is exactly material to hook you in and make you wanna play till the end! There is better quality games that exist out there that won't waste your time and 2 will auto save and 3 are alot more fun to play! :D","timestamp_created":1545411232,"timestamp_updated":1545416122,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.466101676225662231","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6dP+6OcCc9vytQE="}
