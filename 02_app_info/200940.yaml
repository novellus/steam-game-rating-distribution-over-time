    review: 'The first Sonic game I ever finished and by god it was hard. Most people
      already know what they are up to when buying a Sonic game, so I don''t have
      to explain much. You are up to an too fast game with death traps everywhere,
      so expect to die a lot.


      Technically you can play it up to a resoltion to 1920x1080 and besides looking
      a little blurry, it''s fine.


      + The cartoon intro and outro sequenzes are really good and well made.


      Time to finish the game: 2,2 hours'
