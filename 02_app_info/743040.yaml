      \ update, we're happy to introduce new encodings of <i>The Pull</i>, featuring\

    review: "I enjoyed the experience. The music was good and there were some nice\
      \ artistic scenes, it was visually interesting. Well-directed going from one\
      \ scene to the next. It had a nice atmosphere throughout. However, the 360 video\
      \ quality was not the best, even in the best quality available using the Steam\
      \ 360 video player. Streaming quality will vary depending on download speeds\
      \ and there's no option to download. The runtime is listed as 4 minutes, but\
      \ it's less than that at 3:30. \n\nI only recommend this for 360 video enthusiasts.\
      \ The 3D doesn't pop like in true VR, probably because of parallax. \n\nRate\
      \ 6/10. Since you can get this free elsewhere, why can't we download it for\
      \ the $2 we're spending on it to show our appreciation to QubaVr? I obviously\
      \ don't mind paying, but at least give us options to truly appreciate your art\
      \ project.\n\n"
