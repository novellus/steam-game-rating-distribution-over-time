    about_the_game: Red Storm, the third Soviet-themed DLC for Order of Battle, covers
      the battles of the Red Army between 1943 and 1945.<br><br>The campaign begins
      with the fierce tank battle near Prokhorovka during Operation Citadel, the last
      grand German summer offensive on the Eastern Front in mid-1943. Following the
      failure of Citadel the Red Army will almost always be on the offensive.<br><br>Like
      in the previous Soviet DLCs, Red Star and Red Steel, Red Storm includes both
      famous and crucial battles as well as operations that are less known or limited
      in scope, but still provide unique challenges. So while the Eastern Front is
      known mostly for large land battles, a few operations with amphibious and naval
      elements, like the Kerch-Eltigen landings and the liberation of Crimea, were
      added.<br><br>An optional scenario roughly in the middle of the campaign depicts
      key aspects of partisan warfare in Byelorussia. Most core units cannot be used
      here, and the scenario can be skipped entirely if the player prefers more conventional
      battles. But winning it offers additional benefits in Operation Bagration, the
      huge offensive against Army Group Center in the same region a few months later.<br><br>The
      ultimate goal of this campaign is of course the defeat of the Third Reich in
      the Battle of Berlin. But Red Storm does not stop there - players can opt for
      another battle after the fall of Berlin and take their core army to the Far
      East to defeat Japanese forces in the last major Soviet offensive of World War
      2 in Manchuria.<h2 class="bb_tag">SCENARIOS</h2><br>1. Prokhorovka, a massive
      clash of tanks at the height of the Battle of Kursk<br>2. Operation Rumyantsev,
      the Soviet offensive to retake Belgorod and Kharkov following the cancellation
      of Citadel<br>3. Kerch-Eltigen Landings, an amphibious operation to establish
      beachheads again on the east coast of Crimea<br>4. Zhitomir-Fastov, fend off
      a series of heavy German counterattacks west of Kiev in late 1943<br>5. Korsun
      Pocket, Soviet forces encircle two German army corps west of the Dnieper, while
      the Wehrmacht launches several relief attacks<br>6. Crimea, the Red Army concludes
      the liberation of the peninsula as remaining German and Romanian forces hope
      to be evacuated across the Black Sea<br>7. Hide and Seek, a unique and optional
      scenario about partisan warfare in spring 1944<br>8. Karelia, depicts the big
      Red Army offensive against Finland in June 1944<br>9. Operation Bagration, huge
      Soviet offensive to destroy Army Group Center in Byelorussia in summer 1944<br>10.
      Baltic Offensive, the scenario focusses mostly on the Soviet drive towards Tallinn
      and Riga<br>11. Debrecen, after Romania and Bulgaria leave the Axis the Red
      Army advances into Hungary in October 1944<br>12. Vistula-Oder Operation, the
      large offensive in January 1945 through Poland to finally reach Germany<br>13.
      Seelow Heights, the Red Army has to defeat the last defensive stronghold before
      Berlin<br>14. Berlin, the battle for the German capital to end World War 2 in
      Europe<br>15. Manchuria, the last Soviet offensive in August 1945 to defeat
      the Kwantung Army<h2 class="bb_tag">ADDITIONS</h2><br>Red Storm adds more Soviet
      commanders and specialisations, but also a number of new and improved units
      for both the Soviet Union and its Axis opponents:<br><br>Players can buy light
      Ba-64 armored cars, devastating BM-31 Katyusha rocket launchers or hard-hitting
      100mm anti-tank guns additionally to a large variety of Soviet equipment already
      available. They can also field new fighter models like the agile Yak-3, the
      heavily armed Yak-9T and the more advanced Yak-9U, and get access to improved
      medium Tu-2 and heavy Yer-2 bombers.<br><br>On the other side the Germans do
      now deploy their deadly 8,8cm Pak 43, the nimble Pzkw II Luchs and new He-162
      jetfighters in 1945, while their Hungarian allies field Turan tanks, Zrinyi
      SP guns and use Bf-109 and Me-210 aircraft.<br><br>Finally Red Storm adds more
      camouflage patterns which players can use to skin their units if they wish.

    review: "I've played hundreds of hours of Order of battle but get bit frustrated\
      \ with the scenario design sometimes.\nJust got to the Operation Bagration scenario\
      \ which I was really looking forward to and once again the Germans pop up with\
      \ loads of full strength  high quality experienced units outnumbering me having\
      \ been told at the start that there were only weak German units! Bagration was\
      \ an overwhelming Soviet assault with massive superiority  in all areas, this\
      \ is not reflected in the scenario. I want a challenge but it wants to be historically\
      \ somewhat accurate surely. Either make it a time based challenge or give a\
      \ lot more non core units or resource points to Soviets.  \nStill a great game\
      \ ."
