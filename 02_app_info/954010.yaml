      /><br><br>Definitely Sneaky But Not Sneaky is a top-down action game with stealth
      and arcade elements. Small yet difficult levels combined with the ability to
      instantly retry a level creates a fast-paced experience.  In the end, it is
      your choice to be sneaky.. or not!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/954010/extras/about_gif2_small.gif?t=1607383564"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Action-Stealth gameplay</h2><br>Most levels allow you to
      approach them in different ways. You can either sneak into each situation and
      slowly take out your opponents, or you can run in and try to beat the level
      as quickly as possible. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/954010/extras/about_gif3_small.gif?t=1607383564"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">New survival mode</h2><br>Needed something else to do after
      playing the Classic mode? Try out the new survival game mode! Endure never-ending
      waves of enemies, purchase upgrades with kills, and explore the larger maps
      made just for the mode!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/954010/extras/about_gif1_small.gif?t=1607383564"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Controller support</h2><br>With both keyboard/mouse and
      controller support, you can play the game whichever way is more comfortable.
      May it be keyboard and mouse, a PS4 controller, or an XBOX controller, all you
      have to do it plug-and-play (..and go into the options menu)! However, it is
      <strong>important</strong> to note that the game will play better with a controller.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Local multiplayer</h2><br>4-person local multiplayer is also
      supported with the ability for mixing different control types (one player on
      a keyboard, another on a PS4 controller, and a third on an XBox controller,
      etc.) in order to get as many people playing as possible. Use Steam's new <i>Remote
      Play</i> feature to play with other Steam users with just one copy of the game!
      Play the entirety of the game with some friends or play solo, it's up to you!
