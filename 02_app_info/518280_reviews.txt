Do you ask why? Let's take a look, shall we?\nGame itself has promising potential, interesting setting and definitely unique artstyle. It's not an usual novel, it's more like interactive comix, which is fresh wind in this genre. There are likeable characters and few plot twist, though they were easily predictable (watched too much anime, it's hard to be surprised if you're able to predict, how it goes beforehand). That ain't an issue though.\nWhere the game sucks badger's ass, is story. For the love of God, can it be more obvious propaganda? There are four chapters, where first one seems allright, but you'll get strange feeling that something isn't right. And bam! 4th chapter is taken straight from the depth of tumblr abyss. Why devs, WHY???? Why did you killed your own kid (aborted, dare I say) with such obvious political propaganda? Sorry, but I can't give thumb up. And yes, I stand by what I wrote, even though I know I'll feel the banhammer. Never more!\n\nP.S. - bathing scene was completely pointless, you can't even do correct fanservice. If it wasn't there, game would not be worse.","timestamp_created":1572985792,"timestamp_updated":1572985792,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.331217944622039795","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4MzQnu4Cd5Ht1wE="}
