I'm just surprised it has any positive reviews. I was only able to play about 30 minutes before the game hard crashed (had to restart Windows). I took that as a sign that I should quit and uninstall this garbage. I don't even want to do a video review for this mess of a game.\n\nFirst of all, it ran poorly on my 1060 GTX. Controls (gamepad) felt sluggish to respond (motion controllers are only used at the hub menu to select items). The rollergirls start out very slow from the gate. You feel like you're skating on molasses. The visuals are dated with poor lighting and textures.\n\nThe camera views are very poor. There's these parts where you ride vehicles. You're in third person view in VR while riding these vehicles and your AI friends obstruct your view. It's a simple game of Frogger during these portions of the game. Collect cows (save them from aliens) and avoid getting hit. \n\nThe side scrolling is almost as bad. You have  a small field of view. You basically switch in and out of the different roller girls to take down enemies. Freeze it, switch and throw a missile at the alien enemies. There's some powerups that increase your speed and some upgrades that make your weapon stronger. Unfortunately, the game runs poorly, the controls aren't responsive enough, and the environments and level design are dull and uninspired.\n\nThis honestly feels like the quality of a 2013-15 free to play mobile game. It's running on the Unity Engine. It looks & plays ugly. Scantily-clad women on roller skates cannot save it.\n\n[b]Rate 3/10. Unfortunately, I bought this back in a 2017 Steam sale for $4 USD and I didn't play it until now. Too late for a refund, but don't make the same mistake I did. Do NOT buy this game. You've been warned![/b]\n\n[quote]If you enjoyed reading my review. please consider joining my Steam Curator Group here: https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Oculus_WMR [/quote]","timestamp_created":1602439281,"timestamp_updated":1602439457,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570982813835144043","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1602506170,"developer_response":"Thanks FastLawyer for your review. Firstly, we really enjoy your reviews and the dedication you show to reviewing so many VR games. It doesn't go unnoticed that you have a deep understanding and involvement in the VR community.  Appreciate your views on this game. Yes as you mentioned it probably does seem dated by todays standards since it was released in 2016 in very early days of VR.. (since it took 2 years to create from 2014 onward by one person). I would take that as a given. This was before motion controllers were even on the radar, systems for working with VR were changing daily and all manor of issues actually completing a game. Having said that, not making excuses as we would love to update this game in the future and plan to do so however it is not the main focus currently. All fine with your opinions on everything as that is your prerogative, it's pretty harsh based on 0.5 hours of a 8 hour game, but understandable also since you didn't like it. All good. The only thing not comfortable with is telling others to not buy it at all. Seems like a low blow. As a VR only game company you can imagine we make no money at all and work for free always. So the $4 dollars you mention would have gone to paying a random license fee for unity for something else. So many VR developers are and have dropped out of perusing this awesome creative tech simply because they can't maintain even paying rent. So with that comment you help to contribute to that long list. I tip my hat to your sir. Please contact us at info@stonepunkstudios.com and I will personally refund your $4 and you keep to game. Because we are not in this to make money, just to explore the creative medium of VR. You didn't like this particular exploration and it's great you tell others also, I would not ever want anyone to be unhappy with a purchase."}],"cursor":"AoJ4jrW1jPUCfqOlpwI="}
