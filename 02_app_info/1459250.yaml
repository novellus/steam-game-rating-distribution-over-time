      /><br><strong>Temple Hunters</strong> is an adventurous treasure hunting game
      where 2 teams compete against each other claiming the most treasures for their
      nation! You play as either the United States of America or the Germans in the
      mid-1930s. You'll raid tombs, encounter traps, fight players on your quest of
      finding all the lost treasure and artefacts.<h2 class="bb_tag">The setting</h2><img

      /><br>The game is set in the mid-1930s. You are an archaeologist on the hunt
      for artefacts to prevent enemy nations from capturing them and using them for
      propaganda or other more destructive measures. Your goal is to travel across
      the world in search of these ancient and powerful artefacts. Visit the dry Deserts
      of Africa or the Dense Jungles of South America and many more locations!<h2
