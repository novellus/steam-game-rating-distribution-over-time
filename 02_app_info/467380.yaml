    review: "Khimera: Destroy All Monster Girls is an absolutely amazing and adorable\
      \ adventure, platformer game that takes the best ideas from other great games,\
      \ why\u2019ll still being its own thing. Let\u2019s get into the story.\n\n\
      Morgana Island a peaceful place were monsters can live without fear. \nThat\
      \ is until the famous and fearsome pirates known as the sea spiders come to\
      \ plunder the Island, and no one can stop them. \n\nUntil Chelshia the chimera\
      \ the world\u2019s first synthetic monster is made to kick their butts and take\
      \ back their ill gotten treasure.\n\nSo with that all said, on to the likes.\
      \ To start the game\u2019s story is good and made even better with a colorful\
      \ cast of characters bringing it to life.\n\nAnd now characters, they are really\
      \ good, cute with funny and cute dialog, even the NPC\u2019s dialog is good,\
      \ it reminds me of games like undertale.\n\nThe platforming is fun and vary\
      \ well made and did not feel unfair at all, same with combat. The combat was\
      \ fun with all kinds of fun powers to get.\n\nThe pixel art/graphics style is\
      \ very good with little touches throughout the game. The enemies were good looking\
      \ and nice to fight, especially the bosses.\n\nAll so game is absolutely adorable,\
      \ from the dialog, to the humor, to the looks of the characters, even the story\
      \ is cute.\nOkay let\u2019s get into the dislikes and there is nothing to dislike\
      \ it about this game, it\u2019s absolutely perfect.\n\nAll right then with that\
      \ said Khimera: Destroy All Monster Girls is an absolutely amazing and adorable\
      \ adventure, platformer game.\n\nWith a good story, really good, cute and funny\
      \ characters and dialog and fun platforming that does not feel unfair, and so\
      \ \nmuch more.\n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for a fun, cute adventure, platformer\
      \ game. I highly, highly, highly recommend this game.\n"
