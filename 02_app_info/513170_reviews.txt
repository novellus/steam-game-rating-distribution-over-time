I found the spear throwing mechanism quite unrealable and unnatural feeling. Additionally aiming with the long bow feels poorly done compaired to the other bow shooting titles. The graphics and animations don't seem up to scratch with the other titles available in the same price category. Given the price of only a few dollars there is no harm in purchasing this, but there are other games you could spend it on.","timestamp_created":1482855851,"timestamp_updated":1482855851,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v5TGoNkCfZ7GbQ=="}
