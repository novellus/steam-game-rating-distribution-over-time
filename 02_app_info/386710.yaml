    about_the_game: Join our human adventurer on an adventure! Is this adventurer
      even a hero? Is he even actually an adventurer? Who cares? Not the Crafting
      Goddess Joann, apparently! All she wants is a slave to make crap for her, and
      that slave appears to be this poor soul. I guess now that he's been chosen by
      a trans-dimensional entity to do some kind of bidding he doesn't really have
      a choice of sorts. <br><br>At least there's some fun to be had as he traverses
      the dungeons generated from your old high-school reports and questionable images.
      <br><br>Wait a second, did I just say old high-school reports?! They have value
      now? <br>You sure bet! <br><br>You'll have to delve deep into your hard drive's
      dungeons to create the list of items the goddess has bestowed upon you to create.
      All the dungeons are randomly generated from the files that you select on your
      hard drive, with bigger files creating bigger dungeons, and different file types
      designating different kinds of loot you can find. Items, craftables, and monsters
      all have generated names with randomly selected adjectives attached. Even the
      requirements to make the crafted items are random! <br> Use every menu and tool
      at your disposal to collect items and serve the goddess<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Randomly generated dungeons based on your files <br></li><li>Randomly

      no hold hands kind of game made by a fan of old roguelikes for other fans.  Things
      are explained within dialog, tooltips, and in-game manuals.  It is expected
      that players will at some point in time need to read the manuals to understand
      more complex mechanics so they may unlock new parts of the game.  Still, it
      is an easily accessible and expansive experience, but it may not be the most
      welcoming to players new to the rogue genre.  Within minutes you can already
      be collecting tons of loot, exploring your hard drive, and of course dying.  The
      game features practically no story, but many ways to play, and its crafting
      experience is no more than a glorified fetch quest.  There's plenty to sink
      time into, and its accessibility emphasizes an ability to play quickly, such
      as during a coffee break.

    review: 'Ok so I love the game but I do have a few suggestions. 1: please tone
      down the enemies, yes i get it its randomly generated but it gets kinda annoying
      when out of nowhere a monster comes out that  kills you in to hit or a monster
      comes out that you can''t damage.

      2: please put a how to at the beginning cause it took me so long just to figure
      out how to attack and I still have no clue how to level up. (Also someone please
      comment how to level up)'
