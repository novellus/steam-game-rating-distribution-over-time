    review: "What an interesting game. On its surface, it is a walking simulator played\
      \ from the first person perspective of a priest who is seeking redemption. It\
      \ has find and use inventory, collectibles, and a number of mechanical puzzles.\
      \ Inventory is automatically picked up and used, as needed, so the interface\
      \ is very streamlined. There is an auto-save feature as well as an explicit\
      \ save with multiple slots. \n\nWhat is most striking about Gray Dawn is the\
      \ music and art depicting the Eastern Orthodox church and practices. The game\
      \ takes place in the early 1900's in Russia or Eastern Europe. The religious\
      \ artwork, architecture, and icons are done in incredible detail. The various\
      \ prayers, exorcism, funeral, and mystic rituals are portrayed with supporting\
      \ scriptures and prayers. Even the cemetery has been crafted in enough detail\
      \ to make you want to spend time strolling and looking at the different graves.\n\
      \nThe game has \"real life' scenes and dream-like vision sequences that are\
      \ surreal and (often) disturbing. I found the entire game a bit edgy as our\
      \ priest struggles with guilt versus forgiveness, salvation versus damnation,\
      \ and the forces of God versus the forces of evil. The voice acting is especially\
      \ well done, although I found the 'evil' voices somewhat distressing.\n\nI would\
      \ recommend this game to those who enjoy exploration and an unfolding story\
      \ with art and music that is thought provoking and engaging."
