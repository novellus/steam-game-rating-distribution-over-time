    review: "I heard good words about this game, so I tried. The story itself is OK-ish\
      \ but at the end of the day, I can't recommend this.\nIt claims to have a lot\
      \ of branches and \"EVERY CHOICE MATTERS\", yeah, these words are used a lot\
      \ these days. But no, I totally disagree.\nIf you want absolutely no spoilers,\
      \ you can stop reading here. That's all I wanted to say. \nBelow I'll try my\
      \ best to be spoiler-free, if you think a little glimpse to the plot is OK,\
      \ then keep reading, I'll explain more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatever you do,\
      \ whichever choice you make, the plot doesn't diverge from its rail. Maybe a\
      \ few lines of dialogs change after your choice, then it goes back immediately\
      \ forgetting what happened. If a certain character may die, he/she always dies.\
      \ If someone will leave, he/she leaves anyways, even you tried to keep that\
      \ person along for a while, there's no dialog for that poor dude, he/she will\
      \ be invisible for the whole journey.\n\nThis game is trying to make a twist,\
      \ but in a poor way. The first half of the game, as a player you'll be making\
      \ choices for everyone, which is quite weird for a \"Choose your own path\"\
      \ game. (which I thought it was when played for the first time) The game does\
      \ explain why later but it's too late. I could not get involved because of this\
      \ constantly hopping from one character to another, without explaining their\
      \ background and motivations. I don't know what to choose, I don't know why\
      \ it's me to choose. It was confusing until the later half, when I totally lost\
      \ my interest.\n\nThe real branch happens near the end of the story, and I don't\
      \ really want to call it a branch. It's just who you choose to [spoiler]romance[/spoiler]\
      \ with. Other things remain mostly the same. And this is actually the part I\
      \ dislike because it was not advertised as a [spoiler]romance[/spoiler] story\
      \ in the first place. The trial, the seers, what are they? It doesn't matter\
      \ in the end, and almost nothing about them is explained. They remain as a mystery\
      \ from beginning to end.\n\nReplayability? As I said the difference is tiny\
      \ between different paths. And there's nothing like a grand finale after getting\
      \ all of them. So unless you're a completionist I don't recommend relaying the\
      \ game again and again. Not to mention the game lacks some quality of life features\
      \ regarding multiple playthroughs, like mark up and only skip the part you've\
      \ read, or even a fast skip speed. (It took me ~20 mins to skip through, normal\
      \ play may only take 2~3 hours)\n"
