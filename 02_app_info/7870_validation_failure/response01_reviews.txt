This game is one of my favourite games ever. Its prequels were simplistic and its sequels added more complexity, but not necessarily more fun. I think I must have put over 100 hours into this game (prior to owning it on Steam). Certainly if you're new to the Anno/A.D. series of games, this game is a great gateway to the franchise.","timestamp_created":1292729910,"timestamp_updated":1586941527,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vcDFvvECdY6nAQ=="}
