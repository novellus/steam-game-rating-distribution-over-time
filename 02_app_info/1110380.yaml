    review: 'Picked this up as a fan of classic Ultimas.

      Not quite as long as I expected, but still a lot of fun, and a good few laughs.

      Well worth playing through a few times just to see the endings - they change
      based on who you kill, marry, etc and is worth experimenting with.


      Can recommend!'
