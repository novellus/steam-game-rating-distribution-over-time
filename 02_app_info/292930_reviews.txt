You walk slow, everyone talks slow, and a lot of the game advancement involves doing one thing, then walking all the way back (slowly) across the map to do one single thing, then walking all the way back to where you were. \n\nI'm just over halfway through, and I doubt I will finish the game. Just don't have the patience for it.","timestamp_created":1609896505,"timestamp_updated":1609896505,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46uXT6vYCdfPvwAI="}
