This experience had an opportunity to be one of the best. However, with the control of just a gamepad, exploring the museum was frustrating because the controls never lined up, making it seem like I was dancing in circles among the displays. Speaking of displays, not all were labeled with a description - and most of the ones that had a label were only legible if you were right on top of it. Also, some of the sculptures were poorly modeled, making them a comic relief rather than a relief with accurate detail. The developer needs to program controllers into navigating the museum, and make labels easier to read. Waste of time. Waste of money.","timestamp_created":1601511971,"timestamp_updated":1601512293,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qMjk8PQCf6eOpQI="}
