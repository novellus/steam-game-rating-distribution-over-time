Even with a guide it's still a long and grindy game.  Like how many people are gonna grind in the second to lost location to get over 10k.  Probably only someone that has played the game.  There is so much I love about this game but the flaws make it not worth the journey.  The things I love about the game are choice of characters, Love Interest, and you are always in control of what your character does.  I guess the game could be fun by just winging it but like I said when I tried to wing it I got stuck.","timestamp_created":1608502088,"timestamp_updated":1608502088,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlMKMwfYCfeTnuwI="}
