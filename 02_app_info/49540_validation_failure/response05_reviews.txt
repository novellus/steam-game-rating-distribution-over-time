It was five bucks and feels like an aliens game.\" and then the combat started and the aliens just sort of stood up and walked at you like zombies. Ok, well it still might be alright. Then in what I assume was supposed to be an epic cinematic moment where an alien bursts from a guy's chest in a space umbilicus spanning ship to ship, he just pulls out a grenade and detonates it, while an alien already burst from his chest. It took about 2 seconds from running to explosion.\n\nAlright well maybe I'll try this tomorrow. I quit, and the game keeps trying to start itself over and over and over. I had to try and uninstall in between it's automatic attempts to start the game.\n\nAt a certain point a game just isn't worth your time no matter how cheap, and this is one of those games.","timestamp_created":1610254796,"timestamp_updated":1610254796,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzsiq9fYCcav+wQI="}
