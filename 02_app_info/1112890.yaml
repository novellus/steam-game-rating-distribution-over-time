    review: "I would wish that I could recommend this game, in its current state,\
      \ without reservations. Unfortunately I cannot. I can however say the following;\n\
      \nI recommend this game IF;\n\n- You understand and accept that it is incredibly\
      \ buggy. It is filled to the brim with amazing ideas, though unfortunately they\
      \ often stumble at the finish line. An example is disappearing animals, ridiculous\
      \ amounts of clipping and the fact that changing the colour of your clothes\
      \ often doesn't work at all.\n- You do not expect complexity in your story.\
      \ \n- Are okay with a preciously short game. \n- Are not fuzzy about buggy quests.\
      \ \n- Do not mind exceedingly simple graphics. \n- Buggy buggy buggy controls.\
      \ \n- Regular bouts of frustration. \n- Very shallow mechanics. \n- Do not mind\
      \ a game that plays like it should be in early access and no more. \n\nThat\
      \ being said, what you get in return is;\n- Buckets of charm. \n- A game built\
      \ on a concept rarely seen. This is the place to live out your magic girl in\
      \ a marshmallow world dreams!\n- Creative clothes and furniture, when they work.\
      \ The aesthetic is precious. \n- The ability to play with magic and animals!\
      \ (More magic, perhaps the ability to pursue witchdom, would have been amazing).\n\
      - Adorable NPCs. \n- Round soft girls, which is a rare sight in games. \n- Marshmallow\
      \ graphics that grows on you with time. \n- A game that can run comfortably\
      \ on even the most basic of laptops. \n- A game that is an early access title\
      \ in all but name and price. \n\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nI can't quite tell if I love\
      \ this game, or if I love what it could/can be. I've never come across another\
      \ title that allows for round, sugary sweet magic girls in a marshmallow world\
      \ and it's a nice escape. Unfortunately, whenever I start to get into the game,\
      \ one but or another ruins the immersion. The promise of a sweet world that\
      \ you can lose yourself in is there, but that's all it is at this point; a promise.\
      \ It's too buggy, too simple, too unrefined and too small to be a proper game.\n\
      \nIf the game had been listed as an early access game, with a road map clearly\
      \ listed on the store page, this review would have read very differently. Unfortunately,\
      \ at the time of writing, that is not the case.\n\nI do not believe that the\
      \ current state of the game warrants a price of \u20AC9. I want to see more\
      \ games with this concept and aesthetic, but if you're looking for a game more\
      \ than an 'experience', this is not the right place.\n\nEdit 07/01/21: I would\
      \ like to note that the recent patch added several minor quality of life updates.\
      \ While it is not enough to alter anything said in my review above, I am optimistic\
      \ that if the developers keep working on the game and listening to the players,\
      \ this game will become worth what it is priced at. "
