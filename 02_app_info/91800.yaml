    review: While yes, this is a very short game, it is, in my opinion, a very tough
      puzzle and platformer game, but very rewarding and fun that keeps you going
      throughout the game. Brings lots of nostalgia, its beautiful. If you love puzzle
      games, and don't mind graphics, I HIGHLY recommend this game. Very pog. - Strix
