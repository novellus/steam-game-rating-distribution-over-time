      /><br><br>In the year 1139, the Second Council of the Lateran convened by Pope
      Innocent II has pronounced anathema on the use of crossbow. The council saw
      its unstoppable power as ungodly, demonic by nature. They were not entirely
      wrong.<br><br>The Coven of Crossbow, an ancient order of hunters sworn to guard
      the balance between the forces of heaven and hell prevailed against all odds.
      In the year 1666, as fire and plague ravage London, the Coven is facing its
      greatest challenge yet. The Ancient Horror from Beyond makes its way towards
      our reality. In its wake, legions of nightmare creatures spawn in the darkness.
      The Bloodnight is upon us, let the hunt begin! <br><br>Features:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Arcane

      to recharge and is best used in strategic moments<br></li><li>Instant respawn
      button and fast respawn after death, so you can stay immersed in the game<br></li><li>Six
