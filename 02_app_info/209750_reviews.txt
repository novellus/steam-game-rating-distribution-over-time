It's no exaggeration to say there's ample time to make a cup of tea, boil an egg and make toast in the time it takes to load. I've done it!  I considered giving it a thumbs down for that reason.  But the truth is there are faster and newer games that are so much less fun than Cannon Fodder 3 and I could spend hours on an inferior modern game, be far less entertained and have no time between levels in which to chuck the hoover round or feed the cat or whatever.\n\nOther reviewers have compared it to the original Cannon Fodder and I can see why they were generally disappointed but this is essentially the same game with some modifications. There are a whole load of new weapons, gimmicks and vehicles that, on the whole, look good and are fun to try but hardly help you complete the missions at all. But I don't mind that.\n\nThere's something strange about the way the game scrolls which is reminiscent of trying focus on the landscape whizzing past you while you're facing forward on a fast moving train which is distracting and irritating and takes some getting used to. \n\nIt's not hard to play and not hard progress through the levels but I don't play this game for a challenge. I play it to veg out.  So, I would recommend this game for those times when you just need a distraction and you don't want something that's going to take up too much brainpower.","timestamp_created":1608170398,"timestamp_updated":1608170580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgvWbt/YCc53rugI="}
