    short_description: Stoorm is a skill arcade game. Although the reflex is your
      main asset to overcome all levels, you will sometimes need to take back your
      breath, and a minimal analyze of the map, to escape without dying too often.
      The purpose of the game is to move your cube through the rooms to finally leave
      the complex or... you 'll see.
