    review: The man who made this game is the kinda guy who would stick his fingers
      in your spaghetti instead of using a fork, and you have to sit there awkwardly
      thinking to yourself "did that just happen?" you try to move on with conversation
      but you really cant get past it, just like some of the levels in this game.
      This is a difficult yet fun game, in the same vein as Super Meat Boy.  If its
      too hard for you there is an easy mode so you could still enjoy it as a casual
      platformer.
