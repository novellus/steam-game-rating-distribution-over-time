It was a blind buy and one I'm not even sure is working entirely as intended. For that reason I will not recommend this for now. The two new characters are nice but lack some of the base customization others get. You can still add extra items to them, but not change the base clothes or colors as you can with others.\n\nWith more information I would recommend it, especially if the screenshots were relevant.","timestamp_created":1440443379,"timestamp_updated":1440443492,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.714657068252563477","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6uzHsM8Cc9bBQw=="}
