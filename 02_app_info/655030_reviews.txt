Works best with friends.\n\nUsed to play this game in college with my roomies. We had a lot of fun. It becomes especially nerve-racking if you increase the speed setting.\n\nI was really happy to find this gem on steam. Very unexpected. I had lost my copy of it for about 15 years. There have been many light cycle variants, but this is the version (though slightly updated) that I played and loved most.","timestamp_created":1608778190,"timestamp_updated":1608778190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwy+GpyfYCdtjTvAI="}
