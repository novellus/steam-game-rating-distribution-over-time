    review: 'Seriously, where the heck do the devs find so many good, fun and catchy
      songs to stuff into packs?


      These songs are all from The End Records, and more on the pop side of things.
      They''re a positively delightful affair, and despite not being much into electronic
      dance pop (as I''ve said elsewhere), these are ridiculously catchy and grew
      on me after a few listens. They aren''t overly challenging on Hard, just a few
      slightly more intricate sections here and there - so the difficulty is right
      on the level of the [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/558290/The_Metronomicon__JPunch_Challenge_Pack/]J-Punch
      Challenge Pack[/url].


      It also looks like there''s a trend emerging, in terms of equipment. The equipment
      from the J-Punch pack which you can get from completing the challenges is pretty
      wacky and useful; this is no different, though in the case of one particular
      item, it requires a real in-depth understanding about the list of abilities
      at your disposal. The challenges, much like the rest of the game, are just as
      wacky, and themed accordingly to the equipment you can unlock.


      Also seriously, the Jutty Ranx songs are dope.


      [h1]When to buy[/h1]

      As with all the challenge packs, this is a no-brainer.
