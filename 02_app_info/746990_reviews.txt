I bought it on release day way back in 2017 and while it had a single update or two, that was it. Developer kept saying things will change, new updates are on the way, but they never came. I had written a review prior, but later deleted it as I saw some hope of said 'new updates are coming', yet they never did and I forgot about it. \n\nIf you're still developing this game dev, I can't wait to see the update, by now I expect the next update to be a full release as you had like what, 2 and a half years to work with ^_^\n\nEdit: This piece of text probably ruined this game's development 'SO, MAKING THINGS SHORT, every two months I'm gonna donate 30% of the game's revenue to charity for cancer research, you can also vote and choose for another charity where I can donate'..\n\nDon't say things you can't promise.","timestamp_created":1511450069,"timestamp_updated":1609710491,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515418469905853271","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ415qO5fYCcvXCjQE="}
