    review: 'This game was a minor guilty pleasure for me in some ways. I enjoyed
      aspects of it, even though it''s kinda dumb and lacks any real attempt at creating
      lore to explain the need for drones to mine the crystals (or whatever), and
      everything else. It''s a quick and easy game to understand and complete.


      Pros:

      + The aliens are neato, even if their design is what you''d expect.

      + Watching the slaughter can be enjoyable.


      Cons:

      - A lot of stuff doesn''t make sense (making it feel more like a Flash game,
      not a full PC game title).

      - It becomes super repetitive quickly as you get the higher troop/weapon types.


      It might be worth to grab on sale (currently $1.49 for the Christmas Steam Sale)
      if you enjoy alien slaughtering. But it''s probably not worth it at full price.
      It''s just not dynamic enough. But the premise could lead to something a lot
      more fun.
