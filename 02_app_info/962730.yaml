    review: "Good game isn't worth \xA330.99 but it is a good skate game I was disappointed\
      \ that you can't join friends and do spot battle battles and challenges with\
      \ them. I miss the skate 3 memories because this is skate 4 but the positives\
      \ is that the game has very good graphics it's easy to run and a good game to\
      \ play when your board would like to see some more maps and MULTIPLAYER but\
      \ other than that it is great to play they challenges and I mean a lot of challenges\
      \ and I'm happy they added a super ultra mega park like it's called the big\
      \ ramp and it's a sick park to skate on they should release more updates on\
      \ this game and definitely add MULTIPLAYER PLEASE !!!!!!!!"
