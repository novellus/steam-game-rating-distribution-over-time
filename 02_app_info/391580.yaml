      \ to pass through the underworld realm of Osiris, challenging an invisible adversary\
      \ inside an Egyptian hidden tomb in The Valley of the Queens located near the\
      \ better known Valley of the Kings, on the west bank of the Nile river across\
      \ from Thebes (Luxor).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSenet is a board game from predynastic\
      \ and ancient Egypt, it is the earliest known record of a backgammon , checkers,\
      \ draughts, ludo and chess like games.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe oldest hieroglyph\
      \ representing a Senet game dates to around 3500 BC.The full name of the game\

      \nGames have been around for thousands of years, but none are older than the\
      \ ancient game of Senet, invented by the Egyptians roughly 3500 or 5000 years\
      \ ago. It is believed that this two-player board game originated as a popular\
      \ form of recreation with both royalty and peasantry. But by the mid-13th century\
      \ BC, Senet had evolved into a more religious ritual. Some depictions from this\
      \ time period forward show the game being played not by two people, but rather\
      \ as a deceased player competing against an invisible adversary, interpreted\
      \ by some to symbolize the deceased players own soul.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe\
      \ board has become a metaphor for the afterlife with pawns moving across the\
      \ board just as a soul moves through layers of the netherworld after death.\
      \ Reaching the final space and leaving the board is the goal of the game, just\
      \ as reaching Horus and leaving the netherworld was the goal for the Egyptians\
      \ after their death for attaining rebirth with the gods Isis &amp; Osiris, Sekhmet\
      \ &amp; Bastet holding the Egyptian Ankh or the papyrus scepter.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nThe game board consists of 30 squares or slots, arranged in 3 horizontal\
      \ rows of 10. Pawns move from left to right through row 1, then drop down and\
      \ move from right to left through row 2. Dropping down again, pawns move from\
      \ left to right along row 3 and finally, off the board. The game uses the rules\
      \ developed by Timothy Kendall in his 1978 work, Passing Through the Netherworld\
      \ :The Meaning and Play of Senet, an Ancient Egyptian Funerary Game.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nThe game includes five special squares, governed by their own rules,\
      \ each containing a hieroglyphic. Square 15 is the House of Rebirth; square\
      \ 26 is the House of Beauty; square 27 is the House of Water: square 28 is the\
      \ House of the Three Truths; square 29 is the House of Two Truths; and square\
      \ 30, the last, is the House of Horus, the Egyptian falcon-god and lord of the\
      \ sky.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEgyptian Senet is a pharaonic challenging game that\
      \ combines luck,strategy,and magic features authentic photos of ancient Egyptian\
      \ temples,plus artistically crafted graphics and animation of an ancient stone\
      \ game board and pieces,set in an echoing,tomb-like chamber.Ritualistic music\
      \ plus sound effects of stone pieces moving recreate the atmosphere of predynastic\
      \ Egypt.The App's Icon shows the Egyptian Queen Nefertari playing Senet in her\
