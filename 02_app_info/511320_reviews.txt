But I just couldn't get into it. The world the story takes place in isn't explained which just confused me. Especially with fantasy fiction you have to establish the world it takes place in so the player knows the setting. I wanted to like this game but I didn't.","timestamp_created":1547397626,"timestamp_updated":1607728402,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538461565971374512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5ZGFqvYCddKkuAE="}
