    about_the_game: "Mr. Pumpkin 2: Kowloon Walled City is a sequel to the Mr. Pumpkin\
      \ franchise. Our protagonist, an insignificant guy with a pumpkin head, will\
      \ explore the Kowloon Walled City of Hong Kong, and witness the stories happening\
      \ within these walls. The plot is set in the historical sites of Hong Kong,\
      \ and is a tribute to the golden age of Hong Kong films.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      Kowloon Walled City was a settlement in Hong Kong under British rule. It was\
      \ both a hell and a utopia, formed by intertwined streets, aged buildings, dazzling\
      \ neon lights and dark narrow alleys. In the game, you will travel through the\
      \ Walled City by Hong Kong's traditional transport such as cable car, double-decker\
      \ bus and tramway, from episode to episode, experiencing a Hong Kong version\
      \ of the famous painting Along the River During the Qingming Festival.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nKowloon is literally associated with the Chinese dragon, which will\
      \ be a key motif of the game. To progress, you need to solve the puzzles and\
      \ mysteries you encounter, break the code of the Dragon Gate, and help Mr. Pumpkin\
      \ find a way out of the chaotic Walled City. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, you\
      \ will come to realize that it is not only chaos that lies in the heart of the\
      \ city. The people living within the shadowy walls have always been longing\
      \ for the light from outside. They have been striving to survive, chasing their\
      \ dreams and love.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMay the spirit of Hong Kong shine upon\
      \ your journey in the Walled City."
