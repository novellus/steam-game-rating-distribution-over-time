Although eating your enemies is kind of unique, it just didn't appeal to me. It just felt weird, carefully shooting enemies 'just enough' to stun them, then eating them. In practise it just kills your 'momentum' and therefore harms the flow of your game experience.\n\nControls can be a bit awkward, you can choose from two different layouts, but you can't rebind them yourself. Tutorial didn't explain 'dashing straight up', so I almost gave up when I thought I was stuck.","timestamp_created":1606902914,"timestamp_updated":1606903457,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.617719471454620361","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zpy6kfYCfKbctgI="}
