      \ one of the big nuclear players \u2013 from known superpowers like the USA\
      \ to an upstart hellraiser like North Korea \u2013 and plan your strategy wisely:\
      \ Expand to other countries, build bombs or debuild in order to restructure\
      \ your arsenal. Or use research to gain access to new nuclear technology, better\
