But after a good 4 hours or so I just couldn't stand it anymore. \n[list]\n[*] The premise of the game is that you are an amusement park tour guide who takes customers on adventures to make them feel like heroes. While this is cute, the game still just plays like an ordinary idle-RPG. The only difference is that the game constantly bombards you with heavy-handed \"jokes\" about how everything is actually fake. \n[*] As a guide, you 'collect' customers with their own unique personalities that you can level up and become friends with. The main reason that I came to despise the game is because there is *so* much dialogue. The characters are cringey and over-the-top and they constantly have annoying *unskippable* skits which ruins the flow of play. \n[*] Your adventurers fight the enemies by themselves while you standby to provide support, e.g. use healing items, change tactic. For the most part your team do just fine by themselves and will even keep themselves healed up. I pretty much just kept the game on max-speed and stopped to throw out a healing potion or two to stop someone dying. Playing slowly is not engaging enough but you can't just let the game autoplay or people will die.\n[*] The art style is adorable and there are tonnes of collectables and furniture that you can collect to decorate your room.\n[/list]\n\nI would have happily kept Heroland playing in the background to collect all the cute plushies and furniture, but the constant unskippable dialogue drove me mad. There's also not enough to do during combat to be fun but it still needs you to press a button every now and then to stop people dying so you still have to pay attention. Worst of both worlds.","timestamp_created":1607954506,"timestamp_updated":1609187105,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483182936906814575","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jtPB1fYCdo+RugI="}
