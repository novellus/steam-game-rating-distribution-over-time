But it's wildly inaccurate and was clearly made by someone with a negative outlook on life. There are a lot of really random and completely unavoidable debts you incur (like your mom sending you a $10,000 medical debt to pay?!) and it's nearly impossible to hold any job for more than a couple weeks. Additionally, the stock market in this game doesn't perform nearly as well as any realistic market. Overall, this is a game that really makes things seem harder than they are in real life.","timestamp_created":1609116361,"timestamp_updated":1609116361,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498281776905059814","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kuSz0/YCdoT4vQI="}
