This DLC allows for that more so than before, with clear government types that have realistic and proportioned strengths/weaknesses/assets. \n\nAlthough some players do not like the commonwealths, I think it's a great idea and fun to use them. Unlike many 4x games, it adds another layer of \"realism\", a sense of political decision making that goes beyond, \"all these worlds are mine and do what ever I want\". Similar to colonization in human history, setting up colonies in far away places is costly and not easy; they tend to run themselves whether the mother country likes it or not, but are still their citizens. So, if you just limit the number of colonies by government type in a game, that \"seems\" artificial, slows down the game, and there is an incentive to just play for the governments that allow for the most colonization. However, with commonwealths, it allows a player to maintain a certain style of government and forces a player to \"THINK\" about how to expand. Which newly conquered worlds or established colonies or resources should you keep direct control over and which will be allowed to have some autonomy? AND by autonomy, I don't mean the auto governor that frees up micro-managing, but political autonomy with loyalty to the home world.\n\nAlso, the expanded Bazaar is useful strategically, as well as, the spying and galactic market. All of which I find fun to employ and definitely use to strategic advantage. Over-all, this DLC adds more layers and ways to play the game.","timestamp_created":1571477536,"timestamp_updated":1571478122,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4aXZ8e0CcJCt1AE="}
