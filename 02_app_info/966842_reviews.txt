Similar to Contessa, but with some extra quirks to make her more of an aggressive rushdown-styled character. The sword flurry special is really strong and easy to cancel into, allowing for some easy and highly damaging combos. Her shield is unique in that she can shield bash and move while using it, but it overheats faster. The rising sword is a bit worse than Contessa's skeleton arm, but can be fun to catch whiffs with, and the ultimate can dominate in free-for-alls. Overall, very fun mech, each new release to this game just keeps getting better!","timestamp_created":1555132026,"timestamp_updated":1555132026,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561265528202056885","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyfHFiuoCcfuQvwE="}
