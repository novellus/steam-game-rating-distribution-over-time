    review: Really good DLC, if you just started playing Crossout, especially at price
      of $25 or less, the 1000 coin worth it alone, really good 4 energy autocannon,
      loose the side steps (actually sewer pipe painted aluminum colour :)  Heavy
      But looks nice, (good for ramming buzz saw conversion ) Buy the insane-wheels
      with chains, low price now 32 coin ingame 4x, sell the rear wheels for 250 coin
      each, buy some good rare weps with all the cash, engine upgrade and geni, and
      you have a 12 energy 55 parts mid tear rig out of the gate...amazing deal, see
      my picks for PowWow version of this rig :) (native american theme paint low
      price right now on server,, 20 coin) Buy it before March 1 !...then buy other
      DLC in March for some more coin etc...and raid raid raid to level :)  Instance
      matching and fuel collecting is for losers jj, just buy the fuel for raids,
      with all the coin this unlocks etc.  (currently just 6 coin for 100 litres nice
      )
