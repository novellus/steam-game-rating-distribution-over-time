      \ workmanship? Oh no, you feel like that all buildings on the street are kind\
      \ of grand castles? If so, it\u2019s time to play Tree of Life. You can make\
      \ your own village anytime, anywhere. You can also be anyone. You can be a lord\
      \ who rules a huge grand territory or makes a knight guild to protect the ToL\
      \ world. What about a village for wanderers? Whatever you want!<br><br><img\

      \ our world is not perfect. It is full of dangers. So, it could be a good way\
      \ to explore the ToL world in your room. What about the desert? Come and feel\
      \ the sunshine, chase a mirage, find unique cactus and shooting stars\u2026\
      \ If you prefer the North Pole than the desert, why don\u2019t you explore the\
      \ snowy field on the North? Please keep in mind that you should bring your warm\
      \ leather clothes. (\u2026 be careful with bears!) Can you feel it? Just explore\
      \ the world!<br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Player-based Economy</h2><br>Are\
      \ you tired of endless battles? But you still want to support your guild as\
      \ one of guild members? If so, be a master, then move the entire economy of\
      \ ToL. Build and maintain your own farm, then generate food to support your\
      \ guild. Or just be a grand merchant, then transport goods across the whole\
      \ world, or be a master who makes good weapons in legendary level. Whichever\
      \ is fine. That makes the economy.<br><br></li><li><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">21 Class\

      \ chef\u2026 You don\u2019t really know which one fits you? Well, have you ever\
      \ thought why you can\u2019t be a mighty warrior and 5-star chef at the same\
      \ time? Like... a chef who catches a big brown bear with his bare hands. As\
      \ you want, you can be both of them N.O.W, since there are 21 job classes in\
      \ the world! YAY~~~ You can make your own character as you like.<br><br><br><img\

      \ what if the Tol world is, too? You can be a good friend with other players,\
      \ or just be a night watchman to protect the new world order, or offer a reward\
      \ for criminals to bring the justice. Depends on your choice. However just be\
      \ careful. Anyone could offer a reward for you!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/361800/extras/3rd.jpg?t=1608441449\"\

      \ world! Be a hero by defeating your enemies who try to take your grand castle.<br><br><br>So,\
      \ get ready for Tree of Life? Just play your own game, make your own world.\
