    review: "Victoria is a match 3 game with a new twist and had it beeen balanced\
      \ properly it could very well have turned out as a new classic in the genre\
      \ but apparently that is not in the cards to ever actually happen.\n\nFirst\
      \ of all the game revolves around the woman Victoria who after her husband and\
      \ kid was killed by a poltergheist a few years back is now travelling across\
      \ USA in her hunt for revenge on evil supernatural creatures. \nThe game plays\
      \ as a normal match 3 game where players needs to line up matching tiles in\
      \ a setting of fighting off ghouls, vampires etc. The game has a really nice\
      \ look to it and is a far darker approach than the ordinary match 3 games that\
      \ generally are more sweet and bright and colorfull. The real twist of the the\
      \ game though is if you doesnt fend of the evils comming at you in time you\
      \ will instead get \"rewarded\" with  jump scares thrown at you out of the blue\
      \ so that pretty much forces the player to take a more speedy and aggresive\
      \ approach than in an usual match 3 game. The game has 100 levels with 10 enemies\
      \ distributed over 10 sets of ten games and this is where the game starts to\
      \ go downspiralling because its horribly balanced because compared to the usual\
      \ match 3 games you actually has 3 lives to complete the entire game which frankly\
      \ is an idiotic choice by the developer. Ive played my share of match 3 games\
      \ over the years and hasnt even been able to reach the first boss so i feel\
      \ fairly confident to say that most people wont get to that point either. When\
      \ the 3 lives are gone the player will need to start the game all over again\
      \ from scratch.\nAt this point and as much i would have liked to recommend the\
      \ game i simply cant do that unless on a 90% discount. I'd recommend the developer\
      \ to remove the 3 life feature because it will limit 99% of the player base."
