The concept is great ! \n But it has no smooth turning andit is very buggy (your avatar cant stand still, arrow grabbin nearly impposible, no attack sounds or on hit, oculus controllers are not positioned as they \nshould be. I really hope they fix all this, polish the game a bit and i will come back to it in a heart beat!\n\nYou can local coop RTs map or MOBA thats really cool! Please make this game great but until then i have to give  a thumbs down...for now ! \nIf this will be like smite having a baby with total war i would give you 60 bucks for sure !","timestamp_created":1524583382,"timestamp_updated":1524584167,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ45YaT/OICcon3ngE="}
