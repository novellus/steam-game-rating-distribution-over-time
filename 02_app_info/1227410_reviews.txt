Trine 3 has the shortest list (as the game itself is rather short). All available in both .flac and .mp3 formats. So compared to the other soundtracks in the series it is not worth the full price. Might be worth it if you get it on a good sale. \n\n[b]P.S.:[/b] You can press Download Album in the Soundtracks section of the library filter and then find it in \"..\\Steam\\steamapps\\music\\Trine 3 Original Soundtrack\". Or in the game directory if it downloaded with your game.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this DLC review you can find more in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]","timestamp_created":1604432049,"timestamp_updated":1604433597,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.55921638011932373","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pLrsx/UCfLmNrAI="}
