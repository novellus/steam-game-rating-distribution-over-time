    review: 'Card City Nights 2 is unfortunately a much worse game in many ways than
      the first game.


      The core gameplay is similar in many ways, with having to connect 3 cards together
      using the 8-way arrows on each cards. But the board is one large 6x3 board instead
      of each player having their own 3x3 board, and connecting the cards doesn''t
      immediately cause an action, but rather activates them, to do something in X
      number of turns.


      There are definitely pros to the new game. Being able to place your cards directly
      in the way of the opponent is nice. The "spy" cards that have red arrows that
      connect to the opponent''s cards are very cool, and there''s some great balance
      with them (they often have powerful placement effects, but help your opponent
      create matches). There''s a lot of interesting possible combos you can do. Like
      powerful cards with no arrows, that have to be activated by other means. Or
      cards with great effects only WHILE active, which means you want to delay their
      turn timer as much as possible.


      But there''s so much strategy that''s been taken away because of the changes.
      In particular, the ability to win a duel by disabling opponent''s cards to block
      their board is completely gone. The only way to win is getting the opponent
      to 0 HP. Also, the way that activated cards can instantly activate new cards
      leads to very stale gameplay that''s essentially just infinitely chaining damage
      cards. This is compounded by the fact that your opponent has no chance to block
      you if you place a card where one just finished activating.


      In CCN1, every attack took time and you had to be very aware of your opponent''s
      board to know if you might get blocked, or if you should block them. In CCN2,
      I never really had to pay too much attention to my opponent at all. I just had
      to make note of how to continue my chain. CCN1''s three symbols (attack/defend/heal)
      made you think more about how to match your cards and what to do with them,
      but that system is gone in CCN2.


      And while there are a LOT of interesting card effects, they are all almost completely
      useless if they aren''t damage. Almost all these cards that do nothing but provide
      arrows, or let you peek at your deck, or swap card colors, or get mana tokens,
      are all completely inferior to cards that do 1 or 2 damage. Plus, the long delay
      in activation effects often makes instant placement effects too overpowered.
      These were powerful in CCN1 as well, like Health Potion or Brickocalypse, but
      didn''t have the same oomph they do in CCN2. Plus, ones like Anna Ban, which
      stayed ON your board after their powerful effect, or Bomb, which does 2 damage
      but your opponent has a turn to defuse them, were a very interesting mechanic.
      In CCN2, there''s no con to placing a dead-after-arrival placement effect card
      wherever on the board. Or even worse, putting 2 Potatos in your deck because
      there''s literally never a reason not to.


      Another thing is that I enjoyed in CCN1 how you face off against strong opponents
      using a unique Legendary card, and then after you win, you get that Legendary.
      And you could only have ONE legendary card in your deck. They had powerful effects,
      like reviving every turn, or shielding damage, or wiping the board, or chaining
      attacks faster. This element is completely gone in CCN2, and all the rank up
      battles just feel like normal battles using normal cards. For there being so
      many potential combos, I didn''t really see any "gimmick" decks in CCN2, maybe
      because none of them can be successful compared to raw damage.


      And last but not least, the deck editor is a bit worse... No mousewheel support
      for scrolling your card collection or deck? Really? And I absolutely hate how
      you can''t temporarily overfill your deck. I want to put my new cards in, THEN
      figure out what I''m taking out. It''s a super basic feature that Pokemon Trading
      Card Game did perfectly 20 years ago. And your deck is ordered by when you added
      the card, not by name or rarity or anything logical like that. It''s very difficult
      to find specific cards in the deck list to remove. And the only way to sort
      the collection is alphabetically, though there''s definitely some improvements
      compared to CCN1, like searching by name or filtering for specific arrows. But
      there''s a lot of design choices I would change with it if I could, both from
      CCN1 and from other game''s deck editors.


      Overall, it''s still a fun card game adventure, which is an underappreciated
      genre, but in trying to create a new twist instead of refine the original further,
      the gameplay has suffered.'
