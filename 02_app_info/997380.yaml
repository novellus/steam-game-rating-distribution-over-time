      Stoop has wanted to play a simulation game where you can build your own plants
      and animals, put them in a world, and see what happens since 2002. You can imagine
      his excitement when Will Wright, the father of simulation games, demoed his
      latest game Spore to an enthusiastic crowd. When Spore turned out to be all
      game genres except simulation, Wessel decided he wanted to try to make the game
      by himself. The Sapling is the result of that attempt.
