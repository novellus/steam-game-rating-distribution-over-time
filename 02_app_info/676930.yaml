      \ swiftly and heal yourselves. Moving together is the ONLY way to heal, and\

      \ time and really lets you gain the upper hand in tough situations.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">STORY MODE: ABSURD 80s SATIRE</h2>You and your partner were the best\
      \ cops in the greater Twin Cities metropolitan area until a horrific pontoon\

      \ your mangled bodies and combined them together using the latest technology\
      \ to save your lives, combining you into one super-cop: TwinCop. You and your\

      \ to be in sync with one another if you\u2019re going to survive. What truly\

      \ PopTop Drink) have to do with any of this?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CUSTOMIZE YOUR\
      \ COP</h2>Over 25+ character combinations to try! Choose one of the eight most\
      \ elite members of the Twin Cities police force, each with their own unique\

      \ everyday tasks become quite difficult. Defuse bombs by cooperatively cutting\

      \ a job well done. You\u2019ll never take these tasks for granted ever again.<h2\
