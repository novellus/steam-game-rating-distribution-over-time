    review: "TL;DR: Operation Zeta is a fun little puzzle with a lot of promise. The\
      \ developer is actively engaged with the player community discussing features\
      \ and improvements to the game experience. Fans of roguelikes, physics engines,\
      \ and space faring rats should give this charming title a try. \n\nOperation\
      \ Zeta is a unique take on the roguelike genre. There are no bosses or deadly\
      \ combat to end your run, but rather a strict time limit.\n\nPlaying Operation\
      \ Zeta throws the player in to a crisis. You are a sole survivor of a failed\
      \ mission. The enemy is closing in on you. You have minutes to find the pieces\
      \ of your ship and repair them to escape. Your ship parts are rarely just lying\
      \ around having been gathered by locals who will need help before giving them\
      \ back. Sometimes these quests are simple, bring me 5 stones a cat might say.\
      \ Sometimes they are more complicated, requiring you to explore the map and\
      \ find special items spread throughout. These items and denizens are spread\
      \ across numerous planets that you must travel between to complete your goal.\
      \ \n\nThis is where things begin to get interesting. Like I stated above, Operation\
      \ Zeta gives you minutes to explore the map, collect ship parts which means\
      \ complete quests, return parts to your ship, and repair the whole thing. If\
      \ that sounds like a lot, it is. The challenge of this game is not the combat,\
      \ but the pressure of the time limit. Finding ways to save time as you explore\
      \ become immensely rewarding. \n\nTake the Roki, a species of space faring rats.\
      \ They are innately better at repairing ships than any other species. Since\
      \ they have tools to repair faster, you can start building your foundation or\
      \ repair kits as you complete the other tasks. If this sounds like they completely\
      \ bypass the repair stage, they do. This doesn\u2019t feel unfair though because\
      \ their combat is slow and deadly. Each planet has gravity which causes shots\
      \ to arc around the planet in some strange orbit. This mechanic makes fighting\
      \ with most races relatively safe since you can get some range on enemies using\
      \ the gravitational pull to curve your bullets. The Roki however, shoot projectiles\
      \ that are too fast and escape the gravity of your planet. So every fight is\
      \ a grueling game of cat and space rat.\n\n As an early access, indie title,\
      \ Operation Zeta is a fun little puzzle to solve. There are areas for the game\
      \ to grow for sure. I could discuss issues such as the lack of variety in quests\
      \ or inability to leave a puzzle once you start it. However, by the time you\
      \ are reading this they are likely to be addressed by the developer. Opening\
      \ the main screen of Operation Zeta gives a countdown to the next update release.\
      \ This is not to say that both issues I mentioned above will be resolved with\
      \ the next update, but it shows that the developer is committed to making this\
      \ game great. The studio hosts an active discord page that you can use to discuss\
      \ the game and suggest features with the developer and other players. \n\nTo\
      \ wrap this up, I do recommend you give this title a try. The game is charming\
      \ and quick. The community and developer are active and growing. Lastly, a successful\
      \ run will take less than 15 minutes, but you will find yourself playing for\
      \ a few hours before you get there.  \n"
