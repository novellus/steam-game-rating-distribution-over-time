In Silent World, you can do neither. (You don't have to be silent, either.) You push wooden boxes, you use your hat to sneak past zombies, you disarm obvious traps, you climb ladders and fall down platforms, and if you could see where you're going (which will cost you a matchstick powerup), this would be entirely unchallenging, and if your avatar moved with any speed and didn't fuss over climbing and pushing  (you have to get the positioning and direction just right, best to use an analog stick), you'd probably be done in half an hour. That said, I abandoned the game midway through chapter 3 (of 4), because the game presented me with a switch puzzle (guess which switch opens which door) with no visual feedback that would see me slog through several storeys of platforms using an elevator that moved even slower than I usually do.\n\nThe game looks like it was inexpertly cobbled together with a 2D game generator; so uninspired that sometime during chapter 2 I suspected I was running through a procedurally generated endless game. And as with many similar uninspired offerings, the developers turn off the lights to hide much of it, make the enemies zombies to hide their lack of \"intelligence\", and embrace the cliches of the horror genre.\n\nI don't often ask for refunds for games that only cost pocket change; but I'm doing it for this one.\nAnd I'm setting all games from this publisher to \"ignore\". I'm all for Korean kids coding their own games; but there's no reason to reward publishing them on Steam when the farthest they should go is the family fridge.\n\nDon't buy; don't play.","timestamp_created":1606521766,"timestamp_updated":1606521766,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.585501492023468018","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh5iKhvYCfZiFtAI="}
