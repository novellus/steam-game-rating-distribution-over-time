    review: "This game is a lot of fun. It's a simple retro-feeling puzzle-adventure\
      \ game (sort of like Pitfall 2, Metroid, etc.), but much more polished, which\
      \ made it a more enjoyable experience for me.  I never got tired of the music,\
      \ so that made it good in my mind.  The option to choose the machine you play\
      \ the game on was a nice touch.  \n\nAs someone whose appreciation of simple-ish,\
      \ short-ish has grown in recent years, I consider this to be one of the best\
      \ games I've finished recently, and I highly recommend it to anyone who's at\
      \ least partially interested/has any enjoyment of retro-feeling games."
