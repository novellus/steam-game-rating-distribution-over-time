    review: 'Edit: if you''ve never played one of these games before Buy the collection!
      It gives you all the games and is better value for money


      A mighty attempt at keeping the series fresh, suffering from a lack of pc optimisation
      and testing. The 360 pad support is there, but everything else looks like it
      needs more work done with it. In a game about puzzles fused with speedrunning
      you''re thinking 4 player would be an amazing idea! But then you remember it''s
      incredibly easy to troll each other, which will happen 100 times more often
      than the military like precision needed to make full use of co-op speedrunning.
      There''s a vs mode I haven''t tested, but I imagine it has a lot to do with
      the aformentioned trolling.


      Only get this if you REALLY love the series, love the character, have local
      friends who are more likely to work together than troll and/or it''s on sale'
