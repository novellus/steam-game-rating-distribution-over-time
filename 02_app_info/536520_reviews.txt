Certain composition names are straight-up spoilers, so i recommend to not listen to any of the music before you'll finish the game.","timestamp_created":1484555069,"timestamp_updated":1484555069,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60644298791885376","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45JSY09kCes/ebw=="}
