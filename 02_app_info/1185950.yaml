    review: While this game takes place during the Wars of the Roses, a period I do
      not recall any others covering, it is a Hexwar game. As such, gameplay is relatively
      straight-forward. I.e. move your troops and hope the dice/RNG decide in your
      favor. Recommend to those who enjoy this sort of thing.
