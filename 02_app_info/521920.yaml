    review: "What is Death Hangover ?\n\nIts an OK indie game, do you know those old\
      \ brick bash games ? so its one of those, its a very little and basic concept\
      \ and its a type of game Im not a fan of but I can play it easily as its not\
      \ a very interesting type of gameplay at all but can be fun if done well and\
      \ death hangover has its fun moments in the first early levels, I really like\
      \ the artstyle and its personality but the game has so many bad design decisions\
      \ its really hard to recommend it which is a shame because it has potential\
      \ to be a good small indie game with basic but fun gameplay, as far as you go\
      \ into the story, really really bad game design start showing, you cant replay\
      \ levels meaning that if you didnt get all souls (collectibles) on a specific\
      \ level, its over, you cant get them again unless you restart your playthrough,\
      \ you cant repeat levels and not only that but there are secret levels that\
      \ if you miss you cant also play them anymore, the games just goes on and leaves\
      \ everything behind, on top of that, the final level with death is just really\
      \ frustrating and not fun, it really bought the game down, also, about those\
      \ collectibles you need to get a number of them to actually get the true ending\
      \ which is just stupid, the game is fun at times and other times just completely\
      \ boring and bland.\n\nTo make it all worse after finishing the so called \"\
      arcade\" mode the game unlocks its actual story mode which is just the same\
      \ thing as arcade but they throw a really crappy and basic 2d  sidescroller\
      \ gameplay where you just go around inspecting things and killing basic enemies\
      \ by throwing the ball, those sidescroller levels are small and happen between\
      \ each one of the main arcade levels you played before, so its just the same\
      \ game again but with something underveloped throwed between levels, I took\
      \ 2h to finish the arcade mode and Im glad it wasnt longer, Im not interested\
      \ into this story mode as its the same thing over again, it should have been\
      \ the other way around but the devs behind this just made bad decisions all\
      \ over the place and Im not interested into replaying the game again to get\
      \ a true ending, fuck it, it also has a level editor buts its so limited its\
      \ not even worth talking about.\n\n I dont recommend it, there are better brick\
      \ bash games out there, go find them."
