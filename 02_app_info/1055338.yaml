    review: Great route, plentiful mainline running 70+mph, great scenery. The loop
      tracks for the grain elevators are a nice touch as well. For those that love
      road crossings this is for you as they are in abundance. Recycled sound software
      course, easy fix using searchlights sound packs. Overall great route and a real
      bang for your buck.
