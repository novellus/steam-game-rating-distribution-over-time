    review: 'What is Overlord: Fellowship of Evil ?


      The first overlord game was a nice little game that was kinda entertaining to
      play and was competently made, it didnt need to be turned into a franchise but
      since there was potential on it, it had two forgettable spin offs stuck on nintendo
      systems (Minions and Dark Legend) that played safe and easy therefore not exploring
      the potential the first one put on the table, then we got the sequel which was
      disappointing, what people who liked the first wanted was a true sequel to the
      first game, one that kept the spirit of the first game, wasnt overly complicated
      in its execution like 2 and a game that felt more modern and polished since
      the first game is old by now, after many years we get this, another forgettable,
      useless, unnecessary spin-off this time taking inspiration from diablo-esque
      action/hack n slash games in a coop setting which is utterly lame and uninspired,
      even if you judge the game for what it is, its just a mediocre game overall,
      this type of game has been done to death by this point and much better by others,
      just dont waste your time with it.'
