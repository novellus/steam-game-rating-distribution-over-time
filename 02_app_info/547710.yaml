    review: There is great positive difference in the graphical quality off the new
      version to the one before, but unfortunately it doesn't look contemporary anymore
      and also the environment is abandoned and nothing happens. The interiors are
      also almost empty and the few furniture inside the left buildings work unloved.
      Our character runs around the large area and searches for useful objects and
      journals, which give him clues to the whereabouts of his brother. After 39 minutes
      i finished my gameplay because i couldn't find these damned axe to cut through
      wood barriers. Pleasant is the very smooth overall performance of the game and
      it's not dark only empty. Maybe a good title for the version 2.0 would have
      been "Emptiness ahead".
