    review: "It's an insult to even call this a \"game\" but I will call it that to\
      \ simplify this review. I'm only doing this so that other people such as yourself,\
      \ don't get suckered into purchasing it, like I did.  \n\n[Insert Long Breath\
      \ Rant] Now answer me this. Have you ever played a game that was so terrible\
      \ that you immediately uninstalled before you even had a chance to think about\
      \ what it is that you are doing before you did it at an attempt to save yourself\
      \ every last nano second of time that you spent wasting away playing that particular\
      \ flavor of doo doo? Well that's this game. \n\nYou can swing your sword and\
      \ you can move your character using the D-Pad against a green tented background.\
      \ That's the majority of the \"game\", with the occasional slaying of enemies,\
      \ who's AI is worse than Anthem\u2019s upon the initial release. You obtain\
      \ health after walking several hallways until you get to mini boss events and\
      \ if you defeat the challenge you awarded a heart piece, not be be confused\
      \ with a heart container. Did I mention that A & B are swapped but B doesn't\
      \ do anything at all? That's right, you can't; inspect, read, pickup, throw,\
      \ jump, dash, bring up menus, check inventory, switch weapons, pause, etc.\n\
      \nI know it's EA but this isn't that. It's basically a placeholder that tries\
      \ to trick folks into buying what appears to be a retro style Zelda game but\
      \ it isn't that whatsoever. STEAM you are failing so hard in your QA/QC (not\
      \ to mention a million other things but I digress). \n\nTLDR; Folks this is\
      \ utter trash with some ok music. Trrust me whne I say, \"Hard pass on this!\"\

      \ back and alter my review to reflect as such. I am of the opinion that developers\
      \ deserve all criticism of their poor products for releasing them in such a\
      \ rubbish state. When devs do this, they saturate the market with junk that\
      \ \"we\" the consumer, must then have to sort through, to find a sliver of a\
      \ game worth playing. I'll be decent once the developer treats us with some\
      \ decency. /end_rant\n\nAlso, Epstein didn't kill himself.."
