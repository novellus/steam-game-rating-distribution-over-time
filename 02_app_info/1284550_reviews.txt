Allured by the bright effects and promise of a competitive environment I decided to give it a go, not at any risk really as I got this for just over a £. \n\nThe controls are innovative for a shooter, using all four edges of the screen through the teleport system. Shapes with different colours and movement patterns pass across the screen for your ship to fire upon, an emphasis on accuracy is highlighted early on and your score ramps up in chain through a rather standard multiplier system. \n\nSimilar to fellow space shooter title Ikaruga, this game uses colour to diversify the experience, requiring you to use the switchable colour of the ship to shoot the corresponding colour and increase your score throughout the 2 stage round in each level, this adds opportunity for further finesse and difficulty. The ranking structure is simple and understandable. The global scoring system is rather interesting and unique, I think it is the stand out feature of the game being that you must use your score to upgrade the ship as a currency. If you were no1 on the leaderboard and decided to go all out on the next model, your motivated to try and build that score back up to reach the top spot once again. This is can see as both a positive and negative in peoples differing opinion but I personally like the originality. \n\nThe blurb for the game on the stores is what I would call half true, in that competition is a key element and will hopefully grow with time, however the music and sounds is where I started to see issues. Which, being that this is a feel the beats type title, was disappointing. \n\nThe first issue during play was this repeated word (which I will spell wrong no doubt) “Contrau” which triggered when you increase your multiplier, I heard it constantly over the course of each round and it really got on my nerves toward the end of my play time, so much so I had to turn off SFX to continue on with the game. \n\nWhy not just say double, triple, quadruple and max? Or nothing, that works too. \n\nMusic in general could be better and more fitting for a neon style game, it's rather bland in places and repetitive. The round victory music especially seemed rather out of place. Note to YAW - Please see the game 'Super Hexagon' for an example of music style I believe would better suit this title. If it’s is indeed a beats game, It would be nice if you could apply your own music to it and the shapes could be a bit more connected to the music rhythm itself. This is just a standard shooter and music is not is key feature, in my opinion. One of the music packs is called Stinky Toilet, which I found ironic.  \n\nAs mentioned previously, the colours and effects are great, the developer has kindly taken the time and consideration to apply a photosensitivity warning when the game loads up (needed as this game is a light show in it's own right) and I must say that I absolutely love the level starting sequence shown as the beginning of each level. The 'enemies' or shapes that are your targets have a hit box which is indicated by the column following in it's wake, however you will quickly notice that the triangles extend in size past the column and is a little unnatural feeling when you felt assured that you hit a corner of the shape, yet the shot didn't count due to not being within this column. To correct this a change could be made to ensure the full shape stays inside the column, further allowing you to control the ship through peripheral vision. \n\nWith a few extra features and much better music, this would be a fine title for my pick up and play library. \n\n3/10. \n\nBugs and notes\nRanking position 99 to 10? (It doesn't display as rank 100) \n\nWhen the mission is complete, shapes can still reach the bottom of the map and deduct score, minor thing, still annoying. \n\nThere are a few typos in the game itself, I am always guilty of the odd typo but this is a paid for product so should be cleared up, one in particular which jumped out at me was that the community tab is spelt Comunity.","timestamp_created":1602684724,"timestamp_updated":1602791801,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1602781490,"developer_response":"Hi GreyEndurance! Thank you so much for playing our game!\n\nThank you very much for the feedback, we seek as far as possible we are always looking to improve the experience of our players in the games.\n\nWe write down all your observations and we will study them with care.\n\nRegarding the word that is triggered when the multiplier increases, we are studying the possibility of removing it or giving the option to disable it.\n\nCertainly songs made especially for the game would be fantastic, but we still don't have enough resources for that.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no possibility for two players to play on the same keyboard, as part of the commands are made by the mouse, to play Coop mode or PVP it is necessary to have at least one control, because this way a player would stay on the keyboard and mouse and the other in control.\n\nAs we are a tiny studio, working on our little free time, negative reviews really impact a lot. If you can reconsider and post your review as positive, after the next updates, even with your considerations, that would mean too much for us and would certainly be a huge support.\n\nThanks for alerting us to our name on the ranking list, in one of our tests we forgot to remove it.\n\nThanks again for playing our game and we’re glad you did."}],"cursor":"AoJ4isD1lvUCcazppwI="}
