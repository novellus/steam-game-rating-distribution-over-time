As a carnivore, you enter into classic RPG turn-based battle with other animals. You can watch where carnivores (red arrow) and herbivores (green arrows) are located in proximity to you on the mini-map. This is crucial because if a carnivore pops up with a \"red eyes\" thought-box, you are usually dead - no chance of escape. \nSo SAVE FREQUENTLY.\nOnce you reach adulthood, you can find a mate and reproduce - when you are eventually killed or die of old age, you have the choice to respawn as your child. The feature is kind of pointless, admittedly, because the only reason you would want to continue past adulthood is to try to beat your previous high score. So I usually just allow my animal to die of old age, which automatically happens after you eat up to 100 points in adult form.\nIt is worth noting there is educational content about the animals too, although this is limited and not all the information is correct.\n\nOverall the game has three modes:\n\n1) Scenario Mode: \nThis is my favourite. The developer has recreated many of the ancient environments and animals featured in palaeontology documentaries such as Walking of Dinosaurs, Walking with Beasts, and Walking with Monsters. You play out the scenarios as the animal protagonists from the episodes.\n\n2) Free Mode:\nMy second favourite.\nChoose a period and habitat in Earth's history\nChoose your character (animal species + starting age)\nKeep your animal alive for its entire lifestyle!\nDifferent environments offer slightly different challenges. But I won't spoil this for you.\n\n3. Campaign Mode:\nBasically, a story where time travelling rangers go back in time to capture prehistoric animals.\nI only started playing the campaign before deciding it wasn't my cup of tea. The campaign reminded me too much of other \"prehistoric games\" that are usually about people shooting and riding prehistoric animals. I'm more interested in playing pure prehistoric life simulations, without the inclusion of science fiction/human elements.\n\nEven without the Campaign, the Scenario and Free Modes are definitely worth the low price of the game!\n\nThere are a few minor issues with the mechanics and only one game-breaking bug, but they are not really worth discussing here because the developer has assured me most will be fixed in the next update.\n\nThe developer of Dinodrifters has expressed that they were inspired by a classic Walking with Dinosaurs game called the \"Big Al Game\" where you played as an Allosaurus from infant to adulthood. The art style of Dinodrifters is even intentionally crafted with old-school polygonal graphics to create that feeling of \"1990's PC games nostalgia\". \nI 100% respect this.\n\nDinodrifters is the game, at long last, which allows the player to experience all of natural history.\nSo if you are a fan of prehistoric life, Walking with Dinosaurs or classic PC games, you will love Dinodrifters!","timestamp_created":1589700296,"timestamp_updated":1589700296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.587231695652008057","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1K/hkPICcKKpiAI="}
