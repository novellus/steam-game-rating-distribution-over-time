      /><h2 class="bb_tag">About This Game</h2>Ten years after his Apocalypse Weekend
      escapades, The Postal Dude finally returns!<br><br>Paradise Lost is a full-fledged
      expansion pack for POSTAL 2 continuing the saga of the POSTAL series. Join the
      Dude as he ventures back into his former hometown embarking on a quest to find
      his lost dog. Not all is at it seems, as the once tranquil (relatively speaking)
      town and its citizens have been transformed in the wake of the nuclear destruction.
      Dare to enter the varied Zones as you cross the Arid Desert, trek through the
      dense Rainy Foliage, freeze your nuts off in the Nuclear Winter, and roam under
      the Ashen Skies. Meet the many mysterious factions comprised of the towering,
      the miniature, the zombified, and everything in between and use your radiant
      people skills to attempt to ally yourself with their enigmatic leaders, ranging
      from former child stars to terrifying demonic udder-wielding beasts! Fierce
      Lawmen, crazed Bandits, deranged Doomsday Survivalists, and a phallic child''s
      toy mascot await. Do whatever it takes to survive! Wait in lines! Use vending
      machines! Buy toilet paper! Journey to where it all began to rescue your loyal
      companion!<br><br>Prepare to delve into the post-apocalyptic world of Paradise
      Lost!<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>A complete singleplayer
