    review: 'I like the game.  I''ve been playing for about  3 and a half hours and
      I just received a slow down ability. I am at the feet of a giant statue of the
      King''s daughter, the princess.  I''m stuck in this small area.  I have bounced
      in every square inch of the area and tried to press B to slow things down and
      every other thing I could think of. I''m just stuck there.  How do I get out?
      Update:  I finally figured it out.  The game doesn''t seem to explain these
      things very well, but I needed to change the ability to a lightning charge to
      break through rock walls.'
