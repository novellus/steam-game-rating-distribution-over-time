    review: '[i] My Experience [/i]


      I picked up CORGIX after playing and enjoying Fortix 1 and 2. I like this Jezzball-esque
      gameplay style, and find that these games are great to play while listening
      to music.


      CORGIX is quite a bit easier than the Fortix series, as the most effective way
      to win a level is almost always bisecting the playing field. You can veer to
      one side or the other at the end in order to ensure that you capture the boss
      within the smaller segment of the two to instantly complete the level. In Fortix,
      there are certain sections of the playing field that are impassable or inaccessible
      without a key, and there are also different types of terrain that are slower
      to traverse. CORGIX has none of these complications, but there were a few times
      that my pup inexplicably slowed down after capturing a certain section of the
      map (possibly a bug?).


      However, there is still something satisfying about slowly cordoning off the
      playing field a little bit at a time, and CORGIX scratches that itch. Although
      I completed the story mode in about half an hour, I had a decent time following
      this Corgi caper. If you haven''t played Fortix 2, I''d recommend that you play
      that first, but CORGIX isn''t bad for a second helping.'
