    review: 'The new Clunk sprite completely ruins this skin mainly becuase it doesn''t
      look like the one in the art design. An examples: the gun doesn''t have the
      viewfinder and the old sprite had it and when you started to shoot you could
      see the used bullet coming out of the up hole and the new one does not have
      that. The old sprite explosion had a cool animation before he exploded on the
      new one its just a image and thats it. The devs didn''t really care about the
      design and just put crap on the new one which it makes me angry on it. I hope
      that they add a option that let you use the old sprites of Clunk becuase the
      new sprite completely ruins this skin. And the old one you could see the chain
      of the ammo attached on the gun and for some reason the new one does not have
      that. I''m dissapointed in you Ronimo.'
