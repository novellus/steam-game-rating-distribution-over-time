    review: '[u]2020 Speedy Review Cleanup[/u]


      The developers of [i]Blind Spot[/i] know how to make nice graphics and an intriguing
      environment. You are essentially solving puzzles throughout a mansion and trying
      to uncover a story about a family behind all of it.


      On the positive side, there is enough visual design and complex scenes to make
      you want to see where this is all going. On the negative side, the developers
      try to tell the story through text messaging as well and it gets overly convoluted.
      Essentially, by the end of the game, you might not even have an idea of what
      happened. There''s multiple endings, though after watching a video on them,
      I don''t think any of them make complete sense.


      Yet I think the journey outweighed the destination in this game. The puzzles
      and the scenes/areas I encountered (even with it being set inside of a mansion)
      stuck with me and made it intriguing enough to keep playing.


      A couple of other downsides are that the developers limit your walking speed
      to slower than an average human''s pace. Usually I hate this in games, but somehow
      the visual design was good enough to where I enjoyed looking at everything.
      I would still argue for it to be increased. Besides that, you can''t carry more
      than one object at a time, so you have to drop the current one to pick up another.
      Sometimes that gets weird if you drop a puzzle item and need to find it, though
      that didn''t occur much.


      Environment is definitely a focus in the game, and I think a good amount of
      the collectibles shed a nice background on the story, especially better than
      the text messaging does.


      It''s worth giving a try, though I would suggest grabbing it on sale.'
