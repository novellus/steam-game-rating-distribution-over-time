Nonetheless, this game is fantastic for those that share a love of history and reading. The period this is set in: The Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt and the Great Library at Alexandria- is a fascinating time, filled with intrigue, wonder and mayhem. The multiple potential endings mean this game has good replay-ability and as someone new to this genre of games i look forward to it.\nI do recommend this game to my fellow history buff gamers.\nPraise Zeus-Ammon!","timestamp_created":1609178720,"timestamp_updated":1609178720,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8NSh1fYCeNyWvgI="}
