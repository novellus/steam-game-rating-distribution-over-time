    review: "I was a great fan of the original Crimson Room game way back in the day\
      \ (2006?). It paved the way for my love of escape games. \n\nImagine my excitement\
      \ when I saw that Takagism was back with a Crimson Room.... sequel/remake/tribute/something.\
      \ \n\nIt's just... not very good by today's standards. It is still a bit pixel\
      \ hunt-y. There are interactions that don't immediately make sense. In fact\
      \ if you do play this, you must go into it assuming that this is not reality.\
      \ A certain puzzle element occurs that you may not notice because there's no\
      \ real connection between the two things until you notice it by chance.\n\n\
      It's really a click everything and hope it works sort of scenario, except if\
      \ you remember the original crimson room then you'll know a few of the steps\
      \ that make a return.\n\nThere's about an hour of gameplay here. I got this\
      \ for 3 bucks on sale. It was a nice nostalgia trip but ultimately a disappointment.\
      \ If Takagism wants to move forward with Viridian Room, I hope it's better than\
      \ this."
