      \ don't like wargames.\u201D<br />\r\nPC Gamer<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201CBATTLE\
      \ BUGS is nothing if not an enjoyable game to play. The manual and graphic elements\
      \ of the game are uniformly hilarious, from the radar display running on a \u2018\
      No Entiendo Lame Boy\u2019 to gruff spiders whirling into battle in a Tasmanian-devil-like\
      \ tornado. BATTLE BUGS manages to achieve that rare fusion, a meaningful tactical\
      \ game which is funny as well as fun to play. No one will lose their job or\
      \ spouse to an overdose of BATTLE BUGS playing, but plenty of gamers will have\
      \ many enjoyable evenings of conquering cheese wedges and slaughtering spiders.\u201D\
      <br />\r\nComputer Gaming World<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201C\u2018Battle Bugs\u2019\
      \ delights with sounds and images. In the category of scenario games, it\u2019\
      s definitely first place. This game is an example of how you can have a great\
      \ time with the subject, while bursting with humour and mocking our own reality\
      \ to create an extremely easy to use and yet complex simulation!\u201D<br />\r\

    review: Definitely bought this for the nostalgia. Its a great game though.  Starts
      out really easy so you can understand the basic concepts then starts to get
      more challenging. Good game for a child to get an idea of how older games used
      to be.  Its got childish humor and cartoon graphics and it will help build critical
      thinking skills without being overly complicated. You have to use the manual
      in additional content section in steam to get past the start screen guard rhinobugs.
