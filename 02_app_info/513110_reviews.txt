If they were then I would over look the other cons please let me know if you have the same issues with firemass!","timestamp_created":1516225709,"timestamp_updated":1516225783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zayGg+ECf86xlgE="}
