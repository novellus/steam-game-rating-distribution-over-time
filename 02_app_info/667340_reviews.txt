This game brought me to the brink of a breakdown. In the early days of my YouTube channel, I wasn't sure what to do but I knew I wanted to review this game. I could never finish this game though since it is hard as balls. The secrets are real secrets. The game doesn't care about what you think a puzzle should look like. It grabs your opinions screams \"shut\" up and kills you without mercy. Most of you will just leave the game after five minutes because they get frustrated. Those of you that stick around will be rewarded handsomely. Highly recommend it and also one of the worst titles for SEO :)\n\nHere is the full review/walkthrough: https://youtu.be/rOjNQERfiz0","timestamp_created":1566288416,"timestamp_updated":1566288416,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.411937355995178223","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0JGE1+wCf9va0AE="}
