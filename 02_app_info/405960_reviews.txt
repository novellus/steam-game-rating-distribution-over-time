It's still semi beta. The locations and world are superbly done. The enemies are hard to see so, can't really look at them, which is a shame. Maybe a enemy gallery of everything you have killed would be nice. \n\nI understand why when you die you have to lose all progress and start at the very beginning again, but that does not mean I like it. They even have a survival mode which is ironicly easy compared to the main adventure. I feel like this game needs more polish. I may be just a dirty casual who enjoys exploring the worlds and artistic direction in games but I would like at least a mode that does not punish me wanting to enjoy the game at a more relaxed measure. Also when you power punch, its like superman punching a wall. Furniture and objects goes flying everywhere in like a 5 meter circle.","timestamp_created":1573081736,"timestamp_updated":1573081736,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtMy+oe4Cc7mR2AE="}
