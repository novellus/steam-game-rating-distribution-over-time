There is a surface level experience where you can play it once, maybe twice, and for the most part be done with it. Its a nice, inexpensive indie horror game to enjoy in one sitting. The other way to enjoy this game is to seek out the clue trails, replay it a bunch seeking out the small hints and changes, and do a bit of light puzzle work. Either way I would recommend this game.\n\nFor those who just want a small horror experience, it has a moderate bulid up and satisfying payoff with moments where it can be genuinly unsettling. Granted, if you end up following the clue trails and figureing things out on that level then the creepy factor wears off pretty quickly, but at the same point you will know you're way through the game well enough that having to loop through to coninue isn't so bad. So far, its pretty well balanced.\n\nThere is more to come from this game as well. As stated, there will be two more stories added to the game and it will raise in price a dollar for each so if you're interested you might as well get it now while the gettings good.\n\n**Edit**\nIts hard, this one. I honestly enjoyed the first part of the game. The second chapter didn't catch me the same way, as the idea of looping back though for clues and passwords was abandoned for a fairly straightforward experience to a boss fight. I could get behind this but the bossfight felt unpolished. It was very difficult and when I did win, it felt like it was by accident. Now, after a multiple year wait, it is taken off of the steam market for purchase. While Jelli has stated this is not abandoned... well actions speak louder then words. this includes inaction. RIP Mono, I really truly did enjoy you.","timestamp_created":1491251269,"timestamp_updated":1575938801,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557148873805999756","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41rfR9u4Cetr+dQ=="}
