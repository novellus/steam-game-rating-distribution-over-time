    about_the_game: "The year is 1667 and you are a pirate sailing the waters of the\
      \ Caribbean. A Spanish Galleon floats nearby, and you\u2019ve talked your crewmates\
      \ into working together to steal all of its treasure. What you haven\u2019t\
      \ told your fellow pirates is that you have no intentions on sharing the treasure\
      \ once you have it. Your crewmates have told you that they share your loyalty\
      \ and that they\u2019ll help you maroon the greedy pirates on your ship to the\
      \ rocky island of Tortuga. But you\u2019ve seen your friends\u2019 loaded pistols\
      \ and heard their whisperings of a mutiny. You know that nobody can be trusted.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nTortuga is all about the interactions you have with the other\
      \ players. In some cases, such as when you and your shipmates are attacking\
      \ the Spanish Galleon, you need to rely on your enemies in order to succeed.\
      \ In the very next turn, however, your shipmates might stab you in the back\
      \ with a mutiny in order to keep all the treasure for themselves.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nSince nobody holds a &quot;hand&quot; of cards, this game is also\
      \ about knowledge and communication regarding the community Event cards. Unless\
      \ you are in desperation mode, it is not wise to reveal Event cards at random.\
      \ Almost half of the Event cards can hurt your team drastically. It's often\
      \ in your best interest to use an action to view the cards first, or to rely\
      \ on the knowledge of a trusted ally. Knowing where harmful Event cards are\
      \ located allows you to force an enemy to reveal those cards and suffer the\
      \ consequences. The most successful players are the ones who are able to discern\
      \ who is on their team and then share vital information with them at opportune\
      \ moments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVote cards also play a key role in the game. Each\
      \ Vote card has three sections - one each for Attacks, Mutinies, and Brawls.\
      \ Players must put themselves in the best position to use their Vote cards,\
      \ since their hand of Vote cards may not always be ideal based on their pawn\
      \ location. For example, sometimes it may be worth putting in Water, causing\
      \ an attack to fail, in order to save a Crossbones card for when you want to\
      \ Mutiny against your captain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor 2-9 Players. 20-40 minutes.\
      \ Ages 12+."

    review: 'To be honest I am a little disappointed in this DLC. The workshop community
      seems to provide far better games than this for FREE.

      The graphics are fine HOWEVER:-

      1. There are no AI players

      2. There seems to be no way to hot-seat over the network. By this I mean that
      every player needs their own PC and a copy of TTS (TableTop Simulator). This
      would be a perfect introduction to TTS, however, you cannot invite two people
      on the same PC/laptop/Mac to play as you can in some free mods like Carcassonne.
      For a game that is best played with at LEAST 3 (and up to 9) players, I find
      this VERY limiting

      3. The scripted setup is VERY limited and if you attempt to create a game in
      TTS hot-seat mode, it is very difficult to choose three of the starred event
      cards and add them to the event deck (So difficult in fact that I never figured
      out how!)'
