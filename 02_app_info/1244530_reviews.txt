What you are saying is making me think i should remove some of mechanics. I wanted to remove fish and ant completely but it seems every person likes different chapter/mechanics. I also realized that making less levels with more polish may be better idea. Well, endgame was suposed to be hard :)\n\nCould i know which mechanics you like or dont like? \n\nWhich levels were the boring ones? \n\nAnyway i really appreciate such reviews.\n"}],"cursor":"AoJw97nZ+/UCd/WSsAI="}
