    review: "At this moment I have played the game for 6 hours, before the two hours\
      \ struck, I have to admit I was in doubt if I should keep the game, or refund\
      \ it. I have decided to keep it, and I have decided to recommend the game. But\
      \ with some reservations.\n\nThe game is played on a single map (divided by\
      \ portals which you can freely move between). It is a pretty hardcore game,\
      \ in which you can lose everything and can be forced to reset. In many ways\
      \ making this a survival game. In this game you will be able to meet hundreds\
      \ or even thousands of other players all trying to expend their empire.\n\n\
      This is personally something I love, no instance based RTS, but one massive\
      \ world. Everyone connected to each other. For that reason alone, this game\
      \ gets a massive plus, as there are very few games like this and even less that\
      \ succeeded. It is a genre that needs to be tamed, as a true MMORTS is something\
      \ I have been longing for for years.\n\nThe basics are there and they work.\
      \ The pathfinding is not perfect, but your units do get from A to B. Building\
      \ works correctly and your resource gathers work as they should. \n\nThere is\
      \ however not much beyond this point. The amount of buildings, resources and\
      \ troops is limited. When it comes to war, generally the player that is online\
      \ the most wins, as he can gather more resources. The developers have mentioned\
      \ that more resources are on the way and hopefully more unit and building variaty\
      \ will be added as well.\n\nThe game is also lacking a real objective, as there\
      \ is no way to 'win' the game. This might not be seen as a negative for everyone\
      \ however, as some prefer the sandbox gametype."
