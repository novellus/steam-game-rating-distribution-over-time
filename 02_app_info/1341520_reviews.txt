In particular Necrophage origin requires a ton of trial and error before you get the right traits/government/whatever to make it work. I had to restart several games, which is annoying when you have a limited amount of time to play a game. For example, Necrophage works best if you have slavery, but you can't enable slavery if you don't have the proper traits and it's not enabled by default. Moreover, you can't even use Necrophage purge without the right type of traits, which again are not enabled. This means that if you're not extra careful, you will discover that you can't use the Necrophage origin in a reasonable way, but you're forced to go down the slow path. If you want to assimilate other civs in a reasonable amount of time, you need to sacrifice several traits just to be able to use the Necrophage origin.\n\nIn my opinion Necrophage needs to be a thing on its own and not depend on slavery/traits/whatever, I've never heard of a \"nice, law abiding, cool people\" undead decaying civilization that requires to assimilate other species to survive where everything is about death. The way it's implemented now in the base game looks a bit shoe horned to make it just work.\n\nAnyway, the concept and the possibilities it opens are funny enough, but I hope they will fix the Necrophage origin and make it its own thing, independent from other game mechanics that do not fit at all.","timestamp_created":1609912661,"timestamp_updated":1609912661,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wLaR6/YCfNP1wAI="}
