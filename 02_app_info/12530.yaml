    review: "This is a long review for those who want to know all details of the game.\
      \ Long story short, this is a very nostalgic open world classic where you can\
      \ basically do whatever you want. You can hunt 8 different areas, all ranging\
      \ around the world, and HU2010 even adds a few more. You can hunt the Southern\
      \ Rockies: a hidden gem brimming with versatility, accommodating noob and seasoned\
      \ hunters alike. The South Central Plains: where hunters wither under the sun\
      \ every year in pursuit of game ranging from antelope to bison. The Central\
      \ Rockies: a rugged hunter's paradise blessed with gorgeous vistas and mighty\
      \ trophy elk. The Southwest: where unforgiving cactus-covered valleys and ponderosa\
      \ highlands molded America's most elusive big game. The Upper Midwest: a highly\
      \ sought after hunting ground where world class bucks roam these impenetrable\
      \ forests and sprawling farmlands. The Pacific Northwest: another beginner hotspot\
      \ for those seeking some of North America's finest trophy game among luxuriant\
      \ temperate rainforests. The Northern Rockies: a forlorn, cruel wilderness renowned\
      \ for its untreaded peaks and untouched animal populations. And finally, Africa:\
      \ a vast, scorched land with more trophy hunters than animals, all searching\
      \ for exotic wonders like the portly kudu, cunning lion, and the colossal elephant.\
      \ \nYou can hunt 16 animals ranging from Wild Turkey to Elephants, all hyper-sensitive\
      \ to your noises and movements in each unique world. Just remember, while some\
      \ animals pose no danger and can be hunted safely, others may turn in the blink\
      \ of an eye and take YOUR life to protect theirs. \nYou are also provided with\
      \ a wide variety of weapons to choose from to go on your trips. Remember, choose\
      \ the right caliber that suits you and the animal for ethical hunting, the weapon\
      \ you use is up to you. The weapons range in various types: including bows,\
      \ handguns, rifles, and shotguns- all with unique ballistics, calibers, and\
      \ bullet weight (this game does a surprisingly great job with ballistics).\n\
      The render distance is incredible. If you stand on a mountain, you can basically\
      \ see every animal on the map. I've shot animals from 2,000 yards away in this\
      \ game. To shoot long distances, you need to zero your rifle to the desired\
      \ distance, which can be practiced at the shooting range. Hunting Unlimited\
      \ is a paradise for extreme sharpshooters.\nThis game has a lot of content.\
      \ The game gives you more than enough equipment to hunt each species; decoys,\
      \ scent sprays, portable blinds and stands, you name it. For deer alone, you\
      \ get like 5 different types of lures. As mentioned before, there is also a\
      \ heap of weapons and weapon types, and every map is rather large. This game\
      \ has infinite replayability. The next game in the series, HU2010, has even\
      \ more content.\nAnimal AI is very good, they're almost as smart as they are\
      \ in real life; sometimes even smarter. In most games, animals will pretend\
      \ to not notice you sprinting 200 yards away, upwind, wearing bright pink clothes.\
      \ In this game, I've spooked antelope from 400. This makes the game quite challenging,\
      \ but it feels very rewarding to kill something with a bow.\n\nBut now, we unfortunately\
      \ have to go with the flaws.\nFirst off, the repetitive, yet annoying walking\
      \ sound is just terrible, just ignore that. What's worse is the painfully slow\
      \ walking speed that does not resemble anything close to a human's average walking\
      \ speed-- a crab could go faster. The horse, a four-legged 8 foot long animal,\
      \ seems like it actually walks SLOWER than your character. You can only run\
      \ with it, but that obviously scares away close animals you can't see (as mentioned\
      \ before, animal AI is superb).\nPhysics are a bit wonky-- unsurprisingly for\
      \ an old game. With vehicles you can't go too fast or you'll fly all over the\
      \ place and die. When you take down an animal with your weapon(s), the animal\
      \ just stops abruptly and falls over on it's side with a basic animation. There\
      \ really isn't any ragdoll or variation in animations.\nQuite important: there\
      \ is an error that has persisted for Windows users where customers reported\
      \ that after a certain amount of hours they were unable to start the game ever\
      \ again. This happened to me after about 17 hours gameplay, so beware before\
      \ purchasing on Steam. This is a very old game, so don't expect it to be fixed.\
      \ However, I have HU2010 which is better than this version, so it's not a problem\
      \ anymore.\nThe graphics are terrible. Deer Hunt 5 from 2001 had more natural\
      \ graphics, and that's hard to achieve. The colors are often too vibrant, so\
      \ it kind of looks like play-doh.\nRemember how I said animal AI is superb?\
      \ There is one area it's not: lures. Unless you're within 75 yards of an animal,\
      \ most lures except decoys and bait are basically useless, and by that point\
      \ you don't really need lures anymore unless you're going for a bow shot. This\
      \ means to get a bow shot on game like elk that have no decoys, you need to\
      \ either A). crawl in front of the herd without spooking it, hoping they don't\
      \ change direction (if walking is so slow, you can imagine how slow crawling\
      \ is) or B). get lucky and have a herd walk close enough for you to call them\
      \ in. Option A is extremely painful unless you're a really dedicated hunter\
      \ who loves the challenge. I once snuck up to a 236 scoring moose (for those\
      \ who don't know, that's REALLY good) for 1 real life hour before I even came\
      \ within calling distance of it. Not to mention, it was walking toward me half\
      \ the time.\n\nBut I don't think that will stop me from recommending this game,\
      \ this is an awesome game. I recommend it for people like me who just want to\
      \ have fun, the game is very light-hearted and has tons of playability, but\
      \ I DON'T recommend it for die-hard hunters looking for an entirely realistic\
      \ hunting simulator. If you're looking for a hyper-realistic hunting experience,\
      \ I recommend both theHunter games, or even some older classics like Deer Hunter\
      \ 5 or Trophy Hunter 2003. If anything, I highly suggest you buy Hunting Unlimited\
      \ 2010 over this because it's almost the same game with even more content. However,\
      \ I purchased the game for the heavy nostalgic value it carries, and had tons\
      \ of fun playing it, even if my fun was short-lived. Despite its flaws, this\
      \ game is a blast."
