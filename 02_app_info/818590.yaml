    about_the_game: Nano Nebula is a relaxing game about discovering new creatures
      and environments while you travel between procedurally generated tiny-planets.
      You play as an astronaut in a deep-space mission, sent to colonize the galaxy.
      But upon waking from cryosleep, you find your crew is missing and humanity has
      almost vanished. Find out what happened - and save your crew - as you explore
      an endless galaxy. If you're looking to discover new creatures, explore unique
      environments, solve ancient puzzles, or battle formidable foes, this is the
      game for you!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/818590/extras/Features_New.png?t=1541185434"
      /><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> <i><u>Explore.</u></i><br>Procedurally generated
      planets to explore in VR. Every world is unique, but not random or messy. Adventure
      in grassy fields, scorching deserts, boreal forests, vast oceans, poisonous
      swamps, frozen wilderness, and dangerous volcanic planets.<br></li><li> <i><u>Battle.</u></i><br>Engage
      in combat against a wide variety of alien life. Giant space-squids, sand worms,
      elemental dragons, ancient weaponry, golems, slimes, ancient sages, phantoms
      and more await you.<br></li><li> <i><u>Discover.</u></i><br>Record your discoveries
      using the &quot;Discovery Camera.&quot; Take pictures of every new creature,
      item, and location you find to log it in your Discovery Log.<br></li><li> <i><u>Upgrade.</u></i><br>Upgrade
      your ship and your gear. Find specialized space-suits to increase your resistance
      to certain elements. Build technology like teleporters and fuel-extractors to
      improve your mobility.<br></li><li> <i><u>Zero-Gravity.</u></i><br>Zero-gravity
      gameplay. Propel yourself through the vacuum of space in order to loot old spaceships,
      mine resources on asteroids, and attack alien nests in zero-gravity.<br></li><li>
      <i><u>Locomotion.</u></i><br>Free (touchpad/joystick) locomotion, with a variety
      of comfort options. Teleportation is not available, but comfort options are
      very helpful if you are prone to motion sickness. Comfort options include a
      floor grid, a spherical grid around the playspace, and a marker for the room
      center. Each can be configured to appear constantly, or dynamically based on
      the movement circumstance.<br></li><li> <i><u>Save Files.</u></i><br>Up to four
      save files. If you share a VR headset with family or friends, they can play
      on their own save file.<br></li><li> <i><u>Music.</u></i><br>A large and high-quality
      soundtrack by Antti Luode. Enjoy over 45 tracks as you explore and battle.</li></ul>

    review: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU USE THE KNUCKLES (Index) CONTROLLERS. You
      will be unable to move or control yourself at all past the tutorial. It might
      actually be a really fun game, and I will remove the negative review once this
      is fixed, but until then, "Pretty Okay Games" should get a rename to "Non-Functional
      Games." PLEASE FIX
