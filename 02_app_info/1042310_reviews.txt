I get the ride in the car at the beginning and then it repeats over and over again. The one time I was able to get out of the car...the game crashed on me.\n\nTrying to escape the game is not fun, either.\n\nIt may not seem fair to give a negative rating to a game I have only 9 minutes of playtime in, but I also didn't think it was fair that I couldn't get a refund on it because it sat in my folder, unplayed, for a few weeks. It's not like I spent a lot of money on it. \nIt's not going to remain in my games folder.","timestamp_created":1608850748,"timestamp_updated":1608850748,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpsa+y/YCfZzzvAI="}
