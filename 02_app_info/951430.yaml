      /><br>10 years after the initial outbreak of the zombie apocalypse, the members
      of Jack's camp fled to Freedom City, where a cure for the zombie plague was
      developed. But the news brings more suffering than relief. New factions have
      sprung up in the region, in constant battle for dominance. The merciless Military,
      the shady Smugglers and the Independents made up primarily of civilians.<br><br>When
      an Independents' refugee camp was overrun by an undead horde, the few survivors
      struggle for food and valuable resources in an unforgiving world, always looking
      over their shoulder for gangs of looters and the flesh-eating dead.<br><br><br><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/951430/extras/dead_age_2_description_02_EN_JAN2020.png?t=1609840084"
      /><br>While the big advantage of Dead Age's turn-based combat system versus
      tactics-based games is faster progression, the mechanics have evolved.<br><br>A
      character can now bring up to 24 skills to the battle. Change up your tactics
      mid-fight to instantly gain the advantage over zombies and hostile survivors.
      Place front-row combatants to protect ranged-combat allies from attackers, and
      deploy turrets, hunting dogs and tigers, as well as an array of new weapons.<br><br><br><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/951430/extras/dead_age_2_description_03_EN_JAN2020.png?t=1609840084"
      /><br>Visit the outposts of other factions to trade and take on missions and
      improve your standing with them. Improving relations with the region's greater
      factions unlocks better equipment and plot devices. A negative reputation can
      lead to confrontation or even a bounty.<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/951430/extras/dead_age_2_description_04_EN_JAN2020.png?t=1609840084"
      /><br>Your 3D base is your central hub of operations. Here, you assign crafting
      or building jobs to survivors, build and upgrade stations to improve defense
      and quality of life and unlock improved craftable items and higher yield of
      resources.<br><br>The new open game-world offers free exploration of the world
      map with over 80 detailed graphically depicted locations. Beside nature scenes,
      <strong>Dead Age 2</strong> features new indoor locations like hospitals, bunkers,
      schools, malls and army supply stores.<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/951430/extras/dead_age_2_description_05_EN_JAN2020.png?t=1609840084"
      /><br>Decisions you make while playing can have significant effects on the progression
      of the story involving the three survivor factions, romanceable characters,
      and bring you closer to one of the game's six endings!<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/951430/extras/dead_age_2_description_06_EN_JAN2020.png?t=1609840084"
      /><br>Like its predecessor, <strong>Dead Age 2</strong> features random events
      on the map resulting in a variety of consequences, but this time those events
      are depicted fully in 3D. Survival RPGs are especially dangerous. 3 difficulty
      levels and permadeath may result at any time in losing an ally for good. If
      your main character falls victim to the apocalypse you are forced to begin a
      new playthrough, for which you can purchase upgrades and advantages unlocked
      in previous runs.<br><br>Gain enough standing with the factions and you may
      purchase things like upgraded faction equipment for newly-created characters,
      as well as unlock unique endings. This gives <strong>Dead Age 2</strong> high
      replayability!

    review: 'I loved DA1, it was great. This I''m not a fan of... I mean everything
      looks great and kinda similar on paper... but then you play and its just obnoxious.


      First off... worst tutorial ever! Would not shut up... would not stop forcing
      me to make it''s decision... got so pissed I stopped playing for like an hour
      and restarted. Second... there is like no ammunition to be found anywhere...
      it gets beyond annoying. Kill players that are shooting you, loot, no guns,
      no ammo. WTF? DA1 didn''t have this problem... not nearly to the degree its
      in DA2. Yeah, yeah I get it... we can''t get 300 assault rifles 1 hour in...
      but there is like complete zero correlation between what is shooting you and
      what you get for killing them. Especially when everyone with a gun seems to
      do more damage then you do with the same firearm... it gets really annoying.


      Other frustrations include, zero camera controls, cannot zoom or scroll the
      base, expanding crafting (which you think would be a good thing... until you
      realize now there is a billion ingredients too, many which are only useful for
      1 thing... and in perpetual short supply.), story sucks, characters are lifeless,
      (seriously who the hell is going to write you a  freakin letter if they just
      robbed you and changed sides??)... the entire game feels like a bad effort of
      "more is better, so we''ll just do more of everything"


      I mean I want to like the game so much... but its changed so much from the original
      its hard to recognize the two together. It doesn''t feel finished, polished,
      or well thought out. Just more of everything... that will make everyone happy....
