    review: 'Much like my review of Way of the Wang DLC, more game, more toys, more
      perks, MORE WANG!


      A nice side game distraction, also good for zillyen as well as exp. Weapons
      and Perks are a nice bonus too.

      Free DLC is a dying breed. GOOD DLC is not far behind. GOOD AND FREE DLC is
      endangered. This is a breath of fresh air, as long as you don''t mind the smell
      of four roses bourbon.


      Who wants some WANG!?'
