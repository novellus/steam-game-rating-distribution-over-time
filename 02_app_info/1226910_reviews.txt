That's the entirety of the game. If you were expecting any amount of eroticism or sexual content, there is absolutely none in this game.\n\nDo yourself a favor and just lose repeatedly at the mini-games. \"Confidence\" isn't measured by how well you play a mini-game, but by how many times you play the mini-game. Most of the mini-games are far from enjoyable, so losing intentionally is the best way to go about earning \"confidence.\" Luckily for you, the achievement for getting max confidence with all the girls triggers even if you have maybe half of the girls' confidence, so easy pickings there!\n\nAs for the mini-games themselves, they're incredibly boring and the opposite of fun. Rock, paper, scissors is a mini-game but you're able to cheat by seeing what they choose at the last second. There's a bean-catching mini-game where your beans can glitch through your frying pan. There's a memory game. There's a pong game. There's flappy bird. Honestly none of them are remotely visually appealing, appealing in terms of gameplay, or just in general worth your time playing.\n\nI don't care about how the models look, but all of the male ones are strange. Sometimes their faces glitch out and some of them against the wall are completely cross-eyed for some reason. If you're hoping to get the Hidden Achievement, it's to talk to one of the males that is wearing a fedora, which is a small chance to find him as he spawns randomly in place of another NPC.\n\nThe biggest time sink in this \"game\" by far is the Collector achievement where you find 20 panties scattered across the map. The problem is, there is a very very small chance for the panties to actually spawn and over the course of 5+ hours running from the club to the lobby to the beach (do it at night if you're going to try, it's easier to spot them), I found 8. Less than half of what you need for the achievement. This achievement could have been done so much better by scattering them in less obvious locations or making it so you earn them for each girl you bring to your room or whatever but the way that it was implemented is so nonsensical and pointless.\n\nI have spent more than enough time playing this game to know that even if the game were completely free, it still wouldn't be worth it. There is barely even an attempt at making a game here, it's just some slapped-on assets with some thoughtless mini-games slapped onto it with some \"secrets\" that are completely random and could take upwards of literal days to actually get. Skip this title. Hell, ignore this title.","timestamp_created":1608782811,"timestamp_updated":1608782811,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ497G7yfYCf7fVvAI="}
