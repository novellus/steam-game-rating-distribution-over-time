    review: 'The game''s atmosphere is by far it''s strong suit. I find it chilling
      and comforting which is a strange but very welcome blend.

      The story, especially as it pertains to the side story happening around you,
      is touching. To spend most of the game in bleakness, with bleakness happening
      to others around you, makes the final story beat most touching. To be specific,
      the fact that one man''s petty selfishness hurt the potential love story someone
      was cultivating, while at the end we see what a true love story can feel like
      is the perfect contrast. Don''t just blow through the game as you''re quite
      able to do, do the side things and take your time to get the full contrasting
      exposure.


      It was really cool to see the developer consider colorblindness so much since
      it was so key to the game, it wasn''t hidden away in a menu, it was part of
      starting the game.


      I came across only one bug, but I worked around it in 30 seconds. In addition
      I got stuck on day 2 because it wasn''t clear to me what to do, until I realized
      I was missing the obvious game developer''s hint of pay attention to the only
      movement on your screen (the birds).
