    about_the_game: '<strong>Frantic Freighter is a rather simple game with a simple
      premise: get some cargo from planet A to planet B.</strong> However, staying
      alive &amp; reaching your destination isn''t easy!<br><br>Every time you use
      your warp drive, an important system will likely break down. Hopefully, you''ll
      have a part to fix it! Friendly planets, stations &amp; ships may have spare
      parts for you, or information on nearby points of interest. Pirates will try
      to chase you down for your cargo, so hopefully your cloaking &amp; shields systems
      are available when needed!<br><br>Successfully deliver your package to unlock
      random special challenge modes!<br><br>* Frantic Freighter is best enjoyed in
      virtual reality with tracked controllers. However, it can fully be played without
      a virtual reality headset. There is no game menu &amp; the game will immediately
      start (and restart as needed), with or without VR equipment. Press the Escape

    review: ' This is how this game goes:

      Warp wrong direction

      Warp right direction (maybe)

      Get attacked

      Warp

      Shields break

      Fix shields

      Warp

      Map broke and attacked

      Map fixed

      This continues until either you get blown up or run out of spare parts.'
