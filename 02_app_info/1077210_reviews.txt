Not bad though! \n\nThe premise for this spoopish game seems alright. It's sort of like a hide and seek sort of game which can be pretty intense. However, I am terrible at hide and seek games. \n\nI still give this a thumbs up because it ran well, the graphics were alright, and aside from personal preference I couldn't find anything wrong. \n\nGive this a whirl if you like games where you need to run and hide a lot.","timestamp_created":1604063402,"timestamp_updated":1604063402,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593094944953918457","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgaPovPUCcZiHqwI="}
