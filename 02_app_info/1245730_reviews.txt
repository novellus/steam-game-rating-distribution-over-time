I love the simple, yet entertaining graphics and the music is super catchy.  The sound effects of the cat noises crack me up!  Even the subtle, dry yet witty dialogue adds to the games charm.  It is evident that this game had lots of heart and soul put into it!  If you like cats (or even if you don't) do yourself a favor and buy this game.","timestamp_created":1582917991,"timestamp_updated":1582917991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.449438214302062988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pffQxvACdKCQ9QE="}
