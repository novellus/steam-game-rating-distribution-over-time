The music is very intense, and blends fast-paced electronic drums with some ambient synths as well as some retro synth bass. It feels like it's from the 80's, but also it feels very modern too. I think the composer did a great job and really hit the mark with the musical direction. It's perfect post-apocalyptic robot killing music. The way the music works in-game is really cool too. It sounds like it adds layers of intensity as you progress through the levels. It's really well done. The soundtrack is a great companion to the game, and vice versa. They are both high quality products that reflect the high level of care that the team put into them. Worth picking up if you are a fan of this kind of stuff.","timestamp_created":1412527197,"timestamp_updated":1412527197,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.699107527732849121","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tNHL8MgCf4WcLw=="}
