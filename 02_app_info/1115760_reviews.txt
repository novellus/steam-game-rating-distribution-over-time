I am not even pretending to read it any more. The sequences are usually interrupted by a fight scene or two, but they take 2-3 minutes maybe. The rest of the time I'm mindlessly hitting Enter to get thru it so I can save and quit.\n\nI'm going to leave it a positive review because when you can actually play the game, it's a lot of fun, fairly deep and you can tell a lot of work went in to it. I just don't really have the patience to watch people talk to each other for that long, so I'm most likely done with the game. \n\nEnd Edit\n--------\n\nEdit 2:\n\nWell, I got really bored and powered through all of the dialog to get to chapter 18. I now apparently [spoiler] own a house, a farm, and a... Hooters? There's a Playboy Bunny running around and bandits in my pumpkin patch[/spoiler] and... maybe I should have read more of the dialog?\n\nEnd Edit\n--------\n\nI've played this about 5 hours now, and it's a mixed bag. I still find it fun, but I'm not quite sure why. \n\nThe basic idea seems to be:\n\n1. Watch an extended cut-scene, where you make no decisions that I've seen yet. There may be a fight in there somewhere.\n2. You are suddenly back in town and able to roam around, do a side quest or two, shop or craft. The side quests will have you go to an area outside of town and kill/collect X.\n3. When you are done with that, talk to your mentor that is standing around waiting on you, and goto 1.\n\nThe combat is real-time with pause. I only have one companion so far and I can't seem to control her. Maybe I'm missing something because the store page says you can switch between party members. I'm playing on normal and have not even come close to dying yet. I have drank a potion when I got to half health a couple of times.\n\nFighting is pretty much clicking an enemy over and over, and maybe occasionally hitting 1-6 to do a special move. There is not a whole lot of strategy to it. It would be nice if you could click an enemy and it would keep attacking. The constant clicking prevents me from playing more than an hour or so at a time. Even holding down left mouse to keep attacking would be better. (Edit: It does have auto-attack, but you can attack much faster by manually clicking. This makes the auto-attack not very useful.)\n\nThe crafting seems fairly extensive but I've not gotten too deep in to it yet. I did make a few items and they took 4 materials, with each material affecting the stats of the item. At level 5 I have several dozen different materials to choose from in my inventory.\n\nThe story is...well, I kind of quit paying attention to the story after the first hour. I do read all the text but it barely registers. The dialog is painfully awkward and/or badly translated. The characters have annoying habits (e.g. saying \"Hohoho\" at the start of every sentence), everyone seems to be constantly telling others to \"shut up!\" and I just recently met a bad guy referred to as the \"double-headed stupid guy\". He may or may not have a proper name. I wasn't paying attention.\n\nOverall, it is still somewhat entertaining. I think $25 is probably too much, but it appears to have many hours of grindy-crafty goodness, if that is your thing.","timestamp_created":1565020670,"timestamp_updated":1568037764,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.664527237415313721","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1565030953,"developer_response":"hi, thank you for your review.\n\n\"Fighting is pretty much clicking an enemy over and over, and maybe occasionally hitting 1-6 to do a special move.
