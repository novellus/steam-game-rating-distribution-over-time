    review: 'Leaf is a fun and interesting title, the combat is weird but I''ll give
      you the run down. You focus on an enemy by pressing F, once engaged with an
      enemy do left click for two hit light attack and right click for a single heavy
      attack, numbers are for magic spells if you got them. space to dodge, you have
      to dodge an enemy''s attack then attack but they can dodge too. Unfortunately
      its only a robot design but modified into different enemies and NPCs and there
      arent that many npcs to talk to for hints. But the music is swell and if we
      could get some more enemy types besides robot with attack and robot with projectile,
      etc.


      The low-poly style makes me feel like its a mix between lttp and oot. But that
      might just be due to see other games like it, also there are places you might
      get softlocked and if you try to quit your save then reload you''ll just end
      up in the same softlocked position meaning you will have to delete your save.


      Plot is very vague and doesn''t give you all the necessary steps to go to your
      objective which is the Tesseract in the temple. Plus the mystery alphabet language
      makes this even harder with no place to find where this alphabet system is early
      on, players will just stumble about.


      If these were to be added and fixed the softlocks, etc. I''m certain the game
      could possibly be a lot popular + better, just my opinion.'
