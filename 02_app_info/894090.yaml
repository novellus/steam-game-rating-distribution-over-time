      \ Gold Run \u2013 is a game where you have to find a way out of a giant Maze.\
      \ Gameplay evolves from a game of slow exploration in the darkness to super-fast\
      \ races in serpentine corridors. This is a game is for hardcore players who\
      \ are not afraid of difficulties.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Maze is huge. Time\
      \ is ticking. Death is inevitable.</h2><br>The Maze is draining life strength\
      \ out of travelers. That is why in order to have enough time to get to the end\
      \ it is not enough just to explore the maze and to find the right way. You also\
      \ need to use gold, found in the maze, to increase key skills of the character:\
      \ speed and light radius.<br><br>To improve the character skills, you need to\
      \ come back to the Maze entrance. If the character\u2019s health drops down\
      \ to zero your character dies. Bones and found gold mark the spot where your\
      \ character dies.<br><br>In addition to mentioned above, you will use magic\
      \ shining sand marking your path and health improving phials that you find in\
      \ the maze (you will have to remember where they are placed, as you won\u2019\
      t stand a chance without them).<br><br>Notes found in the furthest corners of\
      \ the maze will tell the curious short stories from the maze\u2019s universe.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">FAQ</h2><strong>Q: What is the duration of the game?</strong><br>A:\
      \ Duration of the game (without taking the time to find all story notes) is\
      \ about 5 hours.<br><br><strong>Q: Is it possible to get to the end of the Maze?</strong><br>A:\
      \ Yes.<br><br><strong>Q: Is it possible to lose a game?</strong><br>A: Yes,\
      \ if you thoughtlessly rush forward.<br><br><strong>Q: Who is this game for?</strong><br>A:\
      \ This game is for hardcore players who are not afraid of difficulties. The\
      \ game is a real test of the player\u2019s speed and memory. We recommend using\
      \ a keyboard for the game.<br><br>Q: How large is the Maze?<br>A: It is very\
      \ large. We believe that this is one of the largest mazes presented in computer\
      \ games."
