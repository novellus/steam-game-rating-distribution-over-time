The game itself is fun to play, but Egosoft needs their knuckles rapped for the pathetic story line (if you can even call it that).  One should expect to see continuity between XBTF and X:Tension, but X:tension simply doesn't provide it.  Hey, remember me? I'm  Kyle Brennan, the Hero of Argon and loved by all of the races for my part in the Xenon War. So then why does no one even know me now, plus the Split and Piranad are downright hostile? I was in a sector called Brennan's Triumph, and the Split told me to sod off. What happened to my trading empire and my million plus credits I usually carried with me?  Egosoft no doubt spent quite a bit of money developing that video with the kid telling us about Captain Brennan. Unfortunately, the video does nothing to explain what happened to Brennan's mines and fabs, or why the prices of almost everything have skyrocketed. Would it have been so hard to find a reason?  Of course not. I took a few minutes and came up with this:   After the Xenon's mother ship was destroyed, Ban Danna gave Brennan those fantastic 125mw shields, which he promptly used to wipe out the Xenon ships and bases in all of their sectors. In retaliation, the Xenon staged a major attack that destroyed all of Brennan's possessions and caused prices to skyrocket among all of the races. The Xenon also put a large bounty on Brennan's life, causing Ban Danna to advise him to go incognito for a while. Danna gave him an Argon buster and a few thousand credits to start out on his own. (Brennan couldn't draw on his own account, since that would reveal where he was.)  And then the game could proceed as it does, but at least there would be a reason for Brennan's sudden poverty and unpopularity. Surely their professional writers could have done even better. Having said that, I do like the way the game is put together and recommend it for many hours of fun.  Still, Egosoft really dropped the ball when it came to setting the stage for Brennan's new adventures.","timestamp_created":1605181316,"timestamp_updated":1605181316,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuuOQ3vUCdI/1rQI="}
