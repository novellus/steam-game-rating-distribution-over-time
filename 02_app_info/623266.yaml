      \ Route into a new period of Chessie Systems.<br><br>At a time when US locomotive\

      \ EMD GP30 was considered one of the first so-called \u2018second generation\u2019\
      \ diesel locomotives produced by the company. General Electric had already stolen\
      \ the march on 2,500hp locomotives with its U25B, and although the GP20 was\
      \ only rated at 2,250hp, EMD traded on its reputation to sell units to US railroads.<br><br>In\
      \ total, 948 models were built between July 1961 and November 1963 for railroads\
      \ in the US and Canada, including 40 cabless B units for the Union Pacific Railroad.\
      \ Some elements of the earlier GP20 were carried across, although the GP30\u2019\
      s trademark \u2018hump\u2019 and cab roof profile made it stand out from other\
      \ similar diesel locomotives.<br><br>A number of GP30s remain in service today\
      \ in their original or rebuilt form, with 17 models currently preserved, some\
      \ still in operational condition. Add the Chessie Systems livery to your collection\
