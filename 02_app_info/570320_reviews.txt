Importing Spriter Pro characters and animations into the engine requires a plugin made by third party which is far from perfect (although, it works).\n\nThere are free assets out there on the Unity Store and other sites that offer similar quality and are ready to be used in games without having to waste time, which is the reason why you buy this kind of assets in first place.\n\nI would skip the environmental DLCs.","timestamp_created":1576277127,"timestamp_updated":1576277127,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49YXcgO8Ce7yM5AE="}
