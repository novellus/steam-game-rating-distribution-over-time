It is bit difficult to understand why such mistakes must happen, but I guess it is human nature to be blind, overconfident and fail.\n\nThis game, on side, is a dream come true for all match-3-type games players. All the freedom you ever wanted is here and it is done with good programming and nice graphics. You can move tiles and create whatever shapes and big combinations and then with complete freedom choose when to \"pulse\" them away. But at the same time the freedom, given from beginning, is even killing the game. There is fun in being limited and having to fight something. I was even lost my first game, not knowing what to do. No no no, the tutorial IS there and teaches you what is different about the game. Perfect, simple, easily understandable. But it forgot to tell or emphasize, that the goal is to fill the scale in the bottom of the screen. Ans since the beginning levels are so easy, so I was even thinking what the hell is the goal I am to fulfill here! I didn't see where it tells the task and how much of what to shoot off to succeed.\n\nI can't mourn enough for the loss that happened with this game - the programming is clear and the game is very quick, perfectly working! The graphics are nice, the author did understand that attractive colors and pictures are key for succesful match-3 type game. Or he didn't undestand that nad was just lucky to choose such graphics, because it is very hard to understand that someone would know that graphics are important and not know that music is as well! What the hell who is this weirdo to put in the game so negative disharmonical and stressing music!!? Yes, sure, you can switch off th music and play some your favourite music on computer in background. But that still doesn't excuse the mistake and there comes another mistake: The hell why this game lacks the option to switch off only music and leave sounds??! With switching off music you switch off the sounds too! And to play without sound completely feels like to walk and not feel your feet stepping on floor! So with sound on or off, both options feel bad. Also the background pictures are nice, but they are too quickly switching so that you cannot really enjoy them. The game is or can be peaceful and has even zen mode, but the music is so stressing and rushing that it takes away all the peace!! Even the movement is so nicely quick, but it lacks some feeling of the movement, is bit like too easy and not truly comfy, doesn't give you the feel of moving something preset - this detail is hard to describe and I am sure the author if reading doesn't understand what I mean, but the sensitive player surely knows that it doesn't feel so good. There should be some bounce-back, some friction, sound etc. encompanied with it.\n\nThis game is horrible mistake. It could easily be the best match-3 type game but is just another unsuccesful crap thanks to its trivial mistakes. Such a pity! So good and so bad at the same time.\nDear creator, if you are accidently kissed by a muse and understand that you must consult with someone sensitive and understanding, then don't hesitate to contact me so that we can recreate this game into a new and really succesful and fabulous one, one that will touch heart and create addiction, not one that is weird, with wasted efforts and gets lost after release.","timestamp_created":1579642088,"timestamp_updated":1579642088,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpK2A5e8Cepyj7QE="}
