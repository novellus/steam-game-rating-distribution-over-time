    review: "Quite disappointed with the game because the trailer seems interesting\
      \ and I love to play quiz-related games. Unfortunately, this game is not about\
      \ general knowledge. The scope of the questions are quite narrow, mostly focus\
      \ in Big Bang Theory, Gravity Falls and Adventure Time. I feel like being tested\
      \ whether I know what are the developer\u2019s hobbies and interests. I was\
      \ expecting general knowledge questions or broader topics. Even if the game\
      \ supposed to have only geek questions, it should have wider topics than that.\n\
      \nThe game a bit buggy for me. Sometimes, if I answered the quiz question wrongly,\
      \ the game still put my answer is wrong after I restarted the level and my answer\
      \ is correct. And the achievement to disarm 100 bombs (Seasoned Minesweeper)\
      \ doesn\u2019t make sense because there are less than 100 or even 50 levels\
      \ involving bombs. It means you need to play the levels repetitively until the\
      \ achievement gets unlocked."
