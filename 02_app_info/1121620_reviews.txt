The interior and exterior detailing is exquisite, from the worn leather seats and authentic panel, to the chocks and tie-downs. The flight characteristics feel right, although I have not flown one in real life - you can feel the momentum, she accelerates more slowly than the Turbo Arrow, and gets airborne almost grudgingly. However once cleaned up, and having picked up flying speed, she climbs and cruises effortlessly, with the two-axis autopilot relieving some of the pilot's workload if desired. The instruments are generally excellent, and include a fully-functional HSI. The Duchess is certainly harder to master than the Arrow - and so she should be. \n\nThe flaws come in three forms: those that don't bother me, those that do bother me, and one I quite enjoy! The parking brake does not have any noticeable effect, and the engine sound changes in volume with power but not in pitch with RPM. The electric trim switch on the yoke does not work, and you cannot assign elevator trim to a controller knob as this overrides the AP pitch management. However, these minor flaws are unobtrusive and insignificant. \n\nThere are only two flaws that bother me. The first is the autopilot, which is only partially functional, does not operate according to the Century IV POH. Sometimes the AP appears to be in a mode other than that selected by the pilot, even when the annunciator panel shows the selected mode. For example, if you are cruising in altitude hold mode and then select attitude mode and dial in some up- or down-trim to change altitude, then although the aircraft initially trims as desired, it gradually returns to level flight instead of maintaining the attitude commanded, and appears to still be in altitude hold mode even though the annunciator shows \"ATT\". Sometimes the opposite occurs, with the aircraft climbing or descending when set to and indicating altitude hold. The correct annunciator lights do not illuminate during VOR, ILS and glide-slope acquisition, and the AP will not set an intercept course if the CDI/HSI indicates more than half-scale deflection. The REV (reverse localiser) and GA (go-around) modes do not appear to work at all. The other AP functions are usable, but are unreliable and misleading (which would be dangerous if this was a real aircraft).  \n\nThe second flaw that bothers me is that the GPS course cannot be coupled to the AP. You can set up a course in the FS2 Navigation screen, and the GPS will display the required track, and inform you via messages, but I could not find a way to make the AP fly this track automatically. You should be able to do this by pushing the CDI button on the GNS-430 so \"GPS\" is displayed, but this has no effect. Which is strange, since the GNS-430 feeds VOR nav information to the HSI, and the AP can be coupled by selecting NAV mode; and in the Turbo Arrow, the GPS does couple to the AP. These are particularly unfortunate flaws as with a properly functioning AP that could be coupled to the GPS, the Duchess would make a wonderful touring aircraft for longer cross-country flights. \n\nAnd the flaw that I enjoy? The unrealistic cruise speed. This Duchess will cruise at 185 KTAS using the Beechcraft POH recommended cruise power settings (f23.7 In. Hg., 2300 RPM) at 6,000 ft. This is Baron territory - perhaps she's the Turbo Duchess that Beechcraft never built!\n\nIt's a real shame that an aircraft this good is let down by a few of serious flaws that should be easy to fix. I feel as though, with a couple of weeks of extra effort, the Duchess could be perfect. I'll update my review if any of these issues are resolved in future releases. \n\nRecommended, but with reservations, and not for instrument flying.","timestamp_created":1591084182,"timestamp_updated":1592595405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jKuF5/ICe6nciwI="}
