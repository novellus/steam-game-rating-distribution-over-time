    review: "I must say I'm soooo disappointed to see \"Lily of the valley\" is not\
      \ in it... why? :( \n\nAnyway, the whole game's soundtrack is awesome. Of all\
      \ the games I've played, I think this is the one with the best soundtrack (it's\
      \ good AND it perfectly suits the game's atmosphere).\n\nCheers!"
