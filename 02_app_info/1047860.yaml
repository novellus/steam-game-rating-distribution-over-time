      notes: Fighting is a main activity of gameplay, however because of voxel graphics,
        there are no realistic violence, sexual content or blood. Player fights with
        animals, humans, mythological monsters. Fighting with opponents is avaliable  from
        the beggining of the game. Vulgar and obscene language is not present during
        gameplay.

    review: 'the game some decent potential, as of right now, i''m not sure i can
      fully recommend, its fairly easy to cheese the AI by putting a table between
      you and them, so easy in fact, that its really the only viable way to play,
      and honestly pinging bolt/arrow shafts off an immoving AI mob just doesnt seem
      that fun. like i said, its got potential, so keep up with updates, the AI (and
      melee system) may get improved
