One of which being overpowered or god-like characters that are made so artificially strong that it sparks never ending debates amongst fans of whose stronger; like the ever famous goku v.s. Superman flame wars. \n\nThe creators essentially made One-Punch Man kind of an Anti-hero of sorts for their refusal of giving him a long, tedious overplayed tragic or illustrious backstory like Marvel and Capcom does. Instead his backstory is that he did some push ups and never turned on the A/C in his house. Pair that with the fact of that NO MATTER how strong, NO MATTER how powerful, yatta yatta yatta, the bad guy going up against him...will be killed in 1 hit. Every time. End of story. \n\nGoku = 1 punch\nSuperman = 1 punch\nThanos = 1 punch\n\nDefinitely a fresh series worth watching!","timestamp_created":1536043848,"timestamp_updated":1556089243,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ417CJp+oCefL+qQE="}
