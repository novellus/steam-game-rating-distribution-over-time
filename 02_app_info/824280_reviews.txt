Did it turn out to be that way? Well....yes and no. Here's why.\n\n[h1] The Pros [/h1]\n+A nice variety of trucks and tracks to choose from\n+Good handling -- not as great as POD, but still good\n+Improvable truck stats (Speed, Acceleration, Traction, etc)\n+Great Career mode (and even a Career+ mode to boot, if you like things [u] really[/u] challenging)\n+Several fun competitions to choose from\n++Feels more realistic than most other Monster Jam games -- body panels break and fall apart, cars don't explode when hit, \"one-wheel wheelies\" are a thing of the past, and frontflips are much more difficult to pull off, as they should be\n\n[h1] The Cons [/h1]\n-No online multiplayer\n-The AI can be a pain in the neck if you're not careful, especially in Waypoint and Circuit Racing\n-The Truck Customization feature that was POD remains absent here\n-The DLC is mostly just additional paint schemes for trucks that are already in the game; only includes three additional trucks and no new tracks or other additional content besides that\n--This one's a bit of a nitpick but I'm counting it as a huge con anyway because, despite the huge selection of trucks, if i'm correct, [b] this is the first Monster Jam game to not have any independent trucks [/b] (Not even Avenger or Stone Crusher)\n\n[h1] The Verdict [/h1]\n\nOverall, Monster Jam Steel Titans could've been better, but it also could've been much worse. It's a huge improvement over other recent Monster Jam games such as the ones listed above, and gave me some POD vibes as I played. Would I recommend it? Unless you're quite a big Monster Jam fan, I would wait for a sale. I also would not recommend buying this if your PC can't handle high-quality games very well. Otherwise, expect to be on loading screens for 15+ minutes (you can lower the quality but it'll look like a PS2 game). And if you're looking for complete realism and nothing more, I'd recommend getting Beamng.drive instead and getting the CRD mod on beam-monsters.com, because that's as close to the real deal as you'll get. Otherwise, enjoy the action and destruction you can make in this game with peace of mind knowing that your truck won't handle like garbage.\n\nRating - 7.5/10","timestamp_created":1609389779,"timestamp_updated":1609612422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt42Y4vYCfI6AvwI="}
