    review: A repeatable, endurance-style mission versus Dark Eldar that's great for
      farming relic gear. $3 remains a little pricy for what amounts to a fairly normal
      mission, but the rewards are actually good and you can play this more than once
      per character, so this one is recommended, especially if you buy it with in-game
      currency or in the complete pack.
