Very fast little plane. graphics are nice. not my fav paint job, but it has an awesome interior. The IFR panel  view dosent seem to be there.... but there is a really interesting back seat view. For me the auto-pilot will not hold. it will turn on and off but will not follow heading, hold altitude or aattitude. ill have to mess with it some more\n\nNose wheel thing: the plane in real life uses a \"castering\" nose wheel to make the plane lighter and less complicated a number of other small general aviation aircraft use this including the grumman tiger. it is standard practice to steer with differential brakes. (one break per side) this way you just brake in the direction you need to turn. all airplanes use this already and is usually used when an extra sharp turn is needed. So with that in mind, I think this is a cool DLC plane\n-NAS ( Pilot in training)","timestamp_created":1591213813,"timestamp_updated":1591213813,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40P3uvfICddn/iwI="}
