    review: "MARCELLA MOON \u2013 SECRET ON THE HILL\nOsanna Vaughn, mother of Bjorn\
      \ the Hammer\n\nFor a newcomer to video games, Marcella Moon and the Secret\
      \ on the Hill was the perfect\nintroduction to a fun world of adventure, riddles\
      \ and puzzles, while offering engaging\ninformation about Irish myths and legends.\n\
      \nAuthor Amelia Goldstone has disappeared while researching local myths and\
      \ legends in\nSligo, Ireland; and amateur sleuth, Marcella Moon, is on the case.\
      \ However, when she\ninquires about Amelia, no one seems ready to give her any\
      \ straight answers. It\u2019s almost as\nif, friendly as they are, they all\
      \ have something to hide. Rumours of a legendary pirate\ntreasure could hold\
      \ the key. Had Goldstone discovered too much?\n\nStep by step, Marcella discovers\
      \ clues, locates artifacts and solves riddles that lead her to\nfiguring out\
      \ the mystery of the Secret on the Hill, but\u2026 does she find Amelia alive?\
      \ You\u2019ll\nneed to play the game to find out."
