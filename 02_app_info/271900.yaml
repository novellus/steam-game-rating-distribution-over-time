    review: Hexcells Plus is the logical follow-up to the first Hexcells.  I had a
      blast with the first one.  I could finish this simpler game in a little over
      12 hours for the three sets of problems.  The new Hexcells Plus is more challenging.  Its
      complexity level has gone up and it shows!  It took me the double of that time
      to finish only the first set of problems.  I am looking forward to attack the
      two other sets.  My only complaint with the first one had been that I would
      have wanted more problems!  This new game does not provide you with more problem
      sets, but it certainly provides you with an added complexity that makes for
      a good challenge!  This is a stress free game that provides you with much needed
      brain twisting. It will save the problem set you are solving every time you
      want to exit, allowing you to finish at a later time.  Definitely recommended,
      you cannot go wrong with this one!
