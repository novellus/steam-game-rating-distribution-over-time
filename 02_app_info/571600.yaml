    about_the_game: HACKSAW RIDGE is the extraordinary true story of Desmond Doss
      (Andrew Garfield) who, in Okinawa during the bloodiest battle of WWII, saved
      75 men without firing or carrying a gun. He was the only American soldier in
      WWII to fight on the front lines without a weapon, as he believed that while
      the war was justified, killing was nevertheless wrong. As an army medic, he
      single-handedly evacuated the wounded from behind enemy lines, braved fire while
      tending to soldiers, was wounded by a grenade, and hit by snipers. Doss was
      the first conscientious objector to ever earn the Congressional Medal of Honor.

    review: That was amazing. Best movie I have seen yet. I'm so shocked I can't form
      my thoughts into words. If I had to choose one, it would be beautiful. Just
      beautiful.
