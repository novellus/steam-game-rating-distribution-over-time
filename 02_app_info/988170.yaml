    review: "Personally, and speaking of layout,I found the three PDF documents (Art\
      \ Book, Battle Log and Tactical Guide) very poorly done.  As much the same ones\
      \ from Normandy 44 were nicely done, those ones look as if they were never finished\
      \ but sent to the client \"as is\". They look like drafts. \n\nART BOOK \nNot\
      \ so much explanation, a lot of images (nice images though) pitched together,\
      \ no conclusion, no team presentation, no final word, no credits. The book end\
      \ brutally. Shows if it was never finished.\n\nBATTLE LOG \nNot so bad, not\
      \ especially nice, font is really basic, no frills, but the less worth of the\
      \ three in terms of layout. About the content, nothing new, we find the same\
      \ story in the game itself. Advice are no big secret.\n\nTACTICAL GUIDE \nTable\
      \ of content is a mess. All pages are wrong!\nInformation is pitched one after\
      \ the other without proper page break. \nThis guide especially is really awful\
      \ in term of layout. A real draft. I was shocked to receive such product quality.\
      \ We paid the big bucks after all. I feel cheated.\n\nACES\nMore simple, you\
      \ can't! Just a small picture in the card's corner, half hidden with the requisition\
      \ points... no special border. No description in the Art Book as well. Only\
      \ photos without any Ace's name!\n\nI still recommend Steel Division 2, but\
      \ base game only (and not at full price, see [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198059484979/recommended/919640]\
      \ my other review[/url])\nDon't waste your money for this [i]Commander Deluxe\
      \ Pack[/i], [b]it's worth nothing[/b]."
