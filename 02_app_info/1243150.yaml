    review: 'ngl, this game is a pretty fun little expierence. I love 3D platformers,
      so getting this seemed like a no brainer. It is definetly really rough around
      the edges, but it is still worth getting because of how cheap it is. There are
      50 levels included when you buy the game which lasts for about 2 and a half
      hours, and there are tons of levels made by other players online, with only
      more levels coming for each person that has the game.


      Keyboard controls suck though, when you stop pressing the key you keep walking
      until the walking animation finishes looping, which is just pretty disorienting.
      You really need to use a controller with this game, but when you do the controls
      work pretty well.


      This game isn''t amazing by any means, but there is a fun time here, especially
      if you like creating your own levels. For the price, it''s worth getting.


      I hope there are more updates to come in the future, what we already have is
      good, I hope it becomes great with time :3'
