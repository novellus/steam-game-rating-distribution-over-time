    about_the_game: "Do you know what would make every sport better? Playing it in\
      \ a tank! Battle your friends in Volleyball, Soccer, Football, and Basketball\
      \ to see who can be the best! This game can be played locally with a shared\
      \ screen, over the internet, or any combination of the two with up to three\
      \ friends (4 players total). If you just want to get some practice in, you can\
      \ play by yourself against the CPU. For the best experience, plug in an Xbox\
      \ controller. If you don't have one, the game will revert to keyboard controls.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game is played with a variable game length of 1 to 5 minutes\
      \ set by the hosting player. Players shoot or bump the ball onto the other team's\
      \ side and score a point when the ball hits the ground in a scoring area. Players\
      \ can jump, or launch each other with missiles to their heart's content. If\
      \ the other team is doing a good job of keeping the ball up try sitting on it!\
      \ There's nothing to stop you from invading their half of the court!<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nJump, Aim, Shoot, and Slow Fall your way to victory!"
