    about_the_game: 'Play as Daniel Hanson, commander of the first expedition to planet
      Meridian and uncover the dark secrets it holds! Shape the world around you with
      every decision you make and through every dialogue with your crew. Meridian:
      New World offers countless options to devise your own strategy, including various
      equipment options for your units and special abilities for you to rely upon.
      Use your abilities anywhere on the battlefield and turn the tide of battle by
      weakening the enemy troops. Alternatively take the covert approach and sabotage
      the enemy power supply to shut down their production. You can rely entirely
      on researching superior weapons or special abilities. Or you can risk building
      a large economy, constructing a massive army from your enormous resources. The
      strategy you use and how many troops you sacrifice to reach your goal will influence
      the attitude of your crew towards you. Are you ready to shape the history of
      galactic colonization?'

      Upon first look, Meridian seems to rival \u2013 at least, visually \u2013 the\
      \ most high profile of triple-A RTS games on the market, and it was only crafted\
      \ in two years. Take note, Blizzard.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://gamerant.com/meridian-new-world-game-trailer/\"\

    short_description: Slip into the role of Daniel Hanson, commander of the first
      mission to a remote planet called Meridian. Assured of the fact that the planet
      is uninhabited, the unexpected reception of a distress call from the surface
      could mean many things, none of which you are prepared for.
