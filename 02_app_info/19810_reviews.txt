You go from rescuing hostages and fellow FBI agents from Waco-style separatists to breaking and entering a neutral port to murder its night staff and steal its records, carrying out the international assassinations of businessmen in their homes and offices, to breaking into a man's home to plant a car bomb in his personal vehicle before detonating it without warning in the streets of Vienna. \n\nThis game is a lot of fun despite the incongruous use of the HRT, but the US security services did grease a lot of people in the wake of 9/11 so maybe this is what would happen if terrorists nuked Baltimore? Who knows! This game is basically Rainbow Six for the first mission and then goes right past Ghost Recon into Delta Force series territory, which I love but this game is totally gonzo and Hollywood by comparison to contemporaneous Tom Clancy shooters. If this seems like an appealing use of the Ghost Recon/Rainbow Six engines to you, I recommend it. You can complete it in an afternoon but it's like a dollar a mission and that's not bad.\n\nOne thing this game does really well is the coordinated multi-unit SWAT team room/building-takedown thing. It does this by having your squad (optionally) follow a series of waypoints that, if completed, will theoretically complete the mission when working in tandem with the NPC teams (unless they get whacked, which happens, but not often enough to be frustrating). They'll make their entries when you hit certain waypoints, so you get a lot of dramatic but only lightly-scripted scenes where your team enters through one door and another team exits from another and there's a three-second firefight with whoever's in the room. You see them streaming into doors and buildings a lot, and you encounter them around corners a lot, but you can see them on the minimap.\n\nA lot of the time in Rainbow Six/Ghost Recon the enemy is pretty thinly spread over the map; not here, maps aren't that big but after the first few missions they're absolutely crawling with bad guys to be stamped out like ants (with the same throaty, dick-hard crowing over kills as Ghost Recon, which you'd think an FBI agent might try to suppress, not that I'm complaining). One contribution to the Ghost Recon engine from Rainbow Six is the lock-on-head gunsights of Rainbow Six operators; this means that your HRT operator is more precise than the last game's Green Berets, but given the numbers you're facing it would sometimes be better to be able to just hose down a room with automatic gunfire instead of killing one guy then waiting for your targeting sensors to realign on the next guy before he turns you into hamburger because you've gotta stack corpses like Achilles. You go from West Virginia to Lebanon to Austria; not exactly communities hostile to the United States, but I guess in this game they contain competing right wing death squads who must be extirpated by the CIA's right wing death squad; not that I'm complaining, because this is fun game","timestamp_created":1608923874,"timestamp_updated":1608923874,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrcDVzfYCd5aSvQI="}
