    developer_response: 'I am really happy we were able to allow you to use your arm
      again, and hope it wasn''t too much on you.


      I can only imagine how hard it would be to not be able to use my own arm and
      mouse.


      Your spirit of continued appreciation for your arm gives me joy.


      We hope you were able to enjoy yourself and continue to do so.


      Remember to take your time.


      And, you''re most welcomed.'

    review: I lost control of one of my arms. I got this game after trying the demo.
      The game let me, for the first time, use my mouse. It is something I look forward
      to practicing more. Thank you designers. You let me use my arm. I am crying.
      Thank you.
