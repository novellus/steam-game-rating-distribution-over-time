The combat mode also throws out all the temperaments from ark out the window making all the dinos aggressive even the ones that normally run at the first sign of conflict, which really bugged me it, made no sense to see a group of gallimimus attacking when they run away in the original game. The game is not worth 40$ and honestly im not sure its worth the sale price of 8$ that I paid","timestamp_created":1609726984,"timestamp_updated":1609726984,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9I/N5fYCeZKiwAI="}
