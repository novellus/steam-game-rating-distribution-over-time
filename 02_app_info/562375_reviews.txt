For anybody curious as to the route included with this, it's the old Phorum Pen. charity route. They simply replaced all the narrow gauge track and did away with some other stuff. Its a great route for a small heritage operation, but still.... The stock is nice all in all, though there are some bugs noted. It goes along fairly well with the IoW addon.","timestamp_created":1602722770,"timestamp_updated":1602722770,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxZXulPUCfaH2pwI="}
