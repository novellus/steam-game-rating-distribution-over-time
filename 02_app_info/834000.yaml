    review: 'Did you look at the minimum system requirements for this? There is no
      way that is right. I bought this to see what a GTX 1060 could do, but I feel
      like I''ve been duped. This isn''t worth $1.


      UPDATE: It looks like the requirements were changed and it''s free now? Well,
      that''s better, but I still wouldn''t spend actual time on it. Except maybe
      writing a review...'
