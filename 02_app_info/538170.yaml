    review: "This game momentarily reminded me of Tower Madness. Until after a couple\
      \ easy and moderate levels I discovered a very limited and unbalance game. Tower\
      \ ranges are poorly designed or maybe its the maps? Some towers on some maps\
      \ can only be placed so close to the action, which is just barely in range enough\
      \ to get off maybe one shot. \n\nPitiful economics and difficulty balancing.\
      \ Even for a verteran of the genre and being one who welcomes a challenge, I\
      \ found this TD game to be mediocre at best, and frequently more annoying than\
      \ fun."
