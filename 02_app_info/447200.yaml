      \ or the red district theme; this game may be for you.\nStory is related to\
      \ \"The Men of Yoshiwara: Kikuya\", but you don't have to play it first to play\
      \ \"The Men of Yoshiwara: Ohgiya\". If you want to play both, I would suggest\
      \ playing 'Ohgiya' first simply because it plays into 'Kikuya' more smoothly.\n\
      \n\u2714 Fitting for someone's first Otome/VN.\n\u2714 Good Otome for a veteran\
      \ VN fan's collection."
