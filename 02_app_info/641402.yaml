    short_description: Their day off is peaceful, and Miss Kobayashi spends her time
      relaxing with the others as usual. However, while out shopping, Tohru suddenly
      stops to think on the street--Miss Kobayashi is human, and what will she do
      when her lifespan runs out and she dies...? They can't be together forever.
