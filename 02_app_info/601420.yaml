    review: Dark Parables is one of the BEST HOP game series I have run across and
      by far one of the most fun. I own almost the entire collection to date and would
      love to continue adding to my library. Buy the bundle or when they're on sale
      and you will literally have HOURS of fun. Each of these games takes me roughly
      6 hours. Well worth it!
