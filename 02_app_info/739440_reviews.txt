This is an insult to the entire Saw franchise and focused more on rushing things into play and import which just leaves the film in disarray; the only scenes that I found worth noting are the ones displaying Tobin Bell, and that's all this movie has to proffer.","timestamp_created":1597301267,"timestamp_updated":1597301267,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.439644843339920044","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o+Ok8/MCdP+SmwI="}
