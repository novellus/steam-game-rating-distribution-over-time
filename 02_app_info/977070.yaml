    about_the_game: Hey there! Thank you for considering supporting Fap Queen! <br><strong><br>I
      want to make very clear that this DLC is a single &quot;thank you&quot; picture,
      and nothing else!</strong> It doesn't enhance the game or anything like this,
      it is a simple picture at the start of the game, featuring the Queen and the
      Succubus. Together. Like... closely together. (The screenshot of the DLC is
      just part of the picture, the actual picture shows more)<br><br>I created this
      DLC to help me recovering the costs of creating the game. Yes I know this is
      a very small game, but I had some expenses with it and it would be nice to recover
      those. If it becomes a wild success, then Fap Queen 2 could be a thing. If not,
      then well, it was fun anyways :D <br><br>Thank you again for playing the game
      and considering supporting!

        intimate position.
