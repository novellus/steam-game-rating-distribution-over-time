The game was developed by Orneon and published by Big Fish Games Studio.\n\n\"Mystic Hospital\" is the first episode of \"The Agency of Anomalies.\"\n\nSince this is a collector's edition game, it comes with extra features that are not available in its counterpart; the standard edition.\n\n[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]\n\nGame Visuals\n\nI want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGame Audio\n\nI want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are two different difficulty game modes to choose from: Regular and Advanced.\n\nThe notebook keeps track of progression in the game. Such as story events and clues.\n\nThere is an interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly without having the need to constantly backtrack. It also indicates that there are a variety of tasks that can be completed at various locations within the game. The interactive map is automatically given at the start of the game.\n\nThere is padlock no feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in place to make it stationary. The inventory panel comes automatically stationary.\n\nThere are some interactive items in-game. Some of the interactive items may require extra components before they can be interacted with. All interactive items are marked with a symbol in one of the corners.\n\nThe hidden object scenes consist of the following: Traditional word lists and Reversed objects. Some of these hidden object scenes may require little or no interactions.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them.\n\nThere is a collectible in the game: Postcards. They are scattered throughout the game for the player to find.\n\nSince this is a collector's edition game, there is a bonus chapter, but it can be accessed only after the main story is completed.\n\nThere are twelve different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need to be completed before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game only.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThe extra contents: Bonus Chapter Soundtracks; Game's Strategy Guide; Wallpapers and Concept Art. Some of these extra features can be accessed only after the entire game is completed.\n\nFinal thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.","timestamp_created":1521228915,"timestamp_updated":1600547068,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563197910785675049","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhsOC1PQCeJjtmwE="}
