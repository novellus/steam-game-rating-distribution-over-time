    review: Steam needs to have an age verification method so when I buy something
      that is mature that I get all of the content instead of the censored version
      [I use a credit card with my name on (must be 18 or older) and have hardware
      shipped to a house I own (again must be 18 or older)].  Also I am done buying
      anime on Steam.  Several times now I buy something and then within days it comes
      out on a different platform with the English dubbed version.  The dubbed version
      should alway be offered if available.  For the so called purist who want to
      watch the subbed version they can switch the settings (just like on a Bluray)
      and everyone is happy.  I don't even know if the show is good yet and Steam
      has pissed me off on 2 acounts (censored version not mentioned and cheaping
      out on subbed only version).  I'll pay a little extra for the dubbed version.  Figure
      out how to win me and my money back Steam!
