    review: "I picked this game up for $4.99 after laughing pretty hard. I work as\
      \ an IT engineer in the DevOps realm for a living so it's always entertaining\
      \ to me to see games that try to market themselves at tech people (whether or\
      \ not that is their real aim). The truth is that for every successful \"tech\"\
      \ game out there, there's an engineer like me that's screaming out \"NO.\" \n\
      \nWhere to begin with this game? \n\nI only played for 15 minutes and had a\
      \ third of the content completed. It's pretty bad.\n\nYou play a SysAdmin who\
      \ is helping a friend protect their network against viruses and the like. Why\
      \ you have to do this with a point-and-click sidescrolling game, I don't know.\
      \ What I do know is that as a person in this industry, it kinda makes my entire\
      \ profession look like a joke which doesn't really bode well for the developers.\
      \ It felt like an insult to an entire profession. \n\nWhatever.\n\nThe gameplay\
      \ centers around clicking on bad things as they emerge and move from the right\
      \ side of the screen to the left side of the screen. You need to avoid clicking\
      \ on the good things to optimize points. It's really that simple and looks/feels\
      \ like a flash game from the early 2000s. So here's my short synopsis for a\
      \ really short game that is overpriced for what I received:\n\n[b]The Good:[/b][list][*]The\
      \ concept is.... fascinating?[*]The game play is... functional?[/list][b]The\
      \ Bad: [/b][list][*]No full-screen mode. Because the game only requires a mouse\
      \ to play, I frequently found myself clicking outside of the application box\
      \ which pauses the game and throws it into the background. In the industry,\
      \ we would call this bad UI/UX.[*]ALL YOUR SPELLING ERRORS ARE BELONG TO THEM.\
      \ Jesus Christ in a handbag, there are so many spelling and grammar errors in\
      \ this game. It's so bad, I can't tell if it's intentional/meant to satirize\
      \ the typical \"user\" or if the developers of this game don't have access to\
      \ a spell check for their copy. Either way, it annoyed the crap out of me for\
      \ so many reasons that I don't want to get into here.[*]The music starts out\
      \ pretty decent but then you realize there's only like three songs that you\
      \ are hearing on repeat. The repeat is poor as well. It has a notable skipped\
      \ second where it loops back on itself. It disjoints the entire experience to\
      \ me.[/list][b]The Ugly:[/b][list][*]Spending $4.99 for less than an hour of\
      \ gameplay. Yeeesh.[/list][b]Summary:[/b][list][*]If you find this game on the\
      \ Steam Summer sale for under a dollar and want to see how NOT to make an entertaining\
      \ game, go for it. Otherwise, just don't.[/list]"
