    review: "This psuedo-bluegrass acoustic frontier trip hop album is quite nice\
      \ to relax to. The singers are on point, and overall this is a recommended listen.\n\
      \n[h1] Soundtrack [/h1]\n[olist]\n[*] Get Used to it: This song features Logan\
      \ Cunningham, the voice of the stranger, as he ushers you into the soundtrack,\
      \ and a bit of the story of the game.\n[*] A Proper Story: Staple song for an\
      \ electronic rock style, featuring several string instruments, but also an electronic\
      \ industrial feel.\n[*] In Case of Trouble: One of the more funky rock songs\
      \ you'll get used to hearing, as it is played quite often, Darren Korb proves\
      \ that he can jam.\n[*]Bynn the Breaker: A more industrial sounding song, with\
      \ rhythmic hammer like beats, and prominent violins to keep the frontier feell.\n\
      [*] The Sole Regret: A very slow start song, that encompasses guitars, sitars,\
      \ and has a nice desert vibe to the whole thing.\n[*] Twisted Streets: Has the\
      \ trip hop very upfront, it feels like the start of it could either be part\
      \ of a stairway to heaven or a Tame Impala song.\n[*] Terminal March: I got\
      \ a weakness for industrial music, ever since (as a bet) I listened to Sasha\
      \ Grey's industrial album, I've got this itch to scratch, and this song definitely\
      \ scratches it.\n[*] Percy's Escape: Interesting rhythm this one takes, as it\
      \ is aggressive, and the violins that encompass the background and foreground\
      \ run at different tunes.\n[*] Faith of Jevel: A more somber song for the soundtrack\
      \ to this point, a lot more electric sounds accompany this song, though the\
      \ guitar is never lost.\n[*] Mine, Windbag, Mine: This one follows up from Percy's\
      \ Escape, just heavy beating, sounds like mining, which is great. The sliding\
      \ steel they used to make it, just perfect.\n[*] Slinger's Song: Long range\
      \ western shootouts, that's what this song is supposed to sound like, and that's\
      \ what it exactly sounds like.\n[*] Build That Wall (Zia's Theme): This beautifully\
      \ sad song is the hands down, best song in the soundtrack, and have at one point\
      \ or another been my obsession. This song is composed so damn well. Give it\
      \ a listen, don't take my advice.\n[*] Spike in a Rail: A harmonica joins the\
      \ set for this song, same industrial feel nothing outstanding, but that's being\
      \ compared to the previous song at this point.\n[*] What's Left Undone: Build\
      \ That Wall (Zia's Theme) is hummed by the voice actor for Ruckus (Logan Cunningham\
      \ again) although out of tune, this gives the song a different vibe, a sad,\
      \ tired and defeated feel.\n[*] Brusher Patrol: A more hip hop version of the\
      \ trip hop sound track, feels more like a carnival with guns. With a touch of\
      \ grunge. \n[*] The Mancer's Dilemma: This song is lead primarily by a harp,\
      \ which I believe is a first at this point, and followed by several flutes,\
      \ it's upbeat and a nice windup.\n[*] Mother, I'm Here (Zulf's Theme): A terribly\
      \ sad song with great love and detail into the lyrics.\n[*] Pale Watchers: A\
      \ suspenseful song piano lead,\n[*] The Bottom Feeders: A lot more psychedelic\
      \ rock than anything with this one. Feels like, if it were less electronic and\
      \ more physical, the song could fit on the Flying Microtonal Banana album.\n\
      [*] From Wharf to Wilds: A very nice upbeat song featuring a trumpet as a prominent\
      \ instrument.\n[*] Setting Sail, Coming: Another song in the album with lyrics,\
      \ which I believe are sung by the previous 2 singers for Build That Wall (Zia's\
      \ Theme) and Mother, I'm Here (Zulf's Theme) and encompasses parts from both\
      \ songs.\n[*] The Pantheon (Ain't Gonna Catch You): This song is fully sung\
      \ by Logan Cunningham, this invokes some very nice old Johnny Cash vibes. I\
      \ love it.\n[/olist]\n\nAll in all, I'd give this a solid 8 out of 10, if every\
      \ song was as much of a hit as Build That Wall, it'd be a 10."
