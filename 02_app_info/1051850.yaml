    review: The physics in this game are as if a drunken partygoer wandered into a
      ren faire and ate some mushrooms he found in some cow droppings, the weapons
      are awkwardly positioned, they give no feedback when you hit, everyone moves
      as if its slow motion, overall its very poorly done, and hasnt been updated
      in long enough that i think its abandoned. save yourself the trouble and just
      grab tales of glory instead.
