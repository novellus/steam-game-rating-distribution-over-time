It's quite addictive, easy for anyone to pick upand beat a few boards (every level is single-screen, with movement on a grid) but with a well-implemented difficulty curve. Arcade masters will be breaking a sweat before they clear level 30. The stages repeat thematically every five levels, with different layouts and more enmeies each time. Every fifth stage pits you against a giant teleporting, laser-shooting eyeball and his minions. Controls are crisp and responsive, and music is catchy (I swear the title screen tune is some song I ought to recognize). You'll be surprised how much time has passed as the game keeps enticing you to have one more go. Recommended for retro arcade fans, and a good price to boot (hill).","timestamp_created":1543306219,"timestamp_updated":1543306219,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ434GOqucCdbvbswE="}
