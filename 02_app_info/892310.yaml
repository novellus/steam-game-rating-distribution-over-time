    about_the_game: Infinity Heroes is a strategically deep cross-platform card game,
      designed for mobile &amp; PC. <br><br>The game's foundation is laid in making
      Infinity Heroes easy to get into, for people who don't traditionally play card
      games, by destroying the traditional barriers of entry.<br><br>Pre-constructed
      decks mean not only is the game less expensive to play, but you also won't have
      to worry about deck building, or building up collections and finding rare cards.
      Not only that but giving you access to everything you need to be competitive
      on day 1. When you enter a game, you could play against someone who has played
      for a year, and the better PLAYER will be the one that wins. <br><br>Simultaneous
      turns also give the players a lot less downtime, making sure that there's always
      fast-paced strategic action to focus on.<br><br>With multiple heroes being chosen,
      ultimate units/spells, hero powers, and card cycling, you will never be locked
      out of the game, and you will always have a number of options in how you want
      to deal with your current threats, and potentially punish your opponent.<br><br>With
      characters returning from Infinity Wars, the world and story will continue to
      grow and evolve within Infinity Heroes.<h2 class="bb_tag">Living Roadmap</h2><br>Our

    review: It's fun and has a unique premise that means you don't have to spend hours
      on deckbuilding. Just pick the three complete decks, all based on one character/world
      each. This already delivers a lot of tactical options, and you can learn the
      many decks, not the 1000's of cards.
