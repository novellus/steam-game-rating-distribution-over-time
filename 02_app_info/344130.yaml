    review: 'I usually like frustrating and hard games. But this is just frustrating,
      can''t say it''s thrully hard but just bad development.


      In a point enemies are too huge and has really long attacks and you can dodge
      one attack but not the other 3 attacks on the screen. So the best strategy is
      to shut your brain down and just spamm attacks while sliding throught the floor
      eventually you kill everything.


      But if you waste time dodging and such you end up being knocked back and waste
      time while you take more and more damage.


      The space you have to move is extremelly small in comparation of the size of
      the enemies and their attacks, so again you better just swalking forward spamming
      attacks and hopefully the enemy will die before you. game doesn''t seem to reward
      skill at dodging or "cutting rockets" what''s the point of cutting rockets if
      oyu gonna get hit by a massive flamethrower anyways?


      But then some bosses can be beaten buy just crouching in a corner spamming attacks
      nonstop.


      Couldn''t complete this game was really boring and braindead.'
