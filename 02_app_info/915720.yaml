    about_the_game: <strong>Session Seven</strong> is a free point &amp; click graphic
      adventure game meant for fans of the old school 2D adventure game classics.<br><br>You
      play as Ryan, an estranged father and husband who has just awoken, beaten, bruised,
      and alone in a locked cellar. Your head is throbbing, and you have only a few
      vague, twisted memories about how you might have gotten there. Armed only with
      the sparse tools around you and the strange, possibly dark mementos you find
      along the way, it is up to you to find out what happened and escape the basement.<br><br>Your
      life is not the only one on the line. Your wife and son may be in danger too.
      Through a series of puzzles and player-directed flashbacks with an unidentified
      therapist, you decide how Ryan's story ends... and how it began. It is vital
      that you find your way out, but it is just as important that you figure out
      how you got in. Session Seven is a point-and-click adventure and an interactive
      story, and there are multiple directions in which the player can take their
      narrative.<br><br>Experienced players should take about one to two hours to
      complete the game on the first try. The puzzles are chosen to be a good compromise
      between easy and hard to target both casual and expert adventure gamers.<br><br>The
      game is the passion project of a game designer, a writer, and a musician, and
      we sincerely hope that you will enjoy your experience. Have fun, and good luck.
