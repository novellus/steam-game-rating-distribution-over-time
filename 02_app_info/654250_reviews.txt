I'm not gonna beat around the bush here. These are the Pros and Cons\n\nPros:\n-Very Strategic RPG battle system that has a lot of quirks. You must be always paying attention to your HP and MP to survive every fight.\n-Characters, a bunch of side people who have really cool textures.\n-Simplistic and Direct, no overarching story, nothing crazy, throws you right into the game, no bs\n-A lot of fun and stays away from being too grindy.\n-Cool settings and level design\n-Neat little side quests and in-game achievements for extra XP\n-Armor and Weapon break mechanic\n\nCons:\n-Grid system hitboxes are a little off for some enemies\n-No auto-battle button\n-No Steam Achievements\n-Low sound effect variety and quality\n-Glitch where if your female companion uses magic, she uses the same sound effect as the guy using magic\n-You can walk into NPCs instead of clicking near them\n-Low caliber music (pretty basic and repetitive)\n-Empty World Syndrome. Tons of cabinets and drawers but none of them give items or even say they are empty when the models clearly show stuff on them.\n\nI think this game is more impressive with the combat over everything else. The world is kinda weird and feels slightly off as you are playing. I only played about an hour but I will continue to play and I will update this review accordingly the more I play. Overall 5/10. Average, but could be a lot better.","timestamp_created":1595424319,"timestamp_updated":1595424405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44I6tu/MCf5fzlgI="}
