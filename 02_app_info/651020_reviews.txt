It takes too much luck and makes the game drawn out for no reason.\nYou basically just do secret lands for money. Constantly land and leave until you get an easy task (since most of them are just long) and then rush it and sell everything.\nThere's no point doing getting enchanted stuff since you a guaranteed to die to RNG at some point and all of it just disappears from your ship.\nFriendly fire is also a thing on land and they kill you as well.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend it","timestamp_created":1601915745,"timestamp_updated":1601948512,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8M3k/fQCccaHpgI="}
