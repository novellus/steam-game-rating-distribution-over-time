Originally I had a negative review posted. I, like many others, purchased this season pass as it advertised including all future content only to find out that the product wording was altered afterwards. That's still an uncool move and I am very bothered that it occurred in the first plate. That being said, the developer has posted that they will honor their former wording on the season pass provided you purchased it within the window of when they advertised it as including all future content. After a few emails back and forth the issue was resolved. I appreciate Nomad Games trying to do right and honor their word, but I still don't like that they changed a product *after* many had already purchased it. (Note: the missing content was added to my Nomad Account, not my Steam Library)\n\nThat aside, the game is great. It is heavy on the randomness factor and sometimes it feels like the computer cheats (I don't think it does, I believe it's Negative Bias at play). But it's still a ton of fun, mores so if you play with friends. I don't recommend playing with all expansions simultaneously, especially when it adds to the board real estate.","timestamp_created":1607923335,"timestamp_updated":1609942165,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44PyB7PYCdd6EugI="}
