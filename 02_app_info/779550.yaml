    review: My friend Jakob, a really talented programmer, created this game. Its
      a simple but fantastic game. Its nostalgic of very old classic adventure RPGS
      which I used to play as a kid, which gives it a nice feel; As if I were back
      at home playing in the good old 90's as a hero to defeat evil. The sound track
      is pretty awesome, but my favorite part about this game would have to be the
      different bosses. I enjoyed their unique designs. Overall, its a good game which
      I recommend people give it a try and play it and experience it for yourself.
      For some reason, it felt like the game mother aka earthbound, I am not sure
      why XD. The main character reminds me of Ness. Its a really cool design. Great
      job, keep up the good work! Im excited and look forward to future developments.
      :)
