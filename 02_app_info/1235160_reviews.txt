It is very fast pace and would love to see Y-axis mechanics being implemented on it. The crosshair needs a little buff. Works Perfectly on my Intel Laptop but is quite laggy on my Ryzen Machine. Overall it is amazing and would love to see more improvements being done.","timestamp_created":1582912789,"timestamp_updated":1582912789,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1582968968,"developer_response":"Thank you for the review.
