I think that it will be an excellent introduction and transition into twin engine flying.  This plane is or was apparently quite favored at flight schools for that very reason.  I have the autopilot working in its most basic and important  form using traditional FSX keyboard commands : Z turns off and on(no illumination seen), CTRL H (toggle) makes the heading bug active (AP panel light will illuminate) and CTRL Z (toggle) will enable altitude hold(panel switch illuminates).  I am not having luck yet with direct control of the AP panel switches, but the above takes care of the most pressing needs; others may have that more fully figured out.  I learned how to tailor the sound volumes since the engine was too loud for my taste - this is a big plus in a general way for all sustained flying now.   Also recommend downloading the manual from this page, I think it will be answering most of the questions that are coming up.  Since I am wanting to learn about actual flying protocols and flight models vs. trying to automate the process as much as possible, this looks like a great match for me.  Wonderful to experience the performance improvements of twin engine over singe engine planes if you are at that level of flight study.  Definitely an engaging plane and recommended from my side (also an affordable entry into twins), hope you find the same.\n\nPS From the manual I did later find the AP on/off switch, and it now illuminates the AP power switch properly; I anticipate this should enable full functioning of the AP.\n\n********************************\nPOSTSCRIPT JUL 03 2020:\n\nThis remains my favorite plane in my flight training, vying for position with the Piper Comanche(a very hard plane to find, by the way - Eaglesoft Development Group has it).  There is an interesting evolution that has taken place in my acquistion of these two aircraft:\n\nI was ready to write a critical review on the Duchess as I had almost come to the point of abandoning it.  The problem was with the field of view.  I was never able to see sideways out of the cockpit when I had things set up for the front view without lots of hassles and adjustments while flying.  This was a critical flaw in the design of this airplane for me, or so I thought.  That led me to the Comanche, which does not have this problem.  The performance specs of these two planes are very similar, and hence my equal interest in both of them.\n\nAt this point of abandonment of the Duchess, I decided to investigate any point of view adjustments that can be made within FSX.  THERE IS A GREAT AND SIMPLE SOLUTION here that has radically improved the use of FSX in all respects, so I wish to share it.  This is the link, offered by Steam no less:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=367422210\n\nThis has changed everything in FSX to the better, and now the Duchess is again at the top of my list.  I would highly recommend considering making this change in the config file for FSX.  It was a simple fix (I back up the original file just in case) and all aircraft are dramatically better now.  You can see properly for traffic pattern work and general  viewing and safety in flight.\n\nThe Duchess and Comanche are two wonderful planes if you are involved with the flying of twins.  Still highly recommended, but CONDITIONAL upon setting the view to WideViewAspect=True per the link above.\n\nIncidentally, autopilot works fine in all respects once you learn where the switches for control are.\n\nAdditional note : Learning how to control the zoom of the external view from the aircraft also becomes important here.  This is done with the + and - keys.  Combination of wide angle view and zoom factor will make a big difference with all aircraft, not just the Duchess.\n\nBest regards, CEC","timestamp_created":1590482659,"timestamp_updated":1593853965,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rK7GjPMCcO2uigI="}
