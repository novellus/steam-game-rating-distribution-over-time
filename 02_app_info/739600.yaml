    review: I would recommend getting the whole series by manga but if complete anime
      version yes.  Its good if you handle his misunderstanding situation, it might
      need remake because for guy he understood just girls being not on same page
      as he was...kind bothered me, He wasn't into too forward category they should
      had sign were getting married and doing it seemed it should be rated different
      setting Over teens...because breasts and it would be more adult comedy sort
      thing then teen comedy. Oh I seen the whole series somewhere else and it was
      good. It reminded Munto little bit, but kind wish he could hand the girls off
      to better partners? So he could had one of girls and princesss that was it...he
      seemed got better with just that one other girl seemed too violent and I was
      thinking he going killed by her and other girl going bury him.
