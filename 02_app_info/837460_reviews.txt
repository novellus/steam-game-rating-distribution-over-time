This game deserves way more recognition.\n\nAfter the first hour of the game, here's how I would have summed up the game : a more accessible version of La Mulana, with the same kind of humour as The Messenger, but with interesting light-based mechanics.\n\nNow, I have finished the game (99,5%, missing one chest that is nowhere to be found) and here's what I have to say :\n\n+ : the music is really good, as in \"I will listen to it even after I finish the game\" good.\n+ : the art is great but I was hoping we would see more \"highly detailed sprites\" as we see at some occasions, they look really good.\n+ : the design of the puzzles is on point, nothing too easy, nothing impossible. \n+ : I like this kind of humour, it's not often a game makes me laugh but this one made me laugh OUT LOUD a few times\n\nAside from that, the movements of the character are not often as precise as we'd expect, it can be hard to jump on a platform above you if it means going to the side then back again for example. \nI did not feel the need to read the papers and notes scattered around the game, but I did feel compelled to read all the dialog (but it should be noted that following the story is important). \nThe combat system is pretty basic, and a few extra attacks would have been welcome.\nThe power ups gained during level-ups don't seem to have a lot of impact (I couldn't see any difference probably because the enemies' strength would scale up as well).\nSince our movements and attacks are limited, the fights can often turn out to be quite messy, with enemies everywhere and the character forced to tank damage and hit everything as quickly as possible like... a barbarian. \n\nBatbarian isn't perfect, but there aren't many games that make me want to play MORE. And here I wish there were more zones to explore because of how I enjoyed it. Great job really, can't wait to see what you do next.\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1609939955,"timestamp_updated":1609939955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ408X56/YCfIeAwQI="}
