    review: 'Although the animations are nice, this is less of a platform game and
      more of a "will you stop doing that, I didn''t tell you to do that" game. you
      fight wolves, but the combat is just clicking. the platforming is basically
      you seeing how close to the edge you can get before the deer commits suicide
      by jumping off.


      like why is it that for large section of the game, your only choice is to sit
      there and click to kill enemies. you fight a wolf pack? can''t outrun them,
      they''ll stunlock you and kill you. your only choice is to try and click faster
      than the ai'
