    review: As someone who is new to Vn's this series has gripped me right up until
      each end. The writing is amazing and the characters are believable and i often
      find myself wishing i lived in this world. At first i had thought that it was
      just a little short but the more i delved into these routes and backgrounds
      the more i realised i insanely wrong and each character from the wacky and completley
      unbelieveable are written out so well with thier backgrounds and feelings. I
      did feel a little bad about some route endings, without spoiling i'll just say
      it made me personally wish i could of made a different choice.  The other story
      routes such as elf and man or dragons treasure i feel were just amazing in the
      aspect they went into even more depth. I was literally stuck at my computer
      just going and going for hours on end not wanting to stop reading or learning
      about the characater you have created. I wait impatiently for the next releases
      and you have made a life long customer and turned me into someone who is completley
      looking through thier steam shop for more stories like these.  i would highly
      recommend these for anyone who has never read a Visual novel before or just
      been curious. lifes not fair and i still to this day wish i could find a wish
      making creature and teleport me to this world or make it real lmao.
