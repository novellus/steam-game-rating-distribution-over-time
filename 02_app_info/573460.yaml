    review: '[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers [/h1]


      I can''t believe I wasted $4.79 USD on this game and I''m outside the refund
      period. Ugh! This game is terrible. Don''t get me wrong, it''s not the worst
      game in VR. It has a nice concept. With the laddermen coming up on the tower
      and battering rams. And you can get all these upgrades, like your own personal
      healer or boiling oil. That''s all very good stuff and shows that they were
      trying to differentiate themselves from other bow games.


      However, two things keep this game from being any good. The biggest problem
      is the bow mechanic. It''s not the worst, but it is subpar. It feels like you''re
      shooting a nerf bow. You get used to it eventually, but it just never feels
      satisfying. The bow & arrow feels better in the Lab.


      The second thing is the graphics. They are laughably bad. What''s the point
      of VR if things are just going to look this bland and generic and ps2 level
      graphics? Whoever came up with these assets, 3D models, needs to never do it
      again. I''m pretty sure if you gave me a month to work on it, I can come up
      with something better, and I''m not a good artist.


      So I''m stuck with this game. But don''t make the same mistake I did. Do NOT
      buy. Out of all the archery games on Steam VR, this is not the worst, but it''s
      in the bottom half or bottom third.
