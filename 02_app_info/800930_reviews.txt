The cast of characters were interesting and varied, and there were some nice story surprises along the way as well. I really appreciated all the lore and world building details that were provided throughout the experience, and a lot of imagination and creativity has melded here with some more traditional or realistic aspects, and it makes for an interesting alternate reality sort of universe.\n\nI really appreciated the background art and the costumes for the characters as well. There was a lot of appeal to everything in general for me, and I had a fun time learning more about this world and its inhabitants. At the time of writing this, another story in this same universe has just been released called Lily's Handmaid, and while both of these titles are strandalone experiences, there is a common link between them that is explained in Lily's Handmaid that I appreciated a good bit, and they do both take place within the same fantastical imaginative world, and unless I am mistaken, during very close time periods as well.\n\nThat said, I would advise starting the series here with Twin Blue Moons, because it lays more of the groundwork and foundation of a lot of the world's peculiarities and charms. While not necessarily a prequel/sequel sort of situation, Twin Blue Moons is the better starting point in my opinion.","timestamp_created":1588719518,"timestamp_updated":1588719518,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk4DE8/ECet/shQI="}
