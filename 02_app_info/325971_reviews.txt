It's a pretty easy to drive model and good for beginners like the Castle Class from Riviera in the Fifties.\n. Inspection Lights \"This actually surprised me, I've never seen a locomotive that had this feature.\"\n. Powerful. I tried it on the S&DR with a rake of heavy Railguns from the SR Q1 pack and it didn't grind to a halt on those steep grades.\n. Brakes stop the train quickly.\n\nCons\n. Chuffing is a little quiet and can only be heard when loco is a yard or two from the camera.\n. The Manual doesn't explain how to make the loco steam more efficiently.\n. It surges forward or backward quickly with only a little steam. This could cause collision with rolling stock.\n. Wagons look too modern to be bundled with a steam locomotive.\n\nOverall I give this locomotive 8/10 shovels of coal.","timestamp_created":1606244360,"timestamp_updated":1606244360,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9Pvn/fUCcZelsAI="}
