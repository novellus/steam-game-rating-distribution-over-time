      \ game design around realism, as much as possible while also wanting to keep\
      \ the game fun. You can build apartments, warehouses and labs on the map, but\
      \ they will be expensive and represent the real life money prices.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nYou will start the game with $0 and nothing more. Slowly, by doing\
      \ jobs at first and selling drugs later you will build your empire of drugs\
      \ and blood.<br />\r\nTry it out, it's free. I am one guy working on it and\
      \ pushing out new updates as much and as frequent as I can. The game is not\
      \ done yet and lots will improve."

    review: "So I'm not actually the reviewer like so many others. \n\nFirst of all,\
      \ I want to clear away a few misunderstandings. \nI think this game is anything\
      \ but a Pay To Win. \nYou have the option to spend $ 5 but you don't have to.\
      \ \nWith this money you have a little jump start ... but nothing more. Honestly\
      \ what are 5 $ \n(3 chocolate bars ... woow) \nSecond, I want to point out a\
      \ few comments that claim that everything is so expensive in the game.\n (Seriously\
      \ ... there are enough games where you have to pay more, sometimes real money,\
      \ which is in the 3 to 5 digit range.) \nThat should be enough for now. For\
      \ my part, I will keep playing this game. And I'm already looking forward to\
      \ all new updates etc. the possibilities are endless. Praise to the developer\
      \ or developers. \nI couldn't do that.\n\nBesides, the dev said that he is going\
      \ with realism in the game and it's not finished yet. Let's give him some time\
      \ to see what he plans to do.\n\n\nYes, yes, I know....\nWe live in a society\
      \ that wants to have everything ready now and immediately, and preferably yesterday.\
      \ This is a world sickness and it keeps getting worse.\nJust ... be patient.\n"
