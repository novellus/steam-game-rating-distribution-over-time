I am a small part in and I am enjoying the decisions and encounters very much.\n\nI will say the facial graphics are a little rough at times and a little funny and I personally dont love the main characters voice acting, however if you can get over this, all of the interactions and build paths are super enjoyable.","timestamp_created":1610104926,"timestamp_updated":1610104926,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8+3u8PYCeu/BwQI="}
