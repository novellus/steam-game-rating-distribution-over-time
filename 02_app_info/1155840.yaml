    about_the_game: "Magnum Opus is an indie online multiplayer game developed by\
      \ Novacorp Studios, a startup software company located in Costa Rica. The game\
      \ is currently in Alpha stage but we are building this game based in the premise\
      \ of how we believe MMOs should be:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Truly Free To Play\
      \ With NO PAY TO WIN (Only cosmetic items on store)<br />\r\n- Cloud server\
      \ based (everyone plays on one mega server witth cloud architecture instead\
      \ of splitting the playerbase on multiple servers like MMOs usually do)<br />\r\
      \n- Encourages social interaction amongst players (we are tired of MMOs were\
      \ you just queue with a bunch of random people to complete a dungeon or mission\
      \ but you actually don't need to talk to anybody during the entire mission)<br\
      \ />\r\n- Text and voice chat integration<br />\r\n- Integration to play using\
      \ VR headsets.<br />\r\n- No class restriction, no gender locked characters\
      \ and all that boring stuff. (you can be anything you want and switch anytime\
      \ and anywhere)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlanned additional features:<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\n- Skill based combat system (you will win PvP matches because you become\
      \ good at the game, not just because you have the best gear)<br />\r\n- Quest\
      \ system<br />\r\n- Player housing<br />\r\n- And much more!"
