      is fun, and that muscle memory developed in virtual reality effectively translates

    review: Wow! This is a great example of how VR can improve real life skills. I
      have been playing with my WMR controller and it works great, but I just found
      out that they have a Fire Control Group(FCG) that can mount in existing AR-15
      to provide you with hands on experience with your own weapon. I would love to
      see more VR apps like this one. With the price of the FCG though, I think they
      should include the app. Very realistic, and fun! Have fun training in multiple
      scenarios, and who knows the training from Tactical AR might just save your
      life one day!
