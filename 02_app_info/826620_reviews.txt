The overall story line was good, very hopeful, and it did a good job building suspense. Some of the dialogue and voice acting between the protagonist and the secondary characters could use some improvement to make the scences more impactful. Overall I would recommend this film, if your looking for something short and entertaining.","timestamp_created":1523166756,"timestamp_updated":1523166756,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544469237327575684","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyof00eICd5ThnQE="}
