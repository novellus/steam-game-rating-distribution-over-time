Although it's true that the game is buggy as hell, like being able to pass solid walls and stuff, and the very obvious sprite and sound rips from several different games, it shouldn't make you stop playing. I found it really fun to play if you have a lot of time, or enjoy grinding. My only complaint in this game is not having a Wiki page. Legit needs it as the game doesn't present you with much information other than the general tutorial. Oh and a fullscreen mode.","timestamp_created":1517840510,"timestamp_updated":1517840510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww4WWs+ECeZuKmAE="}
