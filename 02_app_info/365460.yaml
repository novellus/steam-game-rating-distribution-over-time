    review: 'Watch intro which lasts 5+ minutes and cuts off before its'' conclusion.

      Start my first race, the AI pull ahead.

      The AI swap positions with each other off screen.

      Catch up with said AI, and they are in a perfect line, no swapping of positions.

      But, still shows AI swapping positions on the side bar?

      Insert confusion.

      Pass some chariots - shows me in last position.

      Pass all chariots, cross the start/finish line first, tells me I lost.

      Insert more confusion.

      Restart race...

      The AI start climbing up the scenery and doing doughnuts.
