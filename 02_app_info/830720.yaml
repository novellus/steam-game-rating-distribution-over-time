    review: Good airport, no google earth, only modeled textule. It's very realistic
      but is a bit expensive. If you want to play with Lufthansa and other airlines
      on this airport you have to buy Real Color and Real Trafiic, on sites outside
      the Steam. That's the s**t part but at all it's a good DLC.
