    short_description: Six years have passed after the events of 2226 A.D. The balance
      in the galaxy has been restored as transgalactic corporations have been deported
      to the outskirts of the galaxy and deprived of their power. The Empire, just
      as before, continues to fight against the Aliens. As a rule armadas of battleships
      aren't used in such conflicts.
