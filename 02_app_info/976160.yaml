    review: 'There''s quite a few issues with this small game that prevents me from
      enjoying it. Mainly the keg mechanic. The keg fills up in mere seconds. Those
      mere seconds is barely enough to make a trip (filling up a beer mug and serving
      it to a customer). And that''s if you serve the customers that are nearest to
      the keg. What''s worse is that the customers can only be served so much alcohol
      before they crash and stop accepting them which eventually forces you to serve
      the customers that are located at the ends of the bar.  Except those trips take
      up more time than you''re allowed to even take and you eventually get a game
      over. While you do earn some cash for each customer u serve, they''re only use
      is so u change the graphics of the bar and the barista.


      TLDR; this game aint even worth the dollar.'
