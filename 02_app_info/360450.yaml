    review: Great, underrated game which experience emodies fencing very well. The
      game fails to simulate counter time, and parry-riposte seems clunky, but distance
      management, counterattacks, feints with blade and tactical feints, even true
      time (a fencing concept, in which attack lead by blade is good, and attack lead
      by feet / body is stupid) simulation - everything is on point. If You're into
      kendo, kenjutsu, aiki-ken or even just samurai cinema - You will feel at home
      with this game.
