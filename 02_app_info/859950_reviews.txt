All cut scenes are fully voiced.\n\nGame play is pretty standard match-3 fare, with the story of a destroyed Hobbit Village and you need to accumulate various types of materials to rebuild it.\n\nI enjoyed it and over 7 hours of entertainment is worth the 2.99 USD I paid for it.","timestamp_created":1532744403,"timestamp_updated":1532744403,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.621178686618804932","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g/Gr7+QCd4KFpwE="}
