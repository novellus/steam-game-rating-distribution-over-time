    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">How to play</h2>As the CEO of a multinational
      holding company, your task is to find the most valuable markets in the world
      and control them. The board of directors allocates a certain amount of initial
      capital to you at the beginning of each level. You will use the initial capital
      and your headquarters to acquire the company on the map, suppress competitors,
      and finally acquire the headquarters of the competitors to win.<h2 class="bb_tag">Five
      different types of industries</h2>Finance, technology, loans, energy, real estate,
      financial industry can get Acquisition Premium, technology industry can generate
      technology points, loan industry can obtain additional loan income, real estate
      industry can reduce its own acquisition premium, and energy industry has higher
      income. In order to monopolize the industry and obtain monopoly profits, it
      is necessary to purchase, upgrade, merge and expand in different industries.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Matthew Effect</h2>The bigger your market share is, the more
      revenue you have, but the market share has a square relationship with income.
      For example, when your market share is two times that of your opponent, your
      income will be four times that of your opponent. So you need to expand quickly
      and squeeze your opponent, or you may have serious losses.<h2 class="bb_tag">R
      &amp; D of science and technology</h2>Through the control of technology companies
      to carry out scientific and technological research and development to obtain
      an unequal competitive advantage, rapid victory.<h2 class="bb_tag">Headquarters
      acquisition</h2>When you buy all the headquarters of an opponent, it means that
      you will take over all the companies he owns, and obtain the purchase amount,
      remaining capital and technology points of his headquarters.<h2 class="bb_tag">Various
      levels</h2>The game has 50 + various levels, the passed levels will be collected,
      and you can play the collected levels again, and the level of the collected
      level will be improved to contribute more profits to the holding company<br><br><i>If
