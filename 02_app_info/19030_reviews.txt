I'm a big fan of Rocket Knight Adventures of the Genesis and Sparkster on the SNES. They are iconic games that demonstrate Konami on top of their game, featuring gorgeous and vibrant graphics, rocking soundtracks and bombastic and energetic gameplay. Rocket Knight, on the other hand, seems like a pale imitation that doesn't manage to reach anywhere near the heights set by its predecessors. I think this is best observed through the redesign of the main character himself. The original Sparkster was squat in build with a cartoony and expressive face, a hero who looked ready to take on the world and whose boisterous charm and appeal was apparent in every frame of animation. The new Rocket Knight's eyes are no longer large and reminiscent of anime but beady and cold. I can't put my finger on it but he somehow looks sickly. I really can't help but feel like I'm no longer playing the same character I was playing in 16 bit.\n\nIt actually took me a long while to even get around to playing this through, as the demo had originally turned me off and I felt no inclination to come back to it. But eventually I picked it up on the cheap and decided to give it another shot. To be fair, the game does get better as you progress through it. There are some decent gimmicks that make levels feel unique. The controls are mostly fine. The game is also fairly short and doesn't outstay its welcome, which I genuinely appreciate.\n\nIf you're looking to recapture the joy you felt playing throuigh Sparkster's 16 bit adventures, you won't find it here. However, if you're looking for an average action-platformer that will keep you occupied for a couple of hours then you could do worse than this.","timestamp_created":1600097878,"timestamp_updated":1600097878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw///QxvQCc8njoQI="}
