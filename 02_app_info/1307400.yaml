    review: The new area is cool, but I wish the crow did something rather than just
      ocasionally fly around. The DLC is not expensive but it's called "Crow DLC"
      so why not make the bird be an actual companion? Collect sin or deal minor damage
      here and there for example. If you ignore the bird, the DLC is pretty solid.
