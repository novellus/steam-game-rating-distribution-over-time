    reviews: "\u201C...the soundtrack matches the artstyle perfectly. Whether it be\
      \ a playful piano ditty while you pilot a mech suit that shoots cats or an emotional\
      \ strings piece while you\u2019re exploring a brand-new area, there\u2019s a\
      \ childlike sense of optimistic wonderment that\u2019s being reinforced throughout\
      \ the game. The soundtrack does a great job of setting up the right atmosphere\
      \ when it needs to, further immersing you in this strange, fantasy world.\u201D\

      \ can be as incredible as the graphics, as well as the songs that fit perfectly\
      \ with the environment, they have an inexplicable nostalgic factor. Some tracks\
      \ reminded me a lot of the songs of Mega Man Legends, the 3D Adventure of Mega\
      \ Man released for the first PlayStation, which is great, since the franchise\
      \ has always been and always will be reference in quality soundtracks.\u201D\

    review: "Beautifully mixed, a darkwave and orchestral soundtrack that gives quite\
      \ a bit of anxiety, needed for how dark this game becomes. Darker and darker\
      \ still, mixing well with the still, somber cutscenes.\n\n[h1]Songs [/h1] \n\
      1.) Aegis Defenders Main Theme - Heavy orchestral sounds with long string instrument\
      \ pulls, and low wind instruments allow this song to be a very epic start to\
      \ a good soundtrack. A bit of Dark Synth blends into the end as it crescendos.\n\
      2.) Ruinhunters of Annwyn - A bit of a low tide song, feels like you're in a\
      \ cave with different wooden beats that resemble drops of water coming off of\
      \ stalactites.\n3.) Ruins of Sen - Orchestral sounds bring memories of Kirby\
      \ and the Cave of Wonders to mind.\n4.) Temple of the Goddess Kanzeon - [spoiler]\
      \ When you come across the first dead God, this song plays, and as you drain\
      \ the remaining life force from it to further your fight against an evil emporer\
      \ [/spoiler] This song starts wtih very sad low tones, and hums its way to the\
      \ end, symbolic.\n5.) Nereis Desert - Very on point, most video games have a\
      \ wind instrument that, when heard, will almost unanimously cause someone to\
      \ think of \"Desert,\" 2-3 seconds, and you're like \"oh yup this is a desert\
      \ level.\" I wonder why that is.\n6.) The Catacombs of Vaara - In this song,\
      \ the game capitalizes on the \"tower defense,\" making use of industrial sounds,\
      \ clanks, cranks, etc.\n7.) Jheon, the Capital of Indra - As the Journey leads\
      \ towards the end of the conflict, we are met with secrets, and more danger,\
      \ this songs crescendo introduces a sad yet upbeat tone.\n8.) Aegis Awakens,\
      \ Final Battle - In the end you must fight man itself. This song sounds a lot\
      \ like that of Shadow of the Colossus, or Monster Hunter World, it has moments\
      \ between rounds where the song dies down, just to return with full force, as\
      \ the battle of attrition begins.\n9.) Aegis Theme - When you find out who the\
      \ Aegis is, this sad and intimidating song begins to make sense, the longing\
      \ strings and lasting hums make sense.\n10.) Caravan - Calming music that plays\
      \ in between levels, this is the song for resting, saving, and buying. Very\
      \ minimalistic in the composition, an electric piano, as well as as chimes,\
      \ and a regular piano make up most of this songs instruments.\n11.) Defend -\
      \ Preparation song, you hear this in the first round of every level, it is orchestral,\
      \ but it brings back the rhythmic industrial sounds as you build up your defenses.\n\
      12.) Bart's Theme - Interesting theme for one of our main characters, Barts\
      \ [spoiler]a hardened vet [/spoiler] allows you, the player, to feel the weighted\
      \ emotions that Bart has held on to from his passed.\n13.) Clu's Theme - The\
      \ wondrous composition of this space-age pop song reflects our other main characters\
      \ free-spirited nature.\n14.) End Credits - A mix of Aegis Defenders Main Title\
      \ and Aegis Awakens, Final Battle. Done Completely in a 16-bit Chiptune style.\n\
      \nAll in all, I love this dang soundtrack so dang much. Very good listen, very\
      \ good game in general."
