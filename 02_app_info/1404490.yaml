      \ Someone of your friends offered to test their nerves and visit the abandoned\
      \ Wilkerson mansion, because no one has lived there for a long time and it should\
      \ be empty, but something went wrong. Once in an abandoned house, four young\
      \ people become prisoners of the evil living in this house. To escape from this\
      \ trap, they have to find clues for how open the front door through which they\
      \ can escape without getting on evil tricks, because it will try to confuse\
      \ them and interfere in every possible way in achieving the goal. Wherever evil\
      \ succeeds, it will be fueled and thereby giving itself the strength to use\
      \ more sophisticated methods of persecution, bringing the poor fellows to death.<br\

      \ Evil is not immortal, and there is a way to contain or weaken it. Inspecting\
      \ the house you will find tips on how to do that. Having recognized the enemy,\
      \ pick up protection and it will not be so difficult to get to the exit.<br\

      \ which you can find in the mansion for faster reaction and cohesion, but evil\
      \ does not sleep, it hears you.<br />\r\nThere are many alternatives to survive,\
      \ but which one will be suitable, you have to choose yourself. Just as evil\
