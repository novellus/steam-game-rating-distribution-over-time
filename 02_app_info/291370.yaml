    review: "Paid full price for this. Was aware of the negative reviews. Been wanting\
      \ this since 2014 PAX West where I first played it. I was addicted then, and\
      \ after nearly 3 hours I'm still wanting more. \n\nI am aware of the Developers\
      \ no longer actively developing the game, and I understand. The game had a only\
      \ minor issues playing in the last day of 2020. Zombie got stuck on final mission\
      \ by porta potty being so close to another mesh (barrel) Sometimes its one sometimes\
      \ 2 zombies. First 4 missions were very straight forward and got harder as you\
      \ went along. Final mission (Mission 5) can be very difficult and takes time\
      \ and special zombies. Tried with numbers and its a def no go slaughter. \n\n\
      I wanted to give a good review because 6 years later of wanting to play this\
      \ game in full release, I see it won't happen unfortunately. \n\n\nTLDR: I recommend\
      \ if the game play appeals, only 5 missions 2 skirmish maps and 1 alpha map\
      \ playground. Maybe another 2 hours and (plus my 3 currently) for a total of\
      \ around 5 hours of game play.\n\nPros:\nYou get to play as zombies!\nFairly\
      \ short incase you need a break from other games. \nVery tactical and engaging\n\
      I mean it was only $14 (some could argue this be too much, but I think for what\
      \ I played would be worth $10) \n\nCons:\nFairly short incase you wanted more\n\
      No longer in active development\n\nThough if you are strapped for cash, this\
      \ game will not be going on discount anytime soon. Check the game out on youtube.\
      \ Though I see the hard work put into this with a small staff, I still had fun\
      \ for the Beta stage it was left in. No game breaking issues, played on max\
      \ settings. The only crash I had was the first load. Reloaded no issues since.\
      \ \n\nShame it isn't in active development or plans for release with DLC pack.\
      \ I'd pay for an expansion if it helped get these guys back up and running.\
      \ I do wish they could have given community tools to allow for mods and such.\
      \ Though wishful thinking at this point. Cheers.\n\nEdit now after 6 hours*\n\
      \nPros:\nPreset controls that make it easier to attack small groups\nVaried\
      \ amount of zombie types\nGreat music\nPressing Shift while scrolling the map\
      \ makes it a bit faster to look around\n\nCons:\nSkirmish 2 is very laggy, but\
      \ I managed to beat it.\nAlpha play map is very small, and can get very laggy\
      \ if you place one too many zombies or survivors.\nKeybinds are unchangeable\n\
      Lacks a x2 speed in gameplay\nLacks a go to icon function incase a zombie gets\
      \ stuck (you have to manually find them)\n\nStill enjoyable, leaves me wanting\
      \ more."
