      \ /><br><strong>Wonhon: A Vengeful Spirit</strong> is a paranormal stealth action\
      \ game about revenge and its price. The game takes place in the alternative\
      \ history of Korea in the 1920s. The main character is a Korean girl who was\
      \ killed along with her family during the attack on the village. She meets Jeoseung\
      \ Saja, the God of Death, and makes a deal with him. He gives the heroine a\
      \ paranormal ability to turn into a ghost and possess living creatures. <br><br>The\
      \ central game mechanic is stealth: since the girl is not protected by anything,\
      \ and her only weapon is an ability to turn into a ghost, players need to move\
      \ covertly and plan every step. The high complexity of the game makes players\
      \ monitor each of their actions closely, since the punishment for being caught\
      \ is a one-bullet death (and if you\u2019re dead you need to go through the\
      \ mission again). This is a challenge for the players that keeps them in constant\
      \ tension.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1294340/extras/key_features.png?t=1608221306\"\
