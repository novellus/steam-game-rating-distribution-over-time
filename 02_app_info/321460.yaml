    review: I really like the game but this DLC is not worth the money paid (and I
      got it at 50% off, I will be trying to refund). Tried to fish at two spots,
      both were buggy and very irritating. First, I was stuck between the rods so
      couldn't move at all. The second i could walk fine however at no position could
      I cast. Tried for a while and just got frustrated. Wouldn't recommend Foundry
      Dock.
