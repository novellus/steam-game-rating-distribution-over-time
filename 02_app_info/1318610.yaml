    short_description: As you are having a rest in your humble abode you have the
      urge that something is present, something dangerous. Now you trust the urge
      and decide it's time to leave. You've been pushing your luck for too long down
      here. As you walk to exit this place you once called home, your urge becomes
      a reality.
