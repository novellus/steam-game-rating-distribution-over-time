It’s actually metaphorical, making you ‘look back’ on things, such as looking back on the fact that you saw the £0.79 price tag and still thought it’d be a good idea. Looking back on the fact that you wasted storage on it, looking back on the life decisions that made you open the damn game. Trumpiñata is about looking back. And when you do, you realise how much of a fucking idiot you are.\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1582586820,"timestamp_updated":1582586820,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.444444447755813599","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2s7hvPACcp609AE="}
