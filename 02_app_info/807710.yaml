    short_description: "What I think of as mannequinization is constructing the pose\
      \ from simple 3 dimensional forms that lock together all the way down the body.\
      \ And when you look at all the parts they form what resembles a person. All\
      \ these parts, they\u2019re all separate, but they all connect to the whole."
