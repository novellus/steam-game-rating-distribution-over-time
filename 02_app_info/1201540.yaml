      \ that can be played in both <strong>Singleplayer </strong>and <strong>Multiplayer\
      \ </strong>modes. The game takes place in the paper dungeons known from Book\
      \ of Demons, but its main mechanics revolve around deckbuilding and fast-paced\
      \ tactical turn-based card battles. <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1201540/extras/Hellcard_gif5_600.gif?t=1600068460\"\

      \ /><br><br>In <strong>HELLCARD </strong>we\u2019re planning to support <strong>co-op\
