The story is good, but there are a few bugs in the game. One bug that kept me from beating it, was that it kept locking up  on me during week 50 when I was playing as the girl. The gameplay is tough to figure out on your own since there is no guide to this game (as of yet) so it's hard to figure out what stats you need before events.","timestamp_created":1511329348,"timestamp_updated":1511329348,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmveP8d8CcPL6iwE="}
