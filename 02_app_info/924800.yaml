    review: "If you love Titanic then this game is for you, i love the Titanic myself\
      \ \n\nA really great game lets you dive down to the beautiful RMS Titanic and\
      \ see her not only from the outside but inside to using a ROV you get to see\
      \ what the passengers saw and how beautiful she is, it is a sad sight to see\
      \ such a great ship like this at the bottom of the ocean, but Titanic will live\
      \ on in memories and pictures she is still keeping her secrets to her self,\
      \  you can explore the great Titanic either from her bow or stern and see the\
      \ debris field  when she broke in two, you can also see her mighty engines that\
      \ powered her through the ocean, \n\nThis game is very relaxing i would highly\
      \ recommend this game."
