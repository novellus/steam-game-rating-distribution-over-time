I adore the direction in which this game is taking. I only hope to see more improvements. Thank you for the experience!\n\nI would suggest maybe adding in moving objects to the obstacle courses (Ex. Swinging axes, rotating platforms, )\nor allowing custom built obstacle maps in the future.\n\nStill looking forward to the pause physics button! :D","timestamp_created":1484501975,"timestamp_updated":1484501975,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593303918838500977","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4/c/N0dkCcLXYbw=="}
