    about_the_game: "In this unique action platformer, use Rena's magical 'grappling\
      \ bracelets' to latch onto any surface - not confined to specific 'grapple points',\
      \ you can swing freely through the game's varied environments. You'll come up\
      \ against some fierce foes, but don't fret! By grabbing enemies and tossing\
      \ them into each other, you can make quick work of any threat. Creatively use\
      \ the environment and your enemies' powers against each other to turn the tables\
      \ in your favor! Inspired by the mid-90's action games of legendary developer\
      \ Treasure Co. Ltd, Grapple Force Rena combines the familiar aesthetics of the\
      \ 16-bit era with its own unique brand of grappling gameplay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nYou'll join Rena through 30 challenging courses as she saves her home village\
      \ from the invasion of a mysterious automaton army, diving head-first into adventure\
      \ and finding herself caught up in a grander conspiracy than she may have expected.\
      \ Coming into contact with a cast of colorful characters, enemy and ally alike,\
      \ she'll get closer and closer to unwrapping the mysteries of her own arcane\
      \ artifact and those of others - and learn just what it takes to be a real hero!"

    review: 'listen a lot of the time i will put ultra hd 4k effort into my reviews
      but i dont think it will be necessary this time. other people do this too so
      yknow just check their reviews.

      there is a mini boss fight in this game towards the very end and an achievement
      tied to it that is in of itself worth the price of the game. when you get there
      you will know exactly what i mean. it brings me so much joy. please play the
      game. also theres a demo if you''re unsure so be sure to check that out and
      then probably play the full thing.'
