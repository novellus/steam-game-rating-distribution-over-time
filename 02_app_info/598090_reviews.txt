The game concept seems fine, the artwork is nice as well, but the game has technical issues which nerved me. I had to switch to low quality graphics and I barely could see some key objects which were needed in order to advance in the game. The grassy room part seems to be bugged as well, as I did everything I could but the puzzle was never solved. I bought expecting some good indie game to relax and now that I played it I am even more stressed. I would love if the game were fixed so I could finish it :(","timestamp_created":1575251982,"timestamp_updated":1575251982,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw67aV4u4CcN/84AE="}
