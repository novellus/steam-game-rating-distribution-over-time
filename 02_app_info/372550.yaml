    review: "No reviews as of when i'm writing this, and i currently have nothing\
      \ better to do.\n\nThe package is pretty straightforward; it's the official\
      \ soundtrack of the game by Tim Bongiovanni. You can't buy the soundtrack unless\
      \ you have the game, and if you played the game you would've surely heard the\
      \ soundtrack playing in the background, so you would've been able to decide\
      \ wether you liked it or not. Me? I did. I looked on the internet for some easy\
      \ way that i could download it for free from; unfortunately, it wasn't even\
      \ on youtube! Steam Christmas sale came along and the soundtrack was a reasonable\
      \ 50c, so i brought it. \n\nAnd it's what you'd expect. The game soundtrack\
      \ on mp3 files that gets stored in the games folder and which you can listen\
      \ to on the Steam music thing, or whatever else you want to listen to it on;\
      \ it's simple enough to just copy and paste the mp3 files to wherever you want\
      \ aswell if you want to listen to it on your phone or something\n\nTheres no\
      \ point in me saying what i like about it, that's for you to decide when you\
      \ listen to it playing in the background while you play the game; like i said\
      \ earlier, you can only buy the soundtrack if you have the game.\n\nAs for price,\
      \ i think it's ridiculous to pay $3.00 to pay for such a thing, it should earn\
      \ profit, but i think that the price should be lower than that for 14 tracks\
      \ from a game. But that's just me, and that's why i brought it for a low price\
      \ during a Christmas sale; and now i have it, and i don't feel ripped off in\
      \ the slightest way."
