It isn't often one finds a video game available in this langauge and as a language learner, it can be helpful to immerse yourself in the language. This includes taking advantage of entertainment in the language you are learning. \n\nThe language use is great. The game play is straight forward and am looking forward to playing more of this game.While I can understand some of the concerns reagrading the audio track, I would still recommend giving this a shot.","timestamp_created":1511572409,"timestamp_updated":1511627745,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496732026338577271","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47pyC+t8CcIjrjgE="}
