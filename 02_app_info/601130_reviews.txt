It is an arcade style shoot 'em up with 3 different modes. Arcade-style means that your goal is to get to the highest score possible, and when you die... you have to restart. This means there is no real progression, the only progression is in your skills and how far you can get and how high a score you can achieve. I personally enjoy this type of game, but people searching for a compelling story and level progression should probably search elsewhere.\n\nGameplay wise. Spark IS fantastic. The combo system is what makes this game stand out from other shmups. You have access to four different bullets, if you shoot the slower more powerful ones... you get exhausted fast. That means that you have to balance getting the big bullets out there for big combos, and shooting smaller bullets to keep the mobs cleared. When you combine the big bullets with the small bullets, you get COMBOS. Combos are what make Spark great, there are so many different combos, every time I play I feel like i am discovering new and better ways to destroy enemies. Also, it seeing the colorful explosions of bullets all across the screen is great and reminds me of fire works. \n\nThe game is very difficult if you are not a shmup player. It seems to be balanced around knowledge of the combo system, so if you are not using combos it is likely you will get overwhelmed very fast. This can lead to a frustrating learning curve. After you get some combos/super combos down, the game feels more like a traditional shmup and is more about dodging and hitting big combos than anything. When you get to that point, it is super satisfying... but the road leading to that can be VERY hard for new players.\n\nPROS:\n\n[list]\n    [*] Awesome and unique concept with the combo system.\n\n    [*] Good enemy variety\n\n    [*] High skill ceiling\n\n    [*] AMAZING SOUNDTRACK (seriously I love it)\n\n[/list]\n\nCONS:\n\n[list]\n    [*] Long tutorial\n\n    [*] Difficult learning curve\n\n    [*] No story or level/character progression\n\n[/list]\n\n\nOverall, I recommend this game. If you don't think its worth the price, just catch it on sale!","timestamp_created":1519763466,"timestamp_updated":1519763506,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtdi97OECfJelmgE="}
