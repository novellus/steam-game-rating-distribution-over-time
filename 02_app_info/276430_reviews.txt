For an early 2000s animal sim game I'd give it 3/5 stars, as I didn't not enjoy playing it.\n\nPros:\nVariety of Animals - Horses, dogs, cats, budgies, rabbits, guinea pigs, and fish \nVariety of Breeds - There are 3-8 breeds of every species available, and they seem pretty evenly balanced\nExtra Challenge - Each mission has two optional challenge objectives, the completion of which will allow you to upgrade the visual appeal of the hotel grounds\nCharacter Customization - You can change certain aspects of your avatar's appearance, this was not possible in the first game\nRunning - Your avatar is allowed to run, an improvement from the first one\nPlaytime - Took me about 50 hours to fully complete the game\nSale Price - Get it on sale with the familyplay bundle and it will cost you about $1.50\n\nCons:\nClothes - Early 2000s fashion went out of style for a reason\nSpeed - There's still no way to speed up time, this can make the first couple of missions drag, but once there are three or more different species there at once it picks up\nNormal Price - I honestly don't know if the asking price of $15 is a moral travesty, or a practical joke\n","timestamp_created":1571946710,"timestamp_updated":1571946710,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv+jU/+0Cd7DV1AE="}
