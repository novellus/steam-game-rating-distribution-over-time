The sound quality is very good except for the horn which is the equivalent of someone having a genteel little cough into a hankie. There are distinct deficiencies forby the horn, however, and it is those that spoil the game for me. Some of the issues have already been mentioned by other players and I won't repeat them here. But I must mention the one, most important impediment for me - the brakes! For the good part of a year I've been trying to master stopping this train safely and efficiently but just can't get the hang of it. I spend so much time fiddling about with the sensitive/ awkward braking system whilst approaching a station, trying to get it right, that I'm distracted from the actual stopping! So I either inadvertently put it into emergency braking mode or I'm overcautious when trying to avoid the emergency brake demon, that I stop short of the full station platform, and then have to start the beastie moving again, or I stop before I even get to the platform. I just can't get it right. The problem for me is that the emergency setting is too easy to slip into. That makes it undriveable for me.
