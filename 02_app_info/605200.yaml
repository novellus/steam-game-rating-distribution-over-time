      - Kursk - Battle at Prochorovka, covers one of largest single tank battle in
      the history of warfare. Approximately 1000 tanks and assault guns met head to
      head near the town of Prochorovka, in a battle that became a desperate close
      range shoot-out which would decide the ultimate success or failure of Operation
      Zitadelle.<br><br>The 2nd SS Panzer Korps began it's attack on July 3rd, and
      spent the next 8 days breaking through the dense Russian defensive positions.
      During the late afternoon and evening of the 11th, they broke through and repulsed
      a counterattack by the Russian 31st Tank Corps. Reorganizing during the night,
      the panzers struck northward before dawn on the 12th. As dawn broke, the lead
      German elements ran head-on into the lead elements of the Soviet 5th Guards
      Tank Army and the battle was on. It was to last all day, in confused and savage
      fighting at close ranges. <br><br>This game recreates that day with the player
      being able to play both as the Russians and Germans or against the AI. Go to

    review: "Llevo mas de 20 a\xF1os jugando a este tipo de juegos. Tengo o he jugado\
      \ al 99% de los juegos de este estilo y NO recomiendo este juego para nada.\
      \ Es simple, tiene poquisimos escenarios, tiene bugs a mansalva, incluso da\
      \ la sensacion de que no esta ni terminado completamente.\nMe parece increible\
      \ que una empresa como MATRIX ponga su nombre en este tipo de software, que\
      \ no llega ni a tercer nivel.\nNO LO RECOMIENDO EN ABSOLUTO. No vale ni para\
      \ aprender."
