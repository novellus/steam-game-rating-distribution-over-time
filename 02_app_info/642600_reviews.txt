Worse still, the controller can't be configured. The game is also too wide for its own good. This is a vertical-scrolling shmup, for Sans' sake.\n\nBut why do I say Yes? All in all, it's not a horrible experience. I think I enjoyed this game, but not wowed by it. The game does feel overstaying its welcome at times. The scoring system is a chore where it's an item collector but no capability to absorb, but the stage design and damage balance is nice enough, with correct ship setup it's a pleasant ride. At best, this game is a mediocre game that is likely to not harm you.\n\nMust you play this game? No. But when you want to play will you wish to have never bought it? No too. Hence, if you're interested in this game, give it a try. Just don't forget to set up the ship to Blade-Angel-Lancer.","timestamp_created":1589735792,"timestamp_updated":1589735792,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2OPokfICcoC3iAI="}
