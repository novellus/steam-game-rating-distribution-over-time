    review: 'It''s an idle game that doesn''t count up when you''re not running it,
      and the interaction of the idle game and the shooter means the scaling feels
      way off. Once I had the Unicorn rocket thing (one of each weapon), all the bosses
      became trivial, and I didn''t care enough to fill out the achievements or even
      bother unlocking the last few buildings.


      All combat was trivial very quickly, except that most times I came into contact
      with another object, I would very quickly (like in a second) have counted sufficient
      collisions to remove my shields and destroy my health. At least the enemies
      that are *supposed* to ram you die on collision, other things can take only
      one or two bullets, but eat *all* you health without noticing when rammed, scraped,
      or even touched at speed. Particularly annoying when this happened with spawns
      that you cannot *shoot*, but can collide with. Probably due to the weird momentum
      physics, which also show up when you have the booster. You can *brake* harder
      than you can boost, which makes it faster to turn by releasing the booster than
      boosting *against your current velocity*.


      There was never really anything between of "just spam bullets, the enemy shots
      are nearly impotent" and "you touched something solid, you''re instantly dead".
      I honestly never really wanted to fight anything, there just wasn''t any reward
      to it (due to idle-game money scaling), nor even a feeling of accomplishment.
      Most of my deaths happened while boosting between planets upgrading buildings,
      and bouncing off an asteroid due to limited up/down vision range, or having
      something spawn directly in my path. In the end, I stopped playing because I
      didn''t really want to play a 2D space version of Desert Bus.


      Picked it up with a massive discount, probably got my money''s worth out of
      it by leaving it running continuously while I played other games, went to work,
      slept, etc. So probably six hours of play and 70 hours of background idling.


      There''s a New Game+ option, but since it says it resets all your stats, it''s
      not clear how it''s different from ''Delete my data''. And frankly, one round
      of this game was more than enough.'
