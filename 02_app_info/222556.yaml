    about_the_game: "The smallest of British Railway\u2019s Standard class locomotives,\
      \ the BR Standard Class 2MT, is now available for Train Simulator.<br><br>Originally\
      \ derived from the Ivatt-designed Class 2MT for the London, Midland and Scottish\
      \ Railway, the BR Standard Class 2MT was designed by R.A. Riddles with a 2-6-0\
      \ wheel arrangement and tender, with some differences to its LMS cousin. Noticeably,\
      \ these included a reduced cab and taller chimney, and copied the tender cab\
      \ from the LMS version to give the crew better visibility, especially when running\
      \ tender first.<br><br>The Class 2MT, often nicknamed \u2018Mickey Mouse\u2019\
      , was also designed to be light in weight so it could operate on mostly light\
      \ laid routes and secondary lines, primarily in the North of England and Scotland,\
      \ proving its versatility to haul passenger and freight trains. The BR 2MT is\
      \ also known as having one of the shortest operating lives of BR steam locomotives,\
      \ being built between December 1952 and November 1956, and being withdrawn a\
      \ few short years later by August 1967. However, four of the class have survived\
