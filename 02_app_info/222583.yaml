    review: Great deal to get this on sale. If you happen to pick up the Class 31
      Ochre livery from marketplace, note that it appears in RSC\Class 31Pack04 and
      is listed in the locos as Classs 31 Ochre (yes, a typo on DTG's behalf...took
      me ages to locate the loco when adding it into a scenario).  Writing that point
      here because it won't allow me to add the review on the marketplace item.
