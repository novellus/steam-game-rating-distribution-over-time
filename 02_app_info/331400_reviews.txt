The gameplay is fairly simple, rolling, slashing, and jumping among other actions, fighting against an array of different monsters, collecting items, finding recipe's, crafting things.. It doesn't have a comprehensive list of items to craft the way a survival game would, but it is still fun. The story is interesting and was good enough to keep me playing for over 90 minutes when I planned on only 15 - 30. All in all not a bad game, could use some work here and there, but wouldn't be a complete waste if you were to happen across it. Not sure if I would pay much for it, but if it were in a bundle, I would recommend giving it a try.","timestamp_created":1432524733,"timestamp_updated":1432524733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.59316408634185791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pJfIxM0Cco6BPQ=="}
