    review: 'Small game in the style of NES games.


      Graphics, sounds and feel of hard difficulty are there, but tedium of trying
      to complete a level many times isn''t. There''s even [spoiler]a way to die without
      losing progress[/spoiler].


      Exploring levels, figuring how to advance and wondering what happens next brings
      joy, and everything is cleverly designed so that "10 seconds" timer doesn''t
      stand on the way of exploration and doesn''t force to speedrun everything without
      properly examining locations.


      These days with so many games to play it''s hard to find time to complete something
      long, and that turns short length into advantage, since it''s an easy way to
      finally get that "I finally completed another game" feeling.'
