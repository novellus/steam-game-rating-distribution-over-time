It's technically not what I would consider a roguelike, more of a resource management game.  You basically have to stay alive by maintaining attributes like hunger, sleep, and health. It also has some RNG elements because the maps and encounters are randomly generated. You will have to harvest different types of food and resources by interacting in different parts of the map. I have a few nitpicks here and there, but I think the game is enjoyable, assuming that you want a text game in the first place. There are a few decent jokes that made me smile, even though the writing is a little weird. I don't like how some of the items have strange names, it makes it difficult to make an informative decision. Perhaps the best part of the game is the soundtrack, all of the sound effects and music complemented the mood very well. My only big problem is that it does not give me any meaningful goals to aim for (aside from unlocking longer day challenges), maybe it needs an endless map with steam leaderboards in order to have some replay value (achievements would be nice as well). \n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ challenging survival elements\n+ nice soundtrack\n+ some funny writing\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\n- needs some UI updates \n- needs more progression goals (leaderboards, achievements) \n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 6/10 [/b]\n\nA game like this might be too niche for most people, but for a text-based survival title, it's not too bad. Needs a few small updates to increase that replay value.","timestamp_created":1557634372,"timestamp_updated":1557636290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.728627979755401611","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3fKW1eoCdbOEwQE="}
