    about_the_game: "The Black Heart is an 1vs1 fighting game in the tradition of\
      \ Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's about another world\
      \ in a parallel dimension where the king and ruler has been murdered. A vicious\
      \ creature called Final has ripped his heart where he stored all the power he\
      \ used to create that world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSix creatures, both from our\
      \ world and the other one, chase this monster to steal the heart for their own\
      \ purposes, since it's told that the bearer of the heart will weild an enormous\
      \ power.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game was all made by 1 person (Andr\xE9s Borghi)\
      \ through 7 years of hard work, including graphics, programming, story, music,\
      \ sound and pretty much everything. This new release celebrates the 10 year\
      \ aniversary, updating the game to modern specs and with visual and audio improvements.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you enjoy pixelated blood, fluid gameplay in Capcom style,\
      \ combos, tragic and epic music, weird pictoric landscapes and complex storytelling\
      \ this is the game for you!"
