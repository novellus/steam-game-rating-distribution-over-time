    review: 'Bought this ages ago and just pulled it from my backlog.  I like the
      concept and this could have been a fantastic little game but there are numerous
      issues with it.


      1. The game crashes..A LOT.  Expect to crash to desktop at least every other
      level.  Plus side is that the levels are short and getting back to where it
      crashed is only a few minutes, at least early on, but it gets really annoying
      really quick.

      2. Controls are terrible.  The controls for Hamilton are fine, WASD to move
      and space to open doors but when you have to use the bird...oh boy, it is supposed
      to mouse click and move but its AI gets stuck on literally everything.  You
      will click to move it to a lever and it smashes its face into a wall for 2-3
      minutes before warping to the lever.

      3. Building on number 2 here, after a few hours of playing I don''t even know
      how to make the bird do things.  Apparently it can taunt enemies.  Instructions
      say middle mouse button but when I click it nothing happens.  Instructions say
      it can teleport, which is listed as a key called "extra__1".  No idea what this
      key is on my keyboard or mouse.  Also in some videos I have watched to get hints
      when I got stuck, they seem to take control of the bird and fly it around taunting
      enemies out of the way.  Nothing in the tutorial or even searching online tells
      me how to control the bird in this manner, I can only make it hover over Hamilton
      and it is limited to the screen centered on Hamilton.

      4. Some of the levels are extremely complex even early on.  Normally I have
      no problem with this and enjoy things on the more difficult side but it is very
      unforgiving.  As in if you step one step off of the optimal (and only) solution
      path three tiles before the exit you are left with no choice but to restart
      the whole level as reaching the exit becomes impossible.


      In summary, avoid this.  There are plenty of better options to occupy your time.'
