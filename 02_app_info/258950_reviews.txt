The game takes place on a bright and sunny island, with a filter over the screen that makes everything darker and fuzzy.  The result is a game where it looks like you're holding a piece of dark plastic over your face. I thought this was a temporary effect that would disappear after the intro, but looking at the screenshots, it seems like it's there for the entire game.\n\nThat, combined with the slow walking speed and the \"find the important item in these garbage piles\" puzzles, made it clear I wouldn't be enjoying my time.  It's a shame, because the potential is there, it just hasn't been realized yet.","timestamp_created":1609635817,"timestamp_updated":1609635887,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+c7x4vYCe//0vwI="}
