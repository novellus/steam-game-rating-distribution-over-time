      \ nature is not the only enemy as Native Americans, claim jumpers, outlaws,\
      \ and several other hostile elements can make your life tough or end it.  Maintain\
      \ good relationships with tribes and individuals to seek medical help, trade,\

      \ an open world with nothing but will power and your own thoughts.  The game\
      \ is based on the Rocky Mountains in the 1800s and every detail is as realistic\
      \ as possible from the price of goods at the time, to the Native American tribes\
      \ present, to the events that can affect your experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      Start out with a few basic tools and explore the wilderness.  Trap small animals,\
      \ skin them, and trade with NPCs for money which you can then use to buy more\
      \ advanced tools.  As you progress in the game you will be able to explore further,\
      \ gain skills, and craft more complex items.  Eventually you will be able to\
      \ create your own home in the mountains and expand further into the wilderness\
      \ for unique adventures."

      out into the wilderness to stake your own claim on the land. Hunt, fish, start

      is not the only enemy as hostile humans can make your life tough or end it.
