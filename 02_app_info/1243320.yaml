    review: If you enjoy the other games by Kempton then you'll like this game too.
      It adds a new kingdom sim mechanic to the story line  that shows up in the Great
      Tournament games, but it is expanded on in this game. the story still has the
      same charm as his other games and the quality of the writing drives you to make
      some difficult decisions which does a good job immersing you into the story.
      It does lack the deep character development like his other Great Tournament
      games. Definitely worth the price if you're a big fan of the series. I would
      recommend.
