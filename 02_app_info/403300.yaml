    about_the_game: "GravBlocks is both a falling-block puzzle game and a match-three\
      \ puzzle game, but is also uniquely different than any other match-three game.\
      \ In the most basic aspect of the game, players change gravity in order to build\
      \ score multipliers, but must do so carefully!  Hazards can appear on every\
      \ surface of the play area, but players are given tools to work against them.\
      \ GravBlocks demands a combination of reflexes and strategy in it's gameplay,\
      \ and as such, eschews the concept of stacking chains found in nearly every\
      \ other game of this genre.<br><br>GravBlocks has five gameplay modes:<br><br>\
      \   <ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <strong>Challenge</strong> \u2014 Classic-style\
      \ puzzle game, blocks fall in, challenge increases, and players play for a high\
      \ score. Players can edit settings for this mode.  <br></li><li>    <strong>Destruction</strong>\
      \ \u2014 The opposite of Challenge, here players are challenged to destroy blocks\
      \ and just clear the screen.  In this mode, Wild blocks open a whole wall of\
      \ Destruction Hazards.<br></li><li>    <strong>Zen</strong> \u2014 Like Challenge,\

      \ \u2014 Story mode pits players against five jerk aliens in an alien abduction\
      \ scenario!  Having reached the limits of what \u201Ctraditional probing\u201D\
      \ can teach them, they now test abductees.  This mode gives players specific\
      \ tasks to complete for each level. </li></ul><br>On top of this, GravBlocks\

    review: "A entertaining experience. \n\nThe inclusion of a manual is great thing.\
      \ It explains in detail how the controls are setup and what each diffent mode\
      \ is and how they play. For a match 3 puzle game it is one of the best I have\
      \ played and for $3.99 I cant argue with the price. Zen mode is truly like crack.\
      \ \n\nManual Below\nhttp://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/403300/manuals/GravBlocks_Manual.pdf?t=1450275074\n\
      \nPros\n- Lots of gameplay modes \n- Many control options\n- Plenty of achievments\n\
      \nCons\n- Graphics could be better\n- Mouse controls on menus can be a bit finicky"
