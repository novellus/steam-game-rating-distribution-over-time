      \ ensure all types of players can enjoy our game to the fullest, that's why\
      \ we have prepared some variations of what our players can expect when they\
      \ start their karting experience. Take a look!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Enjoyable\
      \ Singleplayer</strong></h2>The singleplayer experience is really important\

      \ online multiplayer. If you have what it takes, do not hesitate to show your\
      \ skills to the entire world, but beware, you will be putting your drifting\
      \ ability to the most difficult test! Can't get your friends to play locally?\

      \ Dodge toxic barrels, collect fuel, find hidden letters and even race with\
      \ your friends in a relay race! A lot of game modes, so there\u2019s definitely\

      \  It is true of what they say, the Karters roster is filled with characters\
      \ possessing extraordinary driving skills, but the most important factor which\
      \ is often overlooked is that each member is one of the most determined and\
      \ competitive individuals on the entire Astoc Island. That's what the Gerbil\
      \ Magazine states anyway. Complete a character\u2019s story in the Adventure\

    review: "Having grown up with CTR from childhood when I first saw this on Greenlight\
      \ (When it was still avaliable) it looked amazing. \nI eventually got in contact\
      \ with the developers after and joining the discord 2 years after only finding\
      \ out about it. I was instantly met with a nice Kart racing community that got\
      \ me into sppedrunning one of my most well cherished games. \n\nUnfortunatly\
      \ the events that unfolded with in the last year with the Alpha, Beta, and the\
      \ Release of this game coming out with in the span of less than a year, the\
      \ postponning, and the constant silence from the developers its saddened me\
      \ to see a full game at $25 NZD being sold with it full of bugs and glitches.\
      \ After 2 - 3 years and that's it?!\nNot to say that there were no good things.\
      \ The characters looked original, the mechanics felt right in my opinion, the\
      \ tracks are great to play on with the senery looking amazing and the music\
      \ is great to listen to.\nBut having 3 years of development with it still feeling\
      \ like Beta and even Alpha states at times. It feeling more than dissapointing.\
      \ And thats just the beginning. The tracks still felt glitchy and the A.I felt\
      \ eaither to easy or gets glitched into the track itself... the activitys for\
      \ single player felt...bland if not scarce at best.\n\nI want to keep supporting\
      \ the developers but until the game is accepted by the Kart Racer community\
      \ I can't buy this. I can only hope that in the coming months that actions will\
      \ speak louder than words...."
