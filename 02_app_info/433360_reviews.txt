I really liked the previous game, this feels like a cheap mess released too early without properly being put together to resemble something coherent. On top of that,  nonsensical puzzles with very little explanation so you'll either waste your time trying to understand where is the logic behind it hiding, or you'll find a walkthrough. Waste of time and money.","timestamp_created":1546970674,"timestamp_updated":1546971194,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477707028388977051","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqeSql+gCe7HrtwE="}
