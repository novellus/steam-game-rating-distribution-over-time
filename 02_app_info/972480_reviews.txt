Go and buy Cat Sorter VR instead, which is clearly where this idea was taken from, but fails to deliver in practically every area that made Cat Sorter VR enjoyable.\n\nCat Sorter VR was fun because it was full of bizarre bodyparts from different creatures that you could stick onto your cat. In this game, there are 3 boxes, and all those boxes contain are normal dog heads, normal dog legs, and normal dog tails. So if you want to pay $10 AUD to stick a head, some legs and a tail on a dog body, go for it, but for 99.9% of people, this game will be a tremendous waste of your money.\n\nHard pass.","timestamp_created":1549112862,"timestamp_updated":1549112862,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.591515183448791504","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw08yU1+gCd83ouQE="}
