    review: Super chill game with awesome pixel art and nice music. You don't get
      a lot of explanation or any tips, which I actually enjoy, because you have to
      figure out the stragegy for yourself.  Controls are nice and simple, so it's
      very easy to get into. Overall, I really like this game and I can definetly
      recommend it! :D
