    review: 'The game has an interesting premise, and what there is of it is great.


      Regrettably, there hasn''t been any updates or anything for a couple of months.  I
      waited to write this review to see what the development cycle would be like.


      It''s free, though, so I''ll keep it in my library and hope for updates.'
