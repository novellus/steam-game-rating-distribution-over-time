This game is great if you're looking for something really laid back. It has a cute, light-hearted story; nothing too deep, and the gameplay itself is quite simple. It also has a bit of a Star Trek feel to it. You can definitely tell the creator is a fan.\n\nBasically, you're the captain of a spaceship. You travel from planet to planet  chasing down your threat-to-the-unverse first officer while collecting some alien friends along the way. You can either try to save the universe and win over your second officer, or like me, stab everyone in the back and make it with your first officer~\n\nThe game is pretty non-violent. Even your strongest weapon is actually just a relocator device. You \"fight\" enemies by walking into them. If that enemy poofs, you've won. If your weapon isn't strong enough, you'll get bumped back and take on a little damage. \n\nHonestly, you can probably just edge around most enemies. They won't chase you, but I'd advise having a strong enough weapon just to avoid the nuissance of it. (There's no need to bother with shields.)  \n\nThe game offers some fun, self-aware humour. It's filled with amusing, silly dialogue and options.\n\nOne thing that particularly stood out to me was the unique option to choose your own gender and pronouns. There isn't the typical drop down list, so whatever it is you'd like your character to be referred as, you can literally type in anything. \n\n\n---\n\nIN A NUTSHELL VERSION\n\n- gameplay simple, story light-hearted and not too deep, great if you're looking for something laid back\n- non-violent, focuses more on character interactions than combat\n- choose your own gender and pronouns\n- has some fun, self-aware humour\n\n\n\n* In good concience, I do feel I need to give fair warning... This game is very social justicey. This is just one extra thing to take into consideration when buying the game, because it's not subtle. If you're all for that, cool! Get the game. If not, the game still has it's charm, but it's just the one extra thing to keep in mind.  \n\n\nEither way, I think the game was fairly priced. Really. It costs nothing. I enjoyed it's humour throughout and I genuinely hope more people will try it out~ Good job to the creator.","timestamp_created":1482483730,"timestamp_updated":1496382284,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.633894741535186768","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjrTVs9wCe7T2bA=="}
