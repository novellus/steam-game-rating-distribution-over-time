    about_the_game: The star in your home system has gone supernova. You must lead
      a caravan of what's left of your race and culture to safety through hostile
      alien territory. Explore new worlds, collect blueprints to build towers that
      will protect your civilization, upgrade your ship's systems and towers to survive
      and find a new settlement.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul">    <li><strong>Permadeath</strong>
      - You've got one chance to lead your people to safety. One wrong move and your
      civilization will be lost forever.<br>    </li><li><strong>Procedurally Generated
      Levels &amp; Loot</strong> - No two playthroughs will be exactly the same. The
      enemies you face and the items you receive will vary with each encounter.<br>    </li><li><strong>Upgrade
      Your Towers &amp; Ship</strong> - The Blueprints you receive that allow you
      to build towers can be upgraded! Each upgrade increases the stats of the tower,
      key threshold upgrades will change and enhance the functionality. Your ship's
      stations can also be upgraded to provide benefits during combat and when crafting.<br>    </li><li><strong>Compete
      on the Leaderboard</strong> - At the beginning of each level you're able to

      leaderboard! However, don't bite off more than you can chew!</li></ul>
