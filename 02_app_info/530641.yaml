      acclaimed tactical computer wargame Conflict of Heroes: Awakening the Bear,

      to Conflict of Heroes as well as full multiplayer support, allowing those campaigns
      to be played head to head using the integrated multiplayer server.<br><br>Army
      Group Center, under the command of Field Marshal Fedor von Bock, fought a series
      of pocket battles as it pushed towards Moscow in the summer of 1941.<br><br>The
      Army Group consisted of the 4th Army ( von Kluge ) and the 9th Army (Strauss
      ) in the center.<br><br>The wings of the Army Group were the fast moving armor
      and motorised units of the two Panzer Groups.  Panzer Group 3 under Hermann
      Hoth formed the Northern wing.  Panzer Group 2 under Heinz Guderian formed the
      Southern wing.  The two Panzer Groups smashed through the Russian defenses and
      performed a series of pincer movements, trapping large groups of enemy forces.<br><br>The
      speed with which these forces moved and the surprise that their appearance often
      created in the enemy often made them seem like ghosts, appearing in areas where
      no enemies were thought to be to strike suddenly at a flank or encircle a strong
      position.  Speed, coordination, concentration and combined arms allowed the
      Wehrmacht to control the initiative and keep the Red Army reeling.<br><br>Still,
      the forces of the Panzer Groups were often stretched thin. Some Soviet units
      fought to escape, while others fought to open the pockets to save their comrades.
      Many battles were chaotic and the front lines shifted as the battles evolved.
      In the end, hundreds of thousands of Russian soldiers surrendered, and entire
