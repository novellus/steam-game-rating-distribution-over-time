    review: "So as the name suggests, you basically pelt kids with food- and they\
      \ will do it to you as well. You start off with a slingshot, and powerups (extra\
      \ life, enemy reveal, ammunition for other more powerful weapons, and so on)\
      \ drop and gives you an added advantage. Most of the time you're shooting from\
      \ an elevated platform, but you can also duck behind cover to avoid getting\
      \ plastered. The further your target is, the more mindful you have to be of\
      \ your aim, since physics does have its role here. \n\nWhile this game is good\
      \ for kids, I particularly like how the game can be surprisingly challenging\
      \ as you progress; a surprise to be sure, but a pleasant one. The only minor\
      \ issue is the sensitivity isn't sensitive enough even at maximum. But otherwise,\
      \ it's a cute game with surprising complexity to it. I'm interested to see how\
      \ it'll be when the VR version is released!"
