At the time, I was nervous about interrupting his evening, and I did not keep him answering every possible question. It was a memorable experience, but I still wanted to know more about what he thought about his own game. This video is basically all those details, with some pretty nice video clips running in the background. And the cost? well, think of it as buying Ian a pint at the local tavern, while you hear his story.","timestamp_created":1553725353,"timestamp_updated":1555809961,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":44,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.782503485679626465","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4woDgnuoCecT6vQE="}
