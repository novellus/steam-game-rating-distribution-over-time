When PBR came around programs like Quixels nDo 2 & dDo came out first and yeah they are still neck and neck with Substance Painter in terms of functionality and power. I used Substance Painter 1 for 32 hours, textured a few assets but was not really impressed as I was already using dDo which as I understood better thus going back to dDo rendered me better results. \n\nIn Comes Substance Painter 2 and I thought to myself \"ok, let’s give it a real shot this time around\" 150 hours and atleast 20-30 textured assets later it’s my program of choice right now. I've gone back to dDo every once in a while for specific assets and just to brush up but Substance Painter 2 is my go-to tool. Not only for PBR Painting either! There baking tools are flawless and I'm getting better results using the inbuilt baking tool with less errors then I would with xNormals which was unexpected as xNormals has been the industry standard for a long while.\n\nOn to the main features though, The Texture Painting. Defiantly the most powerful of all software’s I've used. PBR Materials & Smart Materials are a great base to work from and provide a lot of different filters, masks and affects you can alter to your liking or add/create from scratch. Everything works in layers like photoshop with masks that you can also edit directly with brushes without having to go back and forth like dDo. You can even undo your mask changes! CRAZY RIGHT. \nYou can create normal map decals in photoshop and import them into substance to then paint directly onto your mesh in 3D or 2D views. There are a few different particle brushes which give some nice but sometimes unexpected results that might not work as you expect depending on the asset, its size and both mesh/normal map angles. The Normal map painting works as expected, you set your decal, scale it and add where you want. Works great, good for adding lots of quick details really quick that would normally take a long time to do in 3D modelling. \n\nSome of the achievements are still bugged and have been since Painter 1 was released. Secondly the software is so damn stable I can't even do the report bugs achievement unless I just send them messages like \"hey, your program is pretty neat. Keep it up ;)\" \nIf you are going to add achievements to your product because steam offers the support for them please make them atleast function... Yes this might not be considered a game but as both and artist and a gamer I try to get the most out of my products, achievements included.\n\n[h1]9.6/10[/h1]\n[i]- If this program was a canvas & I was Bob Ross it would be a our Standard old 18 by 24\" canvas covered with a nice thin coat of the liquid hwite and its nice and wet and it's ready to go[/i]","timestamp_created":1479727344,"timestamp_updated":1529644834,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551020383834838867","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzfv7kuQCcLb7ZQ=="}
