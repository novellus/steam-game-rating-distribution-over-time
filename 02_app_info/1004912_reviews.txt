The only time I see its use, its to revive on the spot, instead of restarting the map. It takes a % of your gold pool (which is shared for all characters), so the firts time you die, It will hit you hard.\n\nI have yet to explore the end game (invasions, TOC, relic hunt) to see if gold has any use at all in thewhole game.","timestamp_created":1595427971,"timestamp_updated":1595427971,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548750221729278564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+9u6u/MCesL0lgI="}
