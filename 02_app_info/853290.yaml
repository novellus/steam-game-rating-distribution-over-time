    review: "Worth noting: this is a SMALL fighter, much more along the lines of the\
      \ original Nidhogg than the lines of a traditional fighting game or a character\
      \ brawler. There is no character select, and there are only six stages.\n\n\
      That said, this game is remarkable for just how much game there is in these\
      \ limited elements. The claws are each manipulated using the analog sticks,\
      \ which leads to an incredibly expressive array of options on attack and defense.\
      \ Fights play out wildly differently, and (as seen in the video) can be very\
      \ short and intense. When I sit down with Claw Breaker, I often end up putting\
      \ in 50-60 rounds, since matches are so brief and varied. This also means that\
      \ \u2014 despite having just one character \u2014 you'll end up feeling like\
      \ you're playing many different \"matchups\" since different players will build\
      \ very different skillsets and take very different strategic approaches.\n\n\
      Overall, this game rocks, but don't go in thinking it'll have a giant swath\
      \ of content or ANY single-player material whatsoever. What you'll get is an\
      \ immensely entertaining 1v1 dueling game with delightful gameplay and hilarious\
      \ consequences. It's got a narrow scope, but within that scope, it's a total\
      \ gem."
