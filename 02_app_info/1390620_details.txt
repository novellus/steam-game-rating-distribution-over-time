The Psionic Burst Projector is a prototype smart weapon that would concentrate psionic power in a powerful pulse that would look for its own targets beyond the first one it's directed at hitting them with focused telekinetic energy. The weapon has been since banned for use on Earth, but the Order felt it would give the Argo expedition a good advantage should it encounter any resistance.","about_the_game":"Get a wealth of additional content to upgrade your Drone Swarm base game to “Drone Swarm Deluxe Edition”<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDiscover the official “Drone Swarm Deluxe Upgrade”, bringing fresh content to your game.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDrone Swarm Deluxe Upgrade includes:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n1.
