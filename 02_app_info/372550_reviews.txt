You can't buy the soundtrack unless you have the game, and if you played the game you would've surely heard the soundtrack playing in the background, so you would've been able to decide wether you liked it or not. Me? I did. I looked on the internet for some easy way that i could download it for free from; unfortunately, it wasn't even on youtube! Steam Christmas sale came along and the soundtrack was a reasonable 50c, so i brought it. \n\nAnd it's what you'd expect. The game soundtrack on mp3 files that gets stored in the games folder and which you can listen to on the Steam music thing, or whatever else you want to listen to it on; it's simple enough to just copy and paste the mp3 files to wherever you want aswell if you want to listen to it on your phone or something\n\nTheres no point in me saying what i like about it, that's for you to decide when you listen to it playing in the background while you play the game; like i said earlier, you can only buy the soundtrack if you have the game.\n\nAs for price, i think it's ridiculous to pay $3.00 to pay for such a thing, it should earn profit, but i think that the price should be lower than that for 14 tracks from a game. But that's just me, and that's why i brought it for a low price during a Christmas sale; and now i have it, and i don't feel ripped off in the slightest way.","timestamp_created":1482548676,"timestamp_updated":1482548676,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.456431537866592407","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2rCyl9kCccWCbQ=="}
