This pack is disappointing. First the good, a handful of the models are really GREAT (looking at you cement mixer, though for some reason I think I have seen you before...? )! Now the bad, you know what I don't need for my game and you probably don't either? more barrels and boxes, which seems to be the basis of alot of the models in this pack. For the price they want ($30) it should all be high quality (AAA or close like they say) all the way around. For instance the 20 foot shipping container sides are weakly textured. The cement pipe (you cant even enter it?). Everything is also (\"3d new bright and shiny\"). I have never seen ANY construction site this clean ever. They are a dirty, dusty environment (This complaint could be due to the current state of lighting in Gameguru). So I would advise you to avoid, or maybe buy it when it's really on sale. If they (TGC) are honestly interested in adding to these sets this one could really do with a foundation and maybe a large truck or 2, maybe a beatup pickup truck, warning signs, managers office?? etc.","timestamp_created":1558912570,"timestamp_updated":1558912570,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54517132043838501","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqcKb++oCeJ6JwgE="}
