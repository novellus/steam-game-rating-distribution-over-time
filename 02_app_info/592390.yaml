    review: "Quick review: 7/10\nThis game manages to escape the holy trinity of awful\
      \ (early access, zombies, survival) and do some fun things, its a long way towards\
      \ a complete experience but the game is fun so far.\n\n\nLong review:\nA very\
      \ fun game. As usual, the main problem is the lack of players. I played be myself\
      \ for 30 min, and I knew this was a great game. The graphics are good, weapons\
      \ feel punchy and the pump shotty is a beast. I bought it for my friend straight\
      \ away. The maps are fine, there is a really small map which is really hard,\
      \ there is also a metro map, and the best map is a town in the forest map. It\
      \ has multiple regions and Is the only map to utilise one of the biggest pros\
      \ of this game, crafting. I have played for over an hour and setup an epic base\
      \ with turrets. It is sad that the game uses crafting and basebuilding only\
      \ in one map. I would suggest the developer to use it in all three maps. You\
      \ can craft in every map, but the problem is the complete lack of materials\
      \ in those maps. I have played this game solo and I can tell this is a very\
      \ fun experience. But there are cons as well. \n\nHere is the list of things\
      \ that need improving:\n\n-use the crafting system more\n\n- more zombie variety\
      \ (I only saw two types of different zombie skins)\n\n-Gun attachments and the\
      \ possibility of building a gun upgrade bench. \n\n-Material supply drops. (\
      \ After every night a possibility to collect materials from a supply drop on\
      \ a random location on the map)\n\n-Longer days( days too short.)\n\n-Optimisation\
      \ ( I was playing on max settings with rx vega 56 and i7 8700k and was still\
      \ struggling to keep 60 fps.)\n\n-Zombies getting started in doorways due to\
      \ high count\n\n-zombie physics (something like this would be very cool, with\
      \ zombies climbing over each other like in \"world war Z\" the movie)\n\n-vehicle\
      \ crafting (if you build a vehicle you can escape and therefore win)\n\n-Add\
      \ collision to trees (you can walk through them right now)\n\nThese are just\
      \ some ideas and improvements that can be added to the game.\n\nThe developer\
      \ did a very good job with this game and I am looking forward to future updates.\
      \ \nIf you are not sure about this buy it, play it for an hour if you dont like,\
      \ just refund it. \n\nMy vote for this game is positive, and I wish the developer\
      \ luck in the further development. \n\nComment for questions and discussions\
      \ in the comment section.\n\n\n\n\n"
