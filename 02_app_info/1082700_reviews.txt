This game is not worth the asking price.\n\nThe game is pure nonsense. The self-awareness jokes are out of place and completely random.\n\nThere is no pacing, at all. The game is unnecessarily obtuse and convoluted in almost every facet of its writing and aesthetic. All of the clashing elements, which feel intentional, do not function well together and make the game incredibly difficult to follow or mentally gel together. The designs of the characters do not factor into their personality or habits at all. They don't even seem to have a point or theme behind them. Beyond their interpersonal conflicts with each other, they are just \"wacky and random\" much like the game itself.\n\n[spoiler] To give you an idea of how ridiculous this game is in terms of its pacing alone. One of the teachers is a craftsman who has somehow managed to create VR tech in this half post-apocalyptic world of multi time period settings [take that as you will]. This is introduced for a brief second in a scene, not explained and quickly tossed aside to have you listen to more nonsense. Then, in the second chapter/act, it turns out his VR tech is actually ripping a hole in space-time and causing the characters to really be entering other parallel worlds in the multiverse [which was not so subtlely joked about earlier on in the most unnaturally forced way]. Sh*t just happens like this every other scene with no rhyme or reason. No buildup. No explanation. Just nonsense. [/spoiler]\n\nI think the worst part is that this is supposed to be a visual novel, which tends to center around heavy involvement of the player character. You barely partake at all and for much of the early game spend a majority of the time being a background piece with no involvement beyond being a captive audience to the nonsense of the other characters. It is torture.\n\nThis is one of the worst experiences I have ever had the displeasure of suffering and I do not wish this on my worst enemy. Most of my hours come from leaving this up in the background while I take breaks to not lose my sanity or from just staring at the screen struggling to process what the hell is going on.\n\nIf you are reading this review, just go read anything on fanfiction.net I can't believe I am saying this, but doing so would be a more comprehensive and fulfilling experience.\n\nAt least the Goodbye Volcano High trailer was cohesive. All this game does is make me greatly reconsider whether or not we have all evolved as a species or if some of us literally animated straight out of the dumpsters people thought our teen moms dropped us into.\n\nEdit: Artwork isn't bad, just wish it was more thematic or relevant or conducive to the characters. Game is occasionally funny, albeit inadvertently, as well.\n\nEdit 2: Finished the game. I stand by what I said. It is a colossal piece of sh*t.","timestamp_created":1604677983,"timestamp_updated":1604718087,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tdmp0PUCc4LarAI="}
