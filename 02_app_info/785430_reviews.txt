I see a TON of effort and probably a lot of heart and soul put into this game, but I can't recommend this as it is now for even $5, much less $25. \n\nClunky movement.  Extremely user UN-friendly.  Text dialogue between your man character \"Zak\"/\"Zack\" is way too small and cramped together to read easily.  Terrible UI.  This game is just a mess right now.  Ugh.  I feel bad, but it needs a lot of work and polish and I hope the dev(s) continue to work on it.\n\nDeveloper(s)..  What are you thinking?  You should know better than to sell a game in this poor of a state.  I get that you probably put a TON of time into this game, but why didn't you spend 5 minutes programming ESC key functionality?  \n\n----------------------\n\nIMPORTANT MESSAGE TO THE DEVELOPER(S):\n\nListen, as an indie developer myself of games right here on Steam, I totally know how much this negative review hurts.  It hurts like hell.  The first negative review I got on my first Steam game \"Rock 'N Roll\" made me initially wanna both cry and throw up.  \n\nPlease DO NOT let this negative review make you lose any heart or passion for this game or making future games.  Instead, do what I did with my first negative review.  Learn from this, and use it to make your game 5x better.  Remember and understand that if I had not been honest with my review, if I had not shown you and people in my video review the bad parts of your game and gave it a positive review.. that would have been a HUGE disservice to you.  Now you know that it still needs a lot of work and where you need to focus that work.  \n\nI genuinely LOVE what I see here.  This game holds a TON of promise and I look forward to seeing it as it develops further.  \n\nWith that, please.. for your own sake, not my sake or anyone elses sake.. for your own sake, please consider dropping your price to $15 USD.  The reason i strongly suggest this is really because Stardew Valley is your biggest competition and it's priced at $15.  Charging any more is only going to KILL your sales.  In fact, if I could recommend a price to you with my experience, I'd suggest $12.99.  I honestly think you'll sell 10x as many copies at $12.99 as $24.99.  And in the end, while I understand your game is probably going to be worth the $25.. you will likely make 5x as much money on this game asking around $12.99 as opposed to $24.99.  I hope this review helps you and your game succeed.  ..And I will re-review it in a couple of months to see where it's at then.  I honestly wish you and this game all the success in the world... and this is the first time I've ever made statements like \"this\" on any game with over 700 reviews now!  ...That should tell you something!!   - Keep up the good work!\n\n---------------------\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED... but perhaps put this game on your watch list as I will do.  It's clunky, frustrating, and just not fun in its launch day state.. sadly.\n\nIf you want to support this/these indie developers who are obviously pouring their hearts into this game, definitely give it a purchase and perhaps help make suggestions and give your ideas in their forums to help them mold their game to perfection.  =)  If there is any un-finished or un-polished game on Steam that should get support, in my opinion.. this is the one!","timestamp_created":1603052163,"timestamp_updated":1604383870,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.686730623245239258","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww+GuxvUCftbaqAI="}
