    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Detective Hayseed</h2><br>The list of Oscar
      winners has been stolen as part of a nefarious plot to overturn the established
      Hollywood order. Our hero has to struggle through a series of tests and tasks
      in order to uncover the clues as to who has done it. And, of course, to stop
      him carrying out his threat to blow up the entire Oscars ceremony. Along the
      way he's going to need your help to do everything from waking up to take his
      orders, free the space captain from his bondage to working out how to get Xanax
      into pirhanas. Each test passed reveals more of the necessary clues leading
      to the successful identification of the villain and his plan. And, of course,
      his apprehension and the foiling of his dastardly plot.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><br><ul
