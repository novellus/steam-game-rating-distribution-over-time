    review: "-Feels horribly unfinished\n-Buggy\n-MUCH better boxing out there\n-Blocking\
      \ seems like it's based on luck, not position of hands\n\n1/5\n\nThis game feels\
      \ like an EA game the dev released far before ready. The boxing is sub-par,\
      \ the opponents are bland and boring, hitboxes are terrible, which in a boxing\
      \ game you need to have a good hitbox. Really everything in this game that you\
      \ need to have good in order to be a playable boxing game, is not good. \n\n\
