    short_description: In the beginning, there were Gods. Long imprisoned and forgotten
      in the Temples of the Citadel, they have syphoned the life essence from the
      world in their final act of vengeance. A lone Knight embarks upon a quest to
      slay the Gods and restore the balance. One warrior. One sword. Against them
      all.
