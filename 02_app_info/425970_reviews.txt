Although at times it drags, and other movies have already trod this path, Come on Down still manages to – if for a moment – create some comedic drama in a small town. For the current sale price, it is worthwhile if you have some time to burn and not much else going on. \n\nAlthough the settings and scene may feel familiar from other films, here they allow the cast and actors to explore their connections and build a tentative, but enjoyable, rapport with each other. The clear breakout star is Mark the Manager (played by none other than Jon Robert Stafford), who succeeds in turning his character into that one person we all know and hate. This can be seen quite clearly in the motivational speech Stafford gives at the start of the film, ending with the inspiring and memorable “GO TEAM”. \n\nUltimately, despite its various shortcomings, Come on Down still manages to entertain for the short time it is in front of you. I wouldn’t trumpet this movie from the mountaintops, but certainly did pass the time. Watch it when it’s available on sale, or just look for the inevitable gifs that will be created.","timestamp_created":1474937365,"timestamp_updated":1474943915,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525024533271789551","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v8LgtNcCeueNYg=="}
