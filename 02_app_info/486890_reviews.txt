I saw the reviews and found that Windows Central rated it 4/5 for the XBox. So for under $5 I decided to give it a try....and I'm glad I did. Frantic, Crazy, Chaotic, Frustrating. I kept dying....and dying....and dying. But, I kept trying....and trying....just one more level...one more....one more. Crazy Fun Game....even has a global leaderboard.","timestamp_created":1478215889,"timestamp_updated":1478215889,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563705205917358398","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ho6iltgCe7LeZA=="}
