It's probably the most realistic of the 4 DLC coasters.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice and the coaster has some nice turns and takes you down to near the water and high up into the air.\n\nOne thing I did notice it that this one more than others shows up the aliasing jaggy lines. There really could do with being an anti-aliasing option to smooth out the pixelisation.\n\nI would have liked a few 'events' in this, I know they are trying to do realistic but there must be things that could be added to spice it up, like animals in the woods or something.\n\nStill going to recommend but only just, in the hope that we see more improvements, but I'd say get this maybe only if you are buying them all in a bundle.","timestamp_created":1579093271,"timestamp_updated":1579093271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4neTS1O8CeL6J7AE="}
