In the age of visual sensory overload you need games that can operate spaces, pauses, lacunae. Twisted and minimalist, artsy and absurdist, this scroller-RPG is an eye-candy for those who like dark, Lynchean art.\nI like this graphic style immensely. The DLC is also excellent!","timestamp_created":1575653072,"timestamp_updated":1575653072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyLuP7u4CcfW34gE="}
