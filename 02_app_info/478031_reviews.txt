It looks very nice. The sounds etc are very good, but it drops the ball down the center too often. In my last game it dropped straight down or off to the left 3 times in a row and 4 balls out of 5. I'm not here to argue that it's unrealistic, I'm just saying it's not at all fun and I don't enjoy it.","timestamp_created":1606558297,"timestamp_updated":1606558297,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4usWVh/YCdPaptAI="}
