    about_the_game: "Selected by the fickle finger of fate, Abe\u2122, floor-waxer\
      \ first class for RuptureFarms, was catapulted into a life of adventure when\
      \ he overheard plans by his boss, Molluck the Glukkon\u2122, to turn Abe and\
      \ his fellow Mudokons into Tasty Treats as part of a last-ditch effort to rescue\
      \ Molluck's failing meat-packing empire.                                   \
      \             <br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t                        During his escape\
      \ from RuptureFarms, Abe received a vision from the mysterious Big Face, showing\
      \ Abe that he must not only rescue his fellow Mudokons, but also protect all\
      \ of Oddworld's creatures from the predatory Magog Cartel.                 \
      \                               <br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t                       \
      \ After completing arduous Temple trials, and journeying across a wasteland\
      \ with his friend Elum, Abe was granted the awesome power of the Shrykull. Returning\
      \ to RuptureFarms, Abe destroyed the foul slaughterhouse, rescued his buddies,\
      \ and brought down some righteous lightning on top of Molluck's pointy head."
