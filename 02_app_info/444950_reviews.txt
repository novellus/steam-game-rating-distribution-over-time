A lot of different items for sale:\n a. normal items that you can buy from several shops, some shops are rare and available only temporarily\n b. items that you have to farm for in different locations\n c. items that you can grow on your own farm (like Ish-World egg that you can get if you buy some chickens for your farm)\n d. items that you can make after you sell enough of other items (like selling 200 of Steamed rice allows you to make Ish-World riceballs and Rice porridge from it)\n e. items that you can make after you sell a certain combinations of other items (like selling 50 Chileroo tofu and 50 Ish-World clams allows you to auto-buy Chileroo miso soup)\n2. Progress in each item\n a. at 100 items sold you become able to auto-buy this item in the morning\n b. at 200 items sold some items allow you to use them to produce other items\n c. at 500 items sold you become able to auto-buy this item at any time when amount reaches 0\n d. at 999 items sold you can use some items on altar to gain extra boosts.\n3. Different workers accumulate merits by doing their job and become able to do other better jobs (not sure if it is possible to upgrade workers, they seem to be stuck with the same skills forever)\n4. No rush. You have to pay about 2k each month, but it is not hard to get that amount and it seems it does not increase later, on the opposite you repay the debt and payment decrease, so you can just focus on developing\n\nThere are some problems with the game though.\n1. Translation may look confusing so it's better to experiment with different options and ask on forum if you are confused to see if someone else managed to understand the game better and can explain some problem. Personally I did not find this too big a problem, enjoyed exploring and experimenting\n2. Crashes happen often and there is no autosave system, so you tend to lose your progress ocassionally if you don't save often. On the other hand all crashes that I've seen are reproducable so if you report them with exact steps on how to reproduce them there is a chance that devs will fix them. Also because they need certain steps to be reproduced you can just avoid those steps and walk around the crash (for example, I had a crash when one guy was requesting a Healthy herb, I just removed the herb from the storage and the crash disappeared. did not complete a quest though). I got another crash that blocked my progress - it happens at the beginning of a day when certain person comes to request an umbrella, so there is no way to avoid it.\n\nOverall I think the game deserves positive review due to interesting mechanics although it still requires some patches.","timestamp_created":1476553068,"timestamp_updated":1476553231,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.588547825813293457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qcnb5NcCc5yxYw=="}
