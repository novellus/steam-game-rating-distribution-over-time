I went into it thinking the game would be better. I kept it hoping that there might be some improvements to make this game actually worth playing and that just proved to be my biggest mistake in the world. I regret buying it and wish I return what I'm stuck with but can't. For anyone looking at it, I would recommend seeing if there's a demo available first so you can try it out before spending your money on it, that's a much better idea.","timestamp_created":1610057976,"timestamp_updated":1610057976,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjOG77/YCd5GywQI="}
