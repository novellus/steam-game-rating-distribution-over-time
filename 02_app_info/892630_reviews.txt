This review will cover Mojo: Hanako and it's Deluxe edition. Mojo: Hanako is technically a free demo or sneak peak of what the Mojo series has to offer and as such there is not much to say about it. The game has two major features. A series of progressively difficulty 2048 puzzle boards and artwork of an anime style woman who progressively undresses as you advanced through the game and that's about it. There are a few twists and new rules to help make the game a bit more complex, but nothing much.\n\nThe music is nice for it's minimalist style and the controls are easy to understand. After playing a few other 2048 games I can tell you that this type of game can range from casual to just outright impossible depending on the board and the developers programming. 2048 is such an heavy RNG puzzle style that sometimes it feels more like failing than solving a puzzle. Thankfully Mojo: Hanako is very much a intro to intermediate game where a new player of 2048 can learn the game and still find success. \n\nHanako will offer you about 30 minutes to an hour of simple game-play with, in my opinion, nice adult artwork for free. I've said it before but I do like the artist and their work so this is purely just my opinion. This is also a free game and honestly giving this game a bad review, when it's taken nothing from you but a few minutes of your time, just... I don't know. It's not like its those religious scam artists you meet on colleges who offer you 'free' books but than demand a $20 donation. \n\nThe only way this game will take your money is if you buy the Collectors/Deluxe versions and those versions make it very clear they they are for supporting the developer and nothing else. They add no extra game-play elements, but do offer you some different in game artwork. Seems like a waste of few bucks, but again, I like the artwork so getting more of it is nice. \n\nActual downsides, Hanako doesn't offer a level select after you finish it like the other games do, a proper gallery mode would be nice in these games, and thing that I've noticed that bothers me. Mojo Hanako, XXX, and Mia have dev support deluxe modes that if bought offer new artwork, but the new art replaces the old art meaning you can no longer view the original game art unless you uninstall your Deluxe DLC which is a huge hassle. Again, the need for a proper gallery mode would be nice, but the game is old so that's unlikely. If you like 2048 or if you like Gal style it's a fine game.","timestamp_created":1606529695,"timestamp_updated":1606529695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40beohvYCdPeMtAI="}
