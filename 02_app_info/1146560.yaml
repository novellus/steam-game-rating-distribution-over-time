    review: "Drawn Down Abyss is a solid little game with an interesting premise but\
      \ flawed execution. The art is good and the music is fittingly mysterious/wild,\
      \ if a bit repetitive. The world art does get a bit old, and there aren't that\
      \ many unique layouts, but it's enough for  the length of time you'll probably\
      \ be playing.\n\nThe core gameplay loop has a lot of potential. Your first run\
      \ has you starting a new \"deck\" that will persist between runs. From this\
      \ deck, you will be dealt a handful of cards at the beginning of each floor.\
      \ More cards can be added to you hand from your deck by either picking them\
      \ up off the ground or playing a \"draw\" card. The goal of each floor is to\
      \ simply survive until the trapdoor to the next opens. At the start of a new\
      \ floor, you can choose to change your deck using one to two cards \"dropped\"\
      \ from the previous roundd. \n\nThere are three general types of cards that\
      \ enhance your character: movement, combat, or defense. Movement cards will\
      \ usually add jumps, dashes, or teleports. Combat cards will be either permanent\
      \ or timed damage-dealing attacks. Defense cards could be healing or shields.\
      \ Cards are played by from your hand and cost different amount of mana. You\
      \ can get more mana either via timed regeneration or combat. \n\nThe issues\
      \ start to appear with the enemy AI and placement. At the start of a new floor,\
      \ it seems like a fixed number of enemies spawn. Their variety is fairly good,\
      \ but they can broadly categorized into two types: ground based, and air based.\
      \ Air based enemies will usually fly directly at you or hover, while ground\
      \ based enemies will typically fire projectiles or leap if within range. The\
      \ problem with this is that once ground enemies reach the bottom of the map,\
      \ they're basically stuck there until they die. Air-based enemies will follow\
      \ the player, but are typically pretty easy to dodge. It's fairly simple to\
      \ abuse this mechanic to just wait out the timer and hop to the next floor.\n\
      \nTo make things more interesting, you may be tempted to try the combat route\
      \ instead. The issue with this is that there doesn't seem to be any reason to\
      \ kill enemies and, in some cases, you're actively punished for doing so. Releasing\
      \ a 5 mana attack will almost never get you a return of more than 5 mana, causing\
      \ most offensive tactics to be net losses. Additionally, a fixed number of enemies\
      \ are present at all times. Enemies spawned at the start of the floor won't\
      \ despawn unless killed, regardless of if they're on the screen. The moment\
      \ an enemy dies, another will take its place in your field of view. This leads\
      \ to chains where you unleash a couple attacks only to be beaten down by a never-ending\
      \ stream of monster spawning near you. This leads to either running out of cards,\
      \ mana, or health. Enemies will also sometimes spawn directly on top of you,\
      \ or in your path, causing (seemingly) unavoidable damage.\n\nThere seems to\
      \ be an end goal after about 20-30 floors, with floors taking around 90 seconds.\
      \ The unavoidable damage from combat requires luck of the draw and decent defensive\
      \ cards to have any real success. This cuts down on specialization, and makes\
      \ for very slow hit-and-run gameplay. \n\nDrawn Down Abyss is worth a look as\
      \ a curiosity, and I appreciate the commitment to the concept. At some point\
      \ I may try to see what's at the bottom of the abyss. Unfortunately, I have\
      \ a feeling the run that does it will involve a lot of standing around waiting\
      \ for the door to open while I kite enemies far away from the floor of the map.\
      \ Edit: Having played a bit more, things do get more chaotic. The same issues\
      \ still apply with enemies spawning on you. \n\nTechnical stuff: It ran well\
      \ enough at 1440p, although only in fullscreen (1080p is the highest resolution\
      \ I saw windowed). There's no ingame sound option. It doesn't like to be alt-tabbed.\
      \ The menus can only be navigated using keyboard (untested with a controller).\
      \ The way the window is displayed stopped both Nvidia and Steam overlays from\
      \ showing."
