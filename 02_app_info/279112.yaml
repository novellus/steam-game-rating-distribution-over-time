    review: "This weapon spirit is just useless. For a three seconds, you get a +5%\
      \ bonus to the damage you do to enemy, but the enemy becomes to attack 25% faster.\
      \ So, the enemy's total damage per time of skill's usage becomes roughly 125%,\
      \ when yours (considering you can attack about 1 time in a second) - only about\
      \ 105%. So, most probably, you just lessen your ability to kill enemies, before\
      \ they get you, which on a high level may be a real problem.\n\nA story of that\
      \ character - mentioned in the DLC's description? If it was intended to be funny,\
      \ it isn't. If just to be absurd, in that respect. there was no need to add\
      \ something to the \"Sacred 3\"'s setting. As a brief rererence to the \"Half-Life\
      \ 2\"? Why there was a need to release that as DLC? Even as the very cheap DLC?\n\
      \nI'd say, it's just ridiculous to sell it. However, if they added that into\
      \ the base game, there would be a fat chance players wouldn't ever notice that\
      \ idea, so it may have that kind of sence...\n\n[code]\n* [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/12320]Review\
