The chracters feel so fleshed out and you can really connect with them, which isnt a very popular trend in survival games like this. And I mean, for a card game, it really does feel like a whole different game to Hearthstone. I truly believe that blizzard has taken there company very seriously, and the result are masterpieces like this one. So if youre looking for a competitive dungeon crawle with great gameplay, I cant recommend a better driving game. 10/10","timestamp_created":1488106059,"timestamp_updated":1493702666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480769246816635132","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8bzn49sCcrGWcw=="}
