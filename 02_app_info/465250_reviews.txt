The whole set looks genuinely awesome, it’s a nostalgic classic from the old days when Styx was infiltrating the Tower of Akenash.\n\nBoth items have bonuses, however, somehow there’s no information about penalties in the DLC’s description on the Steam Store, which may be misleading for many people. The Akenash Outfit increases the duration of clones, but also makes Styx lose one unit of life if a clone is killed by anyone or anything other than Styx himself. The Dagger of Akenash instantly dissolves dead bodies of killed enemies, but also makes muffled kills impossible, which means that upon dying they will scream and may alarm nearby guards.\n\nWell, the DLC was supposed to be an exclusive pre-order bonus but it ended up as a standard add-on, which isn’t bad at all. Still, it doesn’t bring anything new nor worthwhile, but it’s a nostalgic classic that reminds me of the previous game - [i]Styx: Master of Shadows[/i] - and I still appreciated the [i]The Akenash Set[/i]. Purchasing the DLC may be a good way of supporting the developers, and if someone is a huge fan, then the add-on is worth buying during a sale.","timestamp_created":1596989657,"timestamp_updated":1596989657,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528688490390777588","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+omA6vMCcOi2mgI="}
