    about_the_game: 'NIMBY Rails is a management sandbox for railways you build in
      the real world. Design train tracks, set up lines, and get that stock rolling
      to make money and serve the needs of the population. Do you have <i>strong opinions</i>
      on rail projects and want to test your own ideas? This game was made for you.<br><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li> The world is your canvas. Design and play on a fully detailed
      real world map with 1cm resolution. A rail link from Lisbon to Shanghai? Anchorage
      to Buenos Aires? Cape Town to Rabat? Why not!<br></li><li> Your tracks will
      need to respect real, existing roads and streets. Too many crossings may make
      your designs not viable.<br></li><li> Streamlined circulation mechanics so you
      don''t get bogged down by the details. Build and run a large network easily.<br></li><li>
      Trams, subways, commuter, regional and high speed trains. Tunnels, viaducts
      and ground tracks with a variety trade offs on the environment, train speed,
      and your company wallet.<br></li><li> Simulated train and station demand, down
      to simulating individual passengers. Passengers can, and will, engage in train
      trips that make them board multiple trains, waiting in transfer stations.<br></li><li>
      Demand flow based on time of day and time of week, with time zone support. Find
      it boring when night time comes and the stations are deserted? No problem, start
      a new line ten time zones away.<br></li><li> Passengers will continuously rate
      their experience based on the trip time and the fares you impose on them, with
      effects on the demand of the stations they visit.<br></li><li> Single player
      and offline first.<br></li><li> Optional cooperative multiplayer: build together
      in real time with friends and others you invite to your hosted server session.</li></ul>'
