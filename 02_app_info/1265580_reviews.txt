There's so much I could say that's bad about this game but, to be honest, none of it was bad enough. I really enjoyed it.  \n\nDo not use the premium items. It is 100% not worth it. Having cheat DLC is probably the worst thing about it because the base game is designed to make grinding levels and getting permanent buffs super easy.\n\nDon't even worry about grinding or getting the best gear though because if you grind to max and get the best gear, you will one shot the final boss.  There are 75 chapters, most of which are pretty short. I wish there was more.","timestamp_created":1596470820,"timestamp_updated":1596470820,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.577294707298278809","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyu/E2vMCdaKWmQI="}
