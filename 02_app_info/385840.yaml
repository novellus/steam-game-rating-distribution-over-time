    review: 'I decided to upvote this game after finishing it - it has a decent (but
      not very engaging) story with some charming moments, mostly good puzzles and
      great music.


      The Beard in the Mirror is a fantasy adventure game made by 2 people over a
      long time: it''s a work of love but it''s a work that was done on limited resources:
      the artwork could use some additional detail and shading, many things were not
      animated and many of the scenes were largely empty.


      The story is a good take on "stranger in a strange land" but there were several
      points where the solution to puzzles were not very believable. The conversations
      were all right but there wasn''t much depth to the world. There are some funny
      one-liners.


      All in all, a good old-school point-and-click adventure, I''m glad I played
      it but there''s not much replay value. Recommended to any fan of the genre.


      Note: like others mentioned, I ran into issues with the game resolution. Keep
      in mind, that this is an old AGS adventure so it''s display support is not as
      up-to-date as the current version of AGS. Windowed mode with 4x scaling worked
      for me; none of the full-screen ones did. If you have issues during start-up,
      run the winsetup utility that sits in the game folder to configure resolution.'
