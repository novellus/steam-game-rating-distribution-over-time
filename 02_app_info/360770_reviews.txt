Purchased it thinking it was regular like recording studio software. Only to find out that the version I really needed was hip hop maker or whatever. COMPLETE WASTE OF MY MONEY. I pray that i can get some type of exchange because this stuff is completely useless for me. If only the store page for it had very clear descriptions of what the product was. I felt like it was studio software similar to reason or even fruity loops. I just want to make music. I also would very much Like my money back. Make sure you hit the company website before you purchase any of their items. that was the only way to get the information I severly needed.","timestamp_created":1440899529,"timestamp_updated":1440899529,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481683552265167236","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kr+Tvs8CcoHsQw=="}
