    review: 'I used to be a huge otome fan, but after a while got tired of some typical
      cliches and moved on to BL/GL, which I''m far more satisfied with. I backed
      this game on KS and already completed it. Brought it here so I can support the
      dev(although I consider a refund rn).Well, turns out this wasn''t the game for
      me. The other negative review has an issue with pricing, but for me it''s not
      a concern. Rather, I have problems with advertising, writing, pacing and the
      "true" route of the game.[olist][*]Let''s start with the fact this game is neither
      otome nor BL. This game is about friendship and struggles of teenage relationships.
      More ramblings about the issue:[list][*]The whole point of otome game is having
      a female protagonist. Here, you can only play as a guy, no kind of POV from
      Emily(the female "MC"). It''s such a missed opportunity to not have her become
      an actual MC in her own route. Heck, she isn''t exactly thrilled to enter a
      romantic relationship(understandable in the context of the game, but for a potential
      buyer it''s very misleading).[*]The "BL possibilities" part of the description
      is more accurate than otome part, but not quite. This game features little to
      no romance, Geum(MC of the game) straight up tells the player he has no intention
      to fall for either of two male leads. Even by the end of the game, during an
      individual route, the guy confesses he MIGHT be interested in Geum, but not
      right now due to personal reasons. That''s right, there''s no kind of romantic
      resolution here. Understandable, but why label it BL?[*]I also have a problem
      with "not-so-generic" thing. Is it, really? I''ll talk about writing problems
      later, but the game is kind of a friendship simulator where you can flirt with
      your friends. I suppose such closeness in platonic relationships is something
      we lack in VN department?[/list] [*]The writing. This was the weakest part of
      the game: This game has a problem with "show, don''t tell" rule. First, it shows
      you something and then it tells you how to feel about it. Generally, it''s better
      to let the player think on their own and react accordingly, unless it''s a game
      made for toddlers. As an example: one of the screenshots has a guy with cat
      ears. In context, he was trying to defuse the tension and everybody else remarks
      how weird and whacky this situation is.The worst example for me was the fact
      every every time LI rejected MC and told him they would rather be friends, Geum
      tells the player "I guess it was wrong of me to try and trick/force them into
      falling for me". Yes? No shit? Why were those lines necessary, the game showed
      MC was acting selfish during first three minutes of the gameplay? As you can
      see, this point really frustrated me. Hehe, I did the same thing.[*]Another
      huge issue, the pacing. The game takes place in a span of a week. So, it makes
      it very hard to believe Geum could befriend his male love interests, much less
      fall for them in such a short period of time. Both routes felt like a race to
      the end rather than gradual build-up. At least his and Emily''s relationship
      was believable enough.[*]Final point, the "true route" aka polyamorous ending.
      Yup, remember how I said it felt unnatural for any of the main cast to be into
      Geum? Welp, suddenly all of them are! And of course, the game doesn''t miss
      the chance to tell you how weird and strange this is! And of course, someone
      makes a harem joke! Honestly...I quit this route and that, because I have a
      feeling this will be even more of not my thing.You may think "you didn''t even
      finish this, why judge it so harshly? Indie devs already have it rough!". I
      agree, I might went on this a little bit too critical, you may really enjoy
      this if you don''t mind or enjoy things I mentioned. But for me, the writing
      and pacing problems made me forgot about things I initially praised the game
      for. So, I sadly will leave this game with a "not recommended" rating.[/olist]'
