      notes: "In WORLD OF HORROR, there are frequent scenes disturbing and horrific\
        \ scenes of implied violence, gore and mutilation of human bodies. All such\
        \ scenes are presented in a 2D pixel art style, but nonetheless may have a\
        \ realistic triggering impact on players with potential sensitivities. Player\
        \ discretion is advised.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the game includes casual usage\
        \ of cigarettes."

    review: "This is just an early beta, but it's already fun and definitely worth\
      \ playing.\n\nEDIT\n\nOK, so I just realised what a lacklustre review I gave\
      \ this game considering how much I love it. \n\nSO,\n\nThe game has a simplistic,\
      \ pixel art style with some very basic but very interesting and true-to-form\
      \ colour options. The art is well-done, stylistic and fun to look at. There's\
      \ some great writing, fantastic atmosphere and a well-measured amount of comedy\
      \ relief and a fun sense of humour. The items work well, the difficulty options\
      \ ensure anyone can play, and the learning curve is pretty shallow, so you don't\
      \ have to be intimidated. There's plenty of stuff to unlock, plenty of stories\
      \ to explore, tons of ways to customise and randomise every playthrough and\
      \ most importantly you can boop him snoot. If you're a long-time horror fan\
      \ or even have a budding interest this game is right up your alley. seriously,\
      \ buy it now before they realise it's worth more than what they're selling it\
      \ for."
