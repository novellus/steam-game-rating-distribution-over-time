    review: "So i was looking Through the Game Shop and found this Game for 0,95\u20AC\
      \ in Sale (it usually costs 2,39\u20AC) and saw it was a simple Platformer.\
      \ I thought why not and bought the Game and i would recommend it to everyone\
      \ that wants Platform Fun for like an Hour.\n\n[u][h1]Good Things:[/h1][/u]\n\
      \n- The Controls are on Point, its sad that some Games that are more expensive\
      \ have worse (Played with a Xbox 360 Controller)\n- The Platforming on the last\
      \ Level (7-7) is pretty Hard which is nice for an Ending.\n\n[u][h1]Bad Things:[/h1][/u]\n\
      \n- You can Spam the Attack all the Time which makes it Overpowered and the\
      \ Enemies aren't really a Problem anymore.\n- You get an Attack Upgrade every\
      \ Stage which makes it way too Easy, the Attack from the beginning of the Game\
      \ is good enough for at least half of the Game, there should be only one Upgrade\
      \ for only 7 Stages and you shouldn't be able to Spam.\n- The Teleport/Rush\
      \ Mechanic.. you can Spam that as well and its Easy to skip some Obstacles with\
      \ it, which makes the Game even more Easy, i would recommend to give it a Cooldown.\n\
      - The Difficulty overall is too Easy, it gets a good Spike in the End, but then\
      \ its too Late. The bosses are no Problem most of the Time, cause you can Spam\
      \ the  Attack and easily dodge their Attacks.\n\nSo overall this Game has some\
      \ Problems, but they aren't that bad and if you want an Platformer to have Fun\
      \ for like an Hour i would recommend buying it."
