I would compare some of them to [i]Boards of Canada[/i]. [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT0gRc2c2wQ]Especially this one tune[/url].  (look them up if you're a fan of low fi beats and ambience)\n\nMy only complaint is that it isn't synced up to steams built in music library automatically. Therefore you can't listen to them using steams audio player. You have to go to the games directory to find the downloaded music folder after your purchase it and manually add it to the library as a fix. Minor stuff though.","timestamp_created":1505595815,"timestamp_updated":1506203857,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ht6v2N4CcKzFhQE="}
