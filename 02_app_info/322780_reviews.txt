I absolutely loved it. The servers have since closed and the game is no longer available for purchase. As far as I know, the game's servers were some sort of proprietary cloud based servers that cannot be replicated at home, so there isn't any chance of homemade servers. For the short amount of time I knew the game, I had a great time with it. I can only hope someone recreates this game some day with the option for self hosted servers to keep the game's lifespan long. It's a sad thought to know this game will never leave early access. If you want to taste some of this game, go get World's Adrift Island Creator. It isn't multiplayer and you can't build ships, but you can make islands and enjoy the game's art style. \n\nI cannot recommend the game since it shut down. That doesn't mean it was a bad game.\n\nGame: 10/10\n\nDevs: 1/10","timestamp_created":1610015885,"timestamp_updated":1610015885,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ47Jib7vYCfO6ewQI="}
