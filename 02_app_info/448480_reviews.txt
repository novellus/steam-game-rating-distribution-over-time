The first several levels add new functions for game play and objectives but most of the game play is extremely repetitive.  If you like resource buying/selling games you will probably enjoy this but I wouldn't recommend buying it at full price.  The menu graphics are cute but most of the graphics are minimal.  Backgrounds are also minimal but depict generic looking desert scenes or small towns.\n\nWith only 10 short levels and not enough variety in gameplay I can't really bring myself to recommend this game unless you really love buying/selling resource games or like me just collect pretty much any game that has a Middle Eastern theme.","timestamp_created":1542872816,"timestamp_updated":1543344148,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480057060718536377","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4tmeq+cCfdaesAE="}
