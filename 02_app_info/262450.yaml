    about_the_game: "The critically acclaimed card game is now available on PC! Dead\
      \ Man\u2019s Draw is a simple and strategic game of luck and skill that boils\
      \ down strategy gameplay into a single, tense decision: to play it safe or risk\
      \ everything in pursuit of killer combos and boundless treasure.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Risk vs reward gameplay \u2013\
      \ Simple and strategic card game puts everything on the line for a single, tense\

      s special power is key to victory<br></li><li> Dozens of tournaments \u2013\

      bb_tag\">How it Works</h2>Players take turns drawing cards in search of the\
      \ greatest number of points. The simple point values of each card are important,\
      \ but their special abilities are even more critical. Swords steal cards from\
      \ your opponent, Mystics reveal the next card, and combining a Chest with a\
      \ Key leads to a huge bounty of bonus treasure. Clever use of each card\u2019\
      s special power leads to victory, but daring to draw is just as important \u2013\
      \ though any card could lead to a dramatic bust, it could also propel you to\
      \ glory.<br><br><br>Traits and tournaments make every game of Dead Man\u2019\
      s Draw unique. Making your Cannon special ability discard an opponent\u2019\
      s entire suit instead of a single card alters the path to victory for both players.\
      \ Special tournament rules like collecting the cards from your opponent\u2019\
      s busts force you to approach every turn differently. Dozens of tournaments\
      \ each bring a unique twist, and each of the 18 traits has a profound effect\
      \ on gameplay.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Upgraded for PC</h2>The original Dead Man\u2019\
