I personally use the werewolf to stream and the majority of people that watch think it's incredible how realistic it looks. I think this pack is a pack that anyone with face rig should try if they really love halloween or want to give their streams or videos a different vibe. \n\nOverall, I give the dlc a 9/10. Go ahead and buy it,","timestamp_created":1543164283,"timestamp_updated":1543164283,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h8nwpecCdfqMswE="}
