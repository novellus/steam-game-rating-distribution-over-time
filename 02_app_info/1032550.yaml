    about_the_game: 'Welcome to Chasm, an action-adventure game in which you play
      a new recruit undertaking your first mission for the Guildean Kingdom. Thrilled
      to prove your worth as a knight, you track strange rumors that a mine vital
      to the Kingdom has been shut down. But what you discover in the mining town
      is worse than you imagined: The townspeople have disappeared, kidnapped by supernatural
      creatures emerging from the depths.<br><br>Honor-bound to solve the mystery
      and restore peace to the Kingdom, you embark upon an epic adventure, with deadly
      battles against cunning monsters, exploration of ancient catacombs and castles,
      and powerful new equipment hidden at every turn. Though the overall story is
      the same for all players, your hero''s journey will be unique: each of the rooms
      has been hand-designed, and behind the scenes Chasm stitches these rooms together
      into a one-of-a-kind world map that will be your own.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key
