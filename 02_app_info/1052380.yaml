      /><br>In the not too distant future, Scrap Hunters scavenge through the remains
      of the old world in search of valuable forgotten military technology... and
      rare metal scrap. <br><br>Following a tip from an old friend of his landlords,
      Iggy Ikeda infiltrates an abandoned Neptune Facility in search of the remains
      of a decommissioned Warthog Mk II tank. You''ll need to wall jump, and slash
      your way through 6 stages of challenging narrow saw blade corridors, security
      droids and lasers while grabbing as much scrap as you can.<br><br>Gameplay is
      simple but hard to master. You can Jump and attack (if you can find the hidden
      Kaizo blade). <br>Collect hidden and hard to reach scrap to get %100 completion.
      <br><br>Ikeda: The Scrap Hunter is a challenging stage based game with no micro
      transactions or loot box shenanigans.<br><br>Approximate time time to complete
      is 45 minutes if you''re a pro at these sorts of games. But to get 100% of collectibles
      may take up to 5-6 hours.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1052380/extras/installing_tall.png?t=1573605979"

    review: Pretty cool fun 2D indie action platformer. Does take some good hand eye
      coordination to play. If you have a few hours you can probably get through it
      quickly. Me on the other hand like to take my time. Art work from the talented
      mind of Trent Kaniuga. While many might not agree, I can't help but having visions
      of the movie "9"! Play it for free, spend the $5.00 and support it!
