The rules are quite simple actually and easy to learn, with a lot of strategy and some randomness mixed in. Players who are good with probability will be able to plan around the randomess of the game, which I find adds extra depth to the strategy.\n\nAll in all, a great and easy to learn game to play with some friends.","timestamp_created":1515123299,"timestamp_updated":1515123299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.650946557521820068","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4q9qY4uACd/uFlQE="}
