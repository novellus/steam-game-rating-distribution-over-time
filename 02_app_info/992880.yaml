    review: Bought it today as it was new on the steam store. The platformer levels
      are fun and challenging, rewarding skilled platformers who can wall jump efficiently
      with faster times. I gotta admit, getting consecutive wall jumps is satisfying.
      The bullet hell stages are pretty decent too, and the upgrades shop means you
      don't need to play each stage the exact same. So far I've enjoyed it a lot more
      than I thought I would
