I can't believe that this game was developed by a single 15 year old developer!! Guys, just the fact that he is 15 is amazing and the game was also very good. I really hope the developer keeps going on making games or maybe make Bernie's nightmare a game series.”<br>10\/10 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/game\/pc\/bernies-nightmare\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Metacritic<\/a><br><br>“Before reading my opinion on the game, please consider that this game was made by a single fifteen year old and that in itself is impressive.   There are many pros and cons to the game, and some things that could be improved on, as well as some of my own personal suggestions.   Lets start with the pros:   While the game in itself may not appear to be that scary, it may certainly catch you buy surprise (and maybe even make you jump) given the fact that the enemy has no audio cues that give away its location except for a constant crying sound, however, the game keeps you on edge due to the fact that this single noise will quiet the closer she gets, therefor she is able to catch you by surprise because she will be virtually silent when she is nearby.   The game will immediately throw you into it, without any clear context or objective for you to follow, you have to figure it out as you progress. This is both good in bad, the good is that it can bring a bit of freedom to the player, but on the flip side, if the player gets lost they are basically going to remain lost.   The game also provides and hiding mechanic similar to games such as Outlast in order to lose the enemy, you are able to hide in\/under beds, tables, cabinets and more. The game is even more punishing and challenging because if you get caught, you have to restart from the beginning. I have found no save points in the game.   Overall I think that this game is worth at least a try, its only $2 after all.   Now lets move on to the cons:   The game settings could be improved on, as of this moment there is no way to adjust you volume and mouse settings in the game.   The AI for the enemy is a little inconsistent, sometimes when you hide she will just remain there and may take a while to leave, but this doesn't happen often.   The music is remains the same and there is no way to adjust it, this is not game breaking by any means but it can become a bit of an annoyance after a while.   The character movement is a bit slow, but i guess this is intended to make it difficult to outrun the enemy.   Overall I could see some minor improvements but I have enjoyed playing the game, and i definitely recommend it for the price”<br>10\/10 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.metacritic.com\/game\/pc\/bernies-nightmare\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Metacritic<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/894390\/header.jpg?t=1560887826","website":"http:\/\/kevinyanggames.com\/bernie-s-nightmare","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel Core i3 \/ other<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> NVIDIA GeForce  630 \/ other with 2GB memory<br><\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> Version 11<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 900 MB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> Game does not require a strong hardware support to run.<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 10<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel Core i7 \/ other<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 8 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> NVIDIA GeForce 940 \/ other<br><\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> Version 12<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 1 GB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> Game does not require a strong hardware support to run.<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Mac OS X 10.8+<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel Core i3 \/ other<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> NVIDIA GeForce  630 \/ other with 2GB memory<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 900 MB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> Game does not require a strong hardware support to run.<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Mac OS High Sierra<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel Core i7 \/ other<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 8 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> NVIDIA GeForce 940 \/ other<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 1 GB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> Game does not require a strong hardware support to run.<\/li><\/ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> 32 bit \/ 64 bit OS<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel Core i3 \/ other<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> NVIDIA GeForce  630 \/ other with 2GB memory<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 900 MB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> Game does not require a strong hardware support to run.<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> 64 bit OS<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Intel Core i7 \/ other<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 8 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> NVIDIA GeForce 940 \/ other<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 1 GB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> Game does not require a strong hardware support to run.<\/li><\/ul>"},"legal_notice":"All rights of the game reserved by Kevin Yang, Kevin Yang Games.
