Regarding the user size, it was hard to even decorate the dress since this child (about 8 years old) wasn't tall enough to easily reach everything. Even catching the torn up letter was hard because this kid had to look straight up at those pieces of paper flying over them and couldn't reach them until they every so often dropped to a reachable level.\n\n[b]DIFFICULTY[/b]: By the time the child got to the music, it was too far apart or difficult to reach to be able to play the music mini game. At the beginning of the game, it claimed there was a way to get past a difficult part, but in that mini game (which loops upon failure) literally no button seemed to help. It was a loop of suffering and frustration!\n\n[b]AUDIO[/b]: Oh dear...apparently no one decided to normalize the volume. You will have to turn up the sound to hear the dialogue, but them brace yourself while the narrator then screams in your ear. Follow that up with some quiet dialogue, and then a normal dialogue. Do that on loop a few times and you get the idea of what you should expect to hear.\n\n[b]VERDICT[/b]: The game needs some repairs and re-engineering, but it's not a total \"nope\"...but right now, I do not recommend buying it. Hopefully, they'll at least consider remastering the volume issues.","timestamp_created":1579229009,"timestamp_updated":1579229009,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.608933448791503906","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1586287724,"developer_response":"Hi Pug,\nThanks for checking out the game and for your feedback!  It was very helpful- we just published an update that should address these issues.  The height of some of the minigames was changed to be more accessible, we added in more obvious \"Skip\" buttons for skipping the minigames, and remastered the audio as well.\nWe hope you'll give the game another try.  Thanks again!\n-Laura & Scott, Developers"}],"cursor":"AoJ4xsrY2O8CeLyt7AE="}
