    review: 'Bought this to give love to the devs of one of my favorite games. I am
      not sure if they change based on relationship or not, I''ve only tried them
      on my main save. But they are cute and fun!


      Except -- (spoilers I guess??)






      In the first game Brash can''t read, I''m not sure what he''s going to do with
      my journal :)'
