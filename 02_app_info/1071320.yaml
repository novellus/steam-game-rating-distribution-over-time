    review: I totally recommend this short vr experience. It was very informative
      and interesting to learn more of this painting. the visuals and the sound were
      more than great. Some FPS hickups were there too (RTX 3090), but aren't that
      disturbing while the trip overall. I really like to see more of this kind of
      VR Experience.
