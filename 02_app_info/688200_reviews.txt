Normally, it should be easy visualizing the branching of the visual novel as you play along but it was not something so clear. I felt like the combat system is what draggged down the experience for me. The dialogue would also be hard to read because of the colors, the font size is good but the contrast with the dialogue box was not enough. \n\nThe only positive thing about the game is how art style of the background and the characters compliment each other. It's just that the sprites were so inconsistent with proportions and angles that makes the art not able to save the flat writing.","timestamp_created":1542160530,"timestamp_updated":1542160530,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566929101943969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpcf7h+cCfpDdrgE="}
