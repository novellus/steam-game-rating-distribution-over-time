    about_the_game: Scoot is a physics based scooter game made for all the scooter
      riders out there! Perform tricks, airs, flips, and make parks to share with
      your friends!<br><br>The goal of Scoot is to give scooter riders around the
      world what they've always been wanting ever since the SKATE franchise. There's
      new skateboarding games, BMX games, and now, finally a scooter action sports
      game. Staying away from crowd sourcing, having Scoot in Early Access allows
      for Matt Cole to be engaged with the community and receive feedback on our journey
      to a the full scooter action sports game that we've all wanted for such a long
      time. <br><br><strong>CONTROLLER REQUIRED</strong>
