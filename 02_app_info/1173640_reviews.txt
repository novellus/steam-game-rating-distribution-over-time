It's too chaotic for me.\nThe design is good.","timestamp_created":1608429487,"timestamp_updated":1608429487,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1608592753,"developer_response":"Hi there!\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to leave a review, I really appreciate it even if it's not a positive one. \n\nI'm not sure I understand the \"luck egal\" comment, but I would love to take your feedback and make the appropriate changes that could improve this issue. As I plan to continue to improve the game over the next year as the remainder of the chapters are released.\n\nPlease reach out if you're still interested in the game and I will send you as free steam key if you've asked for a refund already as you're feedback is invaluable!\n\nContact me on adrian.aksan@gmail.com or on my discord channel. \n\nThank you again :)"}],"cursor":"AoJ4ucj3vvYCdfTKuwI="}
