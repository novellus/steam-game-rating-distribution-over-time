    about_the_game: Game JOYDOOR. Joydoor-the main character who got to the world
      from which he needs to get out. You have to help him get out of this terrible
      world. In the game you are waiting for opponents who will disturb you-be careful,
      because you have only 1 life. You need to look for clues (one or more) that
      are scattered throughout the map to get out of this terrible world. When you
      find all the keys you need you have to get to the door which is located much
      further from the keys.  You will find a lot of interesting and confusing levels.Very
      simple operation, but very interesting story. (The game has such languages as-English,
      Russian, Italian,German, French. Therefore, it will be easy to understand the
      game)

    review: 'It is just so very basic.

      If this was released for gameboy back in the nineties, I would have still complained.

      Jump over stuff using your keyboard and hope the weird hit boxes don''t trip
      you up.

      Overpriced.

      Not recommended.
