This prologue is not worth 1.99$ or 1.69 which is what I got it for on sale. There's no benefit to doing combos no sense of accomplishment when you get a huge line up or a multi combo since it all does about the same damage exactly. The fights are tedious cause you're basically just matching them as fast as possible without combos. The line up is RNG so you're not really improving you just take advantage of what it drops you. The enemies have no powers nothing the fights just get longer. You can get puzzle and dragons for free and it has so much more to it on your mobile device. I like the concept but there's not barely ANY story at all which could set this game apart. Hopefully the creators will improve this I'm not sure if the full release will cost money on top of paying for this version BUT I WOULD NOT BUY THIS ONE until changes are made. I probably forgot somethings but I'm sure I mentioned them in my video.","timestamp_created":1603667183,"timestamp_updated":1603667183,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1603671431,"developer_response":"Thank you for you detailed review. I will work to improve the game as much as I can to make your investment worth. I have no plan in changing the game price.
