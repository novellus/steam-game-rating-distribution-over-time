Have experienced issues with items not being able to click on due to being behind items (even though it sticks out), and some items assume it is wrong item only to be sent back by the help - and many clicks later it is activated.\n\nThis version of the clockwork man is not as linear as the previous version and is more like an adventure game, making it near impossible to determine what needs to be done when.  reminds me of the old adventure games where you would wander around for hours clicking on everything in each scene and trying to utilise and combine all inventory items just to proceed.","timestamp_created":1598482763,"timestamp_updated":1598482763,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4z+m/lvQCffiAngI="}
