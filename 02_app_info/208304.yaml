    about_the_game: 'The Ruhr-Sieg line is a wonderful German route with something
      for everybody, including passenger and freight trains and a choice of diesel,
      electric and steam locomotives. <br><br>The line from Hagen to Siegen in Rhine-Westphalia
      was completed in the 1860s and primarily handled coal traffic, feeding the steel
      mills around Siegen. As passenger traffic increased, stations were built at
      towns along the line such as Finnentrop, Letmathe and Kreutzal and the line
      became a fast passenger link as well as a busy freight route for wood, steel
      and coal trains. The Ruhr-Sieg line for Train Simulator recreates the line from
      Hagen to Siegen and includes a mixture of diesel, electric and steam locomotives
      plus scenarios to let you explore this busy route.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><ul

    review: Reviewing this ancient route in 2020! .... and it's a positive one from
      me.  I drove it this week for the first time in maybe 7 or 8 years and was surprised
      how much I enjoyed it, and how well it has stood the test of time.  The included
      trains are of course very old but I replaced them with more modern train releases
      in the scenarios.  I also use this route for testing mods that I make to trains.  It's
      super stable and gives fantastic frames.  You probably already own it as it
      comes with most versions of TS, but if not, it's definitely worth 6 quid!
