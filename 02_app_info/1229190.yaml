    review: Once you get used to your tools, it becomes an actively engaging rhythm-art
      game. Placing various shapes causes different audio channels to play and, by
      changing the colour of the shape you're placing, you'll get a different tone
      and rhythm to play. I found myself grooving to the songs I was making after
      a while and really got into the intersectionality of visual and auditory art.
      It could have more selection of shapes and perhaps something like a smoother
      line tool, but I'm happy with the game overall and would recommend it to anyone
      who enjoys unique VR artistic experiences.
