      \ /><br><br><i><strong>Silent Hill</strong></i> is a new Chapter for Dead by\
      \ Daylight. It includes a Killer, The Executioner, a Survivor, Cheryl Mason,\
      \ and a Map. Purchasing the add-on will unlock its new Killer, new Survivor,\
      \ and an exclusive Universal Charm: the Seal of Metatron. <br><br>The Silent\
      \ Hill Chapter includes a new map, Midwich Elementary School:  the childhood\
      \ trauma that once took place in its halls has since manifested itself into\
      \ a twisted, nightmarish design.  The new Killer is The Executioner: take control\
      \ of Pyramid Head and wield his great knife to unleash his twisted brand of\
      \ punishment on all who cross him. The new Survivor is Cheryl Mason, a courageous,\
      \ outspoken woman who survived the hellish Otherworld of Silent Hill, and exacted\
      \ revenge on the Order that killed her father. With experience beyond her years,\

      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> The Executioner</h2><br>A sadistic and merciless executioner,\
      \ Pyramid Head is fixated on dispensing punishment through pain. Encumbered\
      \ by the steel frame upon his head and with a hulking great blade in tow, he\
      \ stalked the hellish corridors of Silent Hill, committed to a duty that no\
      \ one truly understood. Where he trod, even monsters fled for the shadows, and\
      \ those who crossed his path fell victim to unrestrained acts of aggression.\
      \ When his duty was complete and his presence no longer needed, he prepared\
      \ for the long rest\u2014and yet, his skills were required elsewhere. The fog\
      \ that streamed over him was somehow different than that he was accustomed to\
      \ in Silent Hill, as if each wisp contained the nerves of a creature, writhing,\
      \ seeking him out. There was an unspoken agreement in that moment. The billowing\
      \ cloud was an invitation to duty and sadism, and Pyramid Head, taking a step\
      \ into the fog, accepted his obligation once more. <br><br><strong>The Executioner\u2019\
      s Power: Rites of Judgement</strong><br><br>Press and hold the Power button\
      \ to activate. Once activated, move in any direction to carve a trail into the\
      \ ground. Release the button to finish carving. Survivors who walk or run on\
      \ the trail will trigger Killer Instinct and be afflicted with Torment. Survivors\
      \ under the effect of Torment may be sent to a Cage of Atonement by The Executioner\
      \ while they are in the dying state. <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1324970/extras/SilentHill_Killer_Perks_header.png?t=1606249108\"\
      \ /><br><br>The Executioner comes with <strong>3 new perks.</strong><h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Forced Penance</h2>Those who stand in the way of duty will suffer harsh\
      \ judgment. <br>Survivors who take a protection hit are inflicted with the Broken\
      \ status effect for 40/50/60 seconds.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Trail of Torment</h2>You\
      \ guide your victims along a path of pain and punishment. After kicking a generator,\
      \ you become Undetectable for 16/16/16 seconds. During this time, the generator\u2019\
      s yellow aura is revealed to Survivors. This effect can only trigger once every\
      \ 80/70/60 seconds.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Deathbound</h2>Those whose lives are\
      \ intertwined in darkness are destined to suffer together. When a Survivor heals\
      \ another Survivor for one health state at least 32/32/32 meters away from the\
      \ Killer, the Survivor performing the healing action will scream, revealing\
      \ their location and activating Deathbound for the next 60/60/60 seconds. During\
      \ that time, the Survivor will suffer from the Oblivious status effect when\
      \ further than 16/12/8 meters away from the healed Survivor. <br><br><br><img\
      \ src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1324970/extras/SilentHill_Survivor_header.png?t=1606249108\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cheryl Mason</h2><br>Caring and impulsive, Cheryl Mason,\
      \ previously known as Heather, attempted to rebuild her life after the tragic\
      \ death of her adoptive father, Harry Mason. While she had freed herself from\
      \ the religious cult that pursued her since birth, she was shackled by the guilt\
      \ of her father's death. A darkness punished her every night under the guise\
      \ of abominable nightmares. <br><br>To ease her conscience, she volunteered\
      \ at a crisis intervention center for troubled youth. Three months later, she\
      \ aced training and could answer the crisis line without supervision. Yet little\
      \ could have prepared her for the first call. All she heard was static. The\
      \ air thickened as black fumes rose from the ground and suddenly she heard the\
      \ voice of a woman\u2014someone she thought she'd never hear from again. Why\
      \ do you cling to this corrupt world? You know that only God can save us. It\
      \ couldn't be her\u2014Claudia was dead. Suddenly, the world spun and she dropped\
      \ on her knees, nauseous. Hot bile traveled up her throat and she retched warm\
      \ blood on the floor. Then the spinning stopped as swiftly as it began. Cheryl\
      \ looked up and saw she was somewhere else. A cold, hopeless place.  <br><br>Cheryl\
      \ comes with <strong>3 new perks.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Soul Guard </h2>You\
      \ have been through immense hardship and you\u2019re stronger for it. Gain the\
      \ Endurance status effect for 4/6/8 seconds after being healed or having recovered\
      \ from the dying state. During this time, any damage that will put you in the\
      \ dying state will instead apply Deep Wounds. You have 20/20/20 seconds to mend\
      \ yourself. If you take any damage while affected by Deep Wounds, or if the\
      \ timer ends, you are immediately put in the dying state. While cursed by a\
      \ hex, you can fully recover from the dying state.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Blood\
      \ Pact</h2>It\u2019s as if a latent part of yourself has awakened. You feel\
      \ like you can reach out beyond yourself for assistance. When you or the Obsession\
      \ are injured, you both see each other's auras. After healing the Obsession\
      \ or being healed by the Obsession, you both gain a 7/7/7% Haste status effect\
      \ for 6/8/10 seconds. Reduces the odds of being the Obsession. If you are the\
      \ Obsession, this perk deactivates.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Repressed Alliance</h2>You\u2019\
      re accustomed to being hunted by malicious forces, and you\u2019ve begun using\
      \ it to your advantage. Repressed Alliance activates after repairing generators\
      \ for a total of 80/70/60 seconds. When repairing a generator while the perk\
      \ is active, press the Active Ability button to call upon the Entity to block\
      \ the generator for 30/30/30 seconds. The perk deactivates. Affected generators\
      \ will be revealed by a white aura to all Survivors.<br><br><br><img src=\"\

      \ /><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New Map: Midwich Elementary School</h2></strong><br>To\
      \ students who were bullied by their teachers and classmates, attending Midwich\
      \ Elementary School was comparable to torture. As the Order\u2019s grip on the\
      \ town\u2019s supernatural energies tightened, a transformation occurred. The\
      \ childhood trauma that took place in the building manifested itself into a\
      \ twisted, nightmarish design. Though desks and textbooks remain, they\u2019\
      re eerily contrasted with stained walls, rusted chains, and hanging cadavers.\
      \ Any notion that this could have been a place of innocence and learning has\
      \ long since faded. <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1324970/extras/SilentHill_ExclItem.png?t=1606249108\"\
