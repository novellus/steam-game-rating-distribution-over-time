    review: This game is terrible. It is trying to be like the Emergency series but
      in Roblox style graphics. Too much micromanagement for gameplay. AI pathfinding
      is terrible, officer response to threats will get them killed, and firemen will
      always walk over dangers. This game has too many issues, and the devs are non-existent,
      and have very clearly bailed on their product. Save your refund request, and
      don't even but it.
