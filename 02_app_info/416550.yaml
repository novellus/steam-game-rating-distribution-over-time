    short_description: Rubber Ducky has found a Rainbow Gun during a rainstorm of
      colored weaponry! The Spikies love to be zapped with Rainbow Guns - so much,
      in fact, that they'll teleport away to tell the other Spikies about it. Follow
      Rubber Ducky as he spreads laser-ed goodwill in this shooter-meets-plushie-toy
      romp!
