But I Am Bread crashes CONSTANTLY. Even when you start the game in steam safe mode with -safe launch option it still crashes when you do various things. Game is very poorly optimized and I cant recommend buying this. Im pretty sure i got it as part of a bundle anyways.","timestamp_created":1610142407,"timestamp_updated":1610142407,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lev98fYCccrSwQI="}
