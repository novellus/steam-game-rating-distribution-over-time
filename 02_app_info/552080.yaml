    review: Bought this game thinking it would be funny to play with my friends who
      also have no clue how a submarine works. And I gotta say this is one of the
      most immersive experiences in a video game for me. We were actually scratching
      our heads trying to get the ship to re-power while under fire from a destroyer.
      Fair to say I'd recommend this one to anyone in this niche and also people looking
      for a good immersive game thriller game to play. 7/10 really fun
