    review: 'What is Frontlines ?


      I got this game from a bundle full of THQ games and decided to give it a try,
      it wasnt a game I wanted to play or anything, it was just a bonus of the bundle
      I got, after playing it for a hour I saw what the game offered and would have
      offered to me if I kept playing and what its main focus was...


      Well, when it comes to singleplayer its pretty crappy, you have those big open
      areas but filled with mundane objectives that could pretty much be recycled
      from a game mode that many game has like destroy this area, plant a bomb, hold
      this point or something like that, the gunplay and weapon handling arent satisfying
      and there is an annoying recoil that just makes it all boring, I like the tech
      side of the game, certain parts of the environment are destructible, with big
      maps and nice graphics for a 2008 game it may impress you a bit and sometimes
      the game may throw something cool like being able to go to an tank and lay destruction
      around or use drones but, the game has like just 9 missions or something, on
      boring, bland and big area, where you just keep doing mundane objectives while
      you fight a really dumb AI, theres no satisfying story or anything, this could
      pretty much have been the multiplayer but with just bots instead...


      And here is what the games main selling point is: the multiplayer, even with
      the gunplay being as shit as it is, having those massive scale experience with
      many players, doing all those objectives and such and using all the cool tools
      the game provides you would have been a cool experience but sadly the servers
      are shutdown and theres no way to do it so that part of the game is off limits
      and the singleplayer portion is just mediocre, so at the end of the day theres
      nothing to see here, move along.'
