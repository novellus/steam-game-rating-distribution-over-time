People seem to think its weird because of the theme of the game. Slashing players to bits with a sword like in Mortal Kombat is fine but kicking someone down below is somehow kinda taboo??? I think some people need to take a look at their moral compass to check if its broken.\n\nMoral debate aside this game isnt too well made. I noticed the fighters feet tend to clip into the floor and there were some sound issues. If you want a laugh then buy this but if you want a serious fighting game you should look elsewhere. But on the plus side the character models are based on real people and if you donate on the website you can even picked up a signed photo of one of the  actresses bits. Thats what convinced me this game is only meant for a laugh not serious gameplay.","timestamp_created":1562341032,"timestamp_updated":1562341032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517647087574005127","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhIiy4esCdJbhzAE="}
