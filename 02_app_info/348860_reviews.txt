These developers didn't take the only review so far ...my original review found below, being negative and basically saying this game is too early in its development status to charge $30 USD. \n\n..These developers LISTENED to me... and to the other people in the community forums saying that this game is asking too much money for it's early state of development!\n\nI will leave my original review unchanged below just so that viewers can see my original first review based on this games original $29.99 USD price tag at it's early access launch.\n\nBut because of the developers listening to this only review so far... and the other posters on the forums here... I must say that I LOVE this kind of professional response so quick from them.\n\n..They didn't blame me for having an insufficient computer or blame the way I played their game.\n\n..They didn't make excuses of any kind.\n\n...They simply listened and dropped their price in half, and are offing refunds to anyone who purchased this game at it's original price tag for early access of $29.99 USD.\n\n....And for that reason, and because I do believe this game certainly shows a ton of potential... and also because I can see most users getting $15 USD worth of fun out of this game in its current state, then I am CHANGING my review from a negative to a positive review. Obviously, changing the price doesn't fix the problems, bugs, or make the game itself any different. But what it does do is shows me that this development team listens to feedback which is HUGE! I do believe they will fix bugs and continue to give this game updates and make it better and better as well.\n\nIt is now worth it's asking price. And it has developers who listen and react quickly to criticism rather then act like cocky jackazzes who make every excuse in the book (we've all seen too many developers like that, right?) \n\nThank you developers for listening. And reactiving professionally. You have my support now, and I will in turn play your game more, upload more videos, and share why \"MyDream\" is worth it's new asking price!\n\n....If only more developers were like this! Other developers can and should learn from this! :-)\n\n******************************************************************************************************\n\n---- EVERYTHING BELOW SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS WAS BASED ON THIS GAMES INITIAL ASKING PRICE OF $29.99 USD AND BEFORE THEY SHOWED THEY CARE ABOUT LISTENING TO THEIR CUSTOMERS AND REACTING QUICKLY AND PROFESSIONALLY. THIS ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW WILL REMAIN UN-ALTERED, HOWEVER WHAT I STATE ABOVE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS MOST RECENT REACTIONS FROM MYSELF ON THE VALUE OF THIS GAME, THANK YOU. ---\n----------------------- ------------------------------ -------------------------\n\nWatch My Video Review At This Early Access Launch Here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92lNiAhKn28\n\nOkay, against my better judgement, I bought into this game.. another early access sandbox voxel world game at what seems like a hefty price. \n\nAfter 3 days, not a single review has come in for this game, and I decided to be the first one to buy it, play it, and give all of you out there my 'honest' thoughts and opinion as to whether this game is worth it right now. The key words being \"right now\" as of February 23, 2015. Things can change over time, and this game could be completely different and much more evolved in two or three months then it is right now, just three days after it's Steam early access launch.\n\nSo... is MyDream worth it's asking price?\n\nIn my opinion, as much as I want to like this game... my answer is a firm NO. I think that answer would apply to most people who might be looking at this game with interest or curiosity. For most people, I think there are better options out there for your money. \n\nMinecraft is cheaper right now and offers tons of player support, community add on, mods, texture packs and more available for free. \n\nCreativerse right now is $10 cheaper, will be free-to-play sometime in the next 6-8 months likely and I believe is much further evolved and more playable then is this game. \n\nIf creating quests and placing treasure and loot and monsters is what you are looking for, then please take a strong look at 'Fight The Dragon' at half the price of this games current asking price. Fight The Dragon is much more complete and fun in my opinion then this game is currently.\n\nAll of the above options would be my recommended options for people looking at this game to consider first. There of course are always exceptions to the rule. I'm sure there are some people who love creating things that might easily get their moneys worth and be happy... but again.. I think that kinda person would be an exception rather then the typical onlooker curious about this game. Most people will probably feel a little scorched for their dollar paying $30 for this game right NOW in the state it is in currently.\n\nRight now, there just isn't enough finished tools in the game, nor enough players actively playing or even on this game's own websites forums to support their asking price. Again, this is only my opinion... and I really WANT to like this game and give it my thumbs up, but I just can't honestly do that now. I will come back and re-review this game in four to six months and see how much has changed and if I feel differently at that time, but for now, I have to give this game a thumbs down. (If it were half it's asking price now of $15 USD, then I would likely give it a pass, but $30 is just far too much for what you get now I believe)\n\nIf you are looking for specific reasons as to why I say \"NO BUY\" on this game now, please watch my video above, at the top of this review. You should see many specific reasons in that video as to why I give this game a thumbs down review currently. \n\nI hope that my honest review here has helped save someone some money and more importantly saved them the disappointment I felt with this game at it's current early access state of development.\n\nSorry devs! I DO see a ton of potential for this game... please keep up the hard work! I'd love to be able to play this game in a few months and change my opinion around 180 degrees and become a supporter and lover of this game! MyDream is a fantastic open world - sandbox game that will lead you to adventure. Explore and build your own world using wide variety of tools and assets provided or play online and join other worlds! \n\nKeep in mind that it's still in early access and there might be few annoyances but I'm sure things will iron out with each update. MyDream is the answer to the question, \"What if Minecraft and RPG Maker had a baby?\" It's a game based around user-generated, story-driven voxelized worlds where just about anything goes, and this gives it a lot of potential.\n\nThe graphics are decent, although they're much better than that OTHER voxel-based sandbox game everyone enjoys. I'm playing on a laptop with an integrated graphics card, too, so I'm sure it's not running at the highest quality the Unity engine delivers. Audio quality is good, but I'm not much of a techno/electro fan.\n\nI had issues connecting to other worlds, in that I attempted to join four/five of the most popular worlds for at least five minutes each \n \n\n- Zaxx\n\nIf you like sand box game, you'll like MyDream.\n10/10","timestamp_created":1486687492,"timestamp_updated":1486687492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw+trektoCcKXdcQ=="}
