The music is cool as well, but beware as some of them are copyrighted on YouTube.\n\nThe major flaw of the game is the marble's physics. It's not a big deal, really, but the marble's speed is capped, it accelerates poorly and it's slippery. As a Marble Blast player, it's very hard for me.\nBesides, it feels like the marble has air movement when it wants, and that's kinda frustrating at times. The slow roll is a good idea, but when you're used to play and you know how to properly control your marble, it feels useless.\nAbout the different puzzles, they are great but sometimes, way too confusing. Maybe try giving some hints or something?\nOverall, the game is pretty solid and I had so much fun on it.","timestamp_created":1590148643,"timestamp_updated":1590148643,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i9ePnvICeqbAiQI="}
