    review: "It's a horror stealth game. No fighting. You evade the monsters and try\
      \ to find collectable harps while seeking to escape the tower. \nTeleport only.\
      \ There are checkpoints every floor, but no save points so you have to finish\
      \ in one sitting. Which is fine bc it took me less than an hour to finish.\n\
      It's not early access and dev is not responsive in discussion board so don't\
      \ expect any changes. \nOn the plus side, it runs fine and is inexpensive."
