    review: "I do feel torn for giving this short scenario a bad review due to its\
      \ pricing, but I must review it for the content it has and not for the pricing\
      \ it has. I can't recommend this one shot to anybody if I am honest with you.\
      \ \n\nAs a keeper I was shocked with the little amount of information that I\
      \ had to work with, there were so many scenarios that I could not possibly describe\
      \ to the players without making up things on a whim. Usually, that is a standard\
      \ in any roleplaying game; however, this was such a frequent theme with this\
      \ scenario that it was just so apparent that I had little to no information.\n\
      \nTo add insult to injury, the creature in this scenario does not feel like\
      \ it belongs in the Lovecraft universe. It feels so out of place with its frost\
      \ bow or whatever it was now again. It felt like the person was writing a Dungeons\
      \ and Dragons campaign and just happened to be inspired by Cthulhu mythos all\
      \ of a sudden. \n\nI did not have fun working with this one-shot and my players\
      \ found it to be completely off the rails when it came to the Cthulhu mythos.\n\
      \nI can't recommend this one shot at all. What I can suggest is \"Camp Sunny\"\
      \ which is a free one shot that you can find on Chaosium's website. It is a\
      \ great one-shot that gives you so much more information to use for the adventure."
