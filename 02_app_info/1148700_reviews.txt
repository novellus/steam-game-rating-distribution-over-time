Check this game out later when there is more content.\n\nPositives:\nGameplay was really satisfying, all the attacks were very simple and you can easily dodge seeing all the numbers when killing enemies with aoe is very satisfying. Each weapon has a different feeling, different knockback when firing, different movement when firing, different movement speed without firing. Some of them you want to be very close to maximise damage, some can work really far, some ignite enemies so hitting an enemy and then leaving is best.\n\nPerks you can get with skill points from leveling up can be combined in meaningful ways and can have massive impact on how you play. For example my favourite combination is kaboom(15% on kill to explode), engulf(25% on kill ignite nearby enemies) and berzerker(double damage when low) you would sometimes set off a chain reaction which killed everything on the screen which is really fun on the endless waves mode (blitz).\n\nNegatives:\nI say this with a heavy heart that it just becomes very monotonous. After 2-3 hours of playing I unlocked everything and just needed to unlock void run which was level capped. And the most efficient way to get there without it feeling to grindy or taking to long is to just repeat underworld blitz. \n\nTutorial how to beat the game:\nplay tutorial world until you can unlock underworld\nplay underworld until you unlock its blitz mode\nspam underworld blitz mode using the following build\nperks: \nLVL:5 quick learner + specialist \nLVL:20+  quick learner + kaboom + specialist \n\nweapon: pheonix\naddons: weapon damage \n\nYou can get to the end game content within 5 hours doing this.\n\nThe end game content is to just repeat a void runs for random legendaries(a random weapon from any of the zones with random damage numbers with a random buff). Void runs is just shooting a giant crystal which doesn't have attacks with a bunch of minions which can't hit you if you spam dodge. It takes 10 crystals to play a void run but you can just make that cost up if you kill enough of the minions which respawn after you kill them. \n\n\nLack of content, there is no co-op which I found very surprising for a looter shooter, you end up just grind the void to get good legendaries so you can do the void slightly faster, but not really since it has 2 phases where it goes invulnerable for 30 seconds where you just wait. There is near to know story except in the beginning it talks about there being a portal where monsters come from or something like that. \n\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1609918532,"timestamp_updated":1609918532,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwmumn6/YCdr/3wAI="}
