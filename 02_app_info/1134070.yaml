    about_the_game: "Keeper 2119 is about the experience of a character that after\
      \ being completely controlled by a mysterious force, they enter a reality completely\
      \ different to the known, with the assistance of a technological alien-type\
      \ device called \u201CTranslocator Device\u201D the character must overcome\
      \ a certain number of challenges to escape using the teleportation provided\
      \ from the &quot;Translocator Device&quot;, while this mysterious force causes\
      \ an internal doubt as to what the character believes as reality. Within the\
      \ game we will be able  to complement the use of teleportation with 3 new sub-mechanics\
      \ within each game space that will provide a new  gameplay so that the player\
      \ can progress trougthout the game. The entire game takes place inside a spaceship,\
      \ therefore each game space is represented by a specific area within the ship."
