    about_the_game: <strong>Can you defeat the overseer and live to tell the tale?
      </strong><br><br>Drones is an action packed, fast paced, arcade style game in
      which you must do whatever it takes to stay alive while facing hordes of drones
      which are hard set on preventing you from surviving. Dodge grenade launching
      sentries and patrolling probe mines while blasting open doors and disrupting
      shield generators. Beware of the wardens though, as each one has it's own special
      ability hiding in it's circuits - none of which are very forgiving. You'll die
      a few times, but each time you can upgrade you character permanently to make
      the next attempt a little easier - and those who stay vigilant may one day defeat
      the overseer.

    review: "I don\u2019t often do reviews, but I feel this game deserves one. I bought\
      \ Drones the day it released and had a very unique experience. I was streaming\
      \ the game, and the developer was active in my stream as I played. There were\
      \ bugs like any other game upon release, but this time the developer was actively\
      \ trying to fix them as I played and asked for my feedback on the game. There\
      \ were times where the developer would have me restart the game because he had\
      \ poured over the code and fixed bugs I was finding as I played. He was friendly\
      \ and helpful, and for that alone I would rate this game 10/10. He is truly\
      \ passionate and cares that the game is the best it can be. The game isn\u2019\
      t entirely my style, but I stilled enjoyed it greatly. It was kind of repetitive\
      \ at first, but that is due to the fact that it is challenging enough to push\
      \ you to play better, learn the tricks, and invest the time into unlocking upgrades.\
      \ It is visually appealing, the music fits well, the graphics are well done.\
      \ So those get a 10/10. My greatest complaint would be the mechanics and bugs.\
      \ I don't have much experience with games that aren't from some big name company\
      \ with many employees and a huge budget, so this game was finitely a change\
      \ of pace for me. The movement can be choppy at times, the doors hitboxes are\
      \ weird, and some other minor bugs like getting stuck in a wall and having to\
      \ use a grenade to get out. It would not surprise me if a couple days after\
      \ I post this review the developer has already fixed the problems I have presented.\
      \ I guess that's the upside to a small developer, they are invested in their\
      \ product, instead of cash-grabbing. I would highly recommend this game. It\
      \ is well worth the price, and your feedback will be valued. That\u2019s the\
      \ only reason I went out of my way to actual write a review."
