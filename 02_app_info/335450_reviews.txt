The story is interesting and varied and the world of Orlandes makes for a colourful setting. This game simply knocks the spots off the other entries in this series, with a longer and far more detailed narrative and also a much more emotional plot.\nYou investigate the death of an old friend and uncover an evil plot. You search out your other old friends and you can take any one of them along as a travelling companion to help defeat the evil plot. [SPOILER](and save your parents)[/SPOILER]\nThe dice-roll combat system can seem a bit harsh at times, but overall the game is really well designed and nicely set-out on the screen. The game has three difficulty settings and it is long enough and challenging enough to provide a good amount of replay value. Also, each travelling companion gives the game a noticably different slant.\nThere are some excellent colour artworks to collect, as well as a set of 32 achievements to complete.\nSteam trading cards are also available from this game, if you like that sort of thing.\nOverall, the game is superb vfm.\nOne small plot gripe: I was seriously shipping the hero with Gatito (the lurvely thief-with-a-kindheart) but instead you end up stuck with the irritatingly smug daughter of the Archduke, with no option to dump her!
