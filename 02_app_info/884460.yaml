    review: 'I won''t give it a thumbs down as I liked the concept, and the performance
      was mediocre (so I''ll give it a thumbs up since that''s the only other option
      to thumbs down)... However, I can''t really recommend it very much: navigation
      awkward, videos extremely blurry, keep traveling through walls and need to restart.
      Concept sounded good, but the execution felt very lacking, and there was very
      little coherency. Gameplay was minimal and content extremely limited. Felt more
      like a partially completed demo version


      All that being said, it''s short enough to perhaps try for yourself, and just
      refund if it doesn''t appeal to you as expected.'
