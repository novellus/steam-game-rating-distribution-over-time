    review: Easy to use and customize. You can even add your own models to the game.
      Very user friendly and much easier to use in comparison to TTS. I think the
      graphics are better too. They are still in Early Access, so there is still a
      need for additional features. I'm not crazy about the mod.io vs the Steam workshop.
      Hopefully they will change that over in the future. All in all though, I think
      personally like this a LOT better than TTS. I'm really hoping to be able to
      edit or create my own virtual room themes in the future! Right now they have
      a small list like (Victorian, Wild west saloon, etc.)
