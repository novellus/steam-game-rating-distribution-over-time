The graphics are beautiful. Very, very typical HO scenes that have a whole bunch of random stuff laying around. The interface is smooth and the story somewhat engaging, though still not well developed nor completed. Nice puzzles that aren't overly complicated to figure out. My biggest annoyance while playing it was not having a map feature available. However, the tasks page is very helpful when stuck.","timestamp_created":1607641434,"timestamp_updated":1607641434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+bC5p/YCeoLzuAI="}
