Although it's only half the resolution of the GenX product, at an overall 1.2m/pixel as opposed to 0.6m/pixel, it still provides plenty of detail and the elevation data is the same at 5m resolution.  \n\nFor someone looking for Scottish coverage at a forgiving install size this is attractive, as it comes in at a bit under 12GB whereas the Gen X are 30+GB each and there are 3 just to cover the mainland!  The outer Islands are extra!\n\nIt installed and ran seamlessly with no performance issues at all and is obviously a massive improvement on the default landscape.  So I now have comprehensive coverage of Scotland, so be it I'm still running the GenX scenery for Northern Scotland due to its improved resolution.  I run it with the Auto gen objects off, but that's just my preference.\n\nIt's somewhat restored my faith in JustFlight after a disappointing previous poor quality photo scenery release from them,  as this is a seamless continuum unlike the patch work of differing exposures they previously released.\n\nDespite it being a big improvement on the default scenery it definitely lacks some of the detail of the Generation X photo scenery. It does however, have better water on the whole with even small mountain streams showing water, unlike the GenX scenery where this and small mountain tarns tend to be missing. In addition it also has night lighting.  The overall colour is darker and more saturated than the GenX, with GenX being much brighter but with a slight green cast.  Which is preferable is probably down to personal taste.  I have found occasional issues with the terrain mesh in both products.  GenX does have nicer coastal water with transparency allowing you to see features beneath the surface which is a nice touch when flying.\n\nHard to choose between them really, both have their advantages, but the Just Flight comes in at a fraction of the price so for that alone it has to be great value for money.  Recommended for anyone looking for an upgrade to their Scottish landscape without breaking the bank!","timestamp_created":1605865885,"timestamp_updated":1606259010,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwne2f/vUCevu4rwI="}
