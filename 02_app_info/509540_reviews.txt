There are some nice puzzles there, but also a a lot of bland and frustrating ones.\n\nPros:\n+ Pirate ship level is really great: it got the best puzzle in the game and even decent looking environments \n\nCons:\n- Item handling are janky and do not have any physical feedback. And a lot of time it's impossible to tell if the object is interactable by looking at it\n- Visuals are bad even by 2016 VR standards\n- Final chapter got some really obscure abstract puzzles, especially compared to logical environmental puzzles of precious levels\n- Loading time is very long\n- Story doesn't make a lot of sense","timestamp_created":1594589707,"timestamp_updated":1594655365,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525719642639160156","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+Lq3pPMCd93ylAI="}
