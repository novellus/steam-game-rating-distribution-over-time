    review: "If you're looking for a violent, bloody game and/or like rock music and\
      \ dark graphic novel style designs, you will probably enjoy some of what this\
      \ game has to offer, however its gameplay is VERY simplistic as a rail shooter,\
      \ with mouse aiming and no controller support (as of 05/17) also, the environments\
      \ and lack of enemy variety can get stale fast, but with boss fights changing\
      \ the overall pace of the main gameplay I can see myself playing more of this\
      \ game later when I want something simple to progress through.\n\nYou pick up\
      \ various weapons including sword, smg, and shotgun, to take out enemies at\
      \ close and long range, while fending off towering, lumbering boss beasts including\
      \ a big crab-like spider while a throng of zombies constantly swarms you. \n\
      \nThe game takes a little getting into, and the UI / upgrade system is more\
      \ or less a complete mess (something about upgrading with transplants, from\
      \ adrenaline currency...?) I had a menu straight up freeze on the overlay and\
      \ it wouldn't go away, about how to insert upgrades. So not being able to clear\
      \ this error or see the menu itself I didn't bother to use the upgrade system\
      \ yet, and the overall UI / menu navigation of the game could use a redux. The\
      \ game also crashed on me a few times as I was clicking around rapidly in options,\
      \ but once the game itself was running I never ran into any other crashes or\
      \ issues with its performance. \n\nThese issues could be resolved in future\
      \ patches, as the game is still in early access as of May 2017. The developer(s?)\
      \ seem to care about the product, however, as they have bothered to make cutscenes\
      \ during the game and presented a \"full game\" despite its budget and scale,\
      \ so I would hope they release a future patch / update of some kind as what\
      \ is present is cool.  \n\nFor its cost and what the game offers I think it\
      \ presents itself really well if you're looking for something with some violent\
      \ edge, cool guitar riffs, and a distinct visual style. I'm happy with having\
      \ purchased it, though I also view the game as being very simplistic in its\
      \ user interaction, more akin to old arcade games.\n"
