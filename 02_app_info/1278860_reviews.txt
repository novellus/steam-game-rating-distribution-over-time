It reminds me to the pen&paper/tabletop games where I used such dice a lot myself. Instead of an invisible random success/failure program I can see the dice rolling. It makes the game slower than some other survival games, but it also adds a lot of \"flair\" which I like.\n\nThe Developer is polite and open for suggestions, and the game is better playable than some other Early Access games that I tried to play. I can walk around, loot plants, chests and other things for food and crafting. When I go sleeping, the game is saved, and after relog, the items are still available (some devs of other games failed in that point).\n\nFrom my point of view I can recommend this game, but of course there is still room for improvement, which is for me fully logical and acceptable in an Early Access game. And it gives me the possibility to add my own ideas into development. I will definitely keep this game in my library.","timestamp_created":1591423439,"timestamp_updated":1591423439,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541666686534881592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4idKOxPICfNG4jAI="}
