    review: 'Bought this for A$ 1. It''s an alright game for 1 dollar. There are many
      things that would be cool to add, but the game really is just what it is; a
      sort of browser game experience. Good to see the farming mechanics included
      (such as saving money from your run to gain an eternal power-up). This mechanic
      costs more gold with every click on the upgrade, so that also increases the
      amount of time you will have to spend on farming.


      Though surprisingly fun, it becomes incrementally tedious. I do, however, recommend
      the game for what it is, but it''s not much.'
