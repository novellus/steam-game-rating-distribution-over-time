The store in Rocksmith Game acknoledges purchase, will be asking for refund.\nFrequent player and purchaser of new DLC\n\nVERY DISAPPOINTED with ubisoft on this\n\nUPDATE SEPT 17, 2018: DLC is now working has been for some time, forgot to re edit this review to let others know, problems and issues should have been corrected, however why this pack is still only able to be purchased as a pack and not the songs seperately still vexes me for those who may only be interested in the one or two songs within the pack. Love the songs but others should have the right to choose if they only wanted one or two specific tracks.","timestamp_created":1533084815,"timestamp_updated":1537146718,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548364400863647461","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw87DF8uUCdO+ppwE="}
