It does feel like it's meant to be on a tablet or one of those over sized aracade games, like how they have fruit ninja as an arcade game. It's bright and colorful and great for kids. It's not that deep and won't last too long, but the characters designs are fun enough.","timestamp_created":1608700103,"timestamp_updated":1608700103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lfH/xvYCe/GtvAI="}
