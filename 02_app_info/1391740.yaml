    about_the_game: "<strong>The Darkness Confessed.</strong><br>S H R i M P is a\
      \ third person platformer where you play as a Shrimp set in a world of abstract\
      \ darkness. You take on the mantle of completing a ritual that had been abandoned.\
      \ Only the first step is clear of this ritual which is to collect all the cars.\
      \ During this journey of collecting cars on levels you come across horrific\
      \ entities roaming around trying to prevent you from completing the ritual.\
      \ You cannot fight back or engage into combat. Best you can do is use your abilities\
      \ to escape from the entities or calm the Shrimp from gaining too much anxiety.\
      \ Will you be able to complete the ritual? Are you brave enough to persevere\
      \ till the end in this forsaken world?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Game Features:</strong></h2><br><u>Basics</u><br>The\
      \ full game includes 20 levels total with loads of skins and headwear for the\
      \ Shrimp (Currently still developing cosmetics). You can find some skins/headwear\
      \ hidden on levels and buy them in the store with coins you pick up. There are\
      \ three difficulties present in the game. There is Endurance, Purgatory and\
      \ Sinner. Each difficulty adds a new challenge. These new challenges are detailed\
      \ within the game\u2019s difficulty screen. <br><br><u>Mechanics</u><br>The\
      \ Stereo is the most important element to calming the Shrimp taking away the\
      \ anxiety. Listening to music on the stereo is not mandatory on all levels while\
      \ on some it is crucial you do. Anxiety plays a significant role on levels that\
      \ contain entities such as the Porcelain Ghost and False Car. Another mechanic\
      \ that will come to use is playing dead. Porcelain Ghost will ignore you when\
      \ you play dead. Keep in mind if you do not play dead on time you will suffer\
      \ the consequence. Shrimp is able to evolve and gain newer abilities progressing\
      \ further into the game. These abilities will help you traverse levels efficiently."

    review: "I'm going to give my thoughts on the game as a whole and further down\
      \ there will be a section addressing people who are having a hard time with\
      \ this game.\n\n[h1] The Game [/h1]\n\nFirst off, I love the aesthetics of this\
      \ game. It has a strange, abstract, almost dreamlike feel to it while also having\
      \ lore that suggests that this is a world with a history. Something I appreciate\
      \ is that the game is weird, but it doesn't feel quirky. The stereo has a nice\
      \ selection of songs that range from chill to unsettling which helps set the\
      \ mood for both the horror focused levels and the platforming focused levels.\
      \ \n\nInitially there's no air control which means when you make a jump you're\
      \ completely committed to that jump. This is a weird choice for a platforming\
      \ game, but for a horror game it makes a lot of sense. Some of the most tense\
      \ moments for me were missing a jump and falling back down to where the creatures\
      \ were roaming. When you do get the air control it can't be used with the antenna\
      \ lights. I think this is a great mechanic for a horror/platforming game because\
      \ it leads to some unsettling moments where you have to choose between being\
      \ able to see and being able to control your jumps well. \n\nMost of the levels\
      \ require you to collect cars, batteries, key pieces, or a mixture of all them\
      \ to progress/complete the level. This works well with the horror aspect as\
      \ it requires you to go around the level instead of making a beeline past enemies\
      \ to get to the exit. These items aren't usually too hard to find as they all,\
      \ except for the key pieces, emit some light and make noise when you're close.\
      \ Even the key pieces aren't too much trouble to find because they are usually\
      \ next to a car or in an area that isn't very big to search. This collecting\
      \ can get a bit tedious on the larger levels because the light and sound the\
      \ items emit don't go that far. The replay value is pretty high because of the\
      \ secret collectibles hidden in most, possibly all, the levels and because there\
      \ is an alternate ending for beating the game on the hardest difficulty. \n\n\
      Overall, this game felt like a cult classic from the ps1 era and it seems like\
      \ games like this just don't get made anymore. If you're a fan of platforming\
      \ games and horror games then Shrimp is a must have.\n\n[h1] Misc/Helpful Tips\
      \ [/h1]\n\nOther reviews for this game mention the physics being weird and they're\
      \ likely referring to the lack of air control. This leads to some frustrating\
      \ platforming early on, but air control is an upgrade on level [spoiler] 12\
      \ [/spoiler] and after you get it it's available for all levels. This makes\
      \ replaying levels much more enjoyable. This game is a bit of a trial by fire\
      \ where if you can get past the first 4 levels then you shouldn't have too big\
      \ of a problem with the rest of the game. Also, other reviews mention the shrimp\
      \ going fast to the point where it's hard to control. I think this is either\
      \ lag, the camera being too sensitive, or a mixture of the two. I had the graphics\
      \ on the middle setting and it seemed fine, but later I put it to the lowest\
      \ setting and it felt much smoother so play around with those if you're not\
      \ sure. The camera was because every time you start or restart a level the mouse\
      \ sensitivity goes to the max setting. It's a bit inconvenient, but just go\
      \ into settings and and click the default mouse sensitivity and then the camera\
      \ movement should be good. One last tip, you can jump on your stereo. It's not\
      \ necessary to beat any of the levels, but it's surprisingly useful."
