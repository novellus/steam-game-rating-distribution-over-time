This game is one of those and it was so enjoyable. The visuals are also very cute and I really loved the sounds the creatures make. Great game!","timestamp_created":1609541816,"timestamp_updated":1609541816,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7OGK4PYCcL3FvwI="}
