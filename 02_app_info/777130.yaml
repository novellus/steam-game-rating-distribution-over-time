    review: 'I''d recommend this moreso as a phone game than a steam game. It''s one
      of those games you leave running in the background and pick up every now and
      then, but it''s not very interactive. It requires a lot of waiting to make progress,
      and if you''re an impatient player, you''ll have to buy your way to get farther.

      If you''re picking this up for unholy needs, keep in mind that these cutscenes
      are very short and not like your typical visual novel. Most cutscenes will be
      3 pictures. Despite there being an option to change your character from male
      to female, this won''t change anything in the game; Scenes are written to be
      gender neutral. It''s a bummer.

      Despite these problems, it''s pretty addictive. Characters are likable, some
      stories are funny. My favorite part so far has been the texting since this allows
      for roleplay. But if you''re impatient, stay away from this game. It''ll blue-ball
      you.'
