So of course I bought it, and played the heck out of it with my friends. I'd reccomend this game, but only if it's on sale as I've run into a number of weird bugs over the years, like for some reason the resolution doesn't match my TV's resolution, so bits of the arena are cut off. And this game hasnt had a major update in a while, so there's a few loose ends in it but it's still fun!","timestamp_created":1609033399,"timestamp_updated":1609033399,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4raf30PYCeqbLvQI="}
