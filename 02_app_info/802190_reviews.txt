The game is centered around throwing cards onto a grid in order to reduce defenses and eventually knock enemies out of the ring, sumo-style.  You get to construct a deck to determine what you use to attack enemies, which is good since there's little reason to hold middle-weight cards or a large amount of grid magic or field magic.  Because each of attack, defense, and two types of magic are bound by separate cooldown timers, the deck construction simply allows one to streamline their deck to [spoiler]  one grid spell, two field spells (heal and slick/damage), big defense cards, small attack cards to soften, big attack cards to kill   [/spoiler]\n\nAfter coming to grips with the general pace of the game, you learn that all the stats of monsters shown prior to each encounter really don't matter.  The same strategy works the whole way through the four campaigns and amounts to [spoiler]  little more than throwing cards as fast as possible [/spoiler].  The processional nature of the combat is not nearly engaging enough for its long hours of repetitive fights.  To note: Difficulty selection seems to only change the speed at which the game runs, so increasing the difficulty doesn't make the game more interesting.\n\nThe story has some nice characters to it, though its overarching plot is baffling, leaving major questions about the nature of magic and the monsters invading the world.  The four campaigns are completely separate from one another (as opposed to being the parallel narratives I initially expected).  The Prophecy narrative is the strongest of them with two sober characters intimately connected to their culture and history.  The Redemption story feels pointless with two characters who talk past each other almost the whole run.\nAlso, why glass?  I mean, it looks cool, but does it have some thematic resonance that I just missed for 20 hours?","timestamp_created":1603592064,"timestamp_updated":1603592064,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwKHirvUCf/H5qQI="}
