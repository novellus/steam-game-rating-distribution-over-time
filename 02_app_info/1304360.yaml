    review: 'Not a bad game, not a great game but good for the price.


      More or less what you might expect, a short, simple, rpg maker Roguelite  without
      much variety, but enough stuff that you can''t just mindlessly click through
      it. There are better, but for its price point it delivers.


      Though for you purists this is a roguelite not a roguelike, but its not THAT
      different. You do have a fixed party of 4, with a 5th characther later. They
      all at least have a few skills to vary battles'
