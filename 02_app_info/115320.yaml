    review: 'PROTOTYPE 2 is a worthy sequel that improves upon many of the lesser
      aspects of it''s predecessor, with particular focus on world design, mission
      design, side content, graphics, writing, tone, dialogue, presentation, and overall
      gameplay balancing.


      In other words, it''s a good game and you should play it.'
