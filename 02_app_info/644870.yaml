    review: "    Fortress of Hell is an RPG Maker game, but one intended for a mature\
      \ audience. Its heroes are all grown up, frequently vulgar/cynical, and there\
      \ will be plenty of sarcastic remarks.Also the theme of the games is quite depraved.\
      \ While I\u2019m not well versed in the state of RPG Maker games in the 2010\u2019\
      s, the combat system in this game seems fairly good, rewarding the use of buffs\
      \ and debuffs, and requiring some management of TP/MP. You won\u2019t be able\
      \ to simply spam skills and spells even in normal mode. Thankfully most of the\
      \ enemies can be dealt with mere weapon attacks, once your party has leveled\
      \ up a bit. The progression of the heroes contain numerous points, where you\
      \ have to choose one talent out of 3 or 2. The description of the outcomes are\
      \ sometimes too vague, so you might end up with an underwhelming upgrade. Not\
      \ that it matter that much, on normal difficulty the game can be easily completed\
      \ even with subpar choices.\n\n    The game claims up to 4 playthroughs with\
      \ different parties, each around 3-4 hours. Maybe without a walkthrough, just\
      \ departing after freeing your girlfriend it takes that much. However, if you\
      \ follow their walkthrough to witness everything, and fight all the fights to\
      \ level up as much as possible, it will take considerably more. The Brutus party\
      \ took me more than 7 hours, the Laxius party more than 5 hours. My third playtrhough\
      \ was for the \u201Cevil invasion\u201D scenario. You have to investigate the\
      \ statue with the \u201CDon\u2019t trust Me...\u201D inscription with the Laxius\
      \ party, then investigate the evil skull in the revealed chamber. After departing\
      \ the fortress with the Laxius party, the \u201Cevil invasion\u201D scenario\
      \ will be unlocked. It has a nice change in the mechanics, too bad there are\
      \ a lot less dialog in it, especially in the first half. You will probably want\
      \ to revisit that revealed chamber as soon as possible with your evil party,\
      \ as things change after further investigating there \u2026 .This playthrough\
      \ lasted a bit over 3 hours. It is the only one without a walkthrough, and after\
      \ the Fountain of Veritas I thought I have got stuck. Thankfully I have found\
      \ that the secret ladder has been activated somehow, so I could finish this\
      \ scenario too. I skipped the Hamilton party, seems to be the hardest one, and\
      \ I didn\u2019t want to play through a fourth time.\n\n    The location and\
      \ the enemies remained the same for all parties that I have played, but the\
      \ dialogs will be unique each time. Also some bosses will appear more than once\
      \ for the Brutus party, but will be dealt with right at the first time with\
      \ the Laxius party, or outright skipped during the evil invasion. To my great\
      \ surprise I found the banter in the Brutus party more entertaining than in\
      \ the Laxius party. Especially in the first half of the Laxius playthrough the\
      \ dialogs felt tepid. The second half gets a bit better, but even then I enjoyed\
      \ the Brutus dialogs more.\n\n    I have naturally played the game with the\
      \ help of the DLC playthrough. I have played through Laxius Force I and II without\
      \ one, then I have bought one for the third installment. After seeing what difference\
      \ that makes, I wouldn\u2019t consider playing through an Aldorlea game without\
      \ a walkthrough. While Fortress of Hell is merely a fraction of the content\
      \ in the Laxius Force games, still you will find keys that open doors in some\
      \ other part of the game. Without a walktrhough you might wander around aimlessly\
      \ quite a bit before finding the correct door which should be opened. Also there\
      \ are optional parts, which you will likely miss without explicit directions.\
      \ For example to get the treasure with the Laxius force party, the Brutus party\
      \ has to do some very specific things. Without that your quest for the optional\
      \ treasure with Laxius party has failed even before the start. Also for the\
      \ Brutus party the walkthrough will direct you through the available places\
      \ in an order which won\u2019t lead you to overly difficult fights or in the\
      \ case of the optional fight with fire elementals it will explicitly tell to\
      \ leave that for later.\n\n    As an RPG Maker game, it should run stable for\
      \ you. For various reasons I have played it not on my default Windows 10 computer,\
      \ but on my weak old computer with a Linux OS (was forced to replace Windows\
      \ XP because Steam wasn\u2019t supporting it, but didn\u2019t want to burn a\
      \ Windows 10 license for such an obsolete hardware), where it can be run only\
      \ through the experimental Steam Play / Proton layer. There it crashed frequently,\
      \ especially in the Guest Patio for some reasons. I had to save paranoidly frequently\
      \ because of this. Granted OBS was running in the background, recording the\
      \ gameplay real time with software encoding on a mere Core 2 Duo E8200. The\
      \ good news is that the game can be played through even on a Linux system, with\
      \ some patience.\n\n    I wanted to add the derpy Sarah achievement to my achievement\
      \ showcase (not because of this game but to show my appreciation to the Laxius\
      \ Force trilogy), but as of the writing of this it is not possible. Steam seems\
      \ to treat this game as \u201Cuntrusted\u201D, and prevents the displaying of\
      \ its achievements on the showcase. Guess I should be content that it allows\
      \ for me to unlock the achievements at all."
