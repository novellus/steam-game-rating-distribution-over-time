    review: I've only played a little, and when I get a chance I'm hoping to play
      more. The atmosphere and the story are very grim dark which i love. It has a
      few issues as it is right now, such as grip detection, being killed through
      doors, and the view doing wonky things when I look up or down to far. But overall,
      in my short time, I've enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to what this game could
      become in the future.
