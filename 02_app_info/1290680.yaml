    review: "This game is great! Cute visuals and artstyle, charming characters, a\
      \ catchy soundtrack good for pretty much anything, fun and simplistic gameplay,\
      \ and up to 4 players to play with! \nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is very simple\
      \ and easy to get a grasp of as it doesn't require you to do much and only requires\
      \ good positioning, movement, and supply management! It really boils down to\
      \ when you should start throwing snowballs or when to start making more. This\
      \ simple gameplay makes choosing a characters fairly easy as there's only a\
      \ few key things to worry about, how much damage each character does, how fast\
      \ each character is, how much snow they can hold, and their EX attack! (all\
      \ of this information is directly shown to you in the character select screen!)\n\
      Characters:\nThe characters are all cute and full of life! as mentioned before\
      \ every character has unique stats you can view on the CSS (character select\
      \ screen) and are all balanced and fun to play!\nCharacter rundowns:\nYukky\
      \ is a character for players who just want a balanced and honest jack of all\
      \ trades, them EX allows them to throw a big snowball that bounces across the\
      \ screen and is good for any form of gameplay!\nMizore is for players who want\
      \ a character who's quick and tricky with and EX attack that summons 2 copies\
      \ of her that will throw snowballs along with them\nRed is a character for people\
      \ who like to rushdown and get things done quick with big damage with their\
      \ EX attack that allows her to throw explosive snowballs!\nIgloo is a character\
      \ for people who like to play tanks in games and play like a brick wall, to\
      \ make up for their low speed, they have a high attack and 4 slots for their\
      \ snow! and their EX attack is a big beam that goes across the screen. However,\
      \ they are very easy to rushdown from their lack of mobility.\nSnorbo is the\
      \ exact opposite of Igloo, hes very fast but does little damage and can only\
      \ hold 2 snowballs, his EX attack allows him to move very fast and ram into\
      \ others!\nAicy is for players who want to play safe and far away, they have\
      \ low speed and a low amount of slots for snow but their EX ability is a homing\
      \ snowball with great damage.\nStages: at the moment of writing this, there\
      \ are only 3 stages in the game and each are different variations of \"flat\
      \ plain with platforms\"\nWhat I personally think the game needs:\n- A proper\
      \ tutorial, as the game does not have one at the time of writing this.\n- Online\
      \ play, at the time of writing this the game only supports 1v1 with a CPU and\
      \ 4-player fights. It would be nice to have an online experience for the game\
      \ so it can gain more replay value and a bigger scene\n- An in-game options\
      \ menu, explains itself, really\n- An in-game button to close the game, at the\
      \ moment you can only use force quits to close the game \n- More stages, 3 stages\
      \ is fine, but it could really use more to diversify gameplay\n- Team battles,\
      \ a 2v2 mode would be great for more diversified gameplay styles\n- Items, as\
      \ fun as the game is stand-alone i feel that items could help the game become\
      \ more interesting from a casual standpoint \n- 4 player VS CPU\n- And finally,\
      \ a training mode for players to practice the game and get a grip of what to\
      \ do and how the game feels \nTLDR:\nThe game is a cute and simple indie fighter\
      \ and no too complicated (something akin to Smash Bros, Nair or Stickfight the\
      \ game) and has a diverse roster of characters that lacks a few key elements\n\
      I recommend the game for simply having fun and goofing around with friends but\
      \ for a competitive e-sport?... only half honestly, if the game updates and\
      \ adds what I listed in the \"What I personally think the game needs\" section\
      \ then 100% it could have some pretty good potential!\nIf I missed anything\
      \ in this review or said something wrong and you'd like to add on to it, please\
      \ reply to this review correcting me!"
