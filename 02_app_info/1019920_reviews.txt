If you're fine with both of those (hell, it's a tower defense game so you might be looking for a pretty casual experience anyway) then there's 20USD worth of fun here, with some pretty visuals and voice acting on top. Otherwise, it might be better to grab it on sale. I had my problems with it, but I basically played through the game twice so I must not have minded that much.\n\nThe gameplay is passive: That's kind of inherent to a tower defense game and the game doesn't give you much reason to push out from your base most of the time. It's also really easy to clear stages, further making it feel passive and hands-off- ymmv but I definitely felt myself checking out during longer stages. There's a lot of gameplay variety between the 17 characters and ~20 traps, but the balance is somewhat poor and you can only take 4 traps into a stage, so it's hard to use the more exotic ones when it means sacrificing boring but reliable options. The problems are somewhat exacerbated by an upgrade system that makes the power imbalances between the traps worse, and makes replaying stages more tedious unless you deliberately downgrade yourself. There might be some challenge if you play to three-star every stage but I wasn't really feeling the urge. There are a couple of really interesting stages in the game but most kind of blur together.\n\nThe presentation is quite good: Environments are really pretty, with good use of the Unreal Engine's lighting and shadows, and the effekseer engine for particle effects. Character models are chibi and detailed enough, but the animation is pretty limited and some actions don't blend with each other, leaving an almost stop-motion effect. The sound effects are mostly serviceable, but several are re-used in ways that make them bad gameplay cues, for example the same sound effect used for the base taking damage is also used for random traps firing, which means you can't rely on it as an unambiguous indicator that you screwed up and cue to defend your base.\n\nThe story's kind of an excuse plot, and that's fine enough. There are a couple of interesting flourishes that use the wide swath of characters in interesting and clever ways, and that helps it feel like a somewhat cohesive whole rather than a greatest-hit collection of characters. The story does have character portraits though, and while half of them are really good, the other half are bizarrely horny. Reimu with a barely existing top and skirt down past her hips is a good example. More mature characters have massive chests with vaccuformed clothes. It's just jarring against the rest of the game's atmosphere, which is pretty cutesy.\n\nThe voice acting is good, with a variety of performances. It's impressive that all of the story dialogue is fully-voiced, but the actual gameplay voice clips are highly limited, with each character only having one voice line for each prompt, so you'll be hearing the same lines over and over again during gameplay, and they can get grating before too long. The priorities here might have been in the wrong place.\n\nIt's a bit rough around the edges, but if neither of the warnings in the first paragraph scared you off? Yeah, it's fine.","timestamp_created":1608474297,"timestamp_updated":1608474297,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540581941604614258","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qsCiwPYCf+XbuwI="}
