    review: "Very cute and a great throwback to games like Metroid. The little quality\
      \ of life things that separate a professional game from a hobby game is the\
      \ little quality of life touches that this one has. The different ways you can\
      \ play the game, the resolutions, saving, and level design all feel like they\
      \ are meant to work that way. \n\nThe level design is very clever; that every\
      \ time you die you are just that much closer to the end goal because you have\
      \ your newest upgrade or ability. The damage you take is not nearly punishing\
      \ enough to become frustrating, giving you ample opportunities to correct yourself\
      \ and take your time. \n\nSome cons:\nEnemy behavior is a bit erratic, leaving\
      \ them trapped smacking into one another and blocking off sections which seems\
      \ unintentional. \n\nThe sense of direction seems generally clear, but its hard\
      \ to distinguish what ability helps you get to what new area. You never really\
      \ get the \"aha!\" moment when you find a new item, because there's no way to\
      \ know if it actually works in this new way or not. \n\nOverall, obviously this\
      \ was very polished and very well executed. If you're a fan of challenging platformers,\
      \ this is definitely up your alley. Every little detail you come to expect from\
      \ a good game is present, and I hope to see more from CoolJosh3k in the future!"
