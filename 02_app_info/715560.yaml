    review: "I really want to love this game, but every single time I bump into an\
      \ invisible wall, I couldn't take it anymore. As much of an \"open world\" Eastshade\
      \ claims to be, it's actually gated behind fetch quest after fetch quest. No,\
      \ you can't swim or even wade through knee-deep water, there's an invisible\
      \ wall in the way and you need to go get a raft. No, you can't stay out in the\
      \ open at night, you'll need to buy a coat to prevent hypothermia. No, you can't\
      \ sneak across a toll bridge that nobody's guarding, there's another invisible\
      \ wall in the way and you have to pay up. No, you can't just buy a map, it's\
      \ another reward from another fetch quest. Okay, so I'm supposed to go from\
      \ point A to point B in this game, but why the hell am I walking so slow? Even\
      \ the sprint speed isn't all that impressive. Guess what, you need to buy a\
      \ bicycle for that. Where do you get that? It's actually from a vendor inside\
      \ a city called Nava, and you need 3 recommendation letter things from people\
      \ OUTSIDE Nava for security reasons. No, not INSIDE the city, OUTSIDE, because\
      \ clearly outsiders are so trustworthy that a guard has to be stationed between\
      \ them and the city. Seriously, who wrote this?\n\n Alright, maybe I could use\
      \ some console commands to increase the walk speed, but the problem is the command\
      \ SetWalkSpeed only works when I'm walking backwards, so now I'm practically\
      \ sprinting backwards while still walking at a snail's space if I want to go\
      \ in any other direction. Okay, fuck it, how about flying? The flight speed\
      \ on the other hand, was way too fast for indoor traversal, forcing me to drop\
      \ out of flight mode every time I enter a building. The flight controls are\
      \ not that great either, with no buttons bound to ascension and descension,\
      \ relying on the first person view angle to climb or descend.  \n\nThere are\
      \ other issues I have with this game as well. Apparently it's not possible to\
      \ rebind any keyboard or mouse controls, nor could I view what the controls\
      \ are bound to, which is a really weird design decision. The presentation of\
      \ this game is also a mixed bag. While objects generally look pretty from afar,\
      \ the plants will look like they're made out of paper if you look closer. The\
      \ NPC model designs are already terrible enough, but the talking animation really\
      \ freaks me out. The voice acting is also a bit hit or miss, ranging from pleasant\
      \ to downright annoying. The drawing mechanic isn't very fleshed out either.\
      \ Pressing E to take a screenshot and drinking tea for some additional effects\
      \ feels a bit lackluster, and it feels more like photography rather than painting.\n\
      \nAll of these issues culminates in a very frustrating experience, and I could\
      \ no longer bring myself to play this game anymore. I understand that this is\
      \ an indie game, but the progression system is so infuriating that it is impossible\
      \ for me to enjoy what would otherwise be a world that truly fits the definition\
      \ of \"every frame a painting\" under most circumstances."
