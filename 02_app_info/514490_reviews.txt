No instruction, the controls are confusing, you can't even tell if you're playing it right. The letters light up as you click them one by one, but stop lighting up as you click the next. You can't \"drag\" click, or it spins the cube around. So did it get the word or not? I love word games, and the idea is good, but the execution is horrible. Don't waste your time.","timestamp_created":1585591584,"timestamp_updated":1585591584,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0PCnlvECcdq8/AE="}
