    review: 'There''s a character in this game that fires homing rockets and a kamehameha
      wave with a 1 second cooldown. On it''s own that sounds incredibly unbalanced,
      but then you find out that every character is like this in their own way. For
      instance, One of the simpler characters is a guy with a sword and shield. That''s
      it, just a sword and shield. The problem is that he can block almost anything
      (I don''t think he can block poison.) so if you have the reflexes you can block
      and counter anything your opponents throw at you and take stocks really fast.
      All of the characters have something that makes them special and able to compete
      with the rest. (Besides roller skating girl in my opinion, because of how most
      map layouts are it''s hard to use her ability well.) I really like how fast
      paced the combat is and it''s fun to mess with people with characters like Owl,
      Rabbit, and Ice Man. The only problem I have with this game is the boss fights.
      They''re too long for how challenging they are, (Especially the Samurai and
      Puppeteer) I enjoyed the Ninja because you have a fair amount of time to react.
      The Bee fight was also fine, you just have to rush him as soon as he spawns
      if you don''t want to take too much damage from his barrages. The Afro Samurai
      was annoying. Unlike the Ninja he''s very spams out his sword beams so much
      in such a short period of time you can''t really react, so if he''s not going
      to be fair on the timing I think he should do the same routine every fight after
      getting hit. The same number of beams, in the same places every time you fight
      him. The Cactus is fine, you should be able to roll past him most of the time.
      The Puppeteer should be removed and is the worst fight by far. There is no pattern,
      there is no special scripted moments, he just has two more puppets and a lot
      of invincibility frames and it''s beyond annoying. He''s insufferable, I feel
      like I should get a costume for every character by beating that annoying waste
      of space once. (As of this review I have not fought the Poison so I can''t say
      anything about her fight here.) Overall: 8/10'
