    review: '[b][u]Game Information[/u][/b]


      "Off the Record: Linden Shades" Collector''s Edition is a Hidden Object Puzzle
      Adventure game. The game was developed by Eipix Entertainment and published
      by Big Fish Games.


      "Linden Shades" is the first episode of "Off the Record."


      Since this is a collector''s edition game, it comes with extra features that
      are not available in its counterpart; the standard edition.


      [b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]


      Game Visuals


      I want to mention that the visuals in the game are well done. The visuals can
      be adjusted in the game''s option menu.


      Game Audio


      I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio
      is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game''s
      option menu as well.


      Gameplay


      There are three different difficulty game modes to choose from: Regular; Expert
      and Insane.


      The typewriter keeps track of progression in the game. Such as story events
      and clues.


      There is an interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel
      between each location quickly without having the need to constantly backtracking.
      It also indicates that there are a variety of tasks that can be completed at
      various locations within the game. The interactive map is automatically given
      at the start of the game.


      There is a padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in
      place to make it stationary.


      There are some interactive items in the game. Some of the interactive items
      may require extra components before they can be interacted with. All interactive
      items are marked with a symbol in one of the corners.


      The hidden object scenes consist of the following: Find ''x'' amount and Traditional
      word lists. Some of these hidden object scenes may require little or no interaction.
      Most of the hidden object scenes can be replayed in the game''s extra feature
      section.


      The puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of
      them. Most of the puzzles can be replayed in the game''s extra feature section
      as well.


      There are three sets of collectibles in the game: Alphabets; Toys and Crayons.
      They are scattered throughout the game for the player to find.


      There are twenty different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the
      game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need
      to be completed before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game
      only.


      Since this is a collector''s edition game, there is a bonus chapter, but it
      can be accessed only after the main story is completed.


      Miscellaneous


      There are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Bonus Hidden Object Scenes;
      Bonus Puzzles; Concept Art; Wallpapers; Soundtracks; Movie Trailers; The Making
      of the Game and Game''s Strategy Guide. Most of these extra features can be
      accessed only after the entire game is completed.


      Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay
      value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game''s
      full price value.'
