    about_the_game: 'Through the Masks of Luzia, based on the acclaimed Cirque du
      Soleil production, is a vibrant celebration of Mexican culture, shrouded in
      surrealism and dreamlike fantasy. A mysterious child serves as your guide as
      you journey through uncanny worlds of mythical proportions: a demigod swings
      across the gateway to the Mayan afterlife and gains the trust of an ancient
      jaguar; a contortionist, flanked by animals and insects, grants you a front
      row seat to the awe-inspiring wildlife; a monarch butterfly dances, evoking
      the celerity of the Tarahumara people. With all this and more, prepare for the
      waking dream of Through the Masks of Luzia.'
