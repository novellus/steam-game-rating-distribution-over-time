Which, wasn't originally what one would think upon looking at how it's advertised. It had me laughing out loud quite a few times and actually playing through all the endings instead of looking them up for that reason. Fully voice-acted which is always a+. The characters were cute and the overall story was playful and enjoyable.\n\n2 routes with generically the same story you follow for both. Choose whoever you like best for the first playthrough because the second one just didn't feel as exciting for me. Either way, 9/10 will play everything this developer releases. Juicy.
