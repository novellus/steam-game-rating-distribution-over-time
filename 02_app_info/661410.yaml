    review: 'WIthout the poop jokes, the storyline would at least be the start of
      something, but this is pretty bad and does the whole poop joke thing overboard
      (even though that''s the entire theme of this), but other cons are that it doesn''t
      seem very well balanced, with items being ridiculously expensive.


      The absolute last straw for me though was having to dodge instadeath orbs as
      part of the main quest. As a side puzzle, okay fine as I can just skip that,
      but as part of the main quest is dumb.'
