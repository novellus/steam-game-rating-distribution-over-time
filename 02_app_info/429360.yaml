    about_the_game: '<h2 class="bb_tag">Werewolves shooting fireballs at each other!</h2><br><i>Lupinball</i>
      is a hilariously hectic 2-to-4-player deathmatch, which starts out like dodgeball
      but slowly becomes a bullet hell. Power up and blast your foes in their fuzzy
      faces, but here''s the key: fireballs zoom around the arena forever, bouncing
      off walls and speeding up over time. The arena gets insanely chaotic in seconds,
      as everyone shoots more and more and <strong><i>more</i></strong> fireballs!
      Last wolf standing wins.<br><br>Which fluffy fighter will be the survivor among
      the fiery doom?<br><br><strong><i>Join the official Lupinball Discord server!
