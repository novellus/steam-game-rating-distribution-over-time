    review: 'After playing this game for like 20 hours, I gotta say, the reviews are
      too harsh. If you''re interested but unsure, definitely go for it on sale. The
      $20 CAD I paid was a good deal imo. (I''d personally value this game at around
      $40, maybe $50)


      THINGS TO NOTE: The game is slow. It''s close to Harvest Moon in pacing out
      chores. A lot of the reviewers that are complaining about the ''grind'' on here
      are people that I suspect didn''t bother learning the game patterns and chore
      allocating. You can''t explore the entire island AND help your cafe, especially
      early game, so make sure you''re planning out your days and where you want to
      go. Check on the cafe during busy times (12:00 and 7:00pm respectively), then
      run out and do your gathering. You can teleport right back to the cafe if the
      staff need help. And if you need hints on how to speed the story along, just
      check the ''story'' tab and it tells you what you need to do to progress.


      Issues I wish I could fix: character controls are wack. I adapted pretty quickly,
      but it can still be annoying when you''re trying turn a certain way and end
      up falling off a rock lol. Only being able to gather things 1 at a time makes
      the game feel sluggish. Cafe wise, It''s hard to tell when a customer is about
      to leave during a rush, I still haven''t figured that one out. And NPCs will
      occasionally push me out of the way when I''m trying to serve dishes. You gotta
      get outta their way, cuz they ain''t altering their path for you lol.


      There''s valid gripes with this game, and I share quite a few of them, but I''m
      still pretty obsessed and having a great time, so I''d say the issues are forgivable.
      If you like fantasy settings, pet raising, and farm/exploration elements, consider
      trying this game. The characters are all pretty lovable (and with surprisingly
      poignant storylines??). It''s rewarding to watch your little dragon grow, too.
      At the time of writing this I just reached the young adult dragon stage and
      being able to ride around and travel the world freely is so great. The NPC designs
      are real cute and the writing is really good! I want more games like this!'
