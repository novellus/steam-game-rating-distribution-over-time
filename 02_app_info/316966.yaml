    about_the_game: 'DCS: C-101 Aviojet will include both the C-101EB and C-101CC
      models. The C-101EB model is the primary jet trainer and aerobatic display aircraft
      of the Spanish Air Force, whilst the C-101CC model, with its 7 hard-points and
      uprated engine, is a versatile light attack aircraft that has seen combat with
      the Honduras Air Force against drug traffickers. It is also in service with
      the Jordanian and Chilean air forces. The two models of the C-101 have many
      similarities that include cockpit layout, core-systems operation, and aerodynamic
      design. This commonality brings something for everyone to include lead-in jet
      training, advanced aerobatics, and light attack.<br><br><strong>NOTE: The C-101

    review: "I dislike this module very much and regret the purchase.\n\nI was expecting\
      \ a light and nimble aircraft that would be a good proxy for low-intensity combat\
      \ scenarios, but instead I got an extremely under-powered, wonky flying aircraft\
      \ that carries a tiny payload. \n\nMaybe my expectations were high, but I really\
      \ dislike is how poorly the aircraft performs and how sensitive the flight model\
      \ can be. I find myself CONSTANTLY trimming the aircraft and still seeing it\
      \ pitch left and right. \n\nThe aircraft barely seems able to hold a heading\
      \ - in fact, the heading and altitude controls just don't seem to work either\
      \ - or are extremely sensitive. \n\nOr maybe this is just a crappy in-game flight\
      \ model depiction of a decent real-life aircraft. Given its real-world missions\
      \ (airshows and training) then I highly doubt this aircraft handles this poorly\
      \ in real life.\n\nAvoid this aircraft."
