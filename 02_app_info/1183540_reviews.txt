Would advise a good graphics card.\n\nEdit: I just noticed that the skins can not be applied to the 1x1x2 cylinder. This is said in the description of the DLC to be that the skins CAN be applied the the 1x1x2 cylinder. This may be a bug or a wrongly implemented feature, however it isn't what they have said. Just be warned if you want to get the DLC for that reason.","timestamp_created":1596272948,"timestamp_updated":1596441794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3ZLW2fMCc/7gmAI="}
