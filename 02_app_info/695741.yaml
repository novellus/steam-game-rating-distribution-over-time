      some of EVE's best ships and skills, as well as giving you an infinite skill

      you will switch back to Alpha Clone State. Alphas are unable to use or train
      the Omega skills but all money, items and ships will remain. Your progress in
      the Omega skills is maintained and as soon as you upgrade again all your trained
      skills will be active. Omega's flexibility lets you choose when and how you
      play. Your 3 month period of Omega Clone State will begin from the moment you
