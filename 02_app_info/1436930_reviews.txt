Issues:\n\n* No experience is ever earned meaning character progression is completely broken\n* Combat is broken, the enemies do very little damage.  Temple of Apshai is a punishing game and it's fairly common to die without a proper build and paying attention to health.  \n* The item values are broken.  For example, there's a Copper Ingot in a hidden room on the first level that's normally worth 20 silver - this version gives 450 silver.  With the combat system broken as well, it's trivial to walk in, pick up that copper ingot a few times and have enough money to get maximum equipment.  That's not supposed to happen.\n\nI never thought I'd give Temple of Apshai a poor review as I have good memories playing the C64 version back in the day, but what's released here is a very broken version.  It's sad that they didn't catch this themselves with some basic play testing.  After talking with some others in the DOS retro gaming community and checking original disks, the DOS version has always apparently been broken.  \n\nThey should really replace with this another emulated version (C64, Atari 8-bit, Atari ST, Amiga) that actually plays correctly.  This version is just broken and as long as they're offering the DOS version stay away.  It's a shame because this is a classic RPG and any other version of the Apshai Trilogy would be worth playing.","timestamp_created":1607562339,"timestamp_updated":1607562339,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.623711049556732178","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4q9SLpfYCeNHAuAI="}
