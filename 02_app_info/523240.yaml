    review: "Been wanting to pick this up for awhile. This movie was critically acclaimed,\
      \ people went wild for it, but I was hesitant to purchase it for a long time\
      \ due to my thinking that this may be some ultra-weebish slice of life flick\
      \ (it's not). So I was waiting for the winter sale, hoping it would be on sale,\
      \ but it wasnt. I caved in and purchased it anyway, and I am glad that I finally\
      \ did.\n\nThis movie just hits so many marks - The characters are great, believable,\
      \ and real. The art work is astounding. The story is well paced and suitable\
      \ for the narrative. The storyline, the writing, comes together brilliantly\
      \ - unfortunately I do not want to say more than that for risk of any spoilers.\
      \ But the feels are real. The soundtrack is pleasant. etc. etc. etc. I feel\
      \ as though I could list pro' after pro while not being able to think of any\
      \ con to the movie. \n\nIt is really a must have for anyone who enjoys anime,\
      \ good movies, good stories, etc.\n"
