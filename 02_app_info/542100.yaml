    review: Moves way too fast. No easy pause mechanism. No speed control. You have
      to reset switches for trains coming the other way. Impossible to make some switch
      changes in the split seconds some combinations require. Stop lights are timed
      from when you activate them instead of when the train arrives so you have to
      time it at that right moment. Just a mess of madness. Maybe you should play
      it in a speed limiter maybe.
