The big plus to this game was color but I feel that detracted from the entire experience of clicking an object and having that object move something or trigger something to occur that helps you find a character you're looking for. Mostly enjoyable experience other than the fact that most of the objects were just blended in to the background or only a very specific part of them was showing.\n\nWould still recommend this game, but only if you play Hidden Folks first","timestamp_created":1610087942,"timestamp_updated":1610087942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw94iu8PYCdrW8wQI="}
