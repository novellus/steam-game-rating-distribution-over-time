However, I am happy it went free to play for everyone to enjoy. This is a good app, but it obviously went free to play for a reason. It's just clunky overall to use. \n\nIf you can look past the unintuitive UI / tools then you can enjoy easy-to-make Dioramas with lots of toys to play with included. There are lots of 3D models you can use in this app to create many different scenes. It's easy to move around (press grab to move yourself around) and rotate objects or the world (grab + joystick left or right). \n\nI could not figure out a way to delete items once created (looking at the community forums, the dev says on the Oculus to press Y while holding an object - I thought I had tried that). I don't think there's a way to make new objects or import / export objects or your final creations. However, it is enjoyable to view the dioramas already-made within this app or view your own creations. Probably one of the easiest creation tools once you get the hang of the interface. \n\nObviously, this app is limited in what you can do, but the trade off is that it's very easy to create worlds. I was able to make a good looking diorama using the pre-made assets in about 10-15 minutes with little knowledge of this software. The question becomes though: what good is it to create something if you can't easily share it with anybody else?\n\n[b]Rate 7/10. It's free and it's one of the better free apps on Steam. I just wish the tools & UI were more polished.[/b]","timestamp_created":1560542143,"timestamp_updated":1560542373,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568988561630249023","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yNzkq+sCfP+0wwE="}
