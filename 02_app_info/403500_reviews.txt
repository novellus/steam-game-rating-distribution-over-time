I DMed this campaign and had four and then later five players play the campaign.\n\nThis was my first time DMing so take what I say as you will, but it was a rather hard campaign to DM (which I later saw many people online saying this). The campaign has a decent story, but there is only small tidbits that is strewn across the book that interweave the story. For the **most** part each chapter is rather separate from the others and how to get them all to link together takes a bit of forethought.\n\nFor example all of the starting NPCs in the group play roles later on, and this is not clear unless you read ahead. In essence what you need to do read each chapter to figure out how each tag-along NPC should act and what their motives and uses are (for the most part each chapter has a location one NPC wants to go). I would read a chapter or two ahead of my players and this causes issues as I did not read the entire book ahead of time. I messed up on some of the NPCs.\n\nFrom some of the players perspective they felt kind of railroaded even though this campaign is a fairly big sandbox. This could be because I am a new / bad DM, but they were asking \"why are we doing this again?\" For many chapters they thought the campaign would end as soon as they get to the surface (which is actually the halfway point).  The also did not like the survival mechanics (getting lost, looking for food, madness, resting causing a con save, etc.).  Personally as a player I would have loved these mechanics, but my players are more role-play heavy and more \"beer and pretzels\". \n\nIf your players want a gritty, survival, and always near death game where you wander from place to place, it would be a lot of fun!\n\nA few downsides to the campaign in general is not enough maps, the reason to kill the BBEG is not personal,  the player's have false choices (go to the next place over here where it is level appropriate, or miss out on a ton of XP and being under equipped), and also the players did not like the lack of magical items. \n\nIt is all up to personal taste, and I think I would have liked it more as a player than some of my friends. Currently we are playing Curse of Strahd as it is kind of the opposite (BBEG is up in your face, lots of role-play, seems to have more magic items, and more puzzles).","timestamp_created":1569952986,"timestamp_updated":1569952986,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575438618659973145","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwua6fxO0CeJ6j0wE="}
