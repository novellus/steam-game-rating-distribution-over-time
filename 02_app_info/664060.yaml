    review: 'Edit: You know what, over the last two years since I''ve played this
      game I''ve actually found myself recommending this game to people more than
      I expected. so I''m changing my rating to a recommend. That said, I still think
      people should know going in there''s a little jank and the ending is still pretty
      bad (also that last boss fight specifically) I''m still not 100% sure it''s
      worth the price but obviously I still have fond memories of it till now so maybe
      I''m wrong here.


      -original review-


      I liked the game, although I don''t think it''s really worth more than a dollar.
      It was a fun world to explore, not very challenging, but fun.


      I will say, the game really feels like the developer rushed the ending, while
      jank is present for the whole game, it really ramps up when you''re fighting
      the last few bosses. With the final boss feeling like it was just put there
      beause the game needed it to be considered finished.


      If I had anything to recommend to the developer, it would be to take this game,
      and make a metroidvannia style game with the engine, with a heavy emphasis on
      exploration and atmosphere, I think they way they develop is really geared towards
      that. Though I might just like the atmosphere because it reminds me of old free
      indie games I used to play.


      Now, as for whether or not you should buy this game, While I''d like to recommend
      it, I just cant at this price. Like I said, It''s worth about a dollar in my
      eyes. It''s a fun experince, there''s nothing about the game that is actively
      offensive except for some occasional glitches or jank that thankfully your character
      is exempt from, but the ending really really left a bad taste in my mouth.'
