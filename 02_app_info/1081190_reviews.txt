A throwback to a Simple platformer and hack n slash. The cutscenes are very \"ninja gaiden\" haha. Attack, Jump, Climb...etc. If it had a few more weapons upgrades it would be better.  A retro styled kick to our nostalgia & overall pretty good. i'm happy with it. would reccomend.","timestamp_created":1608530226,"timestamp_updated":1608530374,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw17X4wfYCf5/wuwI="}
