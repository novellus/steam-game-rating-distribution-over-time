      is built on a turn-based combat system closely inspired by the original X-Com
      and Jagged Alliance. You'll devise strategies based around the unique set of
      abilities you've chosen for your team, and then execute them step-by-step, all
      while responding to counter-moves made by the enemy. It models the stress of
      battle on your heroes, who can flee or go berserk if things start to go too
      wrong. Additionally, everything in the game is destructible. If you damage the
      supports of a building in the middle of a fight, the whole structure can come
      crashing down on you. Inadvertently starting a small fire in the wrong place
      can lead to being caught in the middle of a massive inferno. Combat is dynamic,
      and easily spirals out of control.<br><br><i>Cover art by Joshua Hutchinson.</i>

    review: "Challenging Turn-Based Strategy game with Voxel graphics and destructable\
      \ environments. Game still has an active Dev. Most recent update that was a\
      \ direct result of players critique on ballance.\n\nOne of my earliest games\
      \ started on the Mario inspired tileset. Moved one of my team out of the starting\
      \ building. Near the end of his move he got spoted by a close by enemy, a sploder.\
      \ Neither of the other two of the team could move to get line of site on this\
      \ enemy.  \nNow it is the enemies turn. The sploder jumps at my guy outside,\
      \ landing next to him and explodes. There is now a huge crater in the ground\
      \ where my guy used to be standing. A wall of the building that the other two\
      \ guys were still inside of, is now gone from the explosion. With no wall to\
      \ hold up the roof, a good part of the roof collapsed on my two remaining guys.\
      \ One dies and the other is badly injured. \nNow it's my second turn.  \"OMG\
      \ WTF just happned?\" After a bit of rage and laughter, restart.\n\nThere is\
      \ a free demo, so give it a try."
