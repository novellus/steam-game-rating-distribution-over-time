Don't expect the most serious of stories, but it is very cozy and reminds me of childhood games.  Collect about ~20 monsters to tag along with you (although you will only ever use two given party size).  In the beginning it is very linear but around the level 30 range, the game opens up and there are several spots that you can explore that are out of the way.\n\nGood game, nothing more to be said","timestamp_created":1604623624,"timestamp_updated":1604623624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9KzBzfUCdZ/KrAI="}
