    review: 'I am really looking forward to watching how this title will evolve. At
      the moment, it''s a fun turn-based game with great flavor that is right up this
      humble reviewer''s alley. I love crime games and there is not enough gritty,
      tactical, management based games steeped in realism. The game''s mechanics are
      similar to a game I really enjoy on my phone called "Respect" and its sequel.
      Yet, Gangster Empire: Vendetta has quite a few more options for expanding your
      criminal empire.


      As of now, the title is a little rough around the edges, but the game''s heart
      is there and can provide any aspiring crime kingpin a healthy distraction. I
      am happy to support a developer that is thinking outside of the box and offering
      a different spin on the turn-based genre and cannot wait to see what blossoms.'
