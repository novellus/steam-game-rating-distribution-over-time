The text-to-speech voices are a little weird and might hopefully be replaced with voice actors in the final version, but I thought that the robotic delivery actually helped with the dry comedy.\n\nThe physics of the flying feel very intuitive from the start, and the levels get more challenging quickly enough. But the humor in the writing is what I enjoyed most. I rarely laugh out loud during games, but this one actually had me laughing quite a bit at the remarks of the snarky robot instructor. You'll know which one I mean.","timestamp_created":1603045690,"timestamp_updated":1603045690,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwqYG+nvUCeJrYqAI="}
