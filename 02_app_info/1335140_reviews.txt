The box set retailed at 3990 Yen, roughly 37 USD, when it came out in 2012. But, if you are trying to find a new copy of it today, it will be around this price or a bit more; 60-70 USD from 3rd party sellers. The box is broken into three parts on Steam for around 19 USD each. The songs, are in MP3, AAC, and FLAC format audio. \n\nWith that minor annoyance out of the way, the soundtracks of the first three games are very good. Dare I say my favorite OSTs of all time. If you missed the chance to get the actual CDs or like digital better, this is it here. The most complete collection of the first three Ace Attorney games' soundtracks. Not a single song is left out, you'll find it all here. Every variation, every ringtone. \n\nI am very pleased to see this on Steam, despite its price. Now please excuse me while I go change my pants after listening to the album in FLAC. \n","timestamp_created":1593375019,"timestamp_updated":1593375019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.641400992870330811","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/6mj/vICdvGQkQI="}
