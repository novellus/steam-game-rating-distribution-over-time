    about_the_game: <p>In this 991 MB demo, players will jump into the blood-soaked
      boots of the Norse Warrior, one of the four characters available in the full
      game. The Norse Warrior is the toughest and most brutal character in the game,
      and prefers to deal death with two-handed weapons - including his trademark
      battle axe. As part of the demo campaign, players will have to collect elements
      needed to defeat Fenrir the legendary giant wolf and will also be able to level
      their character up to a max of 20 - which means several hours of hack 'n slash
      fun for those who will want to explore the skill tree of the Scandinavian hero
      (200 is the maximum level you can reach in the game). In order to do this, players
      will face hundreds of enemies, wild beasts and other dangerous creatures that
      live in Myllkwoord forest, in the volcano and in the dungeons of the goblin
      city.</p>
