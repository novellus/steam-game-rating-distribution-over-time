It's exceedingly easy to make one little mistake and then winning becomes impossible. Can't see any potential replay value, and I most certainly don't enjoy the game enough to want to actually try for level 3. The game is a very low price, so there's that. Is it worth the money? Well, I played it for about 25 minutes or so, and people have paid a lot more before to be relatively entertained for that amount of time. All depends on perspective I guess, but from my perspective the game is uninstalled and will remain such. I wouldn't recommend it, but I'll end on a high note. I have no damn clue how to make games, and this might be someone's first crack at it. Well done. I wouldn't say it's necessarily 'bad', if that means anything. It's still a game, and SOMETIMES winning is possible though I suspect that there's occasions when the game screen loads and from the get-go it's impossible, but I just can't be arsed to experiment with the game to see if that's true. Like I said, it seems as though randomness has a big role to play, I suspect TOO big.","timestamp_created":1559910069,"timestamp_updated":1559910069,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528301894664764404","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sNb4mOsCff/1wgE="}
