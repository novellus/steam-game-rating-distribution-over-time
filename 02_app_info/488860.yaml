    about_the_game: '<strong>MADNESS: Project Nexus</strong> is a <strong>third-person
      Run n'' Gun-slash-Beat''Em Up</strong> filled with arcade-style action and button-mashing
      brutality. Train your custom Madness combatant for the endless trials of Arena
      Mode, building weapons from your own sick imagination to get through just one
      more wave of deranged assailants. Or, play through the core campaign as the
      antiheroes of the Madness universe and unearth the terrible secrets of Project
      Nexus itself.<br><br><i>MADNESS: Project Nexus</i> challenges your use of immersive
      &amp; tactical combat, on-your-feet decision making, environmental navigation,
      a massive selection of weapons, and a pretty heavy dose of comic blood and violence.
      You''ll progress through the game by navigating between rooms and overworld
      stages, engaging baddies along the way (who become wiser and more tactical as
      you advance). Not everyone is cut out to survive; we think you may be the exception.<br><br>Can
      you overcome the hordes of gun-toting Agents, sword-brandishing assassins, and
      bullet-deflecting giants that Project Nexus throws in your path? Grab your trusty
      weapon and <i>let''s find out.</i><br><br><strong>MADNESS: Project Nexus features:</strong><br><ul
      class="bb_ul">    <li><strong>Story Campaign:</strong> Take the reigns of the
      heroes of the Madness universe, and infiltrate heavily guarded installations,
      survive cultist-ridden tunnel networks, fight back against dynamite-wielding
      cannibal bandits, and dodge the grasp of armor-plated Mag Agents over three
      times your size.<br>    </li><li><strong>Arena Mode:</strong> Create your character
      from scratch, advance through specialized skill tiers, and build a unique Madness
      warrior who is equipped to take on wave after wave of never-ending badguys in
      several combat environments. Build your own custom weapons and outfit them with
      the latest technology to give yourself the edge you''re going to need to pull
