      \ THE ROADMAP</h2></a><br><br>As you've noticed by now, even with a map in hand,\
      \ sometimes we have to take detours and diverge from our original path. &quot;Not\
      \ all those who wander are lost&quot;, however. <strong>We absolutely still\
      \ plan to deliver all the promised content, we just had to change the order\

      \ game:</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY</strong></h2><br>Children\
      \ of Morta is an action RPG with a rogue-lite approach to character development,\
      \ where you don\u2019t play a single character - but a whole, extraordinary\
      \ family of heroes. Hack\u2019n\u2019slash through hordes of enemies in procedurally\
      \ generated dungeons, caves and lands and lead the family of Bergsons, with\
      \ all their flaws and virtues, against the forthcoming Corruption.<h2 class=\"\

      \ /><br><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br>Gameplay-wise it's a unique mix of action-adventure\
      \ RPG, rogue-lite and hack and slash game. By leveling up, you develop not only\
      \ individual characters but also the entire family. There is no permadeath and\
      \ you can change family members between the dungeon runs.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/330020/extras/2_Story.gif?t=1605022201\"\
      \ /><br><strong>STORY</strong><br>The story takes place in a distant land but\
      \ copes with themes and emotions common to all of us: love and hope, longing\
      \ and uncertainty, ultimately loss... and sacrifice we are willing to make to\
      \ save the ones we care the most for. Ultimately, it's about a family of heroes\
      \ standing against the encroaching darkness.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/330020/extras/4_DungeonCrawling.gif?t=1605022201\"\
      \ /><br><strong>DUNGEON CRAWLING</strong><br>All the dungeons in the game are\
      \ procedurally generated, which means their layout is different with each adventure.\
      \ There can be from two to four levels of each dungeon, with a unique boss fight\
      \ at the end. You can always get back to the previous dungeons to get extra\
      \ XP or finish all the side quests.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/330020/extras/5_Characters.gif?t=1605022201\"\
      \ /><br><strong>CHARACTERS &amp; SKILLS</strong><br>Ranged attacks, magic spells,\
      \ blocks, stuns, healing, evasions and passive skills - it's all there for you\
      \ to discover, unlock and upgrade. You can choose from seven different family\
      \ members, each one having unique skill sets. The father, John - a protective\
      \ warrior with a sword and shield. The elder daughter Linda - a precise archer.\
      \ Kevin, a quiet fighter equipped with deadly daggers. Lucy - a lively and bold\
      \ fire mage. Mark - a mindful martial arts fighter. Joey - who smashes his enemies\
      \ with a sledgehammer. And the latest addition to the family - Apan, a mighty\
      \ healer and a firm defender in one.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/330020/extras/6_Artstyle.gif?t=1605022201\"\
