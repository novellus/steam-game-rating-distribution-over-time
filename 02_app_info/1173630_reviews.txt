The soundtrack is my absolute favorite part of it, and I found myself purchasing the soundtrack shortly after the game. There have been several updates to the game since I bought it, and the developer seems really approachable in case there is a problem or you have questions regarding the game.","timestamp_created":1606404471,"timestamp_updated":1606404471,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530201315879821777","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1606487529,"developer_response":"Thank you so much for such a positive review!\n\nI really appreciate that you played ‚ù§."}],"cursor":"AoJ4jd/KgvYCcs6+sgI="}
