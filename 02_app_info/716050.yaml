    about_the_game: "You are the commander of an elite Strike Team aboard the warship,\
      \ HYDRA. Your first combat mission will have you leading your team in vicious\
      \ ship-to-ship battles against the Sethari, a mysterious alien race whose soldiers\
      \ are genetically bred for war. <br />\n<br />\nIn Strike Team Hydra, you lead\
      \ an elite squad of futuristic soldiers in grueling, turn-based combat. Using\
      \ an intuitive, action-point system, command each warrior to use cover, suppressive\
      \ fire, advanced weapons and iron will to defeat the enemy. Always outnumbered,\
      \ your soldiers will depend on your tactical brilliance to prevail.<br />\n\
      <br />\n\u2022\tCOVER: Use barricades and barrels as cover for your soldiers.\
      \ Less conventional force fields and tachyon fields can also grant a tactical\
      \ edge to those that hold them.<br />\n  <br />\n\u2022\tSUPPRESSION: Use suppressive\
      \ fire to pin enemy soldiers in place before finishing them off in close assault\
      \ or with a well-placed grenade.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\tACTION POINTS: Every\
      \ action, including movement, attacks and special abilities, requires action\
      \ points. Spend them wisely to achieve victory.<br />\n<br />\n\u2022\tMORALE:\
      \ Your soldiers and the enemy are affected by their courage and determination.\
      \ If the battle goes well, they fight with grit and determination. If it goes\
      \ badly, they will focus more on saving themselves than the mission at hand.<br\
      \ />\n<br />\n\u2022\tCHARACTERS: Build a team from 12 different character classes\
      \ ranging from heavy-weapon specialists, snipers, rangers, to exotic classes\
      \ such as the deadly psi-operative. Freely switch members of your team as you\
      \ progress through the campaign and enlist heavy robots and other units for\
      \ special missions.<br />\n<br />\nPlay through a campaign featuring 28 intense\
      \ firefights including various mission objectives and grueling boss fights.\
      \ An additional 20 combat missions are available to hone your skills."
