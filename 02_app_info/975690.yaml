    short_description: You've been hired to defend ELASH, the kingdom that you don't
      have any relation with. The money that the King promised you was more than enough
      to drive you defending it from Ashley's minions.

    review: 'After 5hours playing, here are some thoughts.


      Pros:

      GREAT Soundtrack (scary/fun theme).

      GREAT Mechanics (some harder than the others).

      COOL Graphics (It looks childish but it''s kinda scary).

      FUN Gameplay.

      It''s nice to play with friends at home, trying to beat the highscore. I also
      liked the elements stuff, it brings some strategy to the game.


      Cons:

      Only four types of enemies (despite that 3 of the enemies have 3 elements -
      makes 9).

      No co-op mode.


      It''s fun to play and to challenge friends but if those cons turns to pros,
      it would be awesome. Hope you consider it! Keep up the good work.'
