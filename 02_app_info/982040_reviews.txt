Feels like it has a great base to it that could be moulded into something cool but at the moment it's not there.\n\nThere's no real opening exposition or establishment of atmosphere, the game rushes players in very quickly. The writing is trying to be thematic but it still has a very undeveloped tone. Not much character depth, like there's some tone and personality to the character dialogue but it feels superficial. Minimal establishment of the world and why you're here doing what you're doing. Why is the butler even helping you. Absolutely nothing is established.\n\nThe combat is extremely weak. Basically, move in circles to avoid orange balls while aiming your flashlight at the enemy to drain its health to death. There's no actual physical interaction or any form of interaction with enemies, you just aim the light at them to drain their health. Extremely unengaging and unsatisfying, it's barely passable as a combat system when all you do is hold a hitbox in the direction of an enemy so their health ticks down. You don't shoot or swing or smash or anything, literally all you do is look in the direction of the enemy until they die. It's really difficult to even tell what you're taking damage to most of the time, area effects that aren't telegraphed or visibly obvious are the main danger.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is also very weak. If this game was much, much darker in terms of lighting it would look so much better as an old mansion. The bedsheet ghosts that spit orange balls, the hooded ghosts with grabby hands, imps and lady hooded ghosts look terrible. Goofy Halloween props, they don't actually look like ghosts at all and the noises they make are equally silly. But it's not silly in a way that is appealing, it's just silly as in not immersive or thematically consistent. Really confusing how the upgrade area the fountain leads to is literally the front of the house but its some kind of alternate dimension that isn't the front of the house. Even something so simple as the fact that players collect crystals as upgrade materials. Generic unexplained crystals that you find as drops or growing on scenery are just not a very thematic or fitting element to have in an old mansion.\n\nThe actual house itself looks nice yet at the same time is very visually chaotic with all the different patterns and whatever, not much consistency with the interior decorating. The red banners and carpets don't fit the theme of the spooky haunted house, rich crimson is just such an aggressive active colour for what's meant to be a decrepit ghostly place.\n\nIt certainly feels like the idea of this game and the very very basic foundation of it has the potential to be something cool. But even ignoring the developers shaky history; the shallow combat, lack of exposition or worldbuilding, awkwardly silly enemies and visual inconsistencies in the environment, passable but still uninspiring dialogue. There's just so much here that is just misguided and not on point for a rogue-lite or for a pseudo-macabre haunted mansion styled world, I don't have the confidence that the developer could overhaul all of this. If they got this far with the game in its current state, then it means they aren't looking to really change what's already here and instead are just planning to add more of this type of content to the game.\n\nOnly had to play one floor to encounter repeated rooms, charging twenty dollars from this out of the gate is yet again very misguided and generally discouraging. I don't have enough confidence with the idea of this game being overhauled to trust the developer with twenty dollars I could spend on anything else.","timestamp_created":1575598739,"timestamp_updated":1608679837,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550100088119506836","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1576632293,"developer_response":"Hey thanks for the feedback!
