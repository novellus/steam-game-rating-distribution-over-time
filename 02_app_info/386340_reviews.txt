AMAZING.\n\nI can see a BIG future here, so much talent but this game needs to be polished. Some enemies are very hard and resistant, the menus and interfaces are not very well designed. You lose all your weapons after dying. So in short words, the gameplay and the user experience must be more friendly and understable, the game is like a pretty gem but at the same time itÂ´s a bit confusing. Iam sure that the developers will fix all of this experience way in next updates.\n\n","timestamp_created":1608544533,"timestamp_updated":1608544533,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4oLeuwvYCdYr0uwI="}
