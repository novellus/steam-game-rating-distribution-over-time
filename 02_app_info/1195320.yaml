    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">About</h2>Mokoko was inspired from the arcade\
      \ games like Volfied, Qix and Gals Panic. A popular gaming style in the late\
      \ 1980\u2019s, Mokoko looks to resurrect the soul of the arcade genre while\
      \ adding a modern touch. There are 24 levels in Mokoko; each level has its own\
      \ unique boss and minions. The main goal is assisting the girls that need help\
      \ from the weird bosses. This is sometimes passing a mobile game level, sometimes\
      \ helping out with the insects in the kitchen.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>You\
      \ need to conquer a big portion of the initial area that you start the level.\
      \ While you are in your own area, you are safe from the enemies until your shield\
      \ empties. You conquer new areas by drawing out of your area. Drawing, however,\
      \ deactivates your shield and exposes you to danger. Your shield decreases constantly.\
      \ If you do not conquer at a certain frequency, your shield will burn out and\
      \ you will not be safe on your own areas as well.<br>There are 3 difficulties\
      \ in the game. The difficulty affects enemies, your shield, and required conquered\
      \ area percentage for the victory.<br><br><strong>What happens when you pass\
      \ a level?</strong><br>You see the related girl's photo and can continue with\
      \ her story or unlock the next girl.<br><br><strong>How many girls and bosses?</strong><br>8\
      \ girls, 24 bosses, 24 minions, 4 traps, 4 power-ups, and 2 towers! Evil towers\
      \ of course. Each boss and his minions were uniquely designed. They all have\
      \ different attack types and behaviors, which consist of rich content.<h2 class=\"\

    review: Really nice game in which You have to select and take over areas. I'd
      say that the genre is very simple (I even forgot that this kind of games existed
      as I played games like this around 10 years ago) but in this game every level
      feels unique. There's story mode with 3 stages for each girl and if You want
      it You can install optional free patch that adds nudity. There's also arcade
      mode with global scoreboard which is kinda mid-level difficulty to get top score
      in because of the score multipliers being bigger with difficulty increased.
      I've got 4th place playing every level on hard but I kept dying on one level
      so I gave up. The art style is nice and gameplay is satisfying as long as You
      don't grind arcade mode for top scores and keep dying in the same level. Difficulty
      changes include changes to player/enemy movement speed, negative bonuses from
      boxes and scores multipliers (x1, x2, x4). If You're aiming for good score the
      game can be really hard with each level unique mobs movement and attack patterns.
      Here's an example of one of the unique bosses [spoiler] in one level there's
      a guy yelling to his father to stop downloading while he's playing and the game
      keeps freezing every few seconds saying "waiting for other players" [/spoiler]
      Girls and bosses have voice acting which is really nice. Overall I recommend
      buying it on a sale as the story mode is 1-2 hours and not everyone's gonna
      grind arcade mode for score. I think I spent too much time doing it as I kept
      dying many times which resulted in 8 hours of total gameplay until I finally
      decided to just play it on easy to get the achievements and finish the game.
