The decisions you make for how to complete quests will almost always have a sort of butterfly effect on the rest of the game, and creates a sort of puzzle for deciding which quests to complete in which ways. I didn't play a lot of old CRPGs back in the day, but I imagine if you're looking for one of those that this game would give you a lot of warm fuzzy nostalgia. Even without said nostalgia, I still found myself really fond of the characters and world by the end of the game. Given my habit of bouncing from game to game and not finishing many, I think the fact that I spent the time to see this adventure through to the end is the biggest compliment I can give this style of game. Gave me Chrono Trigger vibes at times.","timestamp_created":1608502576,"timestamp_updated":1608502576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuLCOwfYCf/vnuwI="}
