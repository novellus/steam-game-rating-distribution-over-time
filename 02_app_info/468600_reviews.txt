Content's decent. I like it.\n\n1. Soundtrack sounds nice. I found War Step, the Remastered title theme, to be particularly catchy.\n\n2. The poster-sized image of the Complex really gives an idea of how huge it is.\n\n3. Wallpapers. 4 of them, (Walker Bay, Restoration Logo, Shadow Complex Title, and wallpaper-sized images of the Complex) each in 4 resolutions. (1024x768, 1600x900, 1600x1200, and 1920x1080) Okay.\n\n4. Character Bios. The cover could stand to be less blurry. Be forewarned that the bios spoil parts of the game's (light) plot, and thus I recommend giving it a read AFTER playing the game.\n\n5. Script. Now we're talking! Despite mostly being the dialogue script for the game, it is interesting because certain scenes actually play out differently. There are at least two scenes here that are simply not present ingame, and a character being shot to death ingame may actually have been meant to die via something more ironic in the script.\n\n\n8.9/10","timestamp_created":1486359721,"timestamp_updated":1486359721,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.741128623485565186","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wq78iNoCcaG3cQ=="}
