Love the addicting mechanics. Soundtrack is awesome, sounds are perfectly fitting and very pleasant (alien voices are very funny!). Graphics may look simple but is functional, the scene is readable and full of eye candies here and there.\nGive it a chance, this game give his best when played.","timestamp_created":1434603510,"timestamp_updated":1434603510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56204378604888916","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj4vCgs4CesjzPg=="}
