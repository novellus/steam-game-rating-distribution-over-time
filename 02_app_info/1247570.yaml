    short_description: It all starts with a meteor crash, where an unknown alien substance
      starts spreading, thriving in a thick fog. Humanity sends in countless explorers,
      but none return. You, of course, are one of them. Repair a defunct radio tower,
      establish connection with the outside world and survive.
