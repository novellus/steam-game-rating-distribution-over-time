That's how strongly I feel about this hatemongering dev. It cost me Â£2.89 and it was worth every penny. This verbally abusive developer cannot revoke this key as it is a Steam purchase. \n\nUltio.\n[/b]","timestamp_created":1586656255,"timestamp_updated":1586663269,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":50,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.82642066478729248","comment_count":24,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qISgtvECfaKLgAI="}
