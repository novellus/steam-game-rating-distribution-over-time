      \ /><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2></strong>The year is 1693:\
      \ War engulfs Europe as France, led by the illustrious Louis XIV, battles the\
      \ Grand Alliance. Also called the Sun King for his luxurious tastes and extravagant\
      \ appearances, he is driven by the belief that the sun \u2013 his sun \u2013\
      \ should shine upon all peoples of the world. His enemies are as numerous as\
      \ the stars but it is the moon that reigns the <br>night. Poisoned and left\
      \ for dead, Louis\u2019s bastard son emerges from the smoke and ashes of Germany\u2019\
      s battlefields under the guise of the Moon King. With hatred festering in his\
      \ heart, he has employed the aid of diabolical and forbidden sciences to build\
      \ an army the likes of which the world had not seen since the days of Lucifer\u2019\
      s rebellion. <br>Now the dead rise from their mass graves, seeking vengeance\
      \ upon the king that demanded their deaths while he basked in glory. Can you,\
      \ the Sun King\u2019s bravest musketeer, stop the approaching eclipse before\
      \ it swallows the sun? <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1253520/extras/Steam_108.gif?t=1603112118\"\
      \ /><br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Rules</h2></strong>Timing your actions\
      \ is critical to success in this game, as a correctly timed jump or attack can\
      \ be the difference between glorious victory and shameful defeat. Furthermore,\
      \ studying and understanding your enemies will be of utter importance. Only\
      \ by getting to know your demons can you hope to find their weaknesses \u2013\
      \ and exploit them. For instance, many foes can hurt not just you but also each\
      \ other. Goading them into slaughtering their own is often vital to success.<br>Lastly,\
      \ a word of warning: The Moon King's army is not composed of conventional soldiers.\
      \ These are the living dead, and simply killing them once is not enough to guarantee\
      \ their surrender. There is only one antidote against the cancer of undeath:\
      \ gunpowder and shot. Landing the killing blow with your musket will tear apart\
      \ the body and make further resurrection impossible. Keep in mind that you can\
      \ also shoot corpses before they revive.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1253520/extras/Steam_109.gif?t=1603112118\"\

      \ game began in January, 2018. The feature we worked the longest on is the musket.\
      \ There was hardly a precedent from other games for a similar mechanic, so we\
      \ could not simply take an existing mechanic and put our own spin on it. Instead\
      \ it was necessary to dive into and really understand the 17th century in order\
      \ to transform the historical rules of early gunpowder weapons into a viable\
      \ gameplay mechanic for a 2D action platformer. We spent a lot of time visiting\
      \ museums and poring over books in order to make the game as authentic as we\
      \ could. After we had a foundation that is accurate, we set free our creativity\
      \ and created a typical &quot;Andrade Game&quot; that is always an interplay\
      \ between history and morbid phantasy. <br><br><strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
