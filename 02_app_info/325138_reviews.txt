There is a fix for this, but you have to edit the file by yourself. Instructions here\nhttp://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?showtopic=81095\n\n\n2-Whenever you swtich to map or meteo settings window, when you return to the game the plane bounces just like you are in the middle of a tornado, and the longer you are in those windows, the worse it is. This can cause you to crash or overstress the plane, it is explained in the same link that I posted before. But on the other hand this issue adds ore realism as you have to avoid checking the map, so it is bad but not that much\n\n\nEven with these issues I have to recommend it as it is a lot of fun, and it includes the float version and the bush pack for no additional charge\n","timestamp_created":1436806480,"timestamp_updated":1436806480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.631253898143768311","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiOCVxM4CdbD7QA=="}
