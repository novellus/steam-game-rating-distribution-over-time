      /><br><br>Summer Islands is a holiday real time strategy business simulator.
      Be the right businessman, build your holiday paradise and grab the money from
      your tourists. Get rich and expand your paradise. Play alone, with your friends
      and against enemies and survive natural disasters without going insolvent.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Find your island</h2>Create almost infinite numbers of maps with
      different seeds. One island, several or the Summer Islands mode. From small
      100x100 maps up to 2000x2000 maps. From high mountains or just sand islands.
      Everybody finds his small island in the wide ocean or in the big archipelagos.<br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Build your paradise</h2>Build cabins, villas or expensive
      hotels directly on the beach or in the mountains. When a building is finished,
      tourists can come by boat or plane. The tourists want to be preserved. Build
      bars, discos, golf courses, supermarkets and many other buildings that are popular
      with tourists and will make you rich as the owner.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/731650/extras/buildings.gif?t=1609520422"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Manage your finances, buildings and consultants </h2>Borrow
      money or pay off your debts. Go out and advertise, or take out insurance. Check
      if your buildings are doing well and you can raise the rent. Hire consultants
      to protect you from sabotage, for example. Or would you rather unlock more sabotage?
      That is entirely up to you.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/731650/extras/Management.gif?t=1609520422"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Survive natural disasters and defeat your enemies</h2>Unfortunately
      there are also natural disasters that can destroy your buildings. Whether tornado,
      earthquake or meteorite, everything is possible.<br>In quiet times the competition
      comes from your enemy and expands over your land. Maybe there are some sabotage
      possibilities!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/731650/extras/Catas.gif?t=1609520422"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Create your own map and campaign </h2>In the Map Editor
      you can not only create your perfect map. You can also fill it with events.
      Which buildings should be unlocked under which conditions. A match where you
      cannot build roads or there is no minimap? You want natural disasters to occur
      under certain conditions at a certain place? Try it out!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/731650/extras/EditorCatas.gif?t=1609520422"
