    review: 'The game is super fun in co-op!


      It does have alot of bugs here and there at it''s current state, and it''s also
      a bit confusing in the beginning to learn the menus and everything at the central
      hub.


      But the game looks great and is fun to play, especially in co-op. I hope it
      will get alot more polished, get more content and more customization with new
      outfits and skins. Also hope it gets more players to randomly play with because
      biggest issue for me right now is to find people to play with.


      I had a ton of fun so far so i will recommend it, if you can co-op play with
      random people online or with friends.'
