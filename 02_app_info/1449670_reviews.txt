All the ugliness that we can shamefully still relate to today, were definetly present in the time period as presented in this game.  The fact that they are still raising their ugly heads and afflicting millions of people in our society today is not the authors fault.  That being said, if reminders of the historical roots of current modern day racism and hatred bother you, you would do well to skip this one.\n\nFor myself I found the story line to have moments of intense action and interest, and then other moments of long drawn out situations I really wasnt expecting or wanting to read/play through.  There are alot of different genres covered in this story, everything from high adventure ala Indiana Jones, to Private detective / clue finding / case solving (part I least enjoyed) to Romance (i didnt find a good match for me in this one, the only available male character (that wasnt already involved with someone else) was a no no for me.  After he killed a second person right infront of me I had zero interest in helping him in anyway and certainly didnt want to persue any kind of a relationship with him,) To Combat Simulator / Survival.  The whole combat part bothered me alot as for the first part of the game I was always presented with and chose non lethal options that worked for a good portion of the game.  The suddenly after I start being upset about a companion Im with turning around and needlessly killing people, the MC starts killing people too, without ever asking me if I was willing / wanting to do that.  From there on the MC ends up killing dozens and dozens of people, with me having to choose how Im going to go about doing it.  Its all in self defense, for the most part, although there are several times where you can choose to kill because you want to, sometimes the MC would just turn around and kill some one all on their own.  It left me feeling very unhappy.  I had a real hard time trying to juxtapose a story line where the ugliness of one group of people towards other groups was a running theme, at the same time I was being asked to handle situations where I was responding to violence, with extreme violence / killing of my own.\nAll in All I think if your not triggered by historically accurate depictions of racism, and If you dont have any qualms with killing lots and lots of people in a fictional narrative, you will find a long and varied story line to read though.  If you do find either of those things disturbing though, your going to want to find something else to read.","timestamp_created":1610119504,"timestamp_updated":1610119504,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.601945459842681885","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiLym8fYCdI3IwQI="}
