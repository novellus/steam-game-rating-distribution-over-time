If you can sell your game if it contains this music.)\nFrom what I understand, this does come with Commercial Rights to the music for Visual Novel Maker and other RPG Maker engines from this company!\n\nI'm creating an action-horror visual novel, and I can safely say this music is tight as HECK. Really neat tracks! Some are just cliche enough to be familiar, some are crazy and strange, but they're all perfect for a horror setting! The fact that I got commercial rights to the music is also so amazing, as it gives me the freedom to sell my game if I so pleased.\nPersonally, I highly recommend this music pack.","timestamp_created":1549687157,"timestamp_updated":1549687157,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.61559140682220459","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kK6j6OgCdryyugE="}
