    review: Magnificent deck! Full of tons of anime references, this brings the power
      level of the game to a whole new high, with instant kill weapons like the death
      note and trump cards like Goku (whose power is so high that if he clashed with
      an equal opponent it would wipe out entire universes). This expansion also includes
      locations and scenarios! definitely recommend.
