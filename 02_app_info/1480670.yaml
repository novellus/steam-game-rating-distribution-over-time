    review: '[h1]NOT like the "Sonic DLC"...[/h1]

      Here a fair warning! The Tails DLC here [b]is not like the Sonic DLC[/b]. Something
      i called a "Starter DLC" is not the case here. [b]The Tails DLC is more for
      people which enjoy PSO2 already for longer since most of its stuff is more for
      "later" in the game[/b].


      [h1]So whats in it?[/h1]

      Like last time, let me clear up and count up whats inside and for what you use/need
      it - at least for the most part:


      [h1]FASHION![/h1]

      Tails Suit M

      Tails Suit F

      Tails Hair 1 x2

      Tails Hair 2 x2

      Emotes 726: Sonic/Tails 2

      * Tails Wrench

      * Sonic Ring

      Tails Mask B x2

      Ragol Memory x5

      Salon Free Pass


      Basicly A full Tails set for female and male, a gesture, some weapon skins and
      youre again able to get some of the PSO1 stuff with the Ragol Memories. This
      sure can still be "useful" if you want this pack just because of this but than,
      i dont really think its worth it if you REALLY want it "Just" for this fashion
      part tbh. Still, its nice to have of course. You also get a Free Salon pass
      which means you can change sizes and body stuff in the salon with said pass.


      [h1]PREMIUM AND GOLD PASS![/h1]

      Premium Set (30 Days)

      Mission Pass Gold Ticket


      Like the Sonic pack, it gives you a full month of premium with this DLC and
      a Gold Pass. If you wanna read more details about premium and/or the gold ticket
      (for what it is), best read my review about the sonic dlc here:

      https://steamcommunity.com/id/watheanum/recommended/1327341/


      [h1]BOOSTERS![/h1]

      EXP Earned +150% x15

      Triboost +125% x10


      Exp boosters and Triboosters which makes it easier for you to grain more exp,
      rare drops and money. Always useful to have of course.


      [h1]AFFIXING AUGMENTS, LEVELING UP WEAPONS AND GETTING SKILLTREES![/h1]

      Lambda Grinder x100

      Augment Transfer Pass x30

      Skill Tree Addition Pass x5


      This is something you sure need if you invest time into the game. Getting better
      weapons and level them up plus getting good augments viva affixing them.

      For everyone who plays PSO2 now longer will understand, by now, why i said this
      DLC is more for the people which play it longer at this point. Lambda Grinders
      are, unlike normal Grinders, more for weapons and stuff which have a higher
      rarety - and getting 100 of them is something you really need. Augment transfer
      passes help you to put the augments you want from other, maybe not so useful
      weapons and units to the ones you actually use - and THOSE passes are also pretty
      rare to get.

      As for the Skill Tree Addition Passes, IF im right about those, those enable
      for you more skilltrees for the other classes you level (and dont level). That
      means if you maybe use one class but wanna have different "builds" (maybe like
      one skilltree for using it as Mainclass and another Tree as for a Subclass build),
      this passes give you the opinion to do so.


      [h1]Do i recommend it?[/h1]

      I do recommend it [b]IF you already enjoy PSO2 for a longer time and have already
      "good gear".[/b] If youre NEW to PSO2, i would not recommend it for you to buy
      it "just for the fashion stuff". A lot of the stuff you get with this DLC is
      more useful in the later game and higher levels.


      So again, [b]I recommend it IF you already enjoy PSO2 a bit longer. The stuff
      in it sure is helpful in the later game.[/b] I would not recommend it to buy
      it if youre new to the game or just for the fashion stuff. Worth the pricetag
      for sure.'
