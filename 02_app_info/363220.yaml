    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>about</strong></h2>Ghost in the Machine
      is about the player's escape from a run-down factory following a large explosion.
      In the dark factory there are many dangerous machines that must be minded in
      order to not be crushed or mechanically separated. Inspired by 1980s platformer-genre
      games, Ghost in the Machine features true low-res graphics and an original chiptune
      soundtrack. It is also difficult, yet rewarding.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>gameplay</strong></h2>The
      game is simple - you can walk left and right, and jump. Only one button! Avoid
      the traps, don't get wrecked, get to the end. The challenging levels are filled
      with puzzles and tricky hazards. Each level also has a secret collectible item
      that will reveal a shred of information about how the player got stuck in the
      factory in the first place, as well as unlock a secret or two. A level editor
      is built in to the game so you can create levels to share with your friends.
      <br><br>The controls are tight, giving the player direct movement control at
      all times. Jumps are precise, important for situations where timing is essential.
      Both keyboard and USB game pads are supported, and the game only needs a single
      button. The game is easy to learn (even for a child), but challenging to master
      (even for an adult). Levels are played in a semi-linear fashion so players won't
      get stuck on just one level that they haven't figured out yet.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>graphics
      and Sound</strong></h2>Inspired by Game Boy and MSX games, the graphics are
      authentically restricted, using only four shades at a time. A circular mask
      is at the edge of the screen, restricting the player's view to contribute to
      the dark atmosphere. The sound effects and music were all made with a Nintendo
      Famicom and Game Boy, so they are as real as it gets. The game engine was written
      from the ground up. <br><br>The development of this game was backed by a successful
      Kickstarter campaign, and we are excited to see it finally ready for release.
      Lots of time was spent tweaking and expanding the game to be sure we are releasing
      a high quality title that will provide plenty of play time. We look forward
      to further expansion of the game through new free level downloads.

    review: 'This game is sadistic. Like, if that old "Super Mario Frustration" ROM
      hack and Dark Souls had a baby on the Virtual Boy, it would be this. The game
      was originally made for a contest in which the theme was "unforseen consequences,"
      hence the recurring theme in the story and the tunnel vision. Controls are crisp,
      music is awesome, aesthetic is amazing, but only buy this game if you have a
      CRT that can withstand your fist. LCDs are out of the question, you''ll break
      one on the third level. Do not use with a CRT that cannot withstand your fist;
      you will be horribly mamed by flying shards of glass.


      Anyway, ever get stuck on a level of a game like Donkey Kong Land and just have
      fits of rage after dying on the same level for months? This game summons the
      same amount of rage, but unlike DKL, it''s not because of janky controls, confusing
      graphics, that horrible GameBoy screen, or a sadistic saving system. It''s because
      each level requires a whole lot of trial, error, death, and inhuman precision.
      It''s simultaneously beautiful and horrifying.'
