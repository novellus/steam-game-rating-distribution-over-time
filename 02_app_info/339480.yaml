      >Key Features</h2>\u2022\t<strong>Introducing the Butcher</strong> \u2013 Brought\
      \ to life by Mila Furlan, The Butcher's business is weapons - their procurement,\
      \ sale and distribution. With Gage on an &quot;extended vacation&quot;, she\
      \ is looking forward to a long and fruitful business relationship with Bain\
      \ and the PAYDAY gang.<br><br>\u2022\t<strong>Two all-new heists</strong> \u2013\
      \ This heist will be a little different. Instead of money, this time we will\
      \ be snatching something a little more more explosive, if you'll pardon the\
      \ pun. The Butcher has tasked us to steal a thermobaric bomb that is being sent\
      \ to Norfolk to be decommissioned. And unlike our previous heists, we can approach\
      \ this job in two very different ways - in two very different heists. <br><br>\u2022\
      \t<strong>The Dockyard Heist</strong> \u2013 If we choose to intercept, bear\
      \ in mind that the port authority is taking the utmost precautions in ensuring\
      \ that the transfer proceeds smoothly. The courteous people at Gensec are expected\
      \ to attend as well. So the smart thing would be to avoid detection, and try\
      \ to steal the bomb from under their noses. If that fails, you can always brute-force\
      \ your way to into the ship, just be prepared deal with the best or worst Gensec's\
      \ security has to offer. I will be frank with you, bot approaches won`t be a\
      \ walk in the park but let`s just say that if you actually manage to succeed\
      \ to complete this heist without alerting anyone that you will be in The Butcher's\
      \ good graces. <br><br>\u2022\t<strong>The Forest Heist</strong> \u2013 The\
      \ other plan is to throw caution to the wind, and derail the train as it is\
      \ transporting the bomb. The wagon housing the bomb is well equipped to handle\
      \ violent shocks, so don't worry about the bomb detonating prematurely. Worry\
      \ about the accompanying police force that will try to repossess the bomb once\
      \ they learn that we are trying to steal it. We will have a small time-advantage\
      \ because unlike them, we will be prepared. Your task will be to find the wagon\
      \ housing the bomb, open the wagon, dismantle the bomb, and finally - secure\
      \ an exit point. You will have to decide which exit point you want during during\
      \ pre-planning. <br><br>\u2022\t<strong>A new secondary pistol</strong> \u2013\
      \ The Leo pistol is a semi-automatic pistol that is polymer-framed and striker-fired.\
      \ It is used by both the Croatian military and law enforcement. So you can consider\
      \ using a police pistol to break the law as a form of bizarre poetic justice.\
      \ At the very least, if the cops find any shells laying on the ground after\
      \ a heist they will first be on the lookout for a renegade Croatian cop, so\
      \ you can rest a little easier.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/339480/extras/pd2_bombheist_Banner_masks.jpg?t=1516116044\"\

    review: "[h1]CONS.[/h1]\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n- Alright,\
      \ alright... As a small developer, OK and LL have to make their money somehow.\
      \ But with the growing popularity of the game, charging 7 USD (10 dollars for\
      \ me in Australia, due to tax) for 2 somewhat short heists is a little bit...\
      \ overkill. If they had just included the Dragan character pack in the DLC,\
      \ that wouldve been okay. From a business pov, well done OK, but as a consumer,\
      \ this is a little bit of a rip.\n\n-THE FOREST HEIST is lazy.\nThe forest heists\
      \ sounds like a cool idea, massive explosions, derailing a train, grabbing the\
      \ bomb tactically and bailing back to your escape tug boat... but the reality\
      \ is... this heist is lazy as hell.\nWhy? Well this is the 10-15 minute heist\
      \ in order of objectives.\n\n1. Find a train car with the bomb (which is really\
      \ that hard, as there is only a few objectives to push F on)\n\n2. Place thermite\
      \ and wait.\n\n2. Wait for helicopter ( or connect hose instantly)\n\n3. Connect\
      \ tube and wait.\n\n4. Wait.\n\n5. Wait.\n\n6. Escape.\n\nIts just lazy and\
      \ boring, there's no cool features like the Big Bank. It's just press F, shoot\
      \ and wait. You don't even derail the train yourself, this was obviously a rushed\
      \ heist compared to the Docks.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\
      \n[h1]PROS.[/h1]\n\n-Masks look awesome! (and they are actually fairly hard\
      \ to get)\n-High difficulty achievements, that will require friends.\n\n-The\
      \ Dockyard Heist STEALTH is a new stealth revolution.\nIf your into stealth,\
      \ the Dockyards heist is a good place to practice while getting a good reward\
      \ upon completion. Due to the size and space of the map, it is relatively easy\
      \ to run past guards, but... the size also means there is a lot of stealth travelling\
      \ to objectives. \n\n-DockYards is FUN.\nThe size, the complexity, and the reward\
      \ make the Dockyards heist a playground for heisters. Stealth or Loud, there\
      \ is a range of different objectives, which makes the forest heist somewhat\
      \ lazy (again!).\n\n-Pistol performs just as well as it looks.\nEnough said.\
      \ haha\n\n----------------------------\n\n[h1]Overall, the bomb heist feels\
      \ like a cash grab, but some of the new additions make it worthwhile, especially\
      \ the dockyards. As always, happy heisting and have fun getting those achievements...[/h1]"
