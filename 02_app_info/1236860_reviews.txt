Neither the characters nor the plot engaged me.\n\nNot recommended.","timestamp_created":1609614627,"timestamp_updated":1609614627,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533333301544189453","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i8Kg4vYCepPpvwI="}
