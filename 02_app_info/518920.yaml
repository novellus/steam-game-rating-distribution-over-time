    review: "[b]Disclaimer: I played this game on a WMR (Windows Mixed Reality) Headset,\
      \ which is not listed on this page. My criticism will not entirely reflect the\
      \ experience on other Headsets.[/b]\n\nSo this game was eh, quite something.\
      \ Let's start off with the issues that a lot of players seem to have (probably\
      \ only on WMR):\nThe game is entirely black when you first boot it up in your\
      \ headset, but the window on your monitor works. In order to get the game visible\
      \ on your headset, you need to hold up your headset and open the settings in-game,\
      \ and toggle the motion blur setting. After doing this, your game will be visible\
      \ in your headset. Further, if you pause at any moment, you will have to navigate\
      \ the pause menu by taking off the headset and once again doing the same as\
      \ with the settings.\n\nFor the technical difficulties, which I think everyone\
      \ will have (but im not sure about):\nThe glitchyness. All Operations are pretty\
      \ easily doable, except the brain surgery. To obtain a A++ score, you need stay\
      \ above a certain amount of blood loss. Well, after you have successfully removed\
      \ the skull and just \"grabbed\" the brain to get it into a removable state,\
      \ one of two things will happen:\n1. The brain and \"the string\" that you have\
      \ to sever glitches around so much, that its almost impossible to cut it. Only\
      \ after trying about 11-12 times, I was able to get a lucky hit.\n2. The brain\
      \ isn't glitching out. Good in that regard, but a bad sign since this means\
      \ that somehow \"the string\" despawned or got severed while you were removing\
      \ the skull, meaning that you have to restart the surgery as there is no way\
      \ to sever the brain anymore.\n\nStory- and gameplay-wise it's certainly just\
      \ like surgeon simulator, even if a whole lot easier and shoter (except for\
      \ the bugged brain surgery). I was able to complete the whole game with A++\
      \ ratings on all surgeries in about 50 minutes, and even had some time to still\
      \ mess around with some tiny eastereggs. Spoiler about the last surgery: [spoiler]\
      \ The last surgery on the alien is hard to finish, not because of glitchyness\
      \ or anything but much rather because it's unclear what you need to do. The\
      \ voice prompts are way too quiet even at the loudest setting, which made me\
      \ just throw literally everything at the alien till it worked.[/spoiler]\n\n\
      Overall I think that the game is pretty fun, but currently with its price tag\
      \ of 19,99\u20AC a bit too high for what it delivers. If this game is on sale\
      \ and you feel like having a bit of random fun, I can recommend it. But due\
      \ to a lack of replayability and a fair bit of laggy-ness and confusion caused\
      \ by the game, I must say that I can't recommend it for now. Maybe if there\
      \ is more content added in the future, it might be worth the price. [spoiler]\
      \ I think I would very much enjoy the teased North-Korea-Mission.[/spoiler]"
