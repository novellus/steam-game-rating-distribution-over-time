The fact that just two devs made a really clean and fun VR experience is impressive. Ive really enjoyed my time in Star Shelter. The intro was pretty breath taking, and was not expecting to need another set of pants for it either.\nThere are tons of bugs tbh. Could be memory dump issues... not sure.\nBut still worth every penny.\nCant wait for Star Shelter 2!","timestamp_created":1609834996,"timestamp_updated":1609835116,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3s7p6PYCdMvRwAI="}
