Each mission is fairly short, not more than an hour, often less.  Capturing a planet gives you a random event, but so does recapturing it, making battling for a location more worth it.   Battles are real time, more interesting than strict turn based but not overly stressful.  Since each fleet has a different captain, the different unit type and captain gives it an advance wars feel as well.  Campaign has unlocks and mild 'choose your own adventure' elements, and each race you can play have a different playstyle.   \n\nTLDR: Four X gameplay, in enjoyable bite size chunks.  Similar to other decent games in a familiar, enjoyable way.","timestamp_created":1609909809,"timestamp_updated":1609909809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49sWG6/YCceL0wAI="}
