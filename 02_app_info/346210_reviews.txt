The characters are fun / funny. The levels are interesting and really require strategy. I would say that the weapons are well balanced, great selection and the enemies are well balanced and thought out as well.\n\nOnly a couple things I wish for. First; another Garden Defense game. More levels and perhaps smaller graphics to allow for longer maps.\n\nAside from these (wants) the game is great. I have played many times making up my own challenges. For example I can not finish all levels with a single weapon (THE CACTUS). This weapon shoots both ground and air targets but is not as strong as those intended for just ground or just air. With careful placement and upgrades (and it's not easy) you can play levels using JUST this weapon.\n","timestamp_created":1587317717,"timestamp_updated":1587317717,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gMfgyfECcKaDggI="}
