    review: 'Not memorable, but a good time waster, and the puzzle bits are actually
      kind of fun once you get the hang of them (and moreso near the ending, when
      things get a bit more complicated). They are more Tetris than Match-3, and a
      few battles were actually quite exciting (and I had to manage my equipment to
      better handle them).


      The biggest annoyance was the world navigating. While it takes only a few seconds
      for the character to walk form A to B, the actual walking is completely pointless,
      and there is lots of walking from A to B. It is even more irritating because
      the game shows you were you have to go by having a sparkling effect walking
      from A to B... So often you have to wait for the "effect" to go, and then immediately
      after you spend the same amount of time "going" there yourself. Maybe I missed
      a key which would skip all this walking?


      Another annoyance: loading times are a lot worse than they should.


      But again, mostly, an enjoyable experience, and actually less grindy (near the
      end) than Puzzle Quest. I would say 78/100.'
