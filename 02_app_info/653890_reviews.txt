I find it hard to give a music resource pack a negative review because not only am I not knowledgable in music in the slightest, but I also think each pack can leave an entirely different impression on you based on how useful the songs in it are at the time of you purchasing it. \n\nMy issue with this particular pack is that I found a lot of the tracks to be somewhat generic sounding, like you can find nearly identical ones for free online. There's two or three songs from this I thought were pretty great and useful but the rest kind of just feel like a speck of dust on an old windowsill.\n\nIn the end, I think it's highly subjective how useful The Music Box: Japanese Horror will be to you, but I can say that it might be a bit too pricey for what you get if you pay full price for it, especially since there are many similar sounding tunes you can find for free online. The same applies to the sound effects and ambient sounds, by the way. I guess the MEs are kinda cool. There are certainly horror music packs for rpg maker I can recommend over this one, but if you already have all the others and you're still looking for more then it's not a bad purchase by any means.","timestamp_created":1577046526,"timestamp_updated":1577046692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwitrTl+8Cd5uY5gE="}
