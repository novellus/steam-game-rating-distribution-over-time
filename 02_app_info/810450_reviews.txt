Well I'm happy that I finally changed my mind.\n\nThe game is great in so many aspects: clever writing, good humor and almost perfectly balanced level of puzzle difficulty, simple but comfy interface, smart hint system and even those graphics started looking so much better when playing.\n\nInstant classic, will be remembered!","timestamp_created":1582666074,"timestamp_updated":1582666074,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+fiPv/ACcu7K9AE="}
