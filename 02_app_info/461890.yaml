    review: "This is not a review but a warning. I usually love that kind of minimalistic\
      \ games even tho they have a ton of flaws, but this one's literally unplayable\
      \ for me. \n\nGame doesn't even have a menu to change the horrid mouse sensitivity.\n\
      \nRefrain from buying this game if you don't like:\n\n-forced mouse acceleration\n\
      -massive headbob\n-clunky movement\n-30-40 FOV range. trying to move inside\
      \ a building with this fov is a good way to puke at your screen. Ive played\
      \ a lot of games with forced low fov like offpeak and norwood suite and you\
      \ get used to it, but this game's fov is atrocious. it's like you're playing\
      \ trough a telescope.\n\nStay away.\n\nFps are around 20-30 with a gtx 1070\
      \ and 4790k at 2k...\n\nedit/ game runs at a locked 20 fps."
