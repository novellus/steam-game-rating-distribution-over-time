    review: Well, It does seem to me, that the developer has abandoned this game,
      so other than the fact that my son wasted his christmas money on this, he can't
      even play it in it's current condition because nothing has been fixed!   How
      can developers fight piracy, when you waste peoples money like this?  Give us
      a reason for abandonment, or an update, or a refund, and I'll change my review
      accordingly.
