I understand that devs don't want to do any extra work on these multi-platform releases, but I'm not really interested in doing the work for them to work-around. Always an instant refund.\n\nA minor gripe was not being able to skip the boss dialogue. You may enjoy this game but absolutely wasn't worth my time.","timestamp_created":1603492249,"timestamp_updated":1603492249,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517412900924682617","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42r/lq/UCf+fZqQI="}
