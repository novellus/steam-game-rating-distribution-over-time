The images and description and gameplay all looked fantastic from what little there was, and the tiny handful of reviews over the course of two years only made it sound better.\n\nCastle Agony is a *very* old-school style adventure game, reminding me of attempts to imitate the Lucasfilm Games on console, with faint touches of Resident Evil and Castlevania thrown in for style points. While the graphics look more like Zelda, the gameplay is pure point-'n'-click using the mouse to interact with the environment and choose your next moves.*\n\nEven though the setting riffs off Resident Evil, the tone leans a bit closer to Maniac Mansion -- fluffy horror, I think, perfect for the post-Halloween mood. Depending on luck, you might have some difficulty early on, but assuming you're thorough and constantly making progress, the game never really hits notable difficulty walls and the ending is a bit of a cakewalk. I might even say it's unbalanced in favor of being too easy on the normal difficulty. The types of items I got in my run -- not sure if it's randomized -- meant I was only able to make a handful of the possible items a hundred times over, and the rest only a couple. This also meant I wiped out the final boss using a nigh-endless barrage of molotovs.\n\nAs the level design takes so many nods from the Resident Evil series, the mansion is full of secret nooks and crannies and lore. There's a lot of love put into this game by its lone, part-time developer, and while it ain't perfect, I'm really happy I stumbled upon it and got the chance to play it. One of those indie gems where the developer immediately joins my list of must-support artists.\n\n* Don't use a traditional controller with this game. Steam controller works well, however.","timestamp_created":1605397987,"timestamp_updated":1605397987,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553429067134857178","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ466fL5PUCdbC2rgI="}
