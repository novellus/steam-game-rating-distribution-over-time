    about_the_game: Embark on a journey about mortality, identity, fanaticism and
      grief. Absorb the Essences of dead warriors from 5 different classes and transform
      into them, switching between their skill sets and game modes, in this soulslike
      action RPG.<br><br>Explore Zieminal, a medieval world risen from technological
      ruins as the Prisoner of a Thousand Faces, a creature trapped between life and
      death. Race against time to face your creators, fanatical cultists in search
      of eternal life, before the powerful Church of Death captures them and executes
      them as heretics.<h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2>Eons ago, Goddess Life had deceived
      her sister, Goddess Death, to steal her powers and create the First Men, a race
      of beings unable to die. Alive for thousands of years, they erected a powerful
      and advanced civilization, with magic-like technology and continent-spanning
      cities.<br><br><br>But Goddess Death would not settle for being deceived, and
      began to slowly seduced these immortal people, overwhelmed by an existence that
      would never come to an end. Eventually, they gave up their immortality, and
      their society collapsed overnight.<br><br>Centuries later, a new civilization
      emerged from the wreckage of the old world and, with it, the desire to deceive
      Death once again. For years, the Essencemancers, a zealot sect of scholars of
      the forbidden knowledge, have tried to perfect a ritual that, with the use of
      the First Men's long-lost technology, would allow for eternal life - but at
      a terrible cost.<br><br>You are the result of these experiments.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><strong>Absorb
      Essences:</strong> Capture the Essences of up to 15 characters from 5 different
      classes, each with their own abilities, game modes, personalities and story.<br><br><strong>Transform:</strong>
      Assemble a team of up to 4 captured Essences and switch between them during
      the game - even during combat. Combine the skills of different characters with
      strategy to overcome obstacles.<br><br><strong>Fight:</strong> Face fierce enemies
      that require more than brute force to be defeated. Skillfully coordinate your
      attacks as you switch between Essences to unleash devastating attacks.<br><br><strong>Live
      the conflict:</strong> Each Essence is a character with a past and point of
      view - many of them antagonistic. Conflicts give bonuses and penalties, and
      take the story in unexpected turns. Know how to exploit the weaknesses and strengths
      of having saints and sinners, victims and executioners under the same skin.<br><br><strong>Live
      the world:</strong> Explore Zieminal, a world that intertwines a technological
      past and a medieval present, home to diverse cultures. Choose your side in the
      conflict between the Church of Death and the Cult to Life - or walk your own
      path.<br><br><strong>Live the story:</strong> Experience a mature narrative
      that addresses serious topics such as religious fanaticism, the finitude of
      life and the horrors of war. See the conflicts of the characters reflected in
      the course of the game.
