My thoughts? A lot of stuff is glossed over with the final 'good' ending. What feels like some simple steps that could have been taken to clean everything up over the course of the game pretty much gets swept under the rug with these Nisse at end game. We find out that one of the primary effects of Elixer is madness but the Nisse seem to completely bypass that side effect out of nowhere, despite being 'human.'\n\nThe game is still full of a bunch of magics the player will never be allowed to touch, besides macguffins like the portal.\n\nFighter based weapons/armor is utter crap compared to 90% of the arcane gear available. The weapons themselves seem to be poorly thought out and/or implemented to the degree that no found or quested weapon will be better than the stuff you can buy in the forts eventually (one exception are the orb shields which leave even the magical tower shield in the dust and another is Fool's Shot), Effects are rarely clear+documented, Time Warp would have been amazing if the guy who would have used it could have benefited from the evasion boost. As it is, there was no point so it was shit. still not sure if it was supposed to have a 20% crit range. Fools shot should have had a chance to confuse EVERYONE on the field, not just my party members, but is otherwise the best bow available despite being 'cursed' so long as your guys have solid metal resistance. \n\nOverall, like it enough that I plan on doing Spidweb the courtesy of paying full price for the second one when it comes out, though I'll be expecting the kinks in the system to have been ironed out (at end game there were WAY too many potions/charms in my pack compared to free slots for carrying loot; there needs to be some kind of stacking available for scrolls and potions of a like nature). That and a place to be easily told when i'm above any bonus limits, as well as how much i'm over.\n\n\n\n\n-------old review below\nThis is getting a recommendation early because spidweb usually delivers good stuff. What i see of it is a little simplistic, but it seems to have that extra touch when it comes to the world map and exploration that was always awesome.\n\nYou can definitely see more of an influence of tactical games on hand.\n\nAbout the only criticism I have so far is with this soldier 'Cacambo' whose fate you can decide. You can decide to send him home, flog him, or put him back in the unit one of two ways. But, I don't get the choice of leveling with him that we're stuck here too. While giving him one of two choices: 1) He goes back to his company and finishes his year of service before he can go home, guaranteed. or 2) He swears personal service to you the MC and can leave when you leave, though you should also be able to get a message and payment through to have his family and lands taken care of in the mean time.","timestamp_created":1608759948,"timestamp_updated":1609735850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgfnu5fYCc+7LvAI="}
