There's no time to take in the scenery or contemplation of &quot;right or wrong.&quot; Quick-thinking and fast-shooting are the only way to survive. It won't be easy, and it sure as hell won't be boring.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/screenrant.com\/colt-canyon-game-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Screen Rant<\/a><br><br>“[...] And most fun of all is when you find a pan. You can repeatedly lob it at enemies for one-hit kills, until, tragically, it breaks. It’s also splendidly gory, blood spattering messily across the screen as bullets fly in all directions.
