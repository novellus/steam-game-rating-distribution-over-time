If you want a good retro horror game or a breath of fresh air from the typical Slender knock-off, this is for you. What sets this apart from many other games is that it is f*cking weird but in a good way. Project Night is full of surreal scenes and imagrey that make it very memorable. My gameplay length was about 4.5 hours which is a very nice length for an indie game. \n\nTHE GOOD:\n- Fantastic atmosphere \n- Good sound design \n- Big enemy selection for a horror game \n- Throwback to Silent Hill \n- Incredibly bizzare \n- Lots of exploration of interesting environments \n- Considering how low the budget is, the game looks pretty nice and PS1-esque \n- Most of the enemies are really scary\n- Chilling and varying environments \n- Lots of tension \n\nTHE BAD: \n- The crawling alien looks hilarious \n\nThat's really about it for things I didn't like in this game...","timestamp_created":1434331043,"timestamp_updated":1434408020,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.41067233681678772","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgq3Y/M0CfrnKPg=="}
