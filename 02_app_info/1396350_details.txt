A boss may have a shield that only goes away with fire, by dispelling it, or just waiting it out a set amount of turns. The unique combo system also provides special boosts that are character-specific and helps to balance those runs where you didn't get the ideal setup that you wanted. This makes each successful playthrough a fulfilling experience, and on runs where you lose, you'll eventually learn why and come back even wiser!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Less RNG, More Strategy<\/h2> Unlike other games, Anamnesis focuses more on strategy than RNG. Even if you didn't get the cards you needed to dispel that boss's shield, your combo system has you covered! Each character will have unique memories and boosts that are suited for them to approach every obstacle in the game. This means that defense as well as offense are both important tactical decisions.
