    about_the_game: "Demo of OmniBus, the most advanced bus simulator known to man.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nOmniBus is next-to-last gen physics game about the most powerful\
      \ bus in the universe that can\u2019t stop or even slow down for reasons incomprehensible\
      \ to the simple human mind. OmniBus must complete missions at the behest of\
      \ citizens as its speed increases to unsafe speeds and without landing on its\
      \ head or sides. OmniBus drivers will choose from the bizarre mission mode,\
      \ thrilling trick mode and versus multiplayer mode for up to four players to\
      \ achieve goals, set high scores, and receive total enlightenment. <br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nDeep Emotional Narrative: Throughout history man has looked to the\
      \ noble bus in times of chaos and turmoil to bring peace, prosperity, and a\
      \ lift to those that it serves during hours of operation. Slay demon buses,\
      \ harvest space corn, and transport astronauts to a wedding as the legend foretold\
      \ to become the one true OmniBus. There\u2019s also a pretty cool level with\
      \ a football field on the top of a skyscraper. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nMultiplayer\
      \ Derby Mode: Jump into the chaotic free-for-all multiplayer versus mode where\
      \ drivers are pitted against each other in a high score trick mode or the visceral\
      \ deathmatch mode sure to raise tensions down at the bus depot. <br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nFree Play Trick Mode: Choose your favorite bus and pull off unbelievable\
      \ jumps, flips and twists to hit incredible high scores and impress friends,\
      \ family, and other OmniBus drivers on the leaderboards. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      Cutting Edge Everything: OmniBus has the best of everything from graphics and\
      \ sound effects to physics and an options menu. This is the future. This is\
      \ OmniBus."
