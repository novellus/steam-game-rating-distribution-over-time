      \ humans to crusade you, the demon king. At this time, you need to rely on the\
      \ demon city\u2019s defense area to resist invaders. When the invaders break\
      \ through to the final throne, you can only go out and fight the invaders to\
      \ the death.<br>2. Abundant skill system: most skills have different attack\
      \ ranges, for example: flame magic attacks a certain range of enemies around\
      \ the specified target, wind attacks a horizontal range of enemies, combos can\
      \ attack a single enemy continuously Many times...and more than 50 skills, allowing\
      \ you to learn different skills according to your interests and abilities.<br>3.\

      \ to get random resource rewards.<br>6. Monster summoning system: To conquer\
      \ the world and lead a rich army of monsters to fight together, will you be\
