The only difference between \"Dear Esther\"'s gameplay and Californium's gameplay are the puzzles which are \"search and click\"-alike.\nThe graphics are simple but the developers used their possibilities nicely to create 4 unique worlds with different looks and different feelings in graphics, music, sounds, story and characters. \nThe characters are plain but not because the devs weren't able to create 3D models but there is a little story twist in it. A story twist which is also hard to understand if you never heard of Philip K. Dİck and his novels (in this case \"Man in the High Castle\"). \nSpeaking of Phil K. Dİck: Many players won't understand many hints and plot parts if they never heard of this author, his stories and his life. Only the last chapter will give some hints and explenations. But many things will keep being a riddle for players who don't know anything about Phil. \nBut nonetheless this game got a unique atmosphere and is also a nice play for any players who aren't interested so much in reading 60's sci-fi stories by californian novel authors but in dystopian scifi in general :)","timestamp_created":1609777698,"timestamp_updated":1609778410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoaaR5/YCeua3wAI="}
