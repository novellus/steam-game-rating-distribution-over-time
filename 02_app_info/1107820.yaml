    review: "I'm very disappointed.....\n\nOne of my best childhood memories involves\
      \ my parents and videogames: we went to the beach for a walk, when we saw an\
      \ arcade (yeah, it was that time when arcade were still around). My mom asked\
      \ me if I wanted to play, so we entered the place. My father was never interested\
      \ in games, but wanted to see me happy. My mother instead is a gamer, she likes\
      \ point and click games and puzzles. \n\nI immediately noticed Three Wonders,\
      \ a 3-in-1 arcade game that maybe not many of you know. Basically you insert\
      \ the coin and you can choose between a platformer, an horizontal shootemup\
      \ and an action puzzle, all great full-fledges games. The puzzle game was called\
      \ Don't Pull. \n\nI was already familiar with the game, so we entered and I\
      \ played while they were watching me. I was so pumped up I beat the game while\
      \ they were encouraging me. This still is a vivid memory for me and I keep that\
      \ dear to my heart.\n\nSO.... \n\nWhen I found a game on Steam that wanted to\
      \ emulate the same feel of DP (at the point of being a carbon copy of that concept)\
      \ I was immediately interested, so I waited for a price drop not being sure\
      \ if this game could have been a spiritual successor or a failure. Well, it's\
      \ not a failure as a game, but as a successor to Don't Pull surely is. \n\n\
      BELIEVE ME, SEARCH FOR THREE WONDERS, PLAY IT IN SOME WAY, and you'll see what\
      \ I mean.\n\nPush and Pully lacks everything that made Don't Pull great: good\
      \ control movements, fast gameplay, interesting design of levels, interesting\
      \ enemies and patterns, collectibles, secrets, humor.\n\nMoving is frustrating,\
      \ the player is slow, and the time the character moves from a square to another,\
      \ your hitbox still remains in the starting square, and this is a beginner's\
      \ error that I also made on my first game as designer.\n\nEnemies are boring,\
      \ some of them have unfair movements and infuriating moves, like the ones that\
      \ jump on casual points of the already small and full of obstacles maps. Or\
      \ the ones that fires fast and hard to see projectiles. Add to this that the\
      \ character has the most slow walk and weird hitbox... very frustrating! Not\
      \ hard, just frustrating.\n\nSometimes you will feel that enemies and blocks\
      \ were placed on the maps casually in number and placement, and this shows when\
      \ you die many times in the first seconds of the latter levels. I really miss\
      \ planning strategies and trying to speedrun Don't Pull. The flow of that game\
      \ is just... superior!\n\nAlso, bosses... not much to say for every one of them\
      \ but the last one: while they are a cute addition and a way to break the monotony,\
      \ they are extremely easy and monotonous. The last one instead is the worst\
      \ final boss I've seen in years. He will occupy a large part of the screen,\
      \ while firing projectile with questionable hitboxes and, on the second phase,\
      \ it will split in three. Imagine doing all of this on a timer! You'll die because\
      \ there weren't alternative, a lot. I like hard games, but not unfair. I don't\
      \ want to beat the game now.\n\nBlocks mechanic is interesting but nothing special,\
      \ you can just end the level by pushing blocks at random at enemies ignoring\
      \ combination of bloks. The star rating is not clear, I think using the blocks\
      \ combination is important for the score; however, I lost interest in wasting\
      \ time to get 3 star on levels by using clever combinations. Also, maybe it's\
      \ me, but didn't work majority of time to get me 3 stars. \n\n\nPros:\n+Pixel\
      \ art and animations are cute and colorful\n+Nice enemies variety\n+Bosses\n\
      +\"Puzzle only\" levels are an interesting addition\n+Cute story\n\nCons:\n\
      -Clunky and slow controls\n-Confusionary or absent level design\n-Infuriating\
      \ enemies \n-Last boss is the worse last boss I played in years.\n\nReview based\
      \ on single player mode, but after all I enjoyed play Don't Pull alone majority\
      \ of time. How could a game from 1991 be better than a one from this year???"
