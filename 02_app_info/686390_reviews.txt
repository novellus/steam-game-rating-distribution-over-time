Recommend just flat out removing the DLC or not buying it at all. Blood Bowl is supposed to be quirky teams with differences not this team gets almost all rolls in their favor. 1/6 of dice rolls only work against them on offense. In a game of six siders this is literally stacking the deck. I recommend cutting this DLC out of Blood Bowl if you like the spirit of the board game.","timestamp_created":1602645882,"timestamp_updated":1602645882,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.378151267766952515","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwye7IkvUCfZLgpwI="}
