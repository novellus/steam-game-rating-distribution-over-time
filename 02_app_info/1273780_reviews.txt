I always judge looping hallways harder than I do other tropes because lots of people do them. I liked this one. It felt pretentious in the beginning, but the longer I stayed, the more it grew on me. The ending was a nice cherry on top and it had me sashaying away feeling satiated. Well done. :)\n\nThe second game wasn't too scary. It was more...unsettling. The kind of beast that pries open your jaws and gets deep inside. I won't say too much because I don't want to spoil the story, but I didn't really care for the combat at the end. It was a little janky-- I managed to get through after 3 tries. \n\nThe third game I gave up on because I had to sift through a gajillion frequencies on a radio and I got bored with it pretty quickly because the stuff I managed to pick up wasn't scary. This is probably a personal preference thing. :P\n\nThe Peekaboo Collection is fairly priced at $2.99. Give it a whirl if you're a fan of creepypasta or artsy indie projects. :)","timestamp_created":1606225001,"timestamp_updated":1606225001,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.584775090217590332","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oo+e/fUCddiesAI="}
