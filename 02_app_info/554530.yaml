    review: stockholm syndrome in media form. emotionally torturing. absolutely gut
      wrenching. this is the first time i have ever felt physical pain playing a game
      and this is the first game to make me cry. i hate it so much it's not right
      this shouldn't be allowed this is an undocumented form of MK Ultra there is
      nothing worse than this game it ropes you in with cool visuals and its small
      amount of achievements then kicks your teeth in and puts cigarettes out on your
      balls it forces you to tear open your software to find out how to limit it  to
      60fps so it stops running at 1600x speed then it subjects you to incredibly
      tedious gameplay that isn't challenging at all until you find out that you have
      to do it for about an hour straight with no checkpoints at all and extremely
      buggy physics cause your paddle acts like a fucking ball its self it's so unresponsive
      your mouse just seems to do what it wants it can literally freeze up after touching
      a ball because it's decided it doesn't want to be solid in that moment and then
      the ball just fucks off behind the screen or one of those shitty sheep will
      die infront of your paddle and make this 8kb game drop 70% of its frames, making
      the game run half as fast subjecting you to even more pain then before. then
      don't worry about the ball anymore because if it hits one of these sheep heads
      it will either shoot so many particles that you have a seizure or it will make
      the ball go on the most fucked trajectory right past your paddle making you
      lose another life. make sure to not run out of balls because then you have to
      do it all over again. and who the fuck thought they would name the hardest and
      most boring mode easy mode fuck you i took a 5 month break from this fucking
      game just so i wouldn't cut my fucking ears off and throw them at my neighbour
      and even then i was groaning like i was in fucking labour all throughout it.
      any major terror plot would have been even more devastating if they had just
      used this game as some sort of weapon instead ; Ted Kaczynski couldve just mailed
      usbs with  this game on there and every single one of those lizard men receiving
      it wouldve just offed themselves while trying to get every achievement so they
      can throw "#1 CRACKHEAD" on their steam profile for whatever fufcking reason.
      if you made a dark ages peasant play this game or even look at it all their
      organs would fail and each and every blood vessel would rupture immediately.
      their bones would crumble like dust which is what i wish happened to me while
      i played this game there is no ethical way to play this game it will make you
      either want to kill yourself or kill someone else if i mentioned this game to
      my therapist they would have no care in breaking doctorpatient confidentiality
      this is like a fucking SCP memetic agent itll instantly give you a heart attack
      at one glance if you're not O5 or some shit i hate this game so much man if
      you didn't already hate the world before it play this game i hate it i hate
      it i hate it. the music is half decent however
