    review: 'This is another card game, where I am not to sure if I like it or not.
      It is unique in a way when you play cards, they all seem to have ''haste." Which
      is different from most cards games. They say more cards will be on the way.
      I don''t like how your forced to play tutorial. Cards are unique and some strategy
      is involved. I play alot of cards games and the decks seem stacked against you.
