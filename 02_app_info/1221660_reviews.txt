Honestly, it gets boring after a couple of games anyway. And there's no achievements, so not like I could really brag about much by unlocking things.\n\nAnyways, the game is actually broken as hell. Like actually. The game literally never gives you points, and will often award them to your opponent instead. Well, I've had 3 or 4 instances where it does give you those points, but it's REALLY rare (and one of those times was where I hit the ball OUT, keep in mind). And also it's generally really easy to hit the ball out straight away via a serve, it sucks.\n\nCan't really recommend it due to how it is now, sorry.","timestamp_created":1580387815,"timestamp_updated":1580387867,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.61213451623916626","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l6Od++8CfbaL7wE="}
