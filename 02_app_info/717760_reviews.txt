Game crashes while playing, freezes, slows down all the time... I also had to play it on medium config because higher than that the game is slow motion, even though my specs are better than the recommended. \nIt still needs polishing and optimization, though, it's still an early access game, and for it's price, it's not really a problem, but only if you don't mind waiting for the devs to fix the problems and finish it, which is something that we all know is kinda risky, some devs in the past simply stopped updating their games and left it broken. Not that it will happen, but it's always good to be careful. Good news is that the dev seems to be updating it regurlarly for now, so that's a thing.\nHope the devs make a good job and wish them good luck and success with their game.","timestamp_created":1530816762,"timestamp_updated":1530828815,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4qb+gtuQCd5qmpQE="}
