I only played for a couple minutes but I saw some cool things, specifically animations and effects, but as it is the combat is unfun.  I can hardly tell when I've been hit from behind, enemies feel too healthy, and overall this game fails to feel satisfying.","timestamp_created":1609646879,"timestamp_updated":1609646879,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kcab4/YCeYX6vwI="}
