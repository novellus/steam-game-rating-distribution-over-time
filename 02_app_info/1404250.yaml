    about_the_game: "This DLC for <i>Imperiums: Greek Wars</i>, is inspired by the\
      \ legendary accounts of Homer and the story of love, hurt pride, greed, and\
      \ personal courage that has immortalized the heroes of this epic. Yet, more\
      \ than just military excellence will be needed to achieve the goals you\u2019\
      ve brought to Troy. You will need to face the destiny that the goddesses of\
      \ Fate, have assigned and that no mortal hero can avoid. <br>Join the greatest\
      \ warriors on the plains of Troy \u2013 this time you will decide how the story\
      \ ends.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1404250/extras/SteamStoreTroy.png?t=1609758090\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Greco-Trojan Rivalry</h2>The scenario map is relatively\
      \ small, covering the area of the Hellespont, the strait between Asia and Europe.\
      \ The king of Troy controls it, including all trade travelling via this sea\
      \ route. Troia is a prosperous city with reputedly impregnable walls, its symbol\
      \ of power and wealth. <br>On the other side of the Aegean Sea, King Agamemnon\
      \ of Mykenai, together with his brother Menelaos, the king of Sparta, aspires\
      \ to be first among Greek kings. They\u2019ve been eyeing the wealth of Troy\
      \ with envy for a long time and now that Trojan Prince Paris has abducted Menelaos\u2019\
      s wife, Helen, they finally have their justification for war.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Great Warriors</h2>The Greeks, joined in a loose coalition, have gathered a\
      \ massive war fleet along the coast of Troy, readying to disembark their forces.\
      \ The Trojans continue to fortify their outlying towns, and although they\u2019\
      re greatly outnumbered, they count on Troia\u2019s high stone walls to protect\
      \ them.<br>Will you take command of Troy\u2019s defense and try to save the\
      \ kingdom in the face of such terrible odds? Or would you rather assume the\
      \ crown of Agamemnon of Mykenai, and trample the Trojans into dust to become\
      \ the greatest of all Greek leaders? Perhaps you wish to prove your worth in\
      \ combat and seek eternal glory on the battlefield as Ajax of Salamis or Achilles\
      \ of the Myrmidons? Maybe you prefer unusual solutions that can bring victory\
      \ as much as spears and swords, as the wise Odysseus of Ithaka? <br>The choice\
      \ is yours. Each faction has come to Troy with a different purpose that will\
      \ require different strategies. Take advantage of their unique benefits in pursuing\
      \ your goals.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tactical Plan</h2>The raging war will not\
      \ leave much time for economic or social reforms; all resources, human and materiel,\
      \ will be channeled to the war machine. This is a tactical scenario, and so\
      \ the strategic-level decisions are limited to give you room to focus on the\
      \ military task at hand.<br>Part of your resources arrive via external supply\
      \ routes, but war is an expensive endeavor, and sooner or later the stage will\
      \ be reset to a war of attrition. Prepare for it!<br>There are many strategically\
      \ important points; overlooking one might deprive you of the decisive advantage\
      \ you need. Get to know the battlefield, test various plans, and grab opportunity\
      \ by the throat when it presents itself!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1404250/extras/SteamStoreTroy2.png?t=1609758090\"\

      \ are written in the Book of Fate, and you cannot directly affect them. They\
      \ happen as the game progresses depending on game developments; so, one or another\
      \ faction might be \u2018luckier\u2019 than the rest. However, the outcomes\
