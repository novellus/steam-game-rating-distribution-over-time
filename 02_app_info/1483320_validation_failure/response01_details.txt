You build railroads, drive trains, collect resources, deliver goods, and watch cities grow. There several types of raw resources that spawn randomly on the map. You can build resource collection buildings to collect there resources and then transport them to manufacturing facilities to convert them into more advanced goods. There are also several different rail cars in the game, and each one is used to transport specific types of goods and resources. Ores can only be transported in ore cars, liquids in tank cars, and so on.<br><br><strong>Resources and goods:<\/strong><br><br>There are currently six raw resources in the game; wood, coal, iron, rock, food, and oil. These resources are collected by placing the appropriate resource collection building on the respective resource. Raw resources can then be transported to manufacturing buildings to be combined into more advanced goods and products. There are currently seven products in the game; lumber, steel, processed food, fuel, chemicals, and medicine. These are created at manufacturing facilities by combining raw resources and other products.<br><br><strong>Rail cars:<\/strong><br><br>There are currently four types of rail cars in the game; ore car, log car, box car, and tank car.
