    review: 'Si te gustan los shot em up, te va a gustar, asi de simple, la paleta
      de colores y atmosfera general del juego retrotraen a clasicos de Sega genesis
      como "Truxton" "Wings of Wor" o "Steel of empire", teniendo tanta calidad como
      cualquiera de estos. Eso si, puede hacerse corto, ya que los 8 niveles se van
      en un parpadeo en el calor abrazador de la batalla que te espera. Dominar la
      mecanica de saber cuando utilizar el disparo normal, y cuando el concentrado,
      sera la clave de la victoria.

      Como dato curioso, destaco el giro anticristiano-filosofico que tiene la trama
      hacia el final. (me saco una sonrisa)

      Recomendadisimo!'
