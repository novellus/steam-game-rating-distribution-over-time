Whole thing takes approximately 30 minutes. You don't use motion controllers. You can press spacebar to re-center. There is a mini-game where you gaze at the trash to collect all the trash in the scenes. LOL, I wish I was joking there.\n\nAnyways, anybody who follows me knows that I love VR rollercoasters. Yet I decided to refund this one. I was going to do a video review for this game, but I lost all my motivation to experience this game again and talk about it. It was that bad. \n\nMy problem with this game is that it seemed to me that each of the 5 \"magical worlds\" lacked coherence. It honestly looked like just a bunch of assets from the Unity / Unreal Engine marketplace were thrown in together haphazardly. Some of it made sense, most of it didn't. The worlds weren't interesting. The scales were off. The animations were poor. It wasn't pretty to look at. It wasn't fun. I just wanted to get out of the magic elevator. \n\nThat's why I refunded it. I rarely do that. I don't think I've ever done that with a VR rollercoaster. I definitely think the price does not match the quality of the content. This is $1.99 price territory at the most for mobile VR quality.\n\n[b]Rate 3/10.
