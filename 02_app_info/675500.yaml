    review: I cannot get this game to work as a live streamer on Twitch. The camera
      won't work as it's being used in OBS (the game says as much but doesn't offer
      any solutions to fix it) and the connect to Twitch option is broken too. I've
      spent hours trying to find a fix online and on YouTube - way longer than should
      be necessary. It's really too bad because it looks like a fun game... when it
      works!
