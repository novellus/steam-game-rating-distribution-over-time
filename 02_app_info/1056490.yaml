    review: 'It''s absolutely silly and nonsense, in the best possible ways.  The
      first time you pick up something completely random and unexpected and beat an
      enemy with it will get you hooked, and some of the subtle clever connections
      are hilarious.


      My only disappointment is that there isn''t a sequel yet :D'
