    detailed_description: "<h1>Developer's Note</h1><p>This is the desktop version\
      \ of my push-your-luck card game Brave Hand. Please expect Brave Hand to be\
      \ a small, replayable, solitaire-like card game where your goal is to beat your\
      \ previous score, and unlock a light story along the way. I made it because\
      \ I loved the simple yet replayable games that came with my first computer,\
      \ and wanted something like them, but with just a little more strategy. If the\
      \ main &quot;Brave&quot; mode is too hard or too random for your taste, be sure\
      \ to try out the other modes! Each mode is designed to cater to a specific type\
      \ of playstyle. Please contact me through Twitter, our forums, or my website\
      \ if you run into any trouble or just want to follow along with development.\
      \ I really hope you enjoy the game. <i>-Scott Brodie</i></p><br><h1>About the\
