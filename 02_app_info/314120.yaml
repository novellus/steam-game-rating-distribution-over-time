    review: "There are a few issues I'm having with the UI that are driving me up\
      \ the wall. I'm not exactly sure if I'm going to keep playing the game due to\
      \ these. (1.2 hours at the time of this writing). \n\n1) When you click on a\
      \ menu your mouse teleports to where the dev thinks you'd want it. When you're\
      \ done the mouse teleports back to where it was before you were in the menu.\
      \ This is just like a micro annoyance that builds up over time and makes me\
      \ never want to look at my inventory/character screen etc. \n\n2) I have 20/20\
      \ vision but I cannot get the text at any resolution to not hurt to read. I\
      \ *can* read everything but it just seems like WORK to do it and I can't quite\
      \ put my finger on why I hate reading the manual so much. Also, the game refers\
      \ you to a paper manual  for some things which of course you don't have. \n\n\
      3) There are a LOT of spells and feats that you can use in battle. Here's how\
      \ to cast one. Click the spell button, click spells, click the level range of\
      \ the spell, click the spell, click 0-3 times to find your target, click cast\
      \ spell. If you have a spell on one of the three quick cast buttons then you\
      \ can reduce the amount of clicks you need down to 3-6. Given that 2 of your\
      \ 4 characters are meant to be primarily spell casters this is just too much\
      \ work. I understand this is an old school RPG, and an old one at that, but\
      \ I need a better quality of life.\n\nAlso I'm already kicking myself that I\
      \ forgot to use my silver level drama star which may make or break my ability\
      \ to get out of the first dungeon alive.. This is actually a fine mechanic in\
      \ the game but I'm so used to game states being saved completely that I forgot.\n\
      \nOTHER THAN THAT...\n\nThe actual meat and potatoes of the game is fantastic.\
      \ The underlying mechanics of the game is completely revealed to you via a very\
      \ verbose combat log and a LENGTHY manual."
