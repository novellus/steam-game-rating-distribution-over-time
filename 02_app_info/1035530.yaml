    review: 'This game is completely mad and great fun in local multiplayer, especially
      with my young kids - it''s simple enough for them to enjoy and doesn''t really
      matter if you play it well or not.  It becomes complete mayhem with several
      dangerous items appearing or about to appear as you try to guide or bark the
      sheep away from danger!  The different play modes are fun, the visuals are bright
      and appealing, the music suitably frenetic and some cheesy voice acting is a
      nice addition.


      Although I recommend the game, it would certainly be better with improved controller
      support - it works fine for one person but doesn''t recognise a second controller,
      and I didn''t find the "share controller" feature worked very well.  Two players
      on the keyboard is sort of okay, depending on the keyboard and how many simultaneous
      key depressions it can handle.  Overall the controls do sometimes feel slightly
      sluggish, but not enough to seriously detract from the game.


      In short if you have a few people in the house who want to play a game together,
      especially if some of them are young children, this is a great choice.'
