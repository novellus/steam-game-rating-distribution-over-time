Give the VN a try only if you're willing to be patient bearing in mind the inability to consistently skip old text (and a medium text speed at best when not skipping).\n\nI would certainly recommend this visual novel, though only if you're a patient reader. Without going too into detail, it details life under a Chinese dynasty (I think) while also presenting topics such as natural habitat preservation vs. industrial construction. The game follows a main protagonist from the beginning of the story but also switches character perspectives every so often to add more details (although, I feel there should be more occasions where this takes place, as I remember it only occurring once or twice throughout the VN as a whole).\n\nThis VN also provides the player choices on occasion and has some bad endings, although there are also Steam achievements for each ending, and you'll need to reach at least a few of these endings in order to reach the true ending, so be open to playing out each ending.\n\nHOWEVER, one fair warning! From my personal experience, this VN has a hard time skipping past certain dialogue in comparison to what you would expect from normal VNs with a skip feature. Keep this in mind and be extra sure to save at each choice to mitigate the time spent backtracking.","timestamp_created":1609639728,"timestamp_updated":1609639854,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+9+A4/YCcOr2vwI="}
