(I won't be talking about the sound since my laptop was muted)\n\nI had played Gemstone at Insomnia awhile ago and enjoyed it. I brought it yesterday since it was on sale and sat down to play it today. I really did enjoy it and like how simple the controls are and how simple the game is so far. I do expect it to become harder.\n\nHowever, there are two things I need to make aware. The first is the bright purple light when you enter a portal and the bright red light when you beat a boss. Although I do not suffer from epilepsy, I found it too bright, harsh and sudden.\nThe second problem that could have been my own fault is that the first boss can trap you in the corner and chip away at your health. I was able to escape but it still something that I feel should be brought up. But again it might have been my own fault.\n\nI'm sure if the first issue is dealt with soon, the game would be much better. So I give this a recommend.","timestamp_created":1513983255,"timestamp_updated":1513983255,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532085537910461426","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4neSbwOACdtiIkwE="}
