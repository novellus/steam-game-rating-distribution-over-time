The hidden object scenes start out slightly challenging but grow easier as you go through the game... almost as if the developers kind of gave up. No real challenging puzzles. Not nearly enough play time... I clocked in under three hours. Overall, it was an empty feeling game and your energies would be better spent on another HOG.","timestamp_created":1608057515,"timestamp_updated":1608057515,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v83ss/YCdITBugI="}
