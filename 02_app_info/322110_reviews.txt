It's fairly polished, has a unique and in my opinion nice art style, and has plenty of modifiers to spice things up.\nI think the main problems with the game are the fact that you will see all 8 bosses in a single run (which is pretty Mega Man X-like, but maybe not great for a roguelite) and that there are only 4 'tilesets' to explore, and each boss will always be associated with one tileset. You will probably learn quickly how to deal with each boss and tileset - the differences will be in your toolset.\nStill, that reduced replay value doesn't hurt it significantly, in my opinion - as it's a roguelite you will have to explore the game a few times to see all the available upgrades, but if you're skilled enough you won't need them.\n","timestamp_created":1609946852,"timestamp_updated":1609946852,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqu2T7PYCftWDwQI="}
