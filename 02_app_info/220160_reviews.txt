A lot of issues with their shitty connect software that is mandatory to use. \nAnd the worst part: You CAN'T get the DLC. There is no way for you to get it or play it on PC. The DLC for Evo was amazing and added so much to all parts of the game.\nThis is still the best Trials game of the series but only if you can get it on a 360.","timestamp_created":1609924996,"timestamp_updated":1609924996,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwur3A6/YCf9v5wAI="}
