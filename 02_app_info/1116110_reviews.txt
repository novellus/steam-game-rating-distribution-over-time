It would also increase replay value to include rule options such as \"Point-Victory Only\" or the option to remove certain cards so players can experiment with different rule variations\n\nDefinitely worth the $2.99, I even gifted a copy to my friend so we could play together :)","timestamp_created":1609983946,"timestamp_updated":1609986986,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwgfqs7fYCdN2UwQI="}
