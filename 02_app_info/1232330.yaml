    review: 'TLDR; The game is flawed but good


      Theyest thou is an interesting game for me. I feel as though I should dislike
      it because the game can get frustrating at times to me at least but the core
      game play kept drawing me back, not to mention that the game has an interesting
      art style, though this compliment is kinda balanced by the fact that a majority
      of the game takes place in white corridors and areas. What i''m trying to say
      here is that while it has flaws, I enjoyed Theyest thou.'
