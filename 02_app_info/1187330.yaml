    developer_response: 'I''m sorry that you were overwhelmed in your first match.
      It may well be that you got directly into a match with experienced players.
      Our bots usually adjust to the player level after a few minutes, but even they
      can be a bit overwhelming at the beginning.


      For this reason there is a TRAINING option in the main menu. You can train against
      a 1v1 against an Easy Bot. I''m sure after 2-3 matches you will have the hang
      of it and learn how to use the obelisks in the middle and the walls on the sides
      as cover.


      But of course you can also reclaim your money via the normal way. Here are some
      instructions:


      1. Navigate to Steam Help (help.steampowered.com) and log in with your Steam
      account.

      2. After you have logged in, click on A Purchase.

      3. Find the purchase you would like to refund and click on it. ...

      4. Select the problem you are having with the product.

      5. Next, click I''d like to request a refund.


      Hope that helps.

      Cheers, Nico'

    review: 'I played this game for five minutes. I kept dying from nothing. No damage
      indicator, not in the tower, nothing. I was firing at an enemy that was staring
      at me for a good minute then randomly died, which is telling me that incoming
      fire registration is bugged in some way.


      The game is fundamentally broken and I want my money back.



      01/05/2021


      I''m editing this review for very specific reasons, because apparently someone
      thinks it''s my fault that someone else''s net code straight up broke.


      So here''s the thing: I already did AI matches. I did a few after the tutorial
      to make sure I got the basic controls, and I had a good feeling for it.


      When I did an actual online match is when weird things were happening. I wasn''t
      getting any sort of hit indicators or even seeing projectiles and it seemed
      like the shots I was firing that were VISIBLY HITTING THE TARGET weren''t doing
      anything.


      I tried a few different matches of the course of around 30 minutes rather than
      5, but I wouldn''t be in the game that long before just getting tired of dying
      without warning. Yes, I even reset my modem and did a speed test. Ping was fine.
      Upload and download speed were fine. There wasn''t an ISP issue. The game is
      just buggy and un-intuitive.


      Someone said for me to reconsider my wording before the game gets less sales.
      They fail to see that the point of a bad review is to keep people from buying
      the product until it''s fixed. That''s like defending the PS4 and XBONE versions
      of Cyberpunk 2077 because the game''s story is interesting. Its almost like
      the devs sent someone to leave that comment. Yes, I deleted it. It addresses
      nothing. Telling me to learn how to use cover doesnt either, especially as someone
      that does paintball and airsoft often. In fact, it''s a little insulting to
      be told to do a basic thing that I was already trying to do.


      I think I just get more and more mad the more I read the developer response,
