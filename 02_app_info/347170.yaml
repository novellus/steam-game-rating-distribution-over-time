    review: Another great looking flight game, another flight game that claims to
      support Hotas, but you cant even  navigate the menu  with the flight stick.
      How am i supposed to fumble around for a mouse to navigate the menus and moreso
      doesn't that defeat the purpose of hotas? How am i supposed to play this game
      in VR?
