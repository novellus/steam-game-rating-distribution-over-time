You gain victory points by capturing cities, both those of your opponent and those who start out as neutral. How many victory points you need depends on the difficulty setting. As noted above the campaign game is turn-based, you give your orders by night and they are carried out by the day. But even though it's turn-based, you don't have time to sit back and relax, carefully pondering what to do next, since there is a time limit. On the higher difficulty levels, you won't have time to issue all the orders you would like, and you will have to prioritize, while on the lower levels you'll have plenty of time to come up with a good strategy.","about_the_game":"Civil War is an old-school game that simulates the American Civil War from its start in April 1861 until the presidential election on 8th November 1864, when President Lincoln was re-elected.
