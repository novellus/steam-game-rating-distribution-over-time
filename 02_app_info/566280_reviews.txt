When I first heard of Hurricane of Varstray, what made me want to buy it was the electrifying music from the trailer on its store page. As a fan of shoot 'em ups I was plesantly suprised with a polished and enjoyable game, but what really set it apart from others was its music selection. Striking a similar tone to Grev's \"Border Down,\" Hurricane of Varstray's soundtrack carries the themes of the game. From the cosmic and etheral main menu, to the upbeat character select, the intense level pieces, and the foreboding boss themes, every piece feels just right. I would recommend it a hundred times over to anime, sci-fi, and shoot 'em fans alike.","timestamp_created":1481518840,"timestamp_updated":1481518904,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.603121578693389893","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrI7a+NgCc4iFbA=="}
