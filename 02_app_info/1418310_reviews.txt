This makes the game an absolute chore to play, where you're praying for the Shot power-up in order to hit that last block that's minutes away on the Screen-saver-esque pathing the ball takes.\nFeels like and plays like a quick cash grab from someone utilizing the UE4 game maker.","timestamp_created":1606876004,"timestamp_updated":1606876004,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6r/RkPYCedrTtgI="}
