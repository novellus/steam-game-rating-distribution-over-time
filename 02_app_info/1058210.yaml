    review: 'I loved this franchise ever since it came to steam.

      Sure, there''s a couple of flaws in the core design.

      You simply can''t snap individual pieces together.

      And you sadly can''t use your own pretty images.

      Therefore: You are stuck with the default puzzles.

      Everybody really knows these flaws at this point.

      But I honestly do love these jigsaw experiences.

      It simply feels great to finish every single puzzle.

      During a discount it''s definitely worth a purchase.

      Also: I really like playing Pixel Puzzles: Ultimate.

      I thought this game might give me a DLC for that.

      The older Pixel Puzzles games did give the DLC.

      But unfortunately: This game just isn''t doing that.

      Don''t buy this if you are expecting that free DLC.

      I still enjoyed it, but I was a tiny bit disappointed.'
