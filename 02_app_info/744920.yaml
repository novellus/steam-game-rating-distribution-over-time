      notes: 'Half-Life: A Place in the West is intended for mature audiences, containing
        occasional scenes of moderate violence, rare episodes of body horror, and
        minor nudity and sexual content, although this varies from chapter to chapter.
        The story deals with themes of political oppression, sexual assault, and sexual
        coercion.'
