    review: 'Finally, an ambitious title that delivers. It has a compelling story,
      crystal clear sound, incredible graphics, hyperrealistic physics, meaningful
      dialogue, intuitive UI, a masterful soundtrack, character you empathize with,
      and voice acting that evokes emotion like no other. Its a tour-de-force that
      shows what indie developers are capable of. And with insightful commentary on
      modern society, this masterwork instantly becomes game of the decade. It truly
      is the game all other games strive to be.


      15/10, would shepherd gorillas in a circle again.'
