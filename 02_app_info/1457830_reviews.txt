I loved the theme, I loved the demo, I loved the priest, I loved the whole ethereal doom and decay vibe, and I loved the music! I thought the main menu music and the music you hear while talking to the High Priest was going to be the general vibe of the entire game. But when I listen to the soundtrack, I feel more and more diappointed. I expected gloomy, interesting, mysterious, ethereal music with interesting electronics or glorious vocals like the Main Menu Theme, or Kor Shehr.\n\nInstead I got maybe 8 songs, out of 27, that I liked. The rest are just boring. Almost all of them are just low humming tones with occasional Stranger Things synths, tapping on wineglasses with a knife, windchimes, that whooshy windy noise. The songs are so similar to eachother due to the gloomy low repeating hum that not only do you barely notice you've got music playing and it's not just your refrigerator running, but remembeing the names becomes difficult. I remember the names of the Main Menu Theme, Kor Shehr, Cyberhack, Kephra Security Lockdown, Eryx 1 and 2, and Enigma specifically because they stand out.\n\nI remember Exploration, Confusion and Suspense because Exploration is the only song that sounds similar to the demo songs -in the first half until the vocals are dropped- Confusion sounds like a remix of the Mesmer soundtrack from Subnautica but without the vocals and electronics, and Suspense took off with the windchimes.\n\nThe rest of the songs don't stand out at all. They're bland, dull, you barely notice they'rethere, and frankly the low hum is giving me a headache. I could not for the life of me tell you their names. Buying the soundtrack is like buying 8 good songs and a collection of Low Hums With Special Effects. I considered listening to the songs as background noise, but I genuinely find them boring. They're not at all what I thought I'd get.\nI'd ask for a refund but I like 8 of the songs and I want to keep those. That, and I can't find them on youtube so I can't just, you know, listen to them there instead of wasting money.","timestamp_created":1607355928,"timestamp_updated":1607355928,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3KH4nvYCds//twI="}
