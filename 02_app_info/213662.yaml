    about_the_game: This is the Difficulty Pack for Dwarfs!? If you are REAL Dwarfs-lover,
      then the Easy and Normal difficulty levels in the Arcade mode just won't be
      enough for you. You will need more difficulty! So, this add-on is for you -
      it adds in the following extra difficulty levels (the 5, 15, 30 and 60 minute
      versions) for you to play in Arcade mode:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Hardcore</strong>
      - more enemies, they move faster - and so does the lava!<br></li><li><strong>Tedi
      Hardcore</strong> - named for the coder half of Power of 2. Hardcore wasn't
      hard enough for him, so he made it EVEN more difficult!</li></ul>And remember
      - the core game is always FREE! You buy the add-on packs once and can play them
      with no restrictions, for ever after!
