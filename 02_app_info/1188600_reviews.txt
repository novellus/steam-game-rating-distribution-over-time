If you've always dreamed of getting rid of enemies with a stick with a bunch of grapes on it, then this DLC is clearly worth it. About DLC with skins for weapons... they all look flat and uninteresting to me. I believe that the price of this season pass is unreasonably high. Almost nothing new is added to the game. Whether to buy this season pass or not is everyone's choice. But I wouldn't recommend it.
