It'd be nice to have a more direct, in game method to move yourself in relation to the plate. Like a number of other people, the default position has me standing almost on the plate it feels and I wind up fouling to the left - long hits, but fouls no less.\n2) Pitches seem to come in quite low. at 6ft tall I feel i'm swinging at knee height. I've never played or even really watched baseball though, perhaps that's normal?\n\nThose two little niggles aside, overall it is a fun game.","timestamp_created":1609406360,"timestamp_updated":1609406360,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnIWG3PYCcryGvwI="}
