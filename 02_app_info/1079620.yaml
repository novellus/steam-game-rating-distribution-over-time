      /><br><br><u>Redefining massive action space battles</u><br><br>Infinity: Battlescape
      is a multiplayer space-combat game taking place across a <strong>massive, true-to-scale</strong>
      procedurally generated star system that is 100% seamless (no loading screens).
      Multiple corporate factions are fighting for control of a solar system in a
      war involving <strong>hundreds of players, potentially more than a thousand
      per-server</strong> ( without instancing ), that can last from hours to days.
      Coordinate with other players to destroy enemy infrastructure around strategic
      locations, referred to as <strong>Battlescape''s</strong>, across a wide range
      of gorgeous environments including barren moons, gas giants, volcanic planets,
      asteroid rings, and more.<br><br>Participate in <strong>space and planetary
      battles of massive proportions</strong> like those seen in movies such as Star
      Wars, Battlestar Galactica, and Serenity. It''s not unusual in Battlescape to
      hop from battle to battle, some of them involving <strong>hundreds of ships</strong>.
      Climb the competitive ladder, gain ranks, and complete side missions to support
      the war effort in your own way.<br><br>Earn credits to <strong>upgrade and customize
      your ships</strong>, mount better weapons and equipment to give yourself an
      edge over your opponents.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1079620/extras/HeaderBackground3.jpg?t=1599682009"
      /><br><br><u>Team tactics and strategies</u><br><br>Each faction owns a limited
      amount of infrastructure at each Battlescape, consisting of factories, land
      bases, large space stations, and small space stations. Large space stations
      can spawn all types of ship, making them critically important to defend, whereas
      small space stations and land bases are limited to smaller ships. Factories
      spawn AI-controlled haulers that transport resources to space stations. Those
      resources get converted into credits and redistributed on a regular basis to
      your team''s players and AI commander. Players (or the AI) can then spend these
      credits on acquiring better ships and assembling a fleet to attack the enemy.
      Battles naturally emerge around the solar system at strategic locations.<br><br><strong>Every
      ship in Infinity: Battlescape has its own strengths and weaknesses, supporting
      a wide variety of play-styles that each feel unique.</strong> An interceptor
      is small and nimble, good for scouting and protecting capital ships from hard-hitting
      bombers. Corvettes can be configured defensively, to repair team-mates, or offensively
      as &quot;space tanks&quot;. Carriers are mobile spawn points with limited weaponry
      whereas cruisers are both heavily armored and heavily armed - capable of quickly
      dealing punishing amounts of damage to enemy capital ships and infrastructure.'
