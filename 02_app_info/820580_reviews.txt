In the early game there's some strategy involved to avoid going hungry or becoming really sick, but later on you rake in absurd amounts of cash to fund a weirdly lavish post-apoc lifestyle. There is a story throughout of the girl Ashley losing her entire family to what I'm assuming was a freak attack by a major world power, but it doesn't much go into detail in her younger hard years and skips up into high school and college fairly fast. Also yes, the story is in rather broken and sometimes funny english as expected.\n\nIt's pretty relaxing to play through, worth a buy on seasonal sale discount if you're looking for another 100% game or an easy time waster.","timestamp_created":1568664545,"timestamp_updated":1568664545,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566407620906829834","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47qzsne0Cfa6u0gE="}
