I like this Jezzball-esque gameplay style, and find that these games are great to play while listening to music.\n\nCORGIX is quite a bit easier than the Fortix series, as the most effective way to win a level is almost always bisecting the playing field. You can veer to one side or the other at the end in order to ensure that you capture the boss within the smaller segment of the two to instantly complete the level. In Fortix, there are certain sections of the playing field that are impassable or inaccessible without a key, and there are also different types of terrain that are slower to traverse. CORGIX has none of these complications, but there were a few times that my pup inexplicably slowed down after capturing a certain section of the map (possibly a bug?).\n\nHowever, there is still something satisfying about slowly cordoning off the playing field a little bit at a time, and CORGIX scratches that itch. Although I completed the story mode in about half an hour, I had a decent time following this Corgi caper. If you haven't played Fortix 2, I'd recommend that you play that first, but CORGIX isn't bad for a second helping.","timestamp_created":1598277532,"timestamp_updated":1598277624,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjKSxkPQCcce9nQI="}
