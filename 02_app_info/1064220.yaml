    review: 'do i even need to say why this game is amazing?


      halo reach is one of my favorite games ever.


      i love the characters, the combat, the multiplayer, the story, the customization,
      the playlists, i truly love this game.


      But there are problems with this port.


      For one the new armor unlock system is garbage, its sort of like a season type
      thing like in fortnite, so you grind for stuff you dont even want, really dumb.
      it was changed to make it "easier" but it instead just lowers the amount of
      customization you have, which is painfully stupid.


      Forge is delayed, which is fine if youre patient enough like me.


      you cant crouch while moving, which is very annoying.


      you cant change the chat bindings.


      menus are confusing and ugly (the ugly part is subjective, some people like
      it). my brother who has hundreds, possibly thousands of hours on the original
      halo reach couldnt even figure out how to play infection for about an hour.


      I still dont know how to accept friend requests on the mcc.


      occasional bug.


      one of my biggest problems is no map voting. map voting was in the original
      halo reach, but was removed in other titles because the same maps were voted
      over and over, and bungie wanted other maps in the spotlight, well they werent
      voted because they were terrible maps. in call of duty you can vote for, a random
      map not shown, the last played map, and another random map that is shown. if
      the lobby votes for the last map played again, after that game it cant be voted
      for again, i really like this system because other maps get the spotlight and
      better maps can be voted for.


      another big problem is no forge maps on infection. infection is a really fun
      mode, but no map voting and no forge maps can easily ruin the mode. in the original
      halo reach there were maps made in the popular forge map: forge world. these
      maps were amazing, but theyre just not here for some reason, but there are other
      forge maps in other modes like grifball, so its pretty annoying.


      also idk why it says i have 0 hours, at the time of writing this (December 5
      2019) i have 11.5 hours'
