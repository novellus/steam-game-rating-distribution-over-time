Also the music is just as good as either of the Battlestar Galactica series.  The control scheme is way inferior to Allegiance as one would expect but it does work ok.  I do hope there will be enough variety and length of game though, and it is kind of hard to tell what the enemy ships are.  Big thank you do the devs for making the world more entertaining than it was before NF!","timestamp_created":1608982129,"timestamp_updated":1608982129,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lt2zz/YCcK6tvQI="}
