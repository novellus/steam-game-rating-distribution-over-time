    review: It is nice to see a new outfit from time to time and not just revivals
      which already were in doa5 and should just have been included in this game anyways.
      But many of these outfits seem to be very lazy, like with this set so many are
      very similar and not unique to the characters. This has purple stripe so I guess
      that means Ayane, and Leifang has a orange stripe I think...really??  It was
      same as Halloween this year was very cheap and lazy, just all witches. And Ayane
      and Christie practically was same thing, pfft! Lets see some more cool ones
      next time and not just every character is same thing and not just revivals which
      you make me buy again!!
