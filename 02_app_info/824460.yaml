    review: "This game is one of those rare occasions where your awestruck by brilliance\
      \ (if this is a correct english sentence. If not: sry). \nIt has no artificial\
      \ progression system and no narrative. It's just brilliant in its mechanics,\
      \ everything is thought through, it's strategic and in this not complex but\
      \ deep. Simple rules, easy to play, but with more depth on a tactical and strategical\
      \ level than almost every other game I know. It's perfect in what it wants to\
      \ be and unlike any other game I've played so far. And I played a lot of different\
      \ videogames in my life... \n\nTheres a good chance that this game is the best\
      \ 2,49 you'll spend on games (or any hobby in general) so far if you buy this\
      \ on sale. Is totally worth the ten bucks though. Clear recommendation.\n\n\
      Didn't play it in coop so far though. \n\n\nEdit: Still didn't play coop, but\
      \ got two #1 ladder spots, which feels nice :D"
