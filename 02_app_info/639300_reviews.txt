Very impressed that this is a single dev game too.\n\nHere's the bad up front. There isn't a huge amount of depth to the game. You have fighters, guilds, a few weapons, and arena combat. There's not really a story line, and Death League doesn't have the random events of that AOG: Rome 2 has to keep you on your toes. Oh... and the RNG is suspect (but RNGs are REALLY hard to do well, so that is a bit forgivable). Also, the AI makes some really odd choices for match ups and load outs, but it is what it is.\n\nOkay... not a lot of depth. Got it? Good. What AOG: DL sets out to do, i.e. plant you in a galactic fight league, let you struggle A LOT in the early game, and then rack up a fortune in credits after you build your stable of fighters, it does very well. In other words, it is GM-mode for whatever EA sports game you fire up when you are totally bored. And... it does a pretty decent job too.\n\nThere is enough nuance to the game to make your stats matter to the outcome of your matches. Want to build a slow axe-wielding tank that will soak up damage? You can do that. Need a speedy twerp with a vibroblade to tickle the other gladiators to death? You can do that too. Prefer to take on the enemy at range? Go for it. \n\nYou may find that in the early game melee >>> ranged almost every match. But keeping your guys with your trainers lets you train your shooters so that the phrase \"never bring a knife to a plasma carbine fight\" has some real meaning.\n\nAlso, make sure that you train more that three dudes... why? Playoffs. Don't worry, you'll find out.\n\nSo, after buying this on sale, I've had a good time with it. Not sure how much replayability there is yet due to the depth, but it is a solid game for what the dev set out to do with with it. I'll buy the next one as a result.","timestamp_created":1595207978,"timestamp_updated":1595207978,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513489603996276855","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwcHztPMCdcOxlgI="}
