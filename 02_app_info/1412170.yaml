      Janosik is on the mission to take back his companions. Will you help him?<br><br>Janosik
      was legendary <strong>Slovak highlander robber</strong>. According to the legend,
      he robbed nobles and gave the loot to the poor. He is known as Slovakian''s
      Robin Hood. Game is based on popular legends about Janosik. According to those
      legends Janosik had special magic items given to him (usually) by witches. those
      items gave him superhuman strength, protected him from bullets, or gave him
      ability to jump over the trees. In some legends Janosik fights with supernatural
      beings, devils, etc.. I highly recommend to read those legends. <br><br>The
      game is absolutely <strong>free</strong>. There are no micro transactions or
      anything like that. I made the game because this is my hobby :) I hope you enjoy
      the game!<br>By the way - Janosik is a Slovakian hero. Just to show respect
      I have translated all the dialog to Slovakian language.<br><br>Game supports
