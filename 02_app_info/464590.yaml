    review: 'Order of Battle is my new favorite WWII strategy game. Awesome, well
      done and real fun. After playing my favorite DLC: the US Marines. I decided
      to give the US Pacific a try after playing its first mission. After playing
      the DLC, I have no idea how is it that I complete the objectives (both primary
      and secondary) AND I STILL FAIL THE MISSION?! I even eliminate all Japanese
      troops and capture or take the key points, eliminate key units like carriers
      and for some reason I still fail and have played the campaign up untill coral
      sea where after completing over 5 times and keep losing nearly every battle
      even after I do the objectives? I''m not a noob or don''t know how to play since
      I''ve played the US Marines pack and others and Order of Battle is an amazingly
      awesome and superb game, but for some reason US Pacific has this problem.  If
      anyone could help, then thanks!'
