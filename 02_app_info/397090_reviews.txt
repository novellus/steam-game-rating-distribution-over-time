The title card is fan-service, with a late-game character overshadowing the heroine all to put cleavage at the fore-front.  It seems like a really cheap way to bring attention to the game, which is especially foolhardy as there's nothing remotely like that in the game itself.  Distractions aside, this RPG Maker game does begin clumsily and there are flaws throughout holding the game back from what it could have been.\n\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1] \n•\tIt begins slowly, but the story does become fairly engaging if you're able to stick with the game.  For those 10% of people who give the game a few hours, 8% wind up playing through 'til the very end.  Clearly though, people do give up on the game quickly, as about 20% of people boot it up and don't play it at all.\n•\tI prefer this style of game where enemy encounters are represented by avatars you can either choose to fight or avoid, as opposed to random encounters.  I know I didn't wind up being as powerful as I could have by the end, but I wasn't in the mood to keep fighting random peons.\n•\tYour defense tends to be pretty high, so though you may not easily kill enemies, you tend to be hard to kill yourself.  That varies, especially in the latter half of the game, but if you keep your equipment in good shape, your defense will be solid.\n•\tIt's hard to explain succinctly, but I found the characters and story enjoyable.  Admittedly cliche, but I did get caught up in what was going on and wanted to see more.\n\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1] \n•\tThe game has problems with its walls and boundaries, as there are multiple areas where you will walk through tiles that should represent a cliff-side or wall.  This is mostly a non-issue, though it can get annoying when you're simply trying to navigate an area and randomly get held up or stuck.  However, while traversing through Glenweln Forest, I passed the boulder by walking through the walls, and skipped past content where you get both Renee and magic.  As I went to the next area, Renee arrived to trigger the next story segment, but the characters had no magic.  I only tried it because of the ironic word choice the protagonist had.  If I hadn't saved around that time, I could have really screwed myself.\n•\tNear the end of the game, there's equipment for sale that is well beyond what you can afford at that time.  Sure, you could buy one incredibly expensive item with all the money you have, but to equip everyone in the party somewhat evenly, you have to get items two or three levels below that.  I fail to see why the equipment sold at the end is so unbalanced like that, especially since the location and narrative don't support it being such stellar gear.\n•\tThe main reason I avoided fights towards the end of the game was because many regular enemies make use of annoying status effects that either increase their defense or evasion, or make your characters miss their basic attacks.  This really drags out fights with peons you should be wiping out with relative ease.  It's not interesting or challenging, it's just irritating.\n•\tThere's a random \"cutscene\" halfway through the game, and it includes a very poorly drawn picture.  Compared to the rest of the game, this sudden picture is out of place and jarring, which seems odd to include at all since it's so brief.  This was an anomaly in the game.  \n•\tWhen Lytan comes into your party, he he woefully underequipped.  His equipment is weak, and two slots are totally empty.  He was a fair fight against you earlier, has a unique flying ship, and raids places frequently, but can't get basic defensive gear?  \n•\tHidden rooms and areas don't only hide secrets and treasure, but sometimes require you to find them to progress in the game.  That can be annoying, since there's not always a clear indication where a fake wall is.  \n•\tDespite moving through different areas and facing new enemies, the HP of enemies don't increase as often as I'd expect.  For instance, much of the early game consists of enemies with 40-50 HP.  \n•\tWhen going through the Black Snake Base area, you descend the same exact room TEN TIMES, with no indication anything is happening.  I thought it was either a puzzle or a glitch at first!\n\n\n[h1] Conclusion: [/h1] \nThis game has several design flaws, with little sense as to why these mistakes were made by a developer with this many titles already under its belt.  Even the title seems to be an error, since the game is clearly called Wind Child Black, and the sequel is supposed to be Wind Child White.  The sequel is in theory a WIP, but very little information is available now.  Frankly, though I enjoyed the characters and story as I played through the game, I can't recommend it with the various mistakes and flaws it has.  Personally, if the sequel is released sometime soon, I would want to play it just to see how the story wraps up.  However, having finished this game, I feel invested.  For those who haven't done so, I see no reason to get this game, whether the sequel does or doesn't get released.","timestamp_created":1533870138,"timestamp_updated":1607223063,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.709949970245361328","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nbb9mvYCdOb8pwE="}
