The game itself does need some work on quality and presentation. \nI suggest some fixes / changes:\n-some character animations look unrealistic, I would suggest all workouts would be recorded by mocap and applied to model.\n-ui is horrible looking and needs some polish\n-main volume should be set on main screen and also saved. Currently you only change volume while in workout and it does not save.\n-would love a higher detail character, or more of them to chose from. Possibly with shadow included, it would add to realism. Current character has also a problem of clothes clipping into body at some poses.","timestamp_created":1609143149,"timestamp_updated":1609143149,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609248691,"developer_response":"Thank you for your feedback fakk2981.  Very much appreciated. Good points. I will really think upon each of the ideas you presented here.\nOne very easy update will be to include volume control on the main screen and save it, so I will get this done. There is an update coming out with a 60 minute workout option soon, but in the next update after that I will put volume control onto the start screen also. Plus make the master volume save in general."}],"cursor":"AoJ4nPyZ1PYCeJWEvgI="}
