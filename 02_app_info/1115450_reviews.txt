The gameplay is ok, nice to build, although the placement is a bit wonky, can't get stuff neatly packed easily, roads placement snaps only to ends of stretches of roads you've placed and sometimes their colouring \"pours\" over buildings when you put them too close, making the buildings look brown. Biggest issue is lack of purpose besides building everything. Also it's quite easy to survive, just put a few people on farming and you're set (also you can keep farming throughout winter, which is weird). As it is, I wouldn't recommend purchasing unless you're a big fan of the genre and want to try it badly. I usually get way more hours from any game of the genre, this one just doesn't have more than a few hours of gameplay in it's current state. Hopefully more gets added and it gets better.","timestamp_created":1609330575,"timestamp_updated":1609330575,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609344650,"developer_response":"This week weather is being made to affect crops.\n\nSorry about the colour pouring that is not meant to happen, will try to find the issue."}],"cursor":"AoJ46fjk2fYCdozhvgI="}
