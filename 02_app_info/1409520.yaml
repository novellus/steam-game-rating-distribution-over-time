    about_the_game: <i>In this hand-crafted parkour maze, you must utilize your quick
      reflexes and intuition to not fall into the lava. With no checkpoints in this
      single level maze, one touch of the lava will restart you all the way back at
      the beginning. Work through a variety of challenges that will test how well
      you can adapt to this unpredictable maze by using only a grappling hook and
      the ability to jump on wall panels. Experience the Worst Game Ever with normal
      default controls or make the game even worse with unconventional controls that
      will make every move a challenge. Adventure through this near-to-impossible
      maze to see what awaits you at the end.<br><br>Like mentioned above, the game
      consists of two game styles. Key difference between two modes is that in hardcore
      mode, controls are unconventional and simply uncomfortable; and it's nearly
      impossible to beat the level with. Although, some extra challenge is always
      good, despite the level itself being hard.<br><br><strong>So, what are you waiting?</strong></i>

    short_description: Utilize just a grappling hook and wall jumping to adventure
      through a near-to-impossible parkour maze. With no checkpoints and lava floor,
      your every move counts because once you touch the lava, you restart at the beginning.
      Challenge yourself by making the game even worse with hardcore controls.
