Maybe you might want to have free solutions later on for tough stuff, but I want to solve them myself anyway. :)\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2301670357\n\nThe puzzles themselves need you to put blocks on the right places, starting easy, getting more difficult over time. Blocks can have numbers, may be empty (placable anywhere), or have mathematical functions going in one or more direction, affecting the neighbouring block(s), including blocks that affect neighbouring blocks.\n\nYou do not have to move the blocks with your character. As you're told early on, you have a super power to move them with your mind! :)\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2301643062\n\nThere are also different colours to the blocks, affecting only matching colours, or changing colours. And after a while shapes are added, neighbouring blocks have to fit into each other.\n\nNew blocks are introduced in easier puzzles, where it should be obvious what you have to do with them. \n\nThere is no level selection, but you can start over any time, losing previous progress.\n\nThere is no indication of how many levels there are. A guide on Steam here says it is 67 levels.\n\nThe interface works fine, the graphics are ok, though I could do without the fake 'snow' fuzzying some locations.\n\nThe character you start watching at the start isn't the most likable, but I guess you can imagine just watching the folks, and not actually playing him.\n\nDefinitely recommended for people who like to jog their gray cells and chuckle at the text now and then. Even fuzzy old me got to the end once, and I'm now playing it again. :)\n\nEdit: After playing it some more again, I added additional info.","timestamp_created":1606582104,"timestamp_updated":1609749643,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.684892833232879639","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ478ej5vYCf4zMtAI="}
