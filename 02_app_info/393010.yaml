    review: These Developers fell from grace long ago. They are online bullies and
      deserve no support. They don't take kindly to criticism and will retaliate using
      any tactics at their disposal; thank god they have no power here on Steam. Early
      access game are supposed to be criticized but I guess that is why their crummy
      games never improve.
