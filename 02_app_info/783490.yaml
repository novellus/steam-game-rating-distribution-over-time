    about_the_game: This Demo contains World 1 of Gatlin'.<br><br>Meet <strong>Blot</strong>.
      He's your everyday regular doodle with a vengeance... <i>and a giant gatling
      gun</i>. Help Blot along on his quest to take down the fearsome dictator known
      as <strong>Art</strong>. Shoot, propel, and pogo your way through dozens of
      challenging levels to fulfill Blot's destiny!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/783490/extras/KeyFeatures.png?t=1577222100"
      /><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>A unique, physics-based way of movement.<br></li><li>Quirky
      humor and jokes. <i>Is this a plus? I honestly don't know.</i><br></li><li>It's
      a hard game. <i>Both a pro and a con!</i></li></ul><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/783490/extras/WhatsGatlin.png?t=1577222100"
      /><br>Gatlin' is a physics-based platforming bullet hell where <i>you</i> are
      the bullet hell! Fling your way across dozens of levels with your trusty gatling
      gun of doom. Try your best not to die, but believe me, you are going to be dying.<br><br><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/783490/extras/Gameplay.png?t=1577222100"
      /><br>You live, you die, you live again. In Gatlin', your main methods of problem
      solving are your eyes and learning from your mistakes. Upon dying, you are sent
      back to the start of the level to run through it again until you do it right.<br><br>I
      hear you asking, <i>&quot;What causes me to die?&quot;</i> That is an oddly-morbid
      question, but a question I will answer nonetheless. You'll die to classical
      art, you'll die to spikes, you'll die to weird demented clones, and you'll die
      to tears. By the way, that last thing is both <u>figurative</u> and <u>literal</u>.<br><br><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/783490/extras/BossFights.png?t=1577222100"
      /><br>The boss fights in Gatlin' are sentient bullet hells gone rogue. Fear
      not! They have patterns and tricks that you will likely get accustomed to.<br><br>Each
      boss also reveals  <strong>c</strong>  <strong>r</strong>  <strong>i</strong>  <strong>s</strong>  <strong>p</strong>  <strong>y</strong>  lore
      and each boss harbors an unforgettable personality - so that's pretty neat I
      guess.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/783490/extras/Speedrunning.png?t=1577222100"
      /><br>Gatlin' was and will always be designed with all types of player in mind.
      If you wish to go slow or fast, the level design panders to all. That said,
      <strong>we highly encourage speedrunning</strong>.
