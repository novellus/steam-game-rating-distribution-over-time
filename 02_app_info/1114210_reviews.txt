This is actually a really nice puzzle game.  The levels are varied enough to stay interesting and the learning curve is steady without any jarring leaps.  Colloc feels very complete, with a nice outer map screen and charming backgrounds in the levels.  There are simple and clear instructions for the main mechanics, which I really appreciate.  \n\nThe only feature that was missing for me was an undo button.  As most of the levels were short (less than 30 moves) it wasn't a problem through the easier parts of the game, just on a few of the bigger levels with 30-55 moves.  Still, it wasn't a huge issue as the character movement is easy and fast.  \n\nI spent 11-12 hours to get all the achievements, and nearly all of that time was enjoyable.  Something to note is that to get all of the 'towers' for completing the game, the levels have to be finished below a certain number of moves.  There's more than enough content for a casual gamer who doesn't care too much about achievements or completion, or for a more dedicated puzzle-solver who likes to optimize their solution.  Nothing is ridiculously difficult, as the solutions aren't so open-ended that you can go astray for hours on end.  \n\nThe only 'story' is that you are saving an island from 'black hole 24' by defeating the tower levels that are accessible after completing the main levels in each world (9 each+tower).  No timing challenges.  \n\nWhen you move, any characters you have on the screen will all move in the same direction, unless they have nowhere to move to, in which case they stay where they are.  This is one of the main elements of solving the puzzles, as it changes the configuration of your characters when some of them move and others don't.  \n\nOne world has 'zombies' which cause you to restart the level if you move to the same square as them.  The zombies are controlled by your movements, and move in the opposite direction both horizontally and vertically to your characters.  They don't move on their own so their is no feeling of being chased or attacked, only blocked.\n\nThis is the work of one developer, which is impressive!  Well worth picking up if you like tricky puzzles and cute graphics.","timestamp_created":1609103365,"timestamp_updated":1609103592,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.574531376361846924","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpImD0/YCctzwvQI="}
