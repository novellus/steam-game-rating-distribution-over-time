Was skeptical about the game at first but my curiosity got the better of me and bought it to try it out. If you want my full review with gameplay, then check the link: https://youtu.be/Yj6VRs7uUkE\nWhat made it a worth playing game for me:\n1. Smooth gameplay\n2. Cool main menu theme music\n3. Controller Support\n4. Massive Maps\n5. Huge levels\n6. Compact mission objectives with mini in-game objectives\nA decent game well-worth the money, capable of keeping you busy and entertained for a couple of hours. Something you can come back to for many times. Will keep a lookout for more games from the devs. Recommended.","timestamp_created":1543334514,"timestamp_updated":1543334823,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":18,"weighted_vote_score":"0.160456538200378418","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4xZD7qucCc7XpswE="}
