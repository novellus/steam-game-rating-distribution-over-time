(me either, it's older than I am)\nWell its like Galaga on crack. \nIt's hard. Don't expect this game to pat you on the back for pressing space bar. This isn't chicken invaders.\nYou try to earn money to buy upgrades by betting on how well you will do.\nYou'll probably nearly always lose money because you're just not good enough.\nFor less than the price of a coffee this game offers a serious challenge for those with big space balls.\n\n","timestamp_created":1563135819,"timestamp_updated":1563135819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499639511108398438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4z/eJ+esCc++vzgE="}
