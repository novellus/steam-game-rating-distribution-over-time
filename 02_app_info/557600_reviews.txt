Finished it in 2 hours.\nThe story seems very abstract and confusing on first playthrough. Might require additional playthroughs\nToo expensive for the playtime. Pick it up on a sale.\n","timestamp_created":1610173600,"timestamp_updated":1610173600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkOr08vYCc/PdwQI="}
