The game is decent as it introduces characters, various crafting options and an initial event to send you on a quest to find the village's warriors. The problem is The Song of Tyrim eventually becomes crippled and feels unfinished.\n\nThe modeling is basic, but the objects are also very flexible. Some houses can be destroyed. There were efforts made to make the environment dynamic. The problem is controlling the character feels like trying to move a string puppet through a maze. The movements aren't fluid, the attacks are simplified and most of the time it's not obvious what can be achieved while controlling Tyrim.\n\nIssues spread further when quests are added to your journal which never really grows larger than 3 to 4 items. Sadly the game feels unfinished, several quests I've seen on books don't look very coherent and I'm uncertain if they can be finished at all. Quests may have been too predictable and this is how the end game was translated in order to create difficulty, but it only created confusion.\n\nFinally, it's worth mentioning that the physics are fixed in Cornerstone. You bring the crafting menu and suddenly your character falls off whatever moving platform it was on. Wind will push you over the ledge only when you're in a convenient spot where it can happen. Enemies can go through traps unscathed, etc...\n\nI don't recommend Cornerstone. Even on sale it feels like I purchased someone's botched up project. it needed many more hours of development and testing in order to be worth its regular price tag, but unfortunately it seems it was abandoned.","timestamp_created":1595473378,"timestamp_updated":1595686802,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542809665203094482","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpYqWw/MCcveBlwI="}
