    review: 'EDIT 2 - In November 2019, I was gifted a copy of Year One Survival Edition
      for owning this game. This helps to rectify my prior feelings about being locked
      out of the game, thank you. I will edit one final time if/when I get around
      to trying out YOSE.


      EDIT June 2016 - So this developer basically STOLE MY MONEY at this point. I
      went to check if any updates have been made, and they''ve completely removed
      this game from the Steam store, and replaced it with a "Remastered" version.
      And of course Steam won''t give me a refund for this THEFT because it''s more
      than two weeks old.


      I will never touch another game from this developer, EVER.


      (Previous review below.)


      The game is promising, but was nothing like I was expecting when I bought it.  The
      biggest issues I have are related to game mechanics that waste the player''s
      time:


      If you have to quit the game in the middle of a mission, when you reload your
      save you will end up back at your base.  For missions with a time limit, this
      likely means you will fail because A) you can''t get back out to the location
      and finish it before time is up, and B) something else will come up to prevent
      you from getting back out there, like another damn horde attack as soon as you
      load your game.


      Good luck taking care of a horde attack early in the game.  Gunfire just attracts
      MORE zombies, and melee weapons break too fast to do much good.  Zombies scale
      walls instantly even if barbed wire is on top, and barriers on doors and windows
      DISAPPEAR after an attack.  This makes reinforcement useless and stupid.'
