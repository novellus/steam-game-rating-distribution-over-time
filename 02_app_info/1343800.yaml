      after a disaster that disabled most of the planet''s electric artifacts and
      turned nature against civilization, humans are trying to get back on their feet,
      keeping away from the cities now infested with mutated creatures. You are Lena,
      one of the Seiva Hunters, individuals that brave the cities of old using a mix
      of gunblade arts and capoeira to survive the dangers of the Pulse. <br><br>After
      Lena''s mother - a Master Hunter - disappears in an expedition, Lena embarks
      on a journey leading her to one of the only cities which no hunter has ever
      returned: <strong>Rio de Janeiro. </strong><br><br>You will explore the ruins
      of Rio, discovering the memories of a city that holds many scars - even before
      the disaster - that may help unravel the mistery behind the event that changed
      humanity''s destiny forever: the Terra Pulse.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1343800/extras/Gif-Combat-Moldura.gif?t=1602182891"
