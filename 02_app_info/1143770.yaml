      /><br><br>Ever wanted to destroy everything around you? You see, it's in our
      blood, or at least it was when we were kids, to try and break things. Then we
      were taught we're not supposed to do that as people tend to get pissed off at
      you. If you break stuff as an adult, you'll have to reimburse the owner and
      perhaps even get a fine from the authorities.<br><br>That's why we created StressOut,
      a world where you can go beyond the limitations of the real world... but there's
      a catch! <br><br>An evil AI villain has frozen the supermarket in time and the
      world became grey and dull. It's up to you to bring it back to life by having
      fun and creating as much chaos as possible while racing against the clock. <br><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Great way to experience what VR can offer<br></li><li>Feel
      like a hero by using amazing superpowers<br></li><li>No VR headaches!  Play
      different length levels<br></li><li>More destruction = more rewards!<br></li><li>Earn
      upgrades to create more destruction<br></li><li>Carefully watch your surroundings

      use</h2>Use your hand and fingers to create intuitive gestures. It's <strong>one
      of the first</strong> games ever to apply multi-finger tracking on Index controllers
      to use (and not just visually). Experience VR in all it's majesty!<h2 class="bb_tag">Early
      Access coming in December 2020</h2>If you're interested in helping us define
      what StressOut is all about, then add StressOut to your wishlist to be notified
      immediately when it's available for purchase in Early Access! We see StressOut
      as a platform for physics sandbox with superpowers. Telekinesis is just the
      beginning.
