    review: 'This game just had me melting with big friendship feels.

      It''s charming chapters get you meeting and greeting with some very true-to-life
      personalities in monster form. The music and pixel art are delightful, so is
      the attention to detail - especially on the decks of cards that are crafted
      to each monster''s interests. The fact that Sandwiches and Samson can be played
      in real life with an actual set of cards is pretty lovely. I did have a little
      trouble with the hit boxes every now and again, but ultimately the game is nicely
      polished and super wholesome! I''d certainly recommend to anyone who enjoys
      cute, short, positive, or narrative games - make some friends in Monster Pub!'
