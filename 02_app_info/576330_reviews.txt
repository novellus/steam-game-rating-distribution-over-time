The horses look pretty decent, probably the best constructed bit in the game, though on close inspection the fur texture looks a little more like chipped stone in certain light. The environments were actually not too bad either, though there are some inconsistencies in style and quality. - But again, still better than some horse games.\n\nYou are able to change the graphics settings between Low, Medium, and High. These seem to just alter how much shadow everything has. \n\nSTORYTELLING:\nThe quests and story line seem okay at the moment, though talking to people can be a little difficult. The game actually would not let me speak to Stephen at one point when he was the main quest. I had to restart the game and he generated at his house, not the paddock where he was supposed to be, but it finally let me talk to him.The text boxes look like place holders, I hope they will be updated for the full game as it is hard to read at times, with some typos. But to be honest it is nice to see a horse game incorporate quests beyond \"win this comp, brush, feed, go to bed\" so I do still like that they have tried to make a story!\n\nCONTROLS:\nThese are not the easiest controls to use and get used to. I did experience some trouble with them, and at times if I was too near something else, certain controls wouldn't work. I feel like they are a bit all over the place, using the mouse, arrows AND other keys. The method could do with being tightened or allow the user to define their controls? My horse also ran off at one point when I was chattin' trade with the mayor and I had to wander around the town to find it and had to literally chase it down when it was running about like a lunatic. Could have done with a map or option to call your last ridden horse? Or perhaps clear instructions on how to tether it somewhere even?\n\nPLAY-ABILITY:\nIt is ALMOST playable. I had a lot of trouble with objects phasing through walls, things disappearing, characters being inaccessible to talk too when I needed to, and after a while the nausea was a bit too much and I had to stop from that and frustration with the bugs (and I hasten to add I do not normally experience motion sickness when playing games, it is rare) What I will say is that they have included a feature that allows you to debug your character if you get stuck anywhere.\n\nSUMMARY:\nI am 100% behind this game. I want it finished, because it's got SO MUCH potential to be a seriously well rounded horse game. (The market is desperately lacking in one that ticks even most of the boxes for me) but in its current state I simply can't recommend it and I'm glad I got the demo first! When it's finished though or even updated further, I can guarantee I'll want to give it another good go because it really, really does have so much potential and I can't fault them for what they are trying to accomplish. An open environment, story-driven, horse game with decent graphics, characters, quests and building application alongside riding horses and caring for them? You just don't get that in horse games. Last thing close to this I've seen is the old Pippa Funnell games, some of which don't even run on Windows 10 they are that old now. \n\nIf you are stuck for something in the meantime while we wait for this to be completed I'd recommend \"My Riding Stables: Life with Horses\". It doesn't really have any story but it is surprisingly addictive. That being said, PLEASE, PLEASE FINISH THIS GAME. I AM VERY EXCITED FOR IT!!!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1486736059,"timestamp_updated":1486736059,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p/2XlNoCedricQ=="}
