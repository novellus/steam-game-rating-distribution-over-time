    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">What is Element?</h2>Element BR is a fast paced
      battle royale with 24 others on a large map. Element takes BR to the next level
      with realistically balanced controls and mechanics. With rising walls that will
      kill anyone behind them this prevents camping and forces all players to the
      center of the map, creating an absolute blood bath at the end. Guns and ammo
      are scarce, allowing for more close combat situations with melee. The water
      outside of the map is toxic and will kill you in seconds if you dare go in.
      In overall the goal is to survive and thrive against others to be the last man
      standing.<h2 class="bb_tag">Why Element?</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Element
      is ever evolving with new game modes and guns coming in the next few weeks<br></li><li>
      Balanced mechanics and fast pace fights<br></li><li> Ever evolving map and more
      maps to come in the next months<br></li><li> No paid in game currencies, all
      cosmetics (Coming soon) will be obtained by wining games and logging in daily<br></li><li>
      Active devs and a good anti cheat keeping the games fair<br></li><li> An active
      developer keeping the game in line and glitch-less.</li></ul>
