    review: 'Very very good Destruction Derby game ! The graphics are not spectacular
      but it''s 10 times better than the old 90''ties games, and the tracks are very
      interesting. The tracks changes a little bit with some added ramps and chicanes
      to make it more difficult (read: more crashes) every new championship!

      The damage models are not so amazing but fair enough, but the cars are looking
      all almost the same.

      The soundeffects are also good enough for me and the music is a retro house/acid
      ish, no metal or garage rock this time.

      It''s not a Flatout or Wreckfest game but for me personally during the sale
      price I can warm recomend it!

      I would like more differences between the cars with some Camaro''s, Mustangs,
      Ford Pick-ups and more...

      And a replay would be awesome, I would play a lot more just to watch the crashes
      again from different angles.
