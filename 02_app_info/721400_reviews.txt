Not really. Am I still recommending it? Yeah. Why? Well, it's actually a good workout in VR. It's not perfect, but it is one of the better workout regimens in VR if you're actually interested in getting fit. You may want to mute the game and listen to your own music though (the in-game music track repeats itself).\n\nIn this game, you will need to actually jog (you can do a light jog or you can run as fast as possible), jump, throw, and dodge side to side. You will get a good sweat going after 10-30 minutes of doing this depending on your fitness level. You basically dodge the parked cars, jump over the hurdles, and throw the football to either change the light to green at intersections or to get rid of cops blocking your path (you can dodge instead of throwing though). I do wish the parked cars were actually moving cars so that the dodging left to right were more interesting. \n\nHowever, as is, there isn't much variety. You'll be seeing the same scene throughout the game. It really doesn't get more difficult as you go along. Although, because you do get tired, stuff like crossing the street or jumping the hurdles or even throwing the football does get more difficult as you lose concentration. In my opinion, the game is more fun if you try to cross the intersections without throwing the football at the light (so that you have to be careful crossing the intersections so you don't get run over by a vehicle).\n\nSo this game isn't for everyone. If you're working for a good workout in VR though, this is among the better ones. It has enough variety for those serious about their VR fitness regimen. Keep in mind, it is possible to cheat yourself as this game can be played as an arm-swinger (no need to jog) if you hold down the grip buttons. Don't hold down the grip buttons!\n\n[b]Sale Price Rating 6/10. It's only $5 normal price, I got this for $3 USD on sale. I feel I got my money's worth.\n\n[i]p.s. This game does not have left-handed support. You can just switch your motion controllers though[/i]","timestamp_created":1506613730,"timestamp_updated":1581545271,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559357166290283203","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47bXcnfACcJnDhgE="}
