    review: 'This is a fun little party based Action RPG. I picked it up at around
      $4.50 and I''m enjoying it. Don''t go into the game expecting something crazy
      in-depth. However, the characters are interesting enough to make it fun. I really
      like how Dr. Jekyll plays in particular. If you''re familiar with classic fairy
      tales, then you will definitely enjoy this game with all of its references and
      enemies you encounter. I say give it a try if you catch it on sale. It''s very
      easy to pick up and play a chapter or two when you have time.


      EDIT: I just hit chapter four and there''s a bug where the game loads underneath
      the stage, so you can''t progress. I can''t recommend the game with a game-breaking
      bug like this. Once it''s fixed, I''ll switch it back to a positive review,
      but I can''t in good conscious recommend this game when it has a bug that prevents
      you from finishing the game.'
