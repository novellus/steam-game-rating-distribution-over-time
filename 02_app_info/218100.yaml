    review: Really impressed with this DLC.  Didn't think I'd enjoy playing the Soviets
      as much as the Germans, but the scenarios are very well designed and quite frequently
      epic in scale, if not a tad easy for experienced players (though that's presumably
      historically accurate, given the rout that was the late-war German retreat).  Looking
      forward to Unity of Command II, I hope it preserves the excellent feel of the
      original. Played on linux (Ubuntu 19.04), appreciate the OS support.
