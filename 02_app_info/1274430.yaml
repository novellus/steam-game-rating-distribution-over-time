    about_the_game: "If you are a writer and you have a good story and don't want\
      \ to sell the copyright cheaply, but you don't know how to express the story\
      \ in the form of video, this game may help you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game\
      \ can be seen as a music game, but it doesn't require you to hit the keyboard\
      \ at the right rhythm. You only need to edit the action and special effects\
      \ to show in advance, and then preview it. It will show itself at the rhythm\
      \ you specify.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease wear headphones when playing. The game\
      \ has built-in video tutorials, which are not only tutorials to teach players\
      \ how to play the game, but also a small story, full of suspense, laughter and\
      \ pain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are two points I want to explain in the video\
      \ tutorials,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first one is: during the videos recording\
      \ days, my wife and I had a big quarrel. I was not in a good mood at that time,\
      \ but now we have made up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe second is: the game's original\
      \ price is $5 (June-10-2020---July-10-2020) .  I plan to lower the price. So\
      \ In the future the dollar zone price will not be 5 dollars. <br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nSo the reality may be inconsistent with some contents in the videos, but I\
      \ don't want to change it after it has been recorded. And I have no plan to\
      \ update this game either.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf the game is not hot, then everything\
      \ will be good. If the game becomes hot, there will be a lot of troubles. It\

    review: 'What is this game? It''s you watching and listening to a guy ramble on
      and on incoherently about subjects.


      How to get achievements? Just load up the game and minimize. Chill out on the
      web for a couple of hours while achievements slowly roll in.'
