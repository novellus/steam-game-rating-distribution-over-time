      \ East Mediterranean\_<br><br>A few decades ago, during the &quot;1987 crisis&quot;\
      \ Greece and Turkey came very close to Armed Conflict over disputed drilling\
      \ zones in the Aegean Sea. Turkish expanding Sea Exploration Activities with\
      \ Piri Reis and Sismik 1 ships\_created a provoked tension between the two countries.\
      \ Greek plans also to nationalize the consortium of companies that was drilling\
      \ oil off Thasos island and a planned drilling activity 11 miles east of the\
      \ island, was recognized as illegal and provocative by the Turkish Government.\
      \ The crisis escalated quickly and military forces of both countries were set\
      \ on the highest alert level while Political and Military leaders of both countries\
      \ threatened to use armed force if obstructed by the other.\_<br><br><br>The\
      \ crisis was ended when international pressure was\_increased (mainly from other\
      \ NATO allied countries)\_and Britain's\_Lord Carrington, the Secretary General\
      \ of NATO, urged Greece and Turkey to avoid the use of force and offered to\
      \ act as a mediator.<br>\_<br>Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayip Erdgogan recently\
      \ unveiled his plans for a wider role of Turkey in the Region and the expansion\
      \ of the country's sphere of influence even outside its physical borders.\_\
      <br>September 2, 2019 Turkish Prime Minister makes clear his intentions as he\
      \ presents his Mavi Vatan (Blue Motherland) plan. Based on this claim, Turkey\
      \ does not recognize officially\_Exclusive Economic Zone rights to any Greek\
      \ island close to Continental Turkey, thus claiming that half the Aegean Sea\
      \ and very large areas even over Libya are part of its own Exclusive Economic\
      \ Zone. The newly elected Greek government issues a protest.\_<br><br>December\
      \ 5, 2019: The Turkey-Libya EEZ\_Agreement is announced and days after, Turkey\
      \ submits it officially in the UN.<br>Greece reacts by declaring it as invalid.\
      \ Given the ongoing civil war, Turkey makes it public that will assist the GNA\
      \ (Government of National Accord) militarily.<br>\_<br>January 17, 2020: Greece\
      \ reacts by inviting General Haftar, leader of LNA (Libyan National Army) for\
      \ talks before his trip in Germany ahead of another round of peace talks.<br><br>February\
      \ 2020: Turkey is facing increasing casualties in the Syrian front as the Syrian\
      \ Army with the support of Russia is launching a series of counterattacks north.33\
      \ Turkish soldiers die in a single air raid.<br><br><br>February 28, 2020: Turkey\
      \ reacts by declaring that all restrictions on the land borders with Greece\
      \ are lifted and all immigrants are free to cross. In fact, key members of the\
      \ Turkish Government make no secret that their aim is to blackmail EU for financial\
      \ aid and destabilise the Greek Government. This escalates into a show of will\
      \ as Greece declares its firm position not to allow any trespassers and mobilises\
      \ Border Guards, Police, and Army while receiving token reinforcements from\
      \ Poland, Austria and Italy. \_<br><br><br>March 20, 2020: Greece has managed\
      \ to protect what considers to be European borders by having successfully blocked\
      \ any trespassing attempts that were supported by Turkish police. Rumours regarding\
      \ the impact of Covid-19 in Turkey start circulating while Greece is facing\
      \ a second major crisis and announces a general lock-down.\_<br><br><br>April\
      \ 22, 2020: Drill ships Fatih &amp; Yavuz and research vessels Barbaros and\
      \ Orucreis continue their activities inside what Cyprus considers to be their\
      \ EEZ. They are escorted by a number of ships of Turkish navy with UAV support\
      \ .Greek foreign ministry condemns this as an act of piracy. This action takes\
      \ place while Turkey sees mounting losses due to Covid-19, Turkish lira on a\
      \ free fall and oil prices so low that drilling is not viable.<br><br><br>May\
      \ 2020: Greece is highly regarded as the country that managed to win the fight\
      \ against the pandemic. There are ongoing talks as to the size of EE financial\
      \ help ranging in the tune of \_ \u20AC15-25Bn. Turkey runs a campaign to declare\
      \ themselves Covid-19 free that backfires massively as the EU declare it not\
      \ a safe place.<br>More than 80% of companies in the hospitality sector declare\
      \ bankruptcies. Following that, a wave of nationalisation of bankrupt companies\
      \ follows that only stretches further the already stretched Turkish economy.<br><br><br>June\
      \ 08, 2020: Unofficial discussions between Turkey and the International Monetary\
      \ Fund are leaked. Part of that, mentions what most suspect about the number\
      \ of victims due to Covid-19 and the terrible situation of the Turkish economy.\

    review: "\nHeavily biased towards Greece. Developers really had a great chance\
      \ to make a realistic war scenario however they failed miserably I would say\
      \ like I was playing the Greek side and I literally didn\u2019t have to do anything\
      \ the pre made adjustments did the all work for me not to mention  the  pentagon\
      \ like defended Greek islands with atacms on them how unrealistic this could\
      \ be or how inconveniently placed ballistic missiles of the Turks like I though\
      \ I would be playing balanced war scenario I think it would be better to give\
      \ Greek side a buff so when I play them I can conquer as far as India just like\
      \ alexander the great ffs\u2026\n"
