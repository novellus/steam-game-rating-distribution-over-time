    review: 'Could be really good but it''s way too hard.  It''s hard to pick up the
      kana when you''re getting beat up.  I''m on level 3 and there are these boxer
      type guys that are WAY too hard.  I''m constantly getting bounced between mobs
      and dying.  It''s also unfair that the mobs seem to have a further attack range
      than me.  I have to be right up on them while they can be like 5ft away.  Very
      often we will attack at the same time and I get hit but they don''t.


      I don''t see myself getting past level 3 unfortunately.'
