    reviews: "\u201CFor a point and click adventure game, Zeus Quest will please even\
      \ the most skeptical of you. With comedy and humorous situations being its strong\

      \ with characters and every funny dialogue is pure gold.\u201D<br>4/5 \u2013\

      \ I can heartily recommend Zeus Quest Remastered as a brilliant addition to\

      Clearly, Zeus Quest Remastered offers an adventurous and brainstorming way to\
      \ spend your leisure. It also depicts a legendary epic figure of the Zeus the\
