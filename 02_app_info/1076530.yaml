    review: 'This game focuses more on telling a story rather than giving out traditional
      game play. Player actions are clicking to move character and interact with the
      few things available for interactions. The story reminds me of the short animated
      film "The House of Small Cubes" by Kunio Kato, and although I didn''t exactly
      understand all of it, I enjoyed it and got a general sense of what was trying
      to be told. While some have complaints about the lack of dialogue and sound,
      I did not see this as an issue especially during the emotional cut scenes where
      I can only be left speechless both from trying to understand what was happening
      and from the surprising amount of emotions a 2D, soundless game could make me
      feel.

      On top of all of that, this game is only $1, and $0.50 on sale. If you don''t
      want to spend the money to enjoy this story, I would recommend the film "The
      House of Small Cubes" that I mentioned earlier, but these are two different
      experiences. I think this game allows for more interpretations and I liked it
      more than the film, but to each their own.'
