    about_the_game: "Elyrion is Polytopia\u2019s second Special Tribe! Emerging from\
      \ isolation in a mystical forest, the Elyrion will stop at nothing to uncover\
      \ the magical secrets of the Square. The Elryion are known for surrounding themselves\
      \ in the magic of the forests, using their powers to lure woodland denizens\
      \ to their Sanctuaries for profit, bargain with awesome dragons, and enchant\
      \ animals into soldiers to help them fight.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnlike the other\
      \ tribes, the Elyrion have a unique style of gameplay. First, the Elyrion get\
      \ markers in the Fog of War showing where ruins are, meaning they don\u2019\
      t need to scout as much for them. Also, the Elyrion consider nature divine,\
      \ and their worship of nature prevents them from deforestation for a quick profit\
      \ or hunting animals for food. Instead, the Elyrion can build Sanctuaries, which\
      \ will provide resources based on the amount of adjacent animals. The Elyrion\
      \ are also unable to harvest whales for resources, and instead will use their\
      \ magic to transform them into the fearsome Navalon, which can obliterate a\
      \ navy single handedly! In addition to whales, the Elyrion can enchant animals\
      \ in their territory into Polytaurs, which can be used to supplement an army\
      \ or work as part of an early game rush. Lastly, the Elyrion don\u2019t get\
      \ Giants, but get flying Dragons, instead, which must grow up from an egg before\
      \ they can be used.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you like tribes that are against the\
      \ grain from what you\u2019re used to, or you simply want to fly on the back\
      \ of a majestic Fire Dragon, then the Elyrion are the tribe for you!"
