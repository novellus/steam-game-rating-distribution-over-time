      a half years since the Steam release, Close Your Eyes returns for its 5-year
      anniversary with a complete remake. The remake has been redone from the ground
      up, capturing the ominous feel of the original but with a ton of brand new content,
      an updated look, various alterations and additions, and a plethora of bonus
      modes and goodies.<br><br><i>Close Your Eyes -Anniversary Remake-</i> includes:<br><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li><u>Close Your Eyes</u>: The uprising cult hit about an adorable
      murderer bound by their past, brought into question by a strange game show host,
      returns in a brand new way! Completely remade from the ground up, it includes
      new locations, brand new threats, extended story, 10 possible endings, and a
      delve into an atmospheric abyss that may linger with you long after you beat
      it.<br></li><li><u>Girl''s Graveyard</u>: The predecessor to Close Your Eyes
      has also been remade and included! The maddening arcade-styled game about a

      Your Eyes - Beneath the Surface</u>: A brand new scenario where Marshmallow
      Monk must dig deep to find a hidden truth... Explore a strange explorable urban
      setting for a chilling experience that may leave you sinking into the murkiness
      of an unseen horror.<br></li><li><u>Close Your Eyes Anniversary Mode</u>: A
      brand new mode which remixes Close Your Eyes with even more new scenes, challenges,
      and an extended story. Unlike the main game, there''s only one ending to achieve
      in Anniversary Mode, but the route to that ending is unlike anything you''ve
      experienced before.<br></li><li><u>Girl''s Graveyard Challenge Mode</u>: Are
      you a masochist? Taking place after the events of Girl''s Graveyard as a sequel
      of sorts, Challenge Mode is not for the weak of heart. Can you overcome all
      odds and reach the shocking finale?<br></li><li><u>Three Other Bonus Modes</u>:
      There''s even more to experience between three bonus shorter modes to unlock,
      &quot;The Twisted Puzzle&quot;, &quot;Hushed Hour&quot; and &quot;A Ghastly
      Tale&quot;.<br></li><li><u>Unlock the Secrets of the Annex</u>: As you make
      progress in all of the game modes, you will begin to unlock more content in
      a new hub world known as the Annex. The Annex holds many secrets...</li></ul><br>You''re

    review: I look forward to the completed product of this game. The old version
      of Close Your Eyes is without a doubt one of my favorite indie games out there,
      especially in terms of story. I am happy that this remake, which also contains
      so much more than the original game to the point that one could call this a
      sequel (which it may be, who knows!), was made. I am more than happy to buy
      this game (while the old one was free, I would have absolutely paid to play
      it) and as said before, I am eagerly anticipating the next update to this game.
