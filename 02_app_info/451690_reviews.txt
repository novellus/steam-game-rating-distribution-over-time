Add to it symphonic music that is both soothing and easy on the ears, and you've got a great experience to learn and play chess.  You can decide to play the computer or go online and find someone to play against.  If you find someone online that's really good, you can ask questions, and they will usually try to help you learn better moves and counter moves.  I love that part of the game's community.\n\nPlay is definitely spotty on Linux, so I don't play it when I'm logged into my Linux system but it's perfect on Windows.","timestamp_created":1608835595,"timestamp_updated":1608835595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r9+Ey/YCeafsvAI="}
