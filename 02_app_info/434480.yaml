    review: 'I want to like it.  I really do.  And for a student project, it is excellent.  The
      team should be proud of their work.


      TL;DR: only focuses on addition skills, a bit boring for an adult, not entirely
      polished


      The good:

      -It''s great practice for addition.

      -The difficulty scales with spell power or quest.

      -There''s plenty of rewards to keep someone playing.

      -It''s linear, so it''s difficult to get lost for too long.


      The bad:

      - It is painfully obvious that English is not the native language of the developers.  "In"
      and "on" were misused a couple of times.  In/on/at can be tricky for ESL''ers
      (some languages combine these words).  This is a relatively easy, though tedious,
      fix.  I doubt it would hurt the developing language skills of children, but
      it may be a bit confusing.

      - I''m forced to play a male character.  I could input my name, but not choose
      my gender.  This may have been something that was planned but never implemented.  It
      may have been too much work to include.


      The ugly:

      -I don''t expect it to get as much play time as other games.  The linear story
      line doesn''t seem to branch, so it would be the same story every single time.  I
      don''t think choices really matter much.

      -I find it boring.  Neat, but boring.  I''m not sure I''d be really engaged
      in the game if a child was playing it nearby.


      If I get the opportunity I''ll try to a kid to play with me.  That way I could
      get more accurate feedback -- it *was* designed for kids afterall.  But as it
      is, I wouldn''t recommend it to parents for kids.'
