      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Game Description:</h2>-NavalArt is a sandbox game that combines\
      \ design, construction, physics, and combat, offering players a variety of experience\
      \ in different stages. Players will play as designer, engineer, and commander,\
      \ respectively, and guide their fleets through the ages of steel and nerve.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Gameplay</h2>-As a player, you will construct your warships\
      \ in dock, using parts offered by the game. Through careful placing and adjusting\
      \ the parts, you can shape your warships to anything you like.<br><br>-You can\
      \ take unfinished/newly finished ships for trials, and see if it is satisfactory.\
      \ Command your warships and progress through the campaigns to earn rewards!<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Game History</h2>-The idea of the game came from the unfinished\
      \ IOS-based BattleshipCraft developed by Phyzios, Japan. In 2017, a group of\
      \ programmers in China re-created the game using unity3d (in which the later\
      \ developer of NavalArt played a major role), and re-named Process the Battleship.\
      \ In determination of delivering the most engaging gameplay with the richest\
      \ content of the kind, the dev started over and crafted the NavalArt.<h2 class=\"\
