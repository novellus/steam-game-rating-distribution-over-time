    about_the_game: "Blackbox is an emotional rollercoaster ride through the childhood\
      \ memories of Sami, a Syrian boy, who shares personal stories of happiness and\
      \ joy intertwined with unspeakable moments of sadness and remorse. The story\
      \ takes place in the ruins of his home, where you the observer, interact with\
      \ Sami to uncover hidden childhood memories of playing with friends in his grandmother\u2019\
      s neighborhood. It\u2019s a story of hope for the 2.3 million children like\
      \ Sami that have been displaced as a result of the Syrian Civil War. It also\
      \ shines light on the dark childhood memories that each kid like Sami carries\
      \ forward as they look to resettle and rebuild their lives. Sami\u2019s story\
      \ ends with successful passage and entry into a refugee camp where he will begin\
      \ the next chapter of his life. Directed and produced by the TRT World R&amp;D\
      \ Labs team, the Blackbox narrative is the result of extensive research and\
      \ interviews with social aid workers, psychologists, journalists and refugees\
      \ themselves."
