This took me around 30 minutes to beat. I spent some extra time trying to get achievements which seemed either locked or broken. Only the first achievement seemed to work.\n\nI played the game with a mouse and the controls were very simple. The level rotates either left or right based on which side of the level you are on. The game design is novel and levels are moderately fun, though some levels feel like they have unintended solutions.\n\nCurrently the user interface is cryptic with very few words. Navigating the menu seems harder than it should. Additionally, in the area for level select there seems to be space for many new levels to be made. This along with oddly named achievements (placeholders I assume) make the game seem like it is either unfinished or in the process of being updated.\n\nUltimately this game is mostly fun, but due to being short and the issues listed above I would not recommend this game. If these issues do not bother you then feel free to check this out.","timestamp_created":1593388278,"timestamp_updated":1593388278,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545986950397491455","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj/TV/vICePeWkQI="}
