After playing it for about 10 minutes I was pritty dissapointed. The game completely lacks content, the only thing you do is use the same spell (press trigger) over and over again to shoot the same monster over and over again until you die and repeat it all.\n\nThis doesn't mean though that the game has no potential, if the developers add a story mode, unlockable spells, wands, new maps it can actually be a pritty interesting game. The graphics look fine and the spell from the wand looks quite cool.\n\nEven though the game has potential I would definitely wait with buying this one, as it's just not worth €8, I'd say closer to €1 / €2 in it's current state. (Maybe not even worth any money as of right now)\n\nEDIT:\nAfter checking the Unity asset store I found out that this game is actually completely an asset flip.","timestamp_created":1529152576,"timestamp_updated":1529345847,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47bWHiuQCc6+QowE="}
