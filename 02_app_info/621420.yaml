      \ has a simple riff: Guard a peaceful village of wool-making sheep from the\
      \ thuggish wolf Linnux (Lewis Black) and his rabid pack. To avoid distractions,\
      \ mastiff leader Khampa (J.K. Simmons) forbids all music from the mountain,\
      \ but when Khampa's son Bodi (Luke Wilson) discovers a radio dropped from a\
      \ passing airplane, it takes just a few guitar licks for his fate to be sealed:\
      \ Bodi wants to be a rock \u2018n' roll star. Yet that means defying his father's\
      \ wishes, heading to the city, and locating the legendary \u2014 and reclusive\
      \ \u2014 musician Angus Scattergood (Eddie Izzard), who needs to write a new\
      \ song and fast. If Bodi can put a band together, help Angus with his song,\
      \ and defeat the wolves' plot to take Snow Mountain, his life will be in tune.\
      \ Bodi will become what he's always dreamed of being: More than a dog\u2026\
      more than a Rock God\u2026he'll be a ROCK DOG!"
