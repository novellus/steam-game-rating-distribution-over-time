    review: Ok so as a retro 8 bit fanatic I can tell you this is an amazing game
      has perfect graphics and gameplay. The only problems it suffers from are typical
      of these retro based new age games. WIth new age devs as much as I wish they
      were from the golden age they aren't so will add new age stuff to these games.
      The thing with this game and I bought it for IOS is that it is a clicker game.
      You just either tap on phone or click on screen. No control pad for phone and
      no aswd movement for pc. I am still playing but it was a 12/10 star game now
      it's about a 6/10 purely because of lack of options. I don't think I can recommend
      this not because  isn't amazing not because it isn't awesome but because when
      it was me who was being recommended instead I got super excited just to get
      shot down after buying the game. All over no adding controls.
