      \ /><br>Mars has been colonized. Now, Earth's greatest corporate titans have\
      \ been invited to build companies to support it. The competition to dominate\
      \ the market is fierce in this fast-paced economic RTS from Civilization IV\
      \ lead Designer, Soren Johnson.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Venture to Mars\
      \ to Earn Your Fortune</strong></h2>With space travel becoming a reality and\
      \ the easy-to-reach resources on Earth dwindling, hopeful people seeking their\
      \ fortune are rushing to the next great frontier: Mars. Rekindle humanity\u2019\
      s adventurous spirit by leaving Earth behind and make a new name for yourself\
      \ as a titan of industry on the red planet.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Discover\
      \ the Origin of the Major Martian Businesses</strong></h2>Determine the fate\
      \ of the Martian colonization effort in the dynamic single-player campaign mode.\
      \ Multiple types of CEOs, each with unique traits and abilities, deliver many\
      \ hours of discovery into their motivations and how they intend to dominate\
      \ the future of Mars.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Experience New Adventure in\
      \ Multiplayer</strong></h2>Turn your friends into frenemies! With a robust and\
      \ exciting multiplayer mode that can support up to eight players, no two games\
      \ of Offworld Trading Company are the same! The market fluctuates depending\
      \ on which of the four starting corporations you and your opponents choose and\
      \ what resources you accumulate. Strategy is key, and tenuous alliances between\
      \ rivals are easily broken when the opportunity arises.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      ><strong>Control the Market before your Competition Controls You</strong></h2>In\
      \ Offworld Trading Company, market forces are your weapons, not guns or bombs.\
      \ The real-time player driven market is your sword and your shield here. In\
      \ order to win, you will need to make tough choices on what resources to acquire,\
      \ what goods to build and sell, how to interact with the planet's thriving underworld,\
      \ and what stocks to acquire and when. With over a dozen different resources\
      \ available and a constantly changing market economy, no two paths of victory\
      \ are alike -- each game holds a different \u201Ckey\u201D to dominating your\
      \ competition.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Enjoy a Rich Soundtrack from a Grammy\
      \ Award Winning Composer</strong></h2>Transport yourself to Mars and immerse\
      \ yourself in the battle for big business with an incredible soundtrack from\
      \ composer Christopher Tin (Baba Yetu, Civilization IV). This retro-futuristic\
      \ score mixes orchestra instrumentals, piano, and synthesizers while utilizing\
      \ unique pitch-dives and other electronic treatments. All of these unique elements\
      \ gives Offworld a truly otherworldly tone. Check out the full interview here:\

    review: You'll enjoy the cutthroat nature of this game. Has a slight learning
      curve but it's easy to learn how to do exceptional in the game. Lots of ways
      to make money, but you need to find the best way to increase your profits while
      ensuring the enemy isn't getting too close. You'll have to be dynamic and be
      ready to throw away some of your hard work in order to beat the enemy. Highly
      recommended!
