The end result is a curious roguelike unlike any other.\n\nBattles are a scant three turns long, but by collecting energy from destroyed enemies you can do more moves during your turn. With each move you can travel directly to any tile within range, and a thick line shows if you'll collide with any hazards. As you destroy enemies and collect their scrap (currency), your reputation (score) improves. This lowers prices in the shop, but also makes stronger enemies appear in battle.\n\nThere are several ships to try, each with it's own method of attacking enemies. Different environments also add wrinkles to the gameplay. Solor winds push all ships after each turn. Storms randomly lower ships' energy. Nebulas are shrouded in darkness. And meteors can be used as cover.\n\nUnfortunately, the visuals can get very cluttered. Multiple ships/projectiles can occupy one tile, and some land between tiles. They all move simultaneously, and all actions happen in about half a second. Some bullets look similar to energy, and it's difficult to tell which direction some bullets face. The interactable scrap/meteors don't contrast with those in the background. Put all this together, and half the challenge is just reading the current gamestate.\n\nTo make things worse, the game explicitly refuses to tell you about its many enemy types. Combined with the visual clutter, learning enemies is a painful process of trial-and-error. And yet, once the learning is complete, NEXT JUMP manages to provide a moderately fun tactics game with interesting systems, at a very low price point.\n\nTaking everything into account, I rate this game [b]7/10[/b]. If the visuals were cleaner and the level design was less procedural, this could've very well been a 9/10.","timestamp_created":1576447786,"timestamp_updated":1578620451,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505547523498535156","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i4/Hxu8CdOjO5AE="}
