It starts out nicely enough, but by stage 3 and onward, it becomes just repeating frustration of trial and error.  \n\nThe \"observation\" mini-game is okay at first, then it starts to sprinkle random crap to make it confusing.  Luckily, there are power-ups to skip this.  Then comes the worst part: the level design.  These are some of the most irritating level designs I've seen.  And once I've started to feel like I am getting used to it, the game throws in more stupid obstacles that makes it even more frustrating.  As a matter of fact, \"frustration\" is the word that keeps popping into my head while playing this.  Any semblance of fun that could be had in this game is overwhelmed by repeated frustration.\n\nBut you know what's worse than a bad game?  A bad game that is needlessly long.  By stage 6, I just wanted to beat this game and move on.  But it kept going.  I knock out one frustrating level, and then there was another one, and another one, and another until I am completely fed up with it.  I tend to forgive a lot of things for anime tiddies, but even that has limits.\n\ntl;dr There's no fun here, just frustration.","timestamp_created":1601441711,"timestamp_updated":1601442007,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/bjY7vQCd6D6pAI="}
