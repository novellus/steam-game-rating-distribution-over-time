      \ about striking deadly chain lightning spell to see who gets the last laugh?\
      \ And why not morph yourself into a fire breathing dragon to turn the whole\
      \ place to dust? That is what you can just do in \u201CWicked Witches\u201D\
      .<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou incarnate an evil witch on her path to become the scariest\
      \ of them all, leaving nothing behind but villagers screaming to death! You\
      \ choose your own way to achieve your goal by casting deadly spells, enchanting\
      \ the environment or morphing yourself into terrible forms! Oh and whoever says\
      \ witches says flying on a broomstick, you will of course be able to fly on\
      \ your broomstick as well any time you want!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this third\

    review: This game is enjoyable to play. It is almost like the Destroy All Humans!
      game, causing havoc and destroying everything in sight in open world areas.
      The downside is clunky controls, flying, and aim. I never got past Witch's House
      3 level which is incredibly difficult, but aside from that the game is fun to
      play.
