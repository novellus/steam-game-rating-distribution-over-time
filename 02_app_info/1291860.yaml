      \ In its underbelly, Seneca's criminals, and worse, are finding homes and lairs\

      \ You're released from jail under questionable circumstances. You seek to clear\

      \ and former colleagues, you open and run a private security agency that hires,\

      \ available to you from agents, modern surveillance technology, friends in high\
