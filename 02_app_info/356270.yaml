    about_the_game: <strong>Cuban Missile Crisis</strong> is a real-time strategy
      game combined with a global turn-based tactical mode, thrusting gamers into
      a world ravaged by the military-political confrontation between the USA and
      USSR in 1962. <br><br>Cuban Missile Crisis offers an alternative interpretation
      of the events that followed the infamous nuclear stand off between the United
      States and Cuba. As the stalemate collapsed, the two superpowers unleashed their
      nuclear arsenal on the world, levelling its metropolitan expanses and leaving
      scorched radioactive deserts. The cities that managed to survive the disaster
      realised that the most precious resources were now clean earth and water. The
      remaining world citizens found themselves in a war fighting for their very survival.
      <br><br>Cuban Missile Crisis provides an interesting mix of real-time battles
      and a turn-based global strategy mode, forcing players to use tactical troop
      movements while managing resources and armies. Conquer new resources, track
      new borders, create a new map of the world.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><br><ul
