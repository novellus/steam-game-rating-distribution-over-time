    review: 'Firts of all it is not a horror movie, but a drama. It tells the story
      of man (Diego) haunted by his healing gift and the separation of his daughter,
      and a woman (Hillary) that is confused about his marriage and the feelings about
      his daughter. It is nice movie although slow,and it has some beautiful views
      from caribbean islands. The end it is good, and the untranslated spanish dialogues
      are not important to the main story. For 50 c, it was a bargain.

      That guy that always play bad guys in action movies was put in the movie just
      to call the audience. His participation has some 5 minutes in the movie, although
      it is an important part.'
