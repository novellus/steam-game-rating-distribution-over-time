    review: 'Fun old school coaches. The models of the interior and the people within
      are hilariously bad in noclip mode, but everything else seems to be detailed
      enough. Comes with 1st class, 3rd class, brake/luggage, and even comes with
      slip coaches. If you''re a fan of these coaches, I''d say give them a try. They''re
      certainly better than any 3rd party add-on.


      Pro tip, RH and LH just means which way they start out facing. If you want composite
      to have first class first in Quick Drive, just use RH. If you want the brake+3rd
      class coach to have luggage at the end, just use LH.'
