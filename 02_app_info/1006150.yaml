    review: "After streets of rage 3 and streets of rage 4 It was The BEST Beat em\
      \ up Video game :D\nHey Developer Please Return back to this project!\nThe Bugs\
      \ Are a few But it doesnt even matter the gameplay is nice.\nFor those people\
      \ who are talking about assets.\nYes they are published but you have to pay\
      \ for it and also I think they doesnt had a modeler for this game.\nWhat This\
      \ game needed :\n\nOnline Skirmish (It already has a local Skirmish u can play\
      \ with your friend with one keyboard or one keyboard and joystick so dont worry\
      \ for the joystick u both can play in one keyboard).\n\nOnline story.\n\nLocal\
      \ Co-op story.\n\nMore stories.\n\nMore Characters.\n\nWhat game already has\
      \ : \nSkirmish ( Local co op and solo ) \nstory mode( solo but I think one campaign\
      \ can be co op too idk i'll edit it when i finished that.) \nSome cool characters\
      \ that you can buy with coins that u earn in game (Skirmish and finishing one\
      \ epsoide of story mode)\nSome Cool enemies.\nCool combos\nCool songs and sound\
      \ effects.\nand i think its based on streets of rage\n\nThe only bad thing is\
      \ this game isnt online and maybe 2- 4 local player support would make it better?\
      \ \nAnyway \nI suggest it.\n"
