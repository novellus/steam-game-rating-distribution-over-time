    about_the_game: "As small mixed traffic branch locomotives, the Great Western\
      \ Railway\u2019s Prairies were diminutive workhorses of the railway network,\
      \ and are now available for Train Simulator from Victory Works.<br><br>The 2-6-2\
      \ tank engines were introduced to the GWR in 1904 with the 4400 Class, primarily\
      \ for use on the railway\u2019s numerous hilly branch lines. Only 11 of the\
      \ class were built before the production of its successor, the 4500 Class \u2013\
      \ the same in design but with larger driving wheels, giving the locomotive extra\
      \ speed and therefore more widely used on the GWR network.<br><br>Between 1927\
      \ and 1929, a further 100 small Prairies were built with larger 1,300 gallon\
      \ water tanks, and were allocated the Class number 4575. A number of these locomotives\
      \ were fitted with equipment to run push-pull trains with autocoaches, which\
      \ saw them pressed into service on lines through South Wales.<br><br>Withdrawal\
      \ of the Prairies began in the late 1950s and by the mid-1960s all had been\
      \ assigned to the scrapyard. However, three 45xx Class and 11 4575 Class locomotives\
      \ were saved and many run today on preserved railways around the UK.<br><br>The\
      \ GWR Small Prairies for Train Simulator, developed by Victory Works, are available\
      \ in a variety of GWR and BR liveries \u2013 GWR Green and BR Black, plus BR\
      \ Green (45xx Class and 4575 Class) and a fictional red livery for the 4575\
      \ Class.<br><br>Three operating modes await drivers \u2013 simple, standard\
      \ and advanced \u2013 each with their own style of driving and features for\
      \ the novice and expert drivers. An abundance of detailing can also be found\
      \ on each locomotive, including realistic wheel slip, simulated steam chest,\
      \ operable cab doors, windows and hatches and 3D fireboxes. The 4575 Class can\
      \ also be set with optional auto-gear to make it fully compatible with Victory\
      \ Works\u2019 GWR Class 14xx autocoaches.<br><br>A number of freight wagons\
      \ are also included with the locomotives, including fruit vans, covered goods\
