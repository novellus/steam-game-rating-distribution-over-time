    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Open World Tactics</h2><br>Frozen Synapse\
      \ 2 brings you classic tactical gameplay with a new twist:  it's set within\
      \ a vast procedurally generated city.  We're calling it &quot;open world tactics&quot;\
      \ - a combination of grand strategy and simultaneous-turn-based combat.<br><br>In\
      \ single player, Frozen Synapse 2 tasks you with defending the city of Markov\
      \ Geist against an array of threats from within and without. Set up bases, deploy\
      \ your forces and then enter any building or engage a target anywhere on the\
      \ map: you define your own strategy.<br><br>When you're ready to take tactical\
      \ control, the camera will zoom down to your units, enabling you to make your\
      \ plan and test it out.  When you hit the &quot;Prime&quot; button, your moves\
      \ are locked in and you must see how they play out against your opponent's plan.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">The City</h2><br>The city is a living system, with many AI-controlled\
      \ factions vying for control and conducting their own nefarious business.<br><br>Choose\
      \ to collaborate or betray, rob banks, assasinate political leaders or establish\
      \ a delicate diplomatic accord: it\u2019s up to you.<br><br>Investigate the\
      \ mysterious force which is making incursions into the city while trying to\
      \ establish your own power base in this complex and treacherous futuristic world.\
      \  Follow the extensive story or abandon it to forge your own path: it's up\
      \ to you.<br><br>You'll meet factions like the financial manipulators Diamond\
      \ Brothers or the hacker collective GUEST as you navigate the political landscape.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Multiplayer</h2><br>Frozen Synapse 2 features classic multiplayer\
      \ modes from the original game as well as new ways to outwit your opponents,\
      \ like the thrilling instant action of One Turn mode: commit your plan and see\
      \ how it plays out against a range of oppositions from players all around the\
      \ world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New Features</h2><br>Frozen Synapse 2 adds many\
      \ new units like the Flamethrower, Minigun, Knife and Smoke Grenade.<br><br>Curved\
      \ walls and new objects like trees, rocks and cars allow for much more realistic\
      \ levels on a variety of scales, from a road intersection to an enormous shopping\
      \ mall.<br><br>New Focus Diamond mechanic allows you to take out tricky enemies\
      \ who insist on camping behind cover by predicting their location!<br><br>Vastly\
      \ improved AI makes for tense tactical battles and a host of UI improvements\
      \ mean that the planning process is slicker than ever before.<br><br>And of\
      \ course, there's a brand new soundtrack from nervous_testpilot!"

    review: 'I''m not going to lie i hate this game its just SOOOO BORING i love the
      idea of it but there is something about it what makes me want to jump into shark
      infested waters it has potential for sure i look forward  to the the next one
      Frozen synapse 3 so my friend can put a gun to my head and make me buy it again
      just so he has some one to play with. but all jokes aside its the most unbalanced
      game i have ever played i honestly would not recommend this to anyone any i
      would recommend any other turn based game other turn base game out there even
      if the only thing you got was a black screen at least you would have a fair
      game  '
