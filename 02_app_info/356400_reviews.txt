Like playing Super Meat Boy while being launched into space. Unfortunately, after 30 minutes your eyes start bleeding and the base game offers no way to adjust visual density or audio mix, which is incomprehensible to me in a game like this. Scores at the end of levels are a bit bogus. Thumper might be a fun endurance test for some, but can easily become an inaccessible nuisance for others.","timestamp_created":1609849764,"timestamp_updated":1609849764,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwir+h6fYCedLXwAI="}
