    review: Tried to land my ship in the beginning of the game.  Despite flying extremely
      slow, or at least, having that impression, the flight will give a lot of players
      nausea, even very experienced VR gamers.  After the 8th or 9th failed attempt
      to land, I gave up.  And if you have to create and publish a YouTube video so
      that the people starting with your (non-sim!) game are able to finishing the
      first task at hand, so they can continue your game, then something isn't right.  Can't
      recommend.
