{"814730":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Rogue Frontiers","steam_appid":814730,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"Spend what little money you have at the trading post and head out into the wilderness to stake your own claim on the land.  Hunt, fish, start a fire, cook a meal, make a shelter, and survive the elements.  Mother nature is not the only enemy as Native Americans, claim jumpers, outlaws, and several other hostile elements can make your life tough or end it.  Maintain good relationships with tribes and individuals to seek medical help, trade, and gather information.  Inflict harm on others and you will find yourself alone, or worse, hunted.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn Rogue Frontiers you explore an open world with nothing but will power and your own thoughts.  The game is based on the Rocky Mountains in the 1800s and every detail is as realistic as possible from the price of goods at the time, to the Native American tribes present, to the events that can affect your experience.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nStart out with a few basic tools and explore the wilderness.  Trap small animals, skin them, and trade with NPCs for money which you can then use to buy more advanced tools.  As you progress in the game you will be able to explore further, gain skills, and craft more complex items.  Eventually you will be able to create your own home in the mountains and expand further into the wilderness for unique adventures.","about_the_game":"Spend what little money you have at the trading post and head out into the wilderness to stake your own claim on the land.
