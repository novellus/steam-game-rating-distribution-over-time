    review: "5/10\n\nAlthough the base game (Xenoshyft) had a few bugs when myself\
      \ and a few friends tackled it, I still enjoyed cooperatively taking down the\
      \ Hive. I liked the unique divisions and the ability to help out my co-op partners\
      \ by playing instants and by adding troops to their lanes. The game was tough,\
      \ but required resourcefulness and felt rewarding to win. Unfortunately, the\
      \ divisions were not all equally powerful, and we found ourselves gravitating\
      \ repeatedly to divisions like Armor, Weapons, Science, and the Command Center.\
      \ We found the DLC divisions (Grafting, Psychogenics) to be especially weak.\n\
      \nAlthough Dreadmire adds a new enemy deck, items, troops, and an environmental\
      \ mechanic, it just doesn't feel very different than the base game to me. However,\
      \ I thought that the Resource Officer was a cool inclusion - an option in Wave\
      \ 2 to help you acquire items and instants. Although some of the new items and\
      \ troops are more powerful than those in the base game, many are not. This can\
      \ be a little bit of an issue with the new enemies you'll be facing. \n\nWith\
      \ Dreadmire, I never really found myself breathing a sigh of relief - every\
      \ enemy is just brutal. Almost every enemy you flip has an absolutely nasty\
      \ effect, from trampling damage onto the next troop in line, to stealing troops\
      \ from your graveyard that you then have to fight or turning killed troops into\
      \ enemies, or even repeatedly dealing direct damage to multiple troops.\n\n\
      We were able to beat Dreadmire on the normal difficulty, but we failed during\
      \ our hard run. I like the way that the divisions have been reworked for the\
      \ expansion, but still found a few to be better than the rest. As so many of\
      \ the enemies dealt direct damage and stole troops, we found it most beneficial\
      \ to pack our own direct damage, a lot of damage prevention, and to play as\
      \ many Flight Suit troops as possible (since these can be played instantly,\
      \ they can often dodge enemy effects). The Demolitionist was also a good option,\
      \ since it deals extra damage upon dying.\n\nAlthough the environmental effects\
      \ are probably the biggest change from the base game, we also found them to\
      \ be the most irritating. These effects always benefit the enemies more than\
      \ you, even if you've acquired items that deal an extra damage or prevent an\
      \ extra damage in certain conditions. They add another element of randomness\
      \ to an already random game. Did you draw a hard with a decent amount of cash?\
      \ What items are available during this particular game? What enemies did you\
      \ flip, and when? Now you also have to think about the random weather conditions,\
      \ and these can almost double the difficulty of some enemies.\n\nI like concept\
      \ of Xenoshyft very much. It's thematically cool, has a neat deck building mechanic,\
      \ can be played with friends, and demands cooperative attention. Unfortunately,\
      \ the game always felt too punishing for players to really experiment with all\
      \ the items and divisions available. Dreadmire doubles down on this issue, introducing\
      \ almost strictly more difficult enemies and only some stronger items and troops.\
      \ Therefore, you feel even more pressure to stick with certain divisions and\
      \ strategies. In other words, it doesn't matter how cool the ideas behind the\
      \ Psychogenics and Grafting divisions are if you can't win with them."
