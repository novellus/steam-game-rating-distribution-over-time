    review: As someone who's played the actual board game, this game is incredibly
      hard to navigate to take the various actions.  Additionally, the low description
      approach(usually that means 0 descriptions) allows for many frustrating moments.  Yet
      another developer who just had to port a board games to another platform, requiring
      no creative ability, and has somehow bungled it.
