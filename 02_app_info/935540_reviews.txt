How do you fullscreen? CAN you fullscreen? I never discovered the answer but I'm still convinced it's OUT THERE somewhere.\n\nSecond challenge, you pick up a flashlight, BUT how do you use it? Is it a button on your keyboard or does the flash light never work? AGAIN, I'm not sure if there is a proper answer.\n\nI'm left with metaphors, smoke and mirrors, more ambiguity than answers. A mystery that will haunt me til my dying day.\n\n10/10 PERFECT GAME","timestamp_created":1537856445,"timestamp_updated":1537856445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":22,"weighted_vote_score":"0.446369588375091553","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pOPYh+YCfvWvqwE="}
