      notes: The Light at the End of the Ocean contains discussions about depression
        and suicide (but nothing too graphic or explicit), implied homophobia, brief
        scenes taking place in a hospital, and generally a lot of sadness but with
        an ultimately positive true ending.

    reviews: "\u201CThe Light at the End of the Ocean is a story of friendship, identity,\
      \ and destiny couched in a delicate blend of modern, traditional, and classical\
      \ sensibilities. Despite taking place in one location, it reaches across time\
      \ and space to tell a story both nuanced and universal about the heartbreaks\
      \ that bring us to the most difficult of choices, all the paths we might have\
      \ taken in between, and finding a way to open ourselves to second chances.\u201D\
