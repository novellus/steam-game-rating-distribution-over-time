It took me some time to find what words to write for the review.  I thought this will be a Hidden Object Exploration game through the ship.  It isn't.  Fine by me.  I just really like to look up items for fun.  The game has multiple levels aboard the ship: \"Titanic II\".  With each start of the level, you will get facts about what happened on or about Titanic.  Afterwards you do your search and do puzzles (not every level will have a puzzle, especially when you return to it).  Then comes the story.  At first, I was just having fun and then without realizing, I tried to play the game as fast as I could so I could find out what happened next in the story + resolve the mystery!!!\n\nAfter all the trials and challenges and the last pages... you finally realize the following:  1.  You wish you didn't know what happened.  2.  You wish you could've done something about it.  3.  Wished for something better to happen.  BUT OKAY!  It is a tragic story after all... what did I expect?  Nothing... I came for enjoyment and stayed for some intense story line/mystery.\n\nWhile the ending was playing, I could barely remember what I did.  I vaguely do.  At last... the ending!  When later on it clicks that something good happened, it will probably overwrite the bad, but the bad will still feel pain in your chest, until you finally put it away or let it go.\n\nThat's... yeah... anyway... everything is said above... I appreciate the game and the intriguing story line!!! :> =) :3","timestamp_created":1600147744,"timestamp_updated":1600147744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0JyPyPQCf6P3oQI="}
