    review: "Out of the many boardgames I have played with in Tabletop Simulator,\
      \ Dawn of the Zeds is definitely one of the better ones. In this game of survival,\
      \ you are essentially trying to maintain order as throngs of victims that have\
      \ succumbed to the Zombie Epidemic Disease parade around the countryside. \n\
      \nThe game can be played at several levels - a Basic Game level that uses simple\
      \ instructions to help new players learn the game, to more advanced levels that\
      \ add in new rules and features to play with! There seems to be quite a bit\
      \ of luck involved in the game but it is certainly tempered quite a bit with\
      \ abilities to push things in your favor.\n\nI found the rules to be cumbersome\
      \ - and split across several sources to read, but overall a lot easier to get\
      \ through then other DLCs in Tabletop Simulator I have play, and much more indepth.\
      \ For the most part they were understandable, though I did notice an issue with\
      \ the Setup Instructions for the Level I: Outbreak! - which indicated certain\
      \ components as being there when they are actually apart of the subsequent level\
      \ Level II: Apocalypse!\n\nSomethings that I sort of dislike though is that\
      \ it seems to cater more to a singleplayer then other games - you can play with\
      \ game cooperatively but ultimately you don't really have any singleplayer that\
      \ you specifically control as other players (with your permission of course)\
      \ 'can' move your character around and make other actions.\n\nNonetheless it\
      \ is definitely a step above many other games I have played in Tabletop Simulator.\
      \ It even comes with a little bit of extra scripting - making setting up a game\
      \ so much less of a hassle, and letting you just play!\n\nRecommended!"
