    review: This chapter has a scary environment and is on the longer end of the time
      frame scale compared to all the other chapters. I really enjoyed the suspense
      in this chapter for example (mini spoiler) there was a section where there was
      a threat and you needed to find a key card to move the elevator to escape, and
      when I was trying to find the key card my heart was racing because of how intense
      the situation was. I would recommend this chapter to anyone interested in a
      great horror experience!
