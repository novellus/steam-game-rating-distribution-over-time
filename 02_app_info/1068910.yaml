    review: 'Surely not the more sophisticated Submarine game out there.

      But I must admit that it deserves a definite "thumbs up", for it''s pure simplicity
      and execution.

      When I was a kid in the early seventies, my mom would put quarters in a full
      size "Periscope" arcade machine at the train station.

      It reminds a bit of that big machine/unit.

      Submarine Attack is compatible on Windows 7, which is not mentioned in the system
      requirements (W-10 only).

      More importantly, It also functions perfectly with my Logitech F310 Gamepad/Controller.

      Button X= Mines.

      Button B= Torpedoes.

      Button A= Missiles.

      Left stick: Movements of sub.

      Tip: Dive deep in the beginning of certain missions.

      This way you can destroy "big" enemy sub(s) that dives much lower than you can
      do.

      So long Submariners...'
