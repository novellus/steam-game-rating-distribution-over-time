Almost all relics and blessings are just stat buffs, so the runs feel all the same\n- Jump mechanic feels very awkward. It is very hard to estimate where you are going to land and hard to steer mid-air. Platforming feels terrible. A dash-mechanic (which most other roguelikes go for) would probably have been better.\n- Bosses don't respawn. This is especially disappointing since the bosses are the main strength of this game. Not being able to replay them feels like a poor design decision.\n- Difficulty of rooms varies widely. Sometimes your run will just end because of a room full of mines with moving sawblades, several holes in the ground and a ton of enemies shooting at you. This kind of rng would not really be a problem if not for the next point.\n- I don't like that the in-run and out-of-run currencies are identical. This leads to me never buying any expensive items in-run since the run may be over anytime because of a very difficult room and i would rather save the gold for permanent upgrades. I understand that this is a deliberate design decision but i personally don't like it.\n\nConclusion:\nI am especially disappointed in this game because the core idea is really good (of course a lot is copied from Binding of Isaac), boss design is really cool and the game feels very polished (except the wonky jump mechanic). But the main point of a roguelike is having great replayability through different playstiles in different runs. Unfortunately, Undermine does not deliver this at all. If you are new to roguelikes, this game may be for you. Otherwise, i would rather play Hades, Dead Cells or Binding of Isaac.","timestamp_created":1609840497,"timestamp_updated":1609840497,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lpL+6PYCfNLTwAI="}
