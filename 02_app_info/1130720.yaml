    review: "Opinion:\nAnother game I bought during the sales, and the first thing\
      \ I want to make sure is that it's not worth your money! I was hoping for this\
      \ to be one of those old-school tower defense games, but it's not. \nThis game\
      \ has 30 levels, which all look the same. \nIt's a very active game, where you\
      \ need to spam your mouse buttons all the time. The defending of your tower/castle\
      \ only happens by you, spamming those buttons. There are a couple of things\
      \ you can upgrade, but they actually don't help you that much. Unfortunatly\
      \ this game lacks variation, which makes you want to quit it after probably\
      \ 5-10 levels.\n\nPro's:\n+ Certain amount of difficulty, which makes you need\
      \ to play the same level twice sometimes\n\nCons:\n- Not enough possible upgrades\n\
      - Too active (you need to be clicking ALL THE TIME)\n- Not enough variaton\n\
      \nWorth grinding for the achievements?:\nYes, it's a quick 100%, so go for it!\
      \ I do warn you that it's boring...\n\nPrice: \u20AC0.39 (Sales)\nWorth it's\
      \ money?: No\nOverall: 5/10"
