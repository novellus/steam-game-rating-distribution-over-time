Once I had the Unicorn rocket thing (one of each weapon), all the bosses became trivial, and I didn't care enough to fill out the achievements or even bother unlocking the last few buildings.\n\nAll combat was trivial very quickly, except that most times I came into contact with another object, I would very quickly (like in a second) have counted sufficient collisions to remove my shields and destroy my health. At least the enemies that are *supposed* to ram you die on collision, other things can take only one or two bullets, but eat *all* you health without noticing when rammed, scraped, or even touched at speed. Particularly annoying when this happened with spawns that you cannot *shoot*, but can collide with. Probably due to the weird momentum physics, which also show up when you have the booster. You can *brake* harder than you can boost, which makes it faster to turn by releasing the booster than boosting *against your current velocity*.\n\nThere was never really anything between of \"just spam bullets, the enemy shots are nearly impotent\" and \"you touched something solid, you're instantly dead\". I honestly never really wanted to fight anything, there just wasn't any reward to it (due to idle-game money scaling), nor even a feeling of accomplishment. Most of my deaths happened while boosting between planets upgrading buildings, and bouncing off an asteroid due to limited up/down vision range, or having something spawn directly in my path. In the end, I stopped playing because I didn't really want to play a 2D space version of Desert Bus.\n\nPicked it up with a massive discount, probably got my money's worth out of it by leaving it running continuously while I played other games, went to work, slept, etc. So probably six hours of play and 70 hours of background idling.\n\nThere's a New Game+ option, but since it says it resets all your stats, it's not clear how it's different from 'Delete my data'. And frankly, one round of this game was more than enough.","timestamp_created":1557309211,"timestamp_updated":1601737575,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pfm/9/QCfcXlwAE="}
