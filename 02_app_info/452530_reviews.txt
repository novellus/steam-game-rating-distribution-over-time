Since most of the game oriented towards late game/experienced players and zubmarine routes, buying this DLC makes sense. DLC adds some new places, stories, enemies, a new ambition and some new mechanics like current, sonar, mines, loots and abysses. Even though there are 11 new ports, it doesnâ€™t have more content than the base game of course. Although most of the new content are interesting, they are awfully short and independent from each other, or they have only one small connection. Moreover, most of the problems in base game consist; tedious gameplay, slow progression, no consequence or reward. Still, if you liked Sunless Sea, you will probably like this DLC too.","timestamp_created":1602145165,"timestamp_updated":1602145165,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534461915493011475","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47OPSg/UCdLrIpgI="}
