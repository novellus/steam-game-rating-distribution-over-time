It is balanced well and the netplay works well. It does take a bit of time to find a match during odd hours of the day.\n\nEDIT:\nThere is one big problem. The matchmaking makes your enemies all AI if you can't find a human opponent for a few minutes. There needs to be an toggle option implemented to wait as long till you find a human. I'd rather wait 10-15 mins then play an exclusively AI match.\n\nEDIT 2:\nAfter the full release and free weekend, while the playerbase is not huge, it consistently has a few hundred people playing at most hours of the day, which is good because very, very rarely do I have games with all AI players. Just make sure you are playing 3v3 (it is the most populated.)\n\nEDIT 3:\nWriting this as of 2021. The game hasn't been updated since my last edit and has been abandoned. To my knowledge, console has the biggest playerbase, but on PC it's essentially dead. I would not recommend buying this, really disappointed for the wasted potential as it was one of my favorite games ever when it was active.","timestamp_created":1524430686,"timestamp_updated":1609785506,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwja+s5/YCdbvongE="}
