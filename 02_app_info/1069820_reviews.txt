The 2 main story lines fit quiet well together, with most ending/solutions to the issues being satisfying, and making scene. Be a soldier, rebel, humanitarian, a monster, or a mix of all 4. There all options, leaving good replay ability. \n \nAgain, this is a short story, but that's not a fault, being more then able to convey a thrilling story. \n\nIf your looking for a quick read with a nice straight forward story, I'd say get it.","timestamp_created":1589158304,"timestamp_updated":1589158539,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.531615912914276123","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4793OgPICcf35hgI="}
