    about_the_game: "Duck Boy is a 2-d action platformer adventure game inspired by\
      \ the classics, Like Zelda II and The Battle for Olympus.  Controlling Duck\
      \ Boy, you'll navigate the mysterious land of Avenis on a personal quest for\
      \ treasure and glory!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nArmed with an ancestral knife, worn\
      \ treasure map, and his trusty Call, Duckboy will have to run, jump, and fight\
      \ his way past dangerous enemies and areas alike. Metroidvania elements put\
      \ a focus on discovery and exploration as Duck Boy navigates his way around\
      \ this strange and forbidden land. Combined with a classic-feeling difficulty,\
      \ you'll need a sharp eye and clever problem solving skills to survive. Each\
      \ enemy Duck Boy encounters fights in a unique fashion, demanding an adaptable\
      \ strategy and quick reflexes. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCrisp pixel-art and a limited\
      \ color pallet invoke a sense of nostalgia. Created with this in mind, a retro-game\
      \ feel is incorporated into every part of the game's design. Do you have what\
      \ it takes to unearth the mysteries of Avenis? Will you lead Duck Boy to the\
      \ valor of his birthright? Or will you fall like the many who have come before\
      \ you?"
