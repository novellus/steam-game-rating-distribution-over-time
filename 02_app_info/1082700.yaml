    review: 'I guess I am one of the first reviews and I can see why. This game is
      not worth the asking price.


      The game is pure nonsense. The self-awareness jokes are out of place and completely
      random.


      There is no pacing, at all. The game is unnecessarily obtuse and convoluted
      in almost every facet of its writing and aesthetic. All of the clashing elements,
      which feel intentional, do not function well together and make the game incredibly
      difficult to follow or mentally gel together. The designs of the characters
      do not factor into their personality or habits at all. They don''t even seem
      to have a point or theme behind them. Beyond their interpersonal conflicts with
      each other, they are just "wacky and random" much like the game itself.


      [spoiler] To give you an idea of how ridiculous this game is in terms of its
      pacing alone. One of the teachers is a craftsman who has somehow managed to
      create VR tech in this half post-apocalyptic world of multi time period settings
      [take that as you will]. This is introduced for a brief second in a scene, not
      explained and quickly tossed aside to have you listen to more nonsense. Then,
      in the second chapter/act, it turns out his VR tech is actually ripping a hole
      in space-time and causing the characters to really be entering other parallel
      worlds in the multiverse [which was not so subtlely joked about earlier on in
      the most unnaturally forced way]. Sh*t just happens like this every other scene
      with no rhyme or reason. No buildup. No explanation. Just nonsense. [/spoiler]


      I think the worst part is that this is supposed to be a visual novel, which
      tends to center around heavy involvement of the player character. You barely
      partake at all and for much of the early game spend a majority of the time being
      a background piece with no involvement beyond being a captive audience to the
      nonsense of the other characters. It is torture.


      This is one of the worst experiences I have ever had the displeasure of suffering
      and I do not wish this on my worst enemy. Most of my hours come from leaving
      this up in the background while I take breaks to not lose my sanity or from
      just staring at the screen struggling to process what the hell is going on.


      If you are reading this review, just go read anything on fanfiction.net I can''t
      believe I am saying this, but doing so would be a more comprehensive and fulfilling
      experience.


      At least the Goodbye Volcano High trailer was cohesive. All this game does is
      make me greatly reconsider whether or not we have all evolved as a species or
      if some of us literally animated straight out of the dumpsters people thought
      our teen moms dropped us into.


      Edit: Artwork isn''t bad, just wish it was more thematic or relevant or conducive
      to the characters. Game is occasionally funny, albeit inadvertently, as well.


      Edit 2: Finished the game. I stand by what I said. It is a colossal piece of
      sh*t.'
