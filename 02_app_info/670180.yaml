    review: "One of my favorite games when I was younger... along with its predecessor\
      \ the original Castle's Game.  Though I forgot just how fast paced it was. \
      \  You have to build up fast, or you will get conquered fast, because the AI\
      \ in this builds itself up very fast.   If you don't, you'll quickly find yourself\
      \ excommunicated from the Church and your Happiness level dropping fast.  \n\
      \nTo this day I feel the more modern and more advanced castle building games\
      \ like the Stronghold seriers for example, just can't compare to this .  Because\
      \ this Game, and its predecessor both have just enough randomness to keep them\
      \ challenging and interesting.  I can't help but wonder what a Castles III game\
      \ could have been like if this series had continued.  \n\nIt took me a few minutes\
      \ to remember how to do everything... a few, precious minutes... that the AI\
      \ used to stomp me in its gathering and army building.  By the time I remembered\
      \ how to do everything... the AI already had me surrounded and vastly out numbered\
      \ me.\n\nAll that said, this IS a Steam Port of an old early 90's game.   Its\
      \ 30 years old; originally marketed as an MS-DOS game, ported from a Pre-Microsoft\
      \ Windows Era (Windows is not even mention in its original \"specs\" as a \"\
      supported platform\")  to work on modern Windows based PC's.  So its not without\
      \ a few bugs... but its still fun and enjoyable for the sake of Nostalgia, just\
      \ be prepared for its ridiculously fast pace!"
