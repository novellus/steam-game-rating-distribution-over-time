    review: "No reviews yet?! Alright! Let me blow your mind with mine.\n\nI don't\
      \ fly in and out of this airport often. I bought it because I'm basically getting\
      \ rid of most default FSX airports and adding the add ons for a more realistic\
      \ touch while simming. \nGraphics wise, I don't really see a drop in it, even\
      \ while runnning payware things like the Majestic Dash8, REX textures, or the\
      \ Feelthere Embraer Jets (Which you can also get on steam now.) \nOn the ground\
      \ the airport looks nice as well. Approaching it is pretty with the mountain/volcano/oneofEarth'sbon3rs\
      \ to the side of the airport. \n\nIs it worth what it's being sold for? Ehhhhh.\
      \ Mostly yes. I say it would be nicer cheaper for most add ons but this one\
      \ for sure. It's very nice, worth getting if you are willing to spend the money\
      \ on it but not worth as much as it costs...so get it on sale if you want to\
      \ fly in and out of it every now and then."
