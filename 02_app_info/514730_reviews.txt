Uncover a plot to send humanity back to the Stone Age. Find a missing girl.  As an agent of HELP (I still question this choice of acronym), you can do anything and everything with the help - er, assistance - of your courage and ingenuity.\n\nAs long as you don't mind a \"retro\" sci-fi / secret agent plot that feels more like the 60s than the 90s, this is a fun HOPA game with lots to do in the way of HO scenes and puzzles.  Not the best out there, but entertaining nonetheless.\n\nPros:\n- variety of HO scenes\n- ability to return for missing collectibles and achievements via Extras\n- most of the voice acting is quite good (if I were a girl in a car about to be squished, I'd be more scared, but that's me...)\n- variety of puzzles (mostly on easier side, but some challenges)\n- fully interactive map\n- customizable difficulty\n\nCons:\n- no particular cons, but I didn't love the game (although some of the toys provided a real trip down memory lane!)\n- why are so many genius scientists embittered megalomaniacs?\n\nOverall:  It's a moderately good game in a moderately good series.  I prefer other Eipix games, but probably because they're prettier visually and have more memorable characters.\n\nNote:  The bundle includes three older-style HO games that are not HOPA games.","timestamp_created":1604957857,"timestamp_updated":1604957857,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.622937917709350586","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zqy81/UCdd22rQI="}
