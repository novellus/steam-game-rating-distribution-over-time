Here are my thoughts:\n\nThis game is simple in design but yet has a charm to it that makes it fun and enjoyable to play. The backgrounds for the stages are minimalistic in a good way, allowing for you to focus in on the character you're playing as, Hunter. The story is simple, because this game doesn't need much of an explanation for why you're doing what you're doing. It just wants to put you into a little world to explore and enjoy all the mechanics that the levels have to offer. And there are a lot of fun mechanics to discover, especially in Hard Mode, which basically makes the game an entirely new experience as it keeps the overall level setup, but adds new things to make parkouring more difficult. I would say Hard Mode is basically as hard as an average player playing Cuphead would be, but that's more or less \"what did you expect it's CALLED Hard Mode\". Yes, at times there are levels and mechanics specific to Hard Mode that feel unfair due to randomness, but otherwise it's a fun challenge.\n\nThe normal mode however is extremely fun for any casual gamer to play. The boomerang physics are fun to play around with, and is really THE thing that makes this game unique. It's a platformer, yes, but the addition of combo-ing with your boomerang and doing so by avoiding your own weapon is both a challenge but fun. The upgrades you get are balanced enough that you can really choose your favorite and stick to it. Other than the final upgrade for the boomerangs (which is objectively the best one due to what it is), the boomerangs you get until that point have equal upsides and downsides to them.\n\nAnd the music, well, it's an absolute banger of a soundtrack. I would play this game just to enjoy that alone. \nWith the new Full Screen (ReVamped) update, the backgrounds have more detail to them, without losing their simple-in-design charm. Even small things like all the dialogue through the signposts spread throughout the game are clever and funny. There are some bugs here and there due to the update, but I know that these will be fixed with time. The addition of color palettes for Hunter is a great way to reward the player and basically doubles the amount of time you'll spend playing the game.\nFor an indie game like this, it deserves a lot of credit. It's fun and challenging, as well as rewarding. \n","timestamp_created":1609710477,"timestamp_updated":1609710477,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47JOO5fYCe7KawAI="}
