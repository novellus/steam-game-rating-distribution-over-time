    review: I really love Piko's work, but this particular game I don't recommend,
      and I simply mean the game itself. The music is awful, the game lore is odd,
      the game design is awful (for example once you die, that's it--no lives or continues),
      and the beat 'em up style gameplay is simply mediocre for the genre.
