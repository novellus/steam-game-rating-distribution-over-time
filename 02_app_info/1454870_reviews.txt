The main issue I had with \"Tally Ho\" was that which stats were being checked by each choice was often very ambiguous to the point where it was basically blind guessing which choice was right, and strategizing was practically impossible\n\nThis cheat enabled an optional feature where basically I didn't have to worry anymore about getting really far into the story and making one \"wrong\" choice because it wasn't discernible which stat was being checked. So if you want a more relaxing playthrough, of you're playing more for the story than the challenge, or if the skill check system at all frustrated you in \"Tally Ho\", I would definitely recommend this DLC","timestamp_created":1605652204,"timestamp_updated":1605652204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnomV7PUCcbSCrwI="}
