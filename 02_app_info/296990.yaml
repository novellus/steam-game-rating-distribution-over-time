    review: "Some sort of crossover with [b]Frozen Synapse[/b] game that has pretty\
      \ similar concept with [b]Breach & Clear[/b]. Gameplay-wise, it'll still be\
      \ [b]Breach & Clear[/b], only now there'll be randomly generated maps, deep\
      \ soundtrack and simplified visuals from [b]Frozen Synapse[/b]. [b]DLC[/b] comes\
      \ with five missions long \u201Ccampaign\u201D that'll be available in all three\
      \ [b]Breach & Clear[/b] modes (\u201Ckill 'em all\u201D, \u201Cdisarm the bomb\u201D\
      \ and \u201Crush for the exit\u201D), bu-u-ut that'll be it. And it's not like\
      \ randomly generated maps will add much (those actually look better on paper\
      \ than they feel in the game).\n\nAs the result, this [b]DLC[/b] totally doesn't\
      \ worth [b]$3.99[/b] / [b]\xA32.79[/b]. It's pretty much more of the same, now\
      \ with simplified visuals. It won't prolong your experience with [b]Breach &\
      \ Clear[/b] much, it won't add much to the game, and there's still no proper\
      \ story. It's still totally playable, though, and there's nothing seriously\
      \ bad about it (hence the thumb up). It's just not worth paying extra for it.\
      \ You get it in a bundle, or something like that \u2013 you won't feel bad about\
      \ playing through it. At all. Quite the opposite, actually. But if you're short\
      \ on money, you may as well skip it. Just because there's not much to see here."
