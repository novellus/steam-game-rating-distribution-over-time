Unfortunately, this package didn't have what I was looking for.\n\n\n\nPros:\nThe ice surface appeared pebbled and that's a nice attention to detail.\nIt looks like the developer cares about making a fun product, and they deserve credit for their efforts.\nThe control scheme is easy to learn and I can't complain too much about the controls in general.\nCredit for a clever 2-sweeper control scheme.\n\nCons:\nThe stones are thrown straight by default, which should be an impossible thing to do. \nStone physics on collision are incredibly unrealistic in multiple ways.\n4-stone ends leave little room for any strategy.\nGame length should probably be customizable.\nHitting the wall did not remove stones from play. I never tried hogging a rock, so I don't know what would happen.\n\nA good effort, but this skews more 'arcade' than simulation. Someone playing curling for the first time might enjoy it, though they'd probably have to look up the rules outside of the game.\n\nI hope the developers will continue to improve product, because potential is there.","timestamp_created":1586045078,"timestamp_updated":1586045078,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn+npo/ECdI2X/gE="}
