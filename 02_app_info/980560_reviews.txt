I spent 3 hours and only managed to finished all the common cards. I stopped playing when common cards were still appearing very often costing 500 ink and recycle for 75.\n\nI attempted to craft 10 cards and only 1 wasn't a common. That's 4,325 ink after recycling the other 9 commons for 1 random non common card.\n\nUntil the amount of ink obtained is greatly increased I can not recommend this game and will no longer play it.","timestamp_created":1586977659,"timestamp_updated":1586977659,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568273067474365234","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h6vPv/ECcpyHgQI="}
