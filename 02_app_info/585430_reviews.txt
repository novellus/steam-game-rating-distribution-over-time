When your ship is pointing towards the top of the screen the controls act normally, left it left and right is right, but when you're facing towards the bottom of the screen those are reversed and moving the mouse left turns your ship right and vice versa. I tried to mentally adjust for this but after a while I just started to try and keep my target in the top half. It made dog-fighting nigh impossible. If there was a way to toggle control schemes that would be wonderful but I couldn't find any setting like that. The UI does also have a somewhat clunky feel at times. For example using F1 to bring up the help menu doesn't bring up a menu so much as an overlay that can then be overlaid itself by other menus. Keeping track of what windows respond to what commands (for exapmle the map only responds to the space bar and not escape) is challenging when first starting out. Consistency is a good thing in a well designed UI and this one has some room for improvement.","timestamp_created":1603570996,"timestamp_updated":1603570996,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsvKRrvUCdaTzqQI="}
