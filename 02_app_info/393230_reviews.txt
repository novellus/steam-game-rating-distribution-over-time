Game cannot be completed. Author has admitted to me that this is the case in an email. Have reported to Steam to takedown until fixed, but they cannot. so now it is down to you: BOYCOTT THIS GAME. AVOID. NOT EVEN BAD-ITS-FUN. Games like this killed greenlight, so while authors post games like this and then refuse to fix citing poverty (meanwhile taking your money) it kills the industry! Content-wise, yeah it's waht it is, but it's the lack of love for the  game that galls: HEY AUTHOR -   'FINISH THE GAME' and STOP COMPLAINING THAT YOU EXPECTED THIS GAME TO MAKE YOU MILLIONS! I do sympathise, but at least release a patch that fixes the game so it can be finished - hell, even a video walkthrough of how to reach those 6 endings would be cool! but NO! So if he don;t care, and despite the fact the game was written for his then-pregnant girlfriend (buy flowers next time!) he still will not return  to finish  it. \n[/quote]\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n[quote]\n[h1]AVOID!
