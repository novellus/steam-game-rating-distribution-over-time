    review: 'Needs so much more work, I would love if there was a way to sell all
      the loot and gather food or rest to heal.  The travel is so slow I felt sleepy
      trying to travel through the quests as it''s a decent size map.  So much more
      work before it''s ready for market, I''m sad I paid $16.95 for this due to it
      seeming like it''s at least 4 year more dev at the current rate of work.


      They have done some good work on designing the map and quests, but game play
      is too slow for me and I play simulator games on roblox, this makes those seem
      exciting.'
