    review: I went through the tutorial and started a real game, but the interface
      felt too clunky and the game just didn't capture my interest, resulting in a
      refund request. Maybe it gets more enthralling later in the game, but for me
      it failed to deliver on the 2nd moment of truth from the get-go. (Enjoyment
      of the product)
