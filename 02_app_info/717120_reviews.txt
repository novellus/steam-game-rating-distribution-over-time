Where that game had an overarching story tying randomized missions together, and included easter eggs and thematic mini-games, this one has none of those things.\n\nThere are seven short missions (four regular, two bonus and one free DLC), two of which have been taken from Trajectory (one literally, the other with some improvements). This time, however, there are no alternative ways of solving problems.\n\nAs a result there is much less replay value, even though this game is only one quarter of the length of its predecessor. Taking into account that the price is more than half that of Trajectory, I am disappointed with the value proposition. I hope a lot of additional free DLC content will be added in the future, so that I can increase my rating for what is currently essentially a demo for Trajectory or an advertisement for the Unreal Engine.","timestamp_created":1581301547,"timestamp_updated":1581302620,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529285550117492676","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9uO+lvACdMyk8QE="}
