    review: I'd recommend it, it's a good game with nice mechanics, it can be challenging
      as well, you can play as a regular beat'em all or as a roguelike, it has RPG
      elements to it, the difficulty is increasing as you gain more power, the art
      style and the music are really nice and helps the story delivering, there is
      also funny moments with the cut-scenes which introduce a level, you have several
      classes and many possiblities to approach the game, it is really easy to pick
      up, has a nice playtime and a great variety of enemies, themes and customisations.
