    developer_response: 'There is a lot going on behind the scenes. I also am working
      on 7 other projects. I switched back to End of Days being the main project so
      I have been pumping out work for it. My youtube channel has videos of what I''ve
      been doing and things you can expect to see in game. I will be recording another
      video today.


      A lot needs to be done still, but here is a casual live stream I did to show
      off version 0.2.0 https://youtu.be/HULvui_DvNg'

    review: "In the beginning, I was hesitant to purchase this game. This was due\
      \ to it's lack of content. However, I decided to try it because I like shooting\
      \ zombies. \n\nPros:\n\nSmooth gameplay (no lag)\nIncreasing difficulty\nGuns\
      \ and ammo\nThe moment when you realize you have to eject the mag. insert a\
      \ new one and pull the slide to engage the first round\n\nCons: \nLack of content\
      \ \nmenu glitch (cannot interact with it; sometimes)\n\nLike all new games they\
      \ have little to offer in the beginning. However, if this game gets enough funding,\
      \ I can see it being a very great and well developed game."
