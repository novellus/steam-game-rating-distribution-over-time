I like a game that I can pick up for 10 minutes or 7 hours and have a unique experience while playing each time. There are so many different ways to complete the objectives with so many different combinations of enemies, conditions, tools, and trates..\n\nI would write a longer review, but I want to get back to playing! I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys a good challenge!","timestamp_created":1547291921,"timestamp_updated":1547291921,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.584472596645355225","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pqHyoOgCdOGTuAE="}
