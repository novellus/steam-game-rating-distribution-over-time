    review: 'After playing this game almost one and half hours, my conclusion is that
      I can easily recommend the game to anyone who have some interest in political
      satire and politics, even in a shallow level.


      Although the gameplay style is very classical, to be honest almost stereotypical
      in the field of retro style shooting games, I liked it a lot - because in this
      case, graphics, animations and voice acting are the key elements that make Libtard
      distinct when compared to other similar games. The game mechanics in themselves
      seem to be pretty simple, just like walking, jumping and shooting, but it makes
      me always smile when the skillfully modelled Donald says or does something crazy
      in the game.


      When we treat this as mainly a satire (game), it''s easy to say that the creator
      has done wonderful work! I hope there is even more content to come to the game
      in the form of new courses, and I believe it is, because it clearly looks like
      the game is made with a lot of passion!'
