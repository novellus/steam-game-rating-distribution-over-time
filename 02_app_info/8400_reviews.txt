This version is improved, they added music, new enemies and a grid which breaks in the direction you shoot. The longer you play the more difficult the game gets, kinda simple. If you like asteroid-type retro games then give this a try.","timestamp_created":1609974532,"timestamp_updated":1609974532,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+rj97PYCdquRwQI="}
