Since it is so cheap and in early access I didn't expect much from it but so far I have really enjoyed playing it! You basically just buy animals for your zoo, care for them, hire people to help you care for them, do little missions, and expand your zoo for you to fit more animals to care for. There is a little bit of customization that is pretty limited- a few character customization options and items you can buy to decorate predetermined spots around your zoo but not too much. Also, I think I might have a side hustle with my raccoon. Overall I would definitely recommend!","timestamp_created":1589939482,"timestamp_updated":1589939482,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw2eXxl/ICdpP4iAI="}
