That means repetitiveness hits quickly, but then again, it's a simple, cheap game.\nThe interface is sleek and clever. I like it, and the controls are great.\nIt's visually rather confusing, yet it looks good in slomo.\nI was tempted to recommend, but...\n\nIn the end, two things tip the thumb towards the floor:\n- There are no sound options. When one puts music in a game, one needs to put a control allowing to pipe it down. Independently from the rest of the audio. Those high pitch metallic notes are way too aggressive.\n- No saving. It's not just that you can't interrupt a game, it's 1 player per PC only. The planets are locked as if the game is a campaign, which is totally inconsistent. So there is no saving system whatsoever, only unlocking things that shouldn't even be locked in the first place.\n\nTwo little things for some people (like the deaf and the speedrunners,) two basic requirements for the rest of us.","timestamp_created":1605026771,"timestamp_updated":1605027290,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuZvF2fUCeoTKrQI="}
