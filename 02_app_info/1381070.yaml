    review: "An adult game with turn based 2D D&D styled combat with the option of\
      \ turning combat off if you want just... ahem, the story. Not as much NSFW content\
      \ as I would like but the game is still being actively developed. So hopefully\
      \ later on there will be more NSFW content later on, though what's there isn't\
      \ bad. \n\nRegarding the developer, he develops practically daily at https://www.twitch.tv/mercernarymage.\
      \ That being said, he makes no secret that the game is free to try on his Patreon,\
      \ and buying the steam version is just a way to support him and get access to\
      \ the latest version sooner."
