    review: "This game is VR supported but it was a bit too much for me in the VR\
      \ form.  Enjoyable as a 3D game. \nAfter crash-landing on a sentient planet,\
      \ you awake to find a dreamscape world filled with discovery, wonder and the\
      \ littered remains of a betrayed civilization\n Puzzles are easy to very difficult\
      \ (some tricky platforming).  You have a jet pack to get around (thus the VR\
      \ was too disorienting with the movement for me) Very good graphics and the\
      \ story is ok.  Ending a bit of a let down but not enough to really hurt the\
      \ overall experience of the game."
