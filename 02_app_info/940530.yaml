    review: 'Another excellent add on lake for fsw.


      Based in Poland and although it does contain carp it''s mainly a predator lake.

      I tend to fish with two feeder rods with fish heads and dead bait and spin with
      a third rod.


      You get plenty of action and some of the pike are huge!

      I''ve not had a boss pike yet but I''ve had one over 47lbs.


      8.5/10


      I like this lake so much I recently bought it on sale and gifted it to my wife,
      she also loves it here :)'
