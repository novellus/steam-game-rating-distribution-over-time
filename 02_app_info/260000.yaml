    review: "I bought this game for 1$ on sale so I really don't mind it.\nHowever,\
      \ this game does not hold up well at all, questions are pretty much blind guesses\
      \ 3/4 times because of how old and random the movies are. The game doesn't even\
      \ have a settings page, so your stuck watching it on a tiny little box in the\
      \ middle of your screen, which there is a workaround but its not even worth\
      \ the effort. \nI personally think this game is dead and doesn't need to be\
      \ played, it had its run when it was released but now it just doesn't compare\
      \ to any of the other amazing Jackbox games. \n(NOTE: You can not play this\
      \ with people who aren't watching the game in person, there is no jackbox.tv\
      \ compatibility.)"
