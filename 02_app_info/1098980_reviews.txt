Humans just sort of, stand around until a zombie kills them. The game looks good, but suffers from having zero content. The three levels are easy to play, but there's not much to do but run from enemy to enemy while your zombies pounce on anybody that gets close. \n\nAs far as I can tell, the Dev has abandoned the game. No updates, no steam community presence, nothing.","timestamp_created":1579421652,"timestamp_updated":1579421652,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1582236430,"developer_response":"Hey Necroscourge, thanks for playing the game, we haven't abandoned the game, we are working on releases, but we are also working on changes in and around work, fear not, we have things in the pipeline."}],"cursor":"AoJwwrq33u8CdLHl7AE="}
