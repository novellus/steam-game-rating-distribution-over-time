I should also say that I never play the matches, since the simulation part is what really attracks me. So, I cannot really comment on the arcade part of the game.\n\nHowever, if you find it interesting to start with a very low grade team, and improve its economics and quality through time, this is the game for you. The interest can be mantained for at least 12-15 season (which is a fair amount of play hours), and mostly the first 5-7 years, that is when you really struggle to keep your economics afloat. After that, it will quickly become tedious as you will have the best squad around, your economy is blumming and your stadium is fully upgraded.\n\nAll and all, a fun game to play, with a relatively user friendly interface and a very gradual learning curve.\n\nGive it a try.\n\nFor more PrivateJohâ€™s personal (re)views you can check [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/32042143-PrivateJoh%27s-personal-%28re%29views/] HERE [/url].","timestamp_created":1439666492,"timestamp_updated":1522616798,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws5HCweICcYT8Qg=="}
