In most jurisdictions, according to consumer defense laws, Valve would also be considered legally responsible in these cases, since it is their Steam platform that allows the generation of those keys and their revocation.\n\nUNTIL PEOPLE START MASS REPORTING THESE CASES FOR FRAUD OR LEGAL VIOLATION, VALVE WON'T DO ANYTHING. SO PLEASE GO TO THE GAME'S STORE PAGE, CLICK ON THE FLAG ICON AND REPORT IT.\n\nAlso, report the developer's profile for scam and blacklist all his games by clicking the IGNORE button on their store pages so he won't see a cent from any of us again.\n\nI had to buy this abomination of a game AGAIN to be able to write this review.\n\nFinally, under no circumstances send emails to this \"developer\" asking for new keys. Not only is the \"game\" not worth it, but also an individual who scams their player base like this cannot be trusted with any of your personal info.","timestamp_created":1560119576,"timestamp_updated":1560119576,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.635733723640441895","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3PCXn+sCduWNwwE="}
