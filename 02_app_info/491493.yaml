      \ the SNJ designation, the most common versions being the SNJ-4, SNJ-5 and SNJ-6.\

    review: Outside modeling and textures are nice, good sound and animations, but
      virtual cockpit modeling and texture looks mediocre almost to the level of a
      freeware version you can get for free, since is a payware addon i was expecting
      more quality, I would like to see an update to make the virtual cockpit better
      detailed and animated. Get it if on sale with good discount to be honest.
