    review: The idea that putting sea monsters into a pirate game was great. But what
      I imagined was a combination of Sid Meter's Pirate and Sea Monsters. Worth trying
      a little bit to find out if you like it or not. But skirmish is too time-consuming.
      You need to wait for so long for AIs move. And ship maneuvering is so weak,
      even for a 'turn-based' game.
