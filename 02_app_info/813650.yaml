    about_the_game: Explore the kingdom of Silverdale in this innovative new match-3
      adventure that pairs the classic matching with exploration and discovery, item
      collection, quests, town building, and more! Traverse HUGE environments, collect

      /><br><br>Runefall is unlike any match-3 you've played. With every match you
      make, the camera moves in the direction of your match, allowing you to travel
      in all directions and explore the massive levels. Match over sand, grass, and
      dirt tiles to clear them and discover hidden items like keys to unlock treasure
      chests, unique quest items, or items to help you get past environmental obstacles
      like rivers, cliffs, and overgrown vines. Match shield pieces to fill your jump
      meter and use the mini-map to immediately jump to anywhere in the environment.
      Match gold, wood, and stone pieces to collect those resources and use them to
      upgrade the town of Rivermoor. Every town upgrade rewards you with bonuses like
      new power-ups and abilities.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/813650/extras/town.png?t=1572354686"
      /><br><br>Meet all the townsfolk of Rivermoor who have stories to tell, like
      Hadrick, Winifred, and Caius. Take quests from them and help them gather the
      needed materials for their monthly tribute to send to the king.

    reviews: "\u201CA large part of what makes Runefall great is how genuinely funny\
      \ and entertaining its story is. The writing is great, with light humour and\
      \ instantly likable characters... it feels like a traditional late '80s, early\
      \ '90s fantasy movie, and I mean that in the fondest way possible.\u201D<br><a\
