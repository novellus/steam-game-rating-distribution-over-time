    about_the_game: Exile's End is an homage to early 90's action-adventure PC games
      like Flashback and Another World, but with a Japanese flair. The core of the
      game is from Australian game maker Magnetic Realms with art, cutscenes, and
      music provided by legends of the 8 and 16-bit eras from Japan. It draws its
      thematic influence from the science-fiction films and anime of the 80's and
      its gameplay from classic Amiga and Commodore 64 action-adventures.<br><br><ul

    review: "[h1] The Metroidvania Review[/h1]\n [url=https://metroidvaniareview.com/2019/11/25/exiles-end/]\
      \ Scored Summary[/url] |  |                          [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/30503887/]\
      \ Subscribe to our Curator\t[/url]\n\n[b]How Metroidvania is it?[/b]\nHigh Fit\
      \ \u2013 In spite of the store page\u2019s pleas to the contrary, [i]Exile\u2019\
      s End[/i] fits the Metroidvania Mold extremely well, and is probably the best\
      \ genre to categorize it as. \n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/MetroidvaniaReview/discussions/1/1744480966999144417/]\
      \ Want to hear a different opinion, or want to share your own review? Check\
      \ out our Forum here.[/url]\n\n[h1]Full Review[/h1]\nI\u2019ve noticed that\
      \ for some people, presentation is everything. If a game has good graphics,\
      \ a story that is written to be exciting or entertaining, and great music, that\u2019\
      s all they need. [i]Exile\u2019s End[/i] really attempts to push the boundaries\
      \ of how far presentation can carry a game. Beauty of course, is in the eye\
      \ of the beholder, but if you\u2019re nostalgic for the era that [i]Exile\u2019\
      s End[/i] is trying to emulate, you\u2019ll probably find the game to be quite\
      \ beautiful. At the very least, the cut scenes are basically perfect in this\
      \ regard. If you\u2019re one of those people that appreciates presentation above\
      \ all else, then you may enjoy what this game has to offer. For myself though,\
      \ I\u2019ve always been one to analyze the level design, then the gameplay,\
      \ first. To me, even wrapped up in all of its graphical wonders, [i]Exile\u2019\
      s End[/I] commits the cardinal sin when it comes to rating a game; it\u2019\
      s boring. \n\n[i]Exile\u2019s End\u2019s[/i] biggest problem is that it doesn\u2019\
      t seem to know what it wants to present in terms of gameplay. It starts out\
      \ interesting \u2013 to me at least. You\u2019ve crash landed on a planet with\
      \ all of your allies dead or missing, and you\u2019re hanging on by a thread\
      \ yourself. Your environmental suit is malfunctioning, so you can\u2019t even\
      \ fall very far without taking severe damage. It\u2019s a great setup for a\
      \ Metroidvania game, even if it\u2019s a little frustrating. That genre can\
      \ really cash in on the idea that you start out as a weakling and eventually\
      \ become an all-powerful conquerer, and you certainly start out weak here. [i]Exile\u2019\
      s End[/i] seems like it\u2019s trying to be atmospheric \u2013 certainly the\
      \ claims that it\u2019s actually a cinematic platformer rather than a Metroidvania\
      \ testify to that. But its slower movement and pacing \u2013 albeit perfectly\
      \ functional \u2013 sort of kills that atmosphere rather than build on it. This\
      \ is especially true in the long run as monsters are encountered to the point\
      \ where dispatching them becomes routine rather than a terror to be faced \u2013\
      \ thus it sort of fails at being a cinematic platformer. The game\u2019s progression\
      \ is wholly Metroidvania-like, but you never seem to move beyond backtracking\
      \ through boring enemies so you can flip switches; you never end up being the\
      \ powerful master of his environment.  The end result is a game that wants to\
      \ be something else, ends up to be most like the thing that it claims not to\
      \ be, but then sort of fails at being good at that anyway. \n\nWhile moving\
      \ through the stages quickly becomes tedious, exploration does give some very\
      \ meaningful rewards \u2013 so there are [i]some[/i] positives in the gameplay.\
      \ Bosses aren\u2019t particularly well-designed in terms of patterns and telegraphing,\
      \ so upgrading your armor and weapons really takes the edge off of having to\
      \ face them. Thus finding ammo upgrades still gives that wonderful sweet taste\
      \ that you may have experienced in other exploration-based games. It\u2019s\
      \ just a shame that moving between them can be so uninteresting. \n\nAnother\
      \ way exploration is rewarded is feeding you more information on the story.\
      \ It\u2019s fun to find communiques and tidbits that unfold the plot more organically,\
      \ rather than [i]only[/i] having it fed to you through forced cinematics \u2013\
      \ even if said cinematics are also a highlight of the game. The game ends off\
      \ on a ponderous note which I consider a major positive overall, but ultimately\
      \ the narrative is still probably similar to something you\u2019ve heard before\
      \ if you\u2019ve dabbled in any sci-fi prior to playing. There\u2019s also a\
      \ huge missed opportunity to tell that story through the environment itself.\
      \ Some areas are better than others, but overall levels feel like they were\
      \ made in service to the gameplay rather than to create a sense of \u201Cplace\u201D\
      \ \u2013 which wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing if the gameplay was actually\
      \ good. \n\nThere are some very talented people involved with [i]Exile\u2019\
      s End[/i], but in the end it falls apart due to poor direction. It never really\
      \ sets itself apart in the ways that matter most and while it\u2019s not [i]that[/i]\
      \ bad, it exists in an environment where it can be safely ignored. I feel like\
      \ any of the 2D [i]Metroid[/i] games capture what [i]Exile\u2019s End[/i] does\
      \ best, but better. While the more atmospheric Metroid-like version of Metroidvania\
      \ is slimmer pickings than its campier Castlevania-inspired brethren, I don\u2019\
      t think that\u2019s enough to recommend slogging through this one. \n\n2 out\
