    review: "+ Challenging gameplay. Fairly good sound design, lighting, and overall\
      \ story makes for a fairly immersive experience if you can avoid dying often.\n\
      \n- Textures are poor, character models are horrific, inventory management is\
      \ annoying. \n\nOverall, a pretty good experience, especially considering the\
      \ age of the game. I would recommend this game if you're a fan of Bioshock.\
      \ It's easy to see how bioshock's gameplay and dystopian survival/horror atmosphere\
      \ was heavily influenced by System Shock 2."
