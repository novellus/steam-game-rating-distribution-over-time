    about_the_game: "Midair is a fast-paced jetpack shooter set in a breathtaking\
      \ new sci-fi universe. Use movement and physics to your advantage, outwit your\
      \ enemy from every angle, build bleeding-edge defenses, and fully customize\
      \ the way you play. With up to 16v16 large-scale infantry and vehicle combat,\
      \ you'll never look at a shooter the same way again.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TRUE\
      \ FREEDOM</h2><br>Movement in Midair is an art. It's a flow. It's a learned,\
      \ practiced skill that when you know it\u2026 you just <i>feel it</i>. Using\
      \ your jetpack and frictionless boots, launch high-speed airborne assaults,\
      \ expertly dodge enemy fire, and soar from hilltop to hilltop. Free yourself\
      \ from the ground or become a quick frag for your opponent.<br><br>The jetpack\
      \ draws from your armor\u2019s energy pool, so strategically manage your use\
      \ of the jetpack and energy-based weapons to ensure your battle advantage. Depending\
      \ on the situation, adjust your jetpack from pushing you upward to giving more\
      \ maneuvering power. Veteran players know how to manage their jets and energy\
      \ by instinct.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TEAMWORK IS CRITICAL</h2><br>A team without\
      \ coordination is like a shooter without jetpacks. In Midair it's critical that\
      \ you coordinate your assaults for maximum effect. Take down their automated\
      \ defenses one by one or sneak past the guards and destroy the generator to\
      \ cripple their base and expose their flag for a quick grab.<br><br>But remember,\
      \ you'll need to keep your flag home too. They'll start by using bombers and\
      \ tanks to bombard your fortifications and break your ranks. Heavily armored\
      \ attackers with explosive weaponry will follow, trying to deal critical blows\
      \ to your infrastructure. After that, elite light-armored enemies who have spent\
      \ hours studying the terrain and perfecting their movement will race in, grab\
      \ your flag, and get out -- and <i>FAST</i>.<br><br>Repel the attack by keeping\
      \ your base's main defenses operational, deploying forward sensors to track\
      \ their movements, strategically place turrets deal out some extra damage, and\
      \ get some fighters in the sky to maintain air superiority. With the right team\
      \ and friends you can depend on, this will be a breeze.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >CUSTOMIZE AND STRATEGIZE</h2><br>One thing's for sure - when the situation\
      \ changes, so should your strategy. Midair features complete customization and\
      \ no preset classes. Pick your armor based on how fast you need to go and how\
      \ much damage you need to take. Choose weapons to suit your play style. Packs\
      \ gives you special abilities that can swing the fight in your favor during\
      \ that critical moment, or help you deploy mobile defenses where it's needed\
      \ the most.<br><br>Your team composition matters. Before running into the fight,\
      \ make sure your squad is prepared with the right firepower, support, and intelligence\
      \ to do the job.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THIS IS MIDAIR</h2><br>Get ready for a\
