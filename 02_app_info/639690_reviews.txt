It's not terrible, but can be a little distracting.\n\nOverall I'd recommend giving it a watch!","timestamp_created":1551845021,"timestamp_updated":1551845248,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwOnLqOkCf66zvAE="}
