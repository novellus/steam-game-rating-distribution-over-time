    review: "Now that the developers have finished coming, funny times will be had\
      \ when recommending this game! \n\nThe tutorial attempts to explain the game's\
      \ mechanics, at least. So that's good. The written English instructions need\
      \ a lot of revising. Most of it is formatted strangely/incorrectly. The ability\
      \ to hurl a lightning bolt at enemies is very nice, but feels very difficult\
      \ to execute. I think you have to swing your controller at a certain speed and\
      \ then hit the trigger, if you're swinging too slow then the lightning bolt\
      \ never leaves that player's hand. Because you have to control your velocity,\
      \ you also have to somehow set your aim to hit these small targets on the field.\
      \ It would be better to allow the player to aim the lightning bolt with their\
      \ gaze, and require them to use high velocity swing and trigger to release at\
      \ gazed target. Or, remove the velocity based throwing requirement altogether,\
      \ because it's quite frustrating to reliably use it when you have to wait for\
      \ the meter to get to 100% before it does its full damage potential.\n\nI found\
      \ there was too much to dislike with the user interface and the type of physical\
      \ actions you expect the player to make with the controllers to get simple actions\
      \ working. Interface concerns aside, I also felt deck building seemed nonsensical.\
      \ Why not just build a deck with only enemies that require 10 \"turns\" to cast?\
      \ There seems no benefit to the smaller creatures at all, or even a tactical\
      \ advantage to having them. There seems to be a maximum amount of creatures\
      \ you can have in your deck, but all creatures seemed to do the same thing:\
      \ charge into enemy field, and eventually die while fighting your opponent's\
      \ summoned troops. \n\nThis game kinda looked like fun, and I'm glad I had a\
      \ chance to try it, but I'm not ever going to play it again unless some of the\
      \ concerns I have are addressed. It doesn't seem like there are any other people\
      \ playing this, or if they are, they're not active on the forums, I don't know\
      \ what to expect from this game's future."
