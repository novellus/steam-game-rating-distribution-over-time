    review: 'Me and my kids love this game.  We were introduced to it on the free
      Android version, and fell in love with it.  Was the first game I bought on Steam;
      it''s actually how I found out about Steam.


      About the game, got to play split screen with your kids.  Never gets old.


      When playing alone, the championships are most fun.  Trying to allocate a chunk
      of time to do the 23 race championship.  That''ll be an hour straight of crazy
      racing with concentration off the charts.  Will probably need a nap after that.
