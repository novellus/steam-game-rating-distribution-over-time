Once you get the top weapon, it is just a mindless shootout without any risk and you are just waiting for the level to end so you can do the next one.  The start of each level is the most challenging, Once you have a flamer on each row it you set up to get the top weapon and once you have one on each row, it's pretty much watch the lights and wait for the end\nIt's a game like plants and zombies without any of the complexity.  I would get the game for a novice gaming child.  I am pretty sure they might have some fun. Right now, no balance and not strategy in choosing weapons.  Just get the biggest weapon and clear the level\n\nThis needs a lot of development.","timestamp_created":1575267119,"timestamp_updated":1575267119,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+ZXP4u4Cfq6F4QE="}
