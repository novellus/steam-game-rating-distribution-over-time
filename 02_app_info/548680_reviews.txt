Polished. Fun.\n\nThis is SmashTV but for up to 4 players. And set in a dungeoun. There are ghouls, and a knight looks suspiciously familiar.\n\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\nOk there's some nice new additions, although i'm not sure there are VCR prizes. Too bad.\nAt first i thought it was a lot easier, but it's really not.\nThe music is perfect for a game like this.\nControls are sweet, and configurable. Game recommends a controller, but it's fine on a keyboard if you're playing solo.\nIf you like witty descriptions and puns, you'll find plenty.\nuhm...\nThere's interlaced or scanline modes.\n\nNo, what ARE you waiting for?\n\nWell, there are some video issues. Some people have trouble with fullscreen modes, and Windows DPI scaling doesn't play nice with this game. You can manualy bypass the scaling for this game by creating a custom shortcut and tinkering with it's properties. Not cool, but it's apparently a Windows issue.\nI've had the game crash on me when i tried different windowed modes.\nBut other than those video mode gremlins, everything worked like a charm.\n\nNothing more to say. Goblets to steal, ghouls to hurt, golden chests to liberate. Going away now.","timestamp_created":1609109783,"timestamp_updated":1609109783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ndia0/YCesr0vQI="}
