    about_the_game: <strong>Perfection.</strong> is a simple, soothing puzzle game
      about cutting shapes to fit into outlines. There are an infinite number of puzzles,
      each randomly generated to be unique and interesting.<br><br>Its gameplay is
      very minimalistic and very forgiving; there is no time limit, and you can cut
      as many times as you want and undo as many times as you want until you get each
      shape right. Or, you can challenge yourself to clear the shape in front of you
      in as few cuts as possible. Whether you get it perfect or not, once a shape
      is completed, it's gone forever. There's no commitment to replay any level,
      because there will always be a new one for you to try.<br><br>The game's soundtrack
      is a beautiful synthesized soundscape, composed by Omni-Psyence and available
