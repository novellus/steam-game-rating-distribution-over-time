And having just finished one of the best platforming games ever made, (spleunky,) we finally wanted to give this game a go. Within the first sitting of playing this game a few things were made clear. 1001 Spikes is a game of trolls, bad decisions, good music, charming aesthetics and quite basic platfoming mechanics. \n\nThe troloolololols:\n Since the game gives you only 1001 lives to finish the entire game, (kind of,) you try your best NOT to die. Well sadly, the game goes far out of it's way to make sure you DO die. Spikes will randomly spring out of blocks with no indication they are there. Platforms will fall and never respawn, making progress impossible. Tiki arrow shooting blocks will fire and kill you, only sometimes though, since not ALL tiki arrow shooting blocks will actually shoot. The amount of trolls in this game is immense. In the late game my friend and I stopped asking: 'is there a troll here?' And started asking: 'Where is the troll? I know your gunna kill me you doodle game! WHERES THE TROLL?' \n\n\nThe bad decisions: \nThe bad decisions tie mostly into the coop portion of the game, though not entirely. My friend and I CONSTANTLY soft locked one another. Example: I would cross a bridge; the bridge would fall. My friend can now no longer cross the bridge. He is forced to kill himself, taking one our shared 1001 with him. Other bad decisions is the character selection. When you finally are able to unlock a new character, you cannot continue your game with them; your're forced to restart EVERYTHING. Only the second player can swap characters without restarting the entire game. Why this is the case i'll never know. Once your coop friend finally does swaps characters, hope to GOSH its not to the ninja character. He flat out breaks the most levels, bypassing some completely.\n\nThe cat'sJAM: \nalmost all levels feature quite catchy music. Example: 1001 Spikes OST - World 2. This is quite nice since some levels require quite a hefty amount of game time to complete them. EXCEPT THE GOLDEN BOSS OH MY GOSH THAT SONG IS BAD. WE HAD TO LISTEN TO THAT SONG FOR LIKE 30 MINUTES! 1001 Spikes OST - World 6 Boss If you would care to listen. ( I would link you, but steam doesn't like links )\n\nThe charm: \nIt looks good. My friend's brother once had an argument that it looks super similar to phoenix wright's old art. Lol my friend proceeded to argue that it didn't. 'I have actually played the game I think I would know'  But let's be real, it does look a LOT like phoenix.  \n\nThe basics of platforming:  It's all pretty simple stuff. You have a high jump, (triangle,) and a low jump, X; you also have a GUN. Through out the game they mix things up to a certain degree. Platforms that switch on and off with a timer, some beyond toxic penguins, sliding blocks, ice, and some falling blocks that soft lock your coop buddy. it all feels very basic though. Keep in mind I mean BASIC not BAD. But I do feel like i'm in the minority here when I say I like the lives system. It brings a certain weight every time your coop buddy drags you down into a lava pit. We only ever had to restart the game once though. ( near the end lol ) \n\nThe END: \nEven with all the TRASH in this game, it's still fun. But it is quite annoying knowing that a great deal of deaths will feel CHEAP and UNFAIR. For $15, i'd say it's worth it. You get quite a lot of levels to play, ( and bonus levels :)! ) It's all quite fun in coop, but I have no idea why this game refuses to respawn fallen platforms. It's like they want us to waste all our lives :(\n\nThe NUMBER: \nPshh! shoot, dawg. idk? 7/10?","timestamp_created":1607976772,"timestamp_updated":1607978507,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.467032968997955322","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r5u/sfYCeIycugI="}
