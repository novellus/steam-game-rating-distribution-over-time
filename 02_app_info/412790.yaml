    review: "[h1] Tested using Oculus CV1 and Vive only [/h1]\n\nLet's cut to the\
      \ chase:\n\n- The game runs great (as it should considering this used to be\
      \ a mobile VR game)\n\n- Its art style is very in keeping with the show with\
      \ some extra shading work on top to add a level of polish that I noticed and\
      \ appreciated\n\n- The controls and mechanics work fine but do little to add\
      \ variety to gameplay, this is about as barebones an action-platformer as it\
      \ could possibly be. The control input method being gamepad only with no support\
      \ for motion controllers (emulating a gamepad) is a shame but not the end of\
      \ the world.\n\n- The amount of content (both plot and total playtime) is minimal\
      \ and provides about 45 minutes of gameplay if you pace yourself and look for\
      \ the secrets\n\n- Difficulty is non-existent, the enemies aren't hard to beat\
      \ and traversal is very simple\n\nConclusion:\nThis is a cheap but polished\
      \ Adventure Time game with about as much content as you'd expect for the price.\
      \ As a PCVR game it's just kind of ok (if you find this game scratches an itch\
      \ for 3rd person VR action-platformers you didn't know you had, \"Moss\" and\
      \ the Oculus Store version of \"Chronos\" are both stellar examples of what\
      \ the genre can offer when given a bigger budget and scope), but as an AT tie-in\
      \ this game really sticks out as a neat little novelty and is something I wholeheartedly\
      \ recommend to fans of the show. \n\nAs a side note, if you're seriously writing\
      \ negative reviews complaining exclusively about the amount of content in a\
      \ five-buck bug-free Gear-VR-to-PC port from four years ago, maybe just go fuck\
      \ yourself instead"
