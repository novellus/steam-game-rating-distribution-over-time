    review: 'I gave this game multiple tries, multiple chances, and it is honestly
      the worst VR title I have tried yet. Basically the janky physics will make it
      impossible to complete Escape the Bunker.


      Items will randomally drop out of your hands.

      Bumping anything with an item in your hand will make it bounce out of your hand.

      Items will randomally ignore collisions, falling through tables, or even the
      floor.

      Using one of the many elevators in the game will make you drop objects or cause
      other items you arent touching to move or lose collision.


      I literally walked through the first generator door holding the axe, had it
      spaz out of my hand, rocket around the room and cause a chain reaction of physics
      objects to all gain incredible velocity, wrecking the first room instantly.
      The chaos even caused items to fly up into the first room from rooms below.
      This was less than five minutes into my fifth attempt to play.


      After multiple attempts I haven''t been able to make it past the fifth room
      because the third elevator forces me to lose at least one item no matter how
      I try to prevent it from doing so. This third elevator literally shakes the
      entire map.


      You can literally get stuck because your essental item falls out of your hand,
      flies off and then falls through the level, forcing you to restart, only to
      have the exact same issue happen over and over again.


      On top of being almost incompletable, the rest of Escape the Bunker is of very
      poor quality. Now I dont expect perfection or AAA quality by any means, but
      entire sections of the level are clearly incomplete. Massive holes letting you
      see outside the levels are everywhere, shadows from moveable items are baked
      into the floors and walls, your ability to move is literally only forward by
      pressing the pad, sounds are of poor quality and very loud.


      Escape the Bunker could have been a fun little indie game, but as it stands
      now, I would not say it is complete. It''s a rough buggy mess and simply setting
      an item on the floor can cause you to be unable to progress. I don''t consider
      myself demanding, but this is absolutely unacceptable and I reccomend staying
      away from Escape the Bunker.'
