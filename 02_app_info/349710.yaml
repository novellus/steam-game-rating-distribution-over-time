    review: 'The game is good, tho very experimental


      A lot of things don''t really feel right and the game feels very empty, I think
      my major complaint has to be with the weapons and the maneuvering of the ship


      The game doesn''t have the possibility to go slower than max speed, if you move,
      you go at full speed and that can be a pain in minefield mode as doing small
      movements is impossible


      There is no way to deal with very large ammounts of enemies, as soon as they
      start piling up you''re eventually screwed as your main weapon, the cannon,
      isn''t designed for that and the missiles aren''t really all that usefull


      But the biggest problem I have with wepons, is the whip


      The whip, like the game, was shown has a very smooth weapon, usefull in a ton
      of situations, and is I belive the main selling point to me, it''s rather unique


      Well, as of right now, this whip is clunky, often doesn''t even damage enemies,
