    review: Wait before judging. I do really like this game and its soundtrack but
      its not worth buying on steam unless you want it that desperately, you're best
      off buying it on bandcamp or using a youtube downloader, as the songs are all
      on there, and this is why (it may not be always applicable but I think it happens
      often from other reviews). The thing hadn't downloaded even when it said it
      had and when I asked steam support about it they pointed me towards troves support
      team, who told me its an issue with steam. It may say that it has downloaded
      but it wont be where you thing, I couldn't find it in the game's files nor the
      steam music folder. If this is happening to you i would suggest using the steps
      that Johnny8435 mentioned in his review as they were very helpful and thanks
      to him i can finally rave to "DancePad - Dracolyte's Dance" on the train. I
      stress, it's very good and worth the money and i would recommend getting it
      but i can't recommend getting it on steam on steam as its too much of a hassle
      to install.
