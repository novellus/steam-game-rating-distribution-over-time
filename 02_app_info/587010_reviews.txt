And you can tell! It’s a 2D platformer in the style of Limbo and Inside. Now I say in the style of because in reality it’s a near total rip-off. The visual style is almost identical with a silhouette foreground and character with more detailed backgrounds to show off the kind of area you’re in. other than the backgrounds having more colour which actually look a bit out of place they’re basically the same thing.\nThe platforming is very simplistic, the controls are also very simple but somehow painful to use. Ezra will often drop off ropes or ladders for no reason or even miss grabbing them at all. Ledges never seem to have any indication that it can be grabbed and your jumps will often fall short even though you still manage to grab the ledge. This makes timed puzzles really frustrating because you have no concept of distance.\nOn the plus side it’s not particularly buggy I did get caught on a dropping wall which stopped me going through even though it shouldn’t but otherwise nothing major.\n\n\nIf you want to see the video review with some gameplay in the background it's here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG3291SutFU","timestamp_created":1486313105,"timestamp_updated":1486313105,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503708839416503906","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45sTKh9oCeKexcQ=="}
