Its incredibly relaxing swimming around the underwater scenery and the graphics aren't that bad. If you don't mind that there are unfinsihed sections and some things aren't finalised then then this game is quite good. TIP: When you launch the game, launch it via the steam app not desktop icon as the desktop icon will try to open in VR mode whereas steam gives a choice to open in VR or normal.","timestamp_created":1609515123,"timestamp_updated":1609515123,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4k/ik3/YCfva2vwI="}
