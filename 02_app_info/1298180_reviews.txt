Even so, the expansion packs don't appear to load (Executable not found) and it looks like it requires swiping to access levels greater than 4, with no options for playing on a computer without that capability.  No options at all, actually, except sound and music can be turned on or off.  No updates since release.  No in game instructions or help.  You're on your own.","timestamp_created":1606603507,"timestamp_updated":1606603507,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ404DCiPYCe+LntAI="}
