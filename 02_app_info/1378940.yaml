    review: "This is the 3rd game for this developer, and every time, it gets better!\
      \ This RPG has most all of the elements you want in an RPG - a good turn based\
      \ battle system, a unique cast with different abilities, exploration, crafting,\
      \ side quests....it took me about 30 hrs to complete, with all side quests and\
      \ optional bosses (although there was one I finally gave up on). \n\nYou start\
      \ off in a town and are told to pick your team of 4 to go save the king. From\
      \ here you can pick from every class imaginable (practically). That will definitely\
      \ the replayability, since you can choose many different casts. I started with\
      \ the warrior, cleric, wizard (or mage), and bard. But you can choose a rogue,\
      \ witch, knight, monk....just to name a few. Then your journey starts off -\
      \ pretty straight forward. Thankfully you can back track, which helps with quests,\
      \ mining, etc.\n\nThe only con I would say is that the characters didn't interact\
      \ with each other, nor was there as much of a story, as in the previous games.\
      \ That was one of my favorite things in the first game particularily, how saucy\
      \ some characters are. However the game play/battle system was definitely much\
      \ improved, as was the crafting, mining, quests....One of the best things about\
      \ this game is how visually beautiful some of the maps are, and the music works\
      \ well with the mood, and isn't your standard stuff.\n\nDefinitely a thumbs\
      \ up, and worth playing. I'm looking forward to more games from this developer!\n\
      \n"
