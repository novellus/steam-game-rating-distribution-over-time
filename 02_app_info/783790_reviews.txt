The developer listened to feedback from the community and made the game much user friendlier.","timestamp_created":1518642865,"timestamp_updated":1543955825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60000002384185791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4loi8vecCdIPxmAE="}
