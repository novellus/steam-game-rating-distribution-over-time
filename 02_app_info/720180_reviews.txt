It is purported to be an extract of a longer film in production but I can't verify that. Was it worth watching? Yes, but not because of the horror aspect. This is not a horror film and is instead, a glimpse into what the Cambodian civilians went through during the U.S. military incursion in 1970. But, if you're looking for a war movie, move on. This isn't it. This short is a well made, low-budget drama about two people trying to survive. it's interesting because of the story and because of the local background. The acting isn't bad either. The short is followed by a director's commentary. I gave it a 5.5 out of 10.","timestamp_created":1529210113,"timestamp_updated":1529210113,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547945201396942139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vtGBhuQCfr+YowE="}
