Its i am on drugs simulator or just a crazy Sandbox Game, but thanks to the short story well packed in a very creative way. This is ART no doubt...\n\nthis game conjures a smile on the lips of someone who is sad. \nWarning this Game is glitchy af. You can literally climb through walls. \n\nI agree to some reviews 20 bugs was be a bit to expensive for this game.","timestamp_created":1609842310,"timestamp_updated":1609842310,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536376595497131348","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt4eF6fYCfa3UwAI="}
