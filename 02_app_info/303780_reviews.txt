If I had a dollar for every time I've listened to this album, I'd...be almost a hundred dollars richer. It's [i]that[/i] good.\n\n   Just look at the track titles listed on the Store page. Yes, those tracks are every bit as good as they sound. Yes, \"The Disintegration Kiss on the Door\" [i]is[/i] a blatant Cure tribute. And the rest is 80s-influenced synth-y goodness at its very, very best. (Okay, so there's a tiny bit of \"filler\", but it's still pretty kosher.)\n\n   Five bucks is nothin' for so much goodness packed into a single wallop. Go on. You know you want...nay, [i]need[/i] it. Don't even wait for a sale. Buy it TODAY, you cheapskates. \n\n   Verdict: 10/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1593571710,"timestamp_updated":1593732258,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596533656120300293","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjYv2iPMCfYXnkQI="}
