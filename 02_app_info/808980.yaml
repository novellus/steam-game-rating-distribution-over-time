    about_the_game: What if you got zapped to smithereens by some kind of alien contraption,
      only to somehow wake up in a remote space station far, far away from Earth?
      That'd be awful, right?<br><br>But what if the lady who kind of did that to
      you actually turned out to be the loveliest person ever? And she liked girls
      too? What would that make it?<br><br><strong>Gay</strong>. There's no way around
      that. It's queer women kissing and messing with each other, feel-good slice-of-life,
      aloof banter, silly dates, an occasional serious topic, rainbows, awkward humor,
      bad puns, nonsensical mysteries and stuff.<h2 class="bb_tag">What's the big

      to her research and whole career.<br><br>Even though Sophie can be kind of spontaneous
      and aloof at times, she's still a rather calm and sensible person in general.

      took Sophie with her to the far end of the galaxy. She appears cool and a bit
      quiet at first, but do first impressions ever prove right? Could her personality
      actually be quite different once she's comfortable with Sophie's company?<br><br>Actually,
      who is she anyway, and what did she try to achieve? Even though she looks like
      a human, is she actually from Earth at all? Like, the technology she had in
      her possession definitely wasn't from Earth, and she might just have been a
      wee bit reluctant to accurately answer certain questions about herself.<br><br><strong>Some
      strange individuals</strong> inhabit the isolated place where Sophie and Bryn
      arrive. These individuals might turn out to be helpful as Sophie tries to make
      sense of the confusion. Depending on what Sophie does, they might even become
      friends with her over time.<br><br>Also, even though meeting new people might
      be very unlikely somewhere in deep space, who knows if someone else could actually

    review: 'Both a heartfelt and earnest game about two women in love, and a subversively
      deep meditation on what it means to be human. This game genuinely made me reexamine
      some lifelong assumptions.


      It''s also very cute, and obviously a labor of love. The art is gorgeous, and
      the music is very pleasant - it feels like the aural equivalent of a nice rambling
      walk.


      And it''s surprisingly ambitious! There''s a ton of branching paths, which I
      wasn''t expecting. I definitely want to replay it to get the other routes and
      hear all the other dialogue.


      I also want to mention how impressed I was with the structure of the game mechanically.
      It''s pretty simple - basically, time passes as you walk around and do things
      and eventually you need to go to bed - but it''s a really powerful framing device.
      You get to see the other characters go about their days as you go about yours,
      and conversations often result from running into them in a very natural way.
      It''s real clever.


      In short: it''s a gem of a game. I''m going to be thinking about it for a while
      to come.'
