    review: "Hmm.\nWell I do not think this is a great VN but something keeps me reading\
      \ it...\nAnd what I mean by not great is that its probably someones first project..\n\
      But I will thumb it up anyway as it does make me smile a little bit and those\
      \ smiles are very welcome in this year of Covid19 madness. So any smile I get\
      \ is very welcome.\n\nThe bad things about this so far is I think tiny bit the\
      \ writing and the lack of people in the scenes.. Like host mother and host father\
      \ are not pictured but they are in the dialogue. Its a bit silly. \n\nAnd the\
      \ script is not foolproof but I would say if you want to support a first project\
      \ I would say whoever is behind this has some kind of good touch whatever that\
      \ person does, and even though it might be a mess as it is now I dont mind as\
      \ I am happy to support a non adult VN happily. Too many of those around anyway,\
      \ its nice to have something right and clean for once that someone has made,\
      \ I think that might be the reason why I smile at this, its still a noob project\
      \ but the mind behind it is pure and good.. Thats why I say thumbs up and support\
      \ this!\n\nEDIT: I would still say it needs more characters shown in it because\
      \ it describes masses and this and that but NO One is there hehe so it sort\
      \ of well falls short on the story because it does not back it up visually.\
      \ Still recommending it but maybe for the next project if theres masses of people\
      \ they need to be shown thats all."
