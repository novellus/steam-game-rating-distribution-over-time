Of which I myself am one, so Iâ€™m on board!\n\nNice to see how the sausage is made and behind the scenes footage and interviews of both those who make a bunch of these different shows and also their loyal fans/listeners. Nothing revolutionary to see here perhaps, but a real good attempt at giving an insight and homage to a popular (and fast growing) media source loved by so many faithful listeners.","timestamp_created":1505501517,"timestamp_updated":1505501517,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zMK4w94Ce8C3hQE="}
