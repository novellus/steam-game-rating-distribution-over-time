I'll have to play more to see what else they say in certain situations\n\nAll in all, I like it. it's simple, but there's strategy to it and enough animation and physics to make it more interesting than...say a real life dice game. :D\n\n(will update later after I've played a few games. I spent my time playing Single player vs. 2 Easy AI)","timestamp_created":1605482924,"timestamp_updated":1605483262,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.573304176330566406","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg86Q5/UCcOfQrgI="}
