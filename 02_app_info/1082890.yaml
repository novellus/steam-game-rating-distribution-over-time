      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>GODS</strong></h2>During your journey in the\
      \ Vikings\u2019 world you will come across different Idol statues of Gods that\
      \ can be unlocked. <br>Each God is unique and will come with its own set of\
      \ powers and abilities. You will gain your God\u2019s favors, they will give\
      \ you their powers in battle or grant you the ability to become their avatar\
      \ for a limited period of time. Gods won\u2019t listen to your mortal callings\
      \ every time. <br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1082890/extras/gods.gif?t=1609406758\"\
      \ /><br><br>You can unlock this power by filling up your devotion bar. Performing\
      \ certain actions such as finding Runes will grant you more abilities during\
      \ your avatar state while others like defeating certain enemies, damaging Templar\
      \ flags or other artifacts will help fill up your devotion bar faster. When\
      \ your devotion bar is full you will be able to pray and will have good chances\
      \ to receive an answer from your God. The choices you make regarding new items\
      \ will affect the way your devotion bar fills up and the way your God will respond\
      \ to your prayers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Classes/Builds/Combat</strong></h2>You\
      \ can choose between three different classes, each with its unique gears and\
      \ weapons. Characters in Viking Vengeance are visually distinct and grant access\
      \ to different skills and items that have to be used in combination with the\
      \ God mechanic. These combinations allow you to build unique experiences every\
      \ time and influence the way you approach encounters.  <br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1082890/extras/c4-executeWolf.gif?t=1609406758\"\
      \ /><br>Each class will have the ability to execute the enemies after their\
      \ health reaches a certain threshold. Executing enemies will either give you\
      \ health back or extra blood currency which can be used for reviving, boosting\
      \ your devotion or for other gains.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1082890/extras/c5-skelletons.gif?t=1609406758\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Level Up</strong></h2>Leveling up in Viking\
      \ Vengeance consists in receiving new skills, upgrades for old ones or new equipment\
      \ to choose from at certain levels as well as receiving extra stat points.<br>The\
      \ items and weapons are brought to you by the only Valkyrie that is willing\
      \ to help. The characters have a maximum of 6 basic abilities, one weapon trait\
      \ ability and one ultimate ability.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>AFTER LIFE</strong></h2>In\
      \ Viking Vengeance, death comes at a price. Your options will be Reviving on\
      \ the spot for a large blood cost or going back to your last saved location,\
      \ restarting the world. When returning to Midgard from Valhalla you will always\
      \ be marked by Valkeries with different intensity effects, depending on your\
      \ results in the challenges of the After life. While marked the Valkeries will\
      \ hunt you and try to get you back to the spirit world.   <br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1082890/extras/c2-valhalla.gif?t=1609406758\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Monsters &amp; Enemies</strong></h2>Enemies\
      \ appear in specific areas and they have different behaviors, strengths, weaknesses\
      \ and skills. <br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1082890/extras/c6-giants.gif?t=1609406758\"\
      \ /><br>You will remember when a clumsy and slow Jotun will manage to land a\
      \ hit and you will remember that the Dragur attacks are burning up points from\
      \ your devotion bar, preventing you from using the power of the Gods. You will\
      \ be intrigued by the Templar Priest who has a divine shield from his God, making\
      \ him invulnerable to non God attacks.  <br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1082890/extras/c3-fafnir.gif?t=1609406758\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Rune stones</strong></h2>While discovering\
      \ the world of Viking Vengeance, you will come across Runes, blessed stones\
      \ that will offer benefits on your journey. The most important Runes you need\
      \ to find are the Nine Noble Virtues. <br>Finding all the nine stone is your\
      \ main mission. It is said that once all the Noble Virtues are together, they\
      \ will form a powerful legendary weapon of Gods. This weapon has the potential\
      \ to change the fate of the world. The Nine Noble Virtues will reveal their\
      \ origin story by deciphering the mosaics you will gather.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      ><strong>Story</strong></h2>It all began as a trembling flame that turned into\
      \ a full blown conflict between the two faiths. Seeing no other way to stop\
      \ the unnecessary bloodshed, the Templars acted as ambassadors and signed a\
      \ peace treaty with the vikings. <br>Years passed and the Dark Ages began bringing\
      \ hunger, famine, plague and violence. The common people believed that the peace\
      \ treaty with the heathens unleashed God's Wrath.They started protests throughout\
      \ the kingdoms and soon enough the Templars were arrested and the peace treaty\
      \ voided. One Templar Knight managed to escape.<br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1082890/extras/c1-village1.gif?t=1609406758\"\
      \ /><br>The last Templar went on a quest to find the Holy Grail. His only wish\
      \ was to put an end to the Dark Ages and heal the world. Through his perseverance\
      \ he managed to find the Holy Grail, put an end to the peace treaty and be proclaimed\
      \ Emperor by the people.Through this new position and with the aid of the Holy\
      \ Grail, he restored the Templars\u2019 Order, this time as a military force\
      \ with the purpose of eradicating all the heathens and avoiding a new Dark Age.<br>Witnessing\
      \ the unnecessary bloodshed of innocent people, a Sergeant has a change of heart\
      \ and turns his back on his fellow Crusaders during his Teuton Knight Initiation\
      \ process.  <br>Trying to reconnect with your people, from whom you were taken\
      \ as a child, and to put an end to the Templar oppression, you will rediscover\
      \ your original Gods and you will be harnessing their powers. You will find\
      \ out the legend of an ancient weapon that could change everything.<br><br><img\
