This game has almost nothing that would make me want to play it again. £7.19 isn't much for a game, but for £7.19 I would expect something that is at least fun to play. This game could be really good but it would need more updates to get to that point. If you have £7 to spend, find something that you can actually have a good time playing.","timestamp_created":1608050595,"timestamp_updated":1608050595,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y5rSs/YCfOe9ugI="}
