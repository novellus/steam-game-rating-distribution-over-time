This game does them no justice.\n\nMaybe I forgot how Solitaire works over the years, but I'm pretty sure I was playing something completely different, maybe Dogeitaire?\nThe game is kind of confusing, even with a tutorial it lacks the ability to give you the information you need to 100% understand how all of the mechanics and progression work.\nEarn money for completing games, earn more for getting a \"Perfect\" hand and using all of your cards. Spend your money at the Pet Store to unlock perks used in-game and training for your dog.\n\nAside from the glitches, lack of explanation and not being Solitaire, this game makes cats look better than dogs. Therefore I'm going to have to not recommend it to others. Nobody should think cats are better than dogs. Not on my watch!\n\n3/10 - Not doge approved.","timestamp_created":1577529399,"timestamp_updated":1577529544,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1NGFpu8Cffza5wE="}
