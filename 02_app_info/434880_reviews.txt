Sure, it may still take some trial and error to fully understand what things do, but that can happen even in games where you have text descriptions.\nMusic is good, sounds are great, and I also appreciate that any gear you equip shows up on your character model.\nOne of the most common complaints is the slow pace, but I find myself leaning more towards agreeing with the developer on this one.  If enemies moved too quickly, you could miss quite a bit of what's going on.  You need to be able to pay attention to how many tiles an enemy can travel so that you can learn their patterns, which panels they're stepping on, which traps they're triggering, the tiles the traps are affecting, and so on.\nGiven that the maps aren't that large, and once you advance so far, you then have guards chasing you from behind, it essentially forces you to pay close attention to your surroundings and carefully work out how you plan on making it to the floor exit.  Whether or not you're going to skip grabbing some goodies because the guards are too close for comfort, or if you're going to risk walking into a trap zone because the consequences of staying put are much worse, etc.\nThis isn't an easy game, but I wouldn't necessarily say it's harder than any other rogue-like, just difficult in its own unique way, if that makes any sense.","timestamp_created":1609684803,"timestamp_updated":1609767673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yqvo5vYCdZGLwAI="}
