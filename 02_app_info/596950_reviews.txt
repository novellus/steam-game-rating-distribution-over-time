It may not be the most forgiving game, and its saving system definitely leaves a lot to be desired. However, the dialogue is hilarious enough to make up for it. Sometimes it's clearly intentional, other times it isn't. I've heard weird philosophical statements, spongebob references, a guy claiming he's wario, and tons of boomer jokes. All with the most ridiculous voice acting I've ever heard. I paid under $3 for this game and it was money well spent.","timestamp_created":1609823966,"timestamp_updated":1609823966,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws4q/6PYCcvHNwAI="}
