There are no combos or 'special moves'. The focus is on reaction based blocking, as failure to block will have dire consequences. <br>Due to this alternative focus, Endless Knight might take a few minutes to adapt to, but we hope that once you get the gist, you will love it as much as we do!<br>Played alone or with friends, mastering Endless Knight can be jolly good fun!<\/i>","about_the_game":"<strong>Enjoy getting 'legless' with friends?<\/strong><br>Well, now you can cut each other's arms and legs off as you've always dreamed!<br>Unlike 'proper' games, Endless Knight lets you continue to fight even after you have become separated from your limbs.
