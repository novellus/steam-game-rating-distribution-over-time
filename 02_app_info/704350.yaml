      s unique gameplay style, your objective is to spot the weak spots on meteors\
      \ and act fast to destroy them before they get to you. That\u2019s not all -\
      \ you must collect the bare necessities th at you\u2019re rewarded with for\
      \ each meteor destroyed. To ensure a prolonged experience you must collect fuel\
      \ and service your ship if it is damaged along the way. As the sole survivor\
      \ and carrier of your mission, you must push through the escalating meteor cluster\
      \ and beat your own and other global player high-scores."
