    review: Do NOT spend money on this. It's a very pretty model, but super glitchy.
      The plane would constantly glitch on the ground, and it made the runways and
      taxiways glitch out even when I wasn't using this plane. This DLC comes with
      an installer, so I removed everything from it entirely from the FSX directory
      and the game has been back to normal since. It was the only change I made, so
      it must have been this DLC. Come to think, I'll try to manually put the model
      into the FSX:SE directory and see if that works because this DLC comes with
      2 extra Missions and add-on scenery and probably some other garbage that glitches
      the game. Hopefully it's all the ancillary junk that they included that's causing
      this plane to crap out my game and I can actually get my money's worth with
      just the model.
