This game is kind of like Wii Music.\n\nIt has a certain polish to it that makes it fun in a banging on the drums kind of way.\nThe sample triggers are responsive and satisfying to hit.  \n\nIt's more about live playing than production but you can get in a groove and feel like you're jamming.  There are some nice quality samples too.","timestamp_created":1586958005,"timestamp_updated":1586958005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sK6Ev/ECefL9gAI="}
