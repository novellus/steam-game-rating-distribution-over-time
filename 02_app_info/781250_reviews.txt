Yes, ratings will be skewed in by that nostalgia. All the good, the bad, the funny and all the annoying gameplay elements have been preserved and restored exactly how you remember them. I would love nothing more than to see a modern developer remake and/or reboot this IP. The closest thing I can think of that this is like, would have to be Westworld--the other parks, not the wild west park. The story is still quirky & unique and the scope is still ambitious, I can only imagine what this gem could blossom into with some modern TLC.","timestamp_created":1597083683,"timestamp_updated":1597083683,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i+Hm7PMCe6XTmgI="}
