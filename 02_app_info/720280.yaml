    review: "[b]For me this is not an ordinary short story.[/b]\n[b]All the time when\
      \ I went through it I had a lot of emotions, very pleasant game. It's sad that\
      \ it ended right here in this review ... But I need something similar, maybe\
      \ continuation or other games from the same developers. Indescribable feelings\
      \ from this game.[/b]\n\u26A0\uFE0F SPOILERS \u26A0\uFE0F\n[spoiler]So it was\
      \ sad when Mori left, went goose bumps, but then when she came back there was\
      \ such a feeling of joy, words can be difficult to convey ...[/spoiler]\n--------------------------------\n\
      This is the best novel that I've been going through, it's hard to part with\
      \ it so easily.\nI want something like that, my feedback is from the heart."
