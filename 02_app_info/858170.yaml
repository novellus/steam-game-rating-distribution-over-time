    review: Just picked the game up on sale since it had a really interesting setting.
      The game is good, has a very fascinating world war 2 story. Loved the strategic
      aspect of the gameplay, there is a lot of resource management and planning involved.
      I managed to 100% the game with all achievements in about 4 hours. I would love
      to see more content in the setting.
