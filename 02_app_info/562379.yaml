    review: "I'm reccomending this because it has more pros then cons, here are the\
      \ pros:\nThe detail's are great\nit's very fun to drive\nThe Cons:\nEvreything\
      \ need's to be done manually, the only good reason to use the F4 mode is to\
      \ check your coal/fire mass & your speed. \n\nSo, depending on what your preferance\
      \ is, weather you like a challenge or not, buy or don't buy this pack, I reccomend\
      \ it because I love it and don't see any problems with it. also quick peice\
      \ of advice, if you want it to go faster then 20 mph, just put another engine\
      \ behind it (I recommend a gwr hall class) I do this from time to time, just\
      \ like the U.S. day out with thomas events with the dummy locos."
