    about_the_game: 'This short game (20-60 mins gameplay) is designed to teach fraction
      concepts in an exciting interactive sci-fi escape room based game. You explore
      a derelict space station to restore its power, hack its terminals, and get to
      your shuttle to save an endangered planet, while enjoying astonishing views
      of Earth. The gameplay unfolds in a massive 16,000 sq ft highly-detailed space
      station with over 20 sections across 5 floors and 8 game levels. While you solve
      the challenges, you are learning and applying middle school math fraction concepts
      in a step-by-step manner based on actual school syllabi. Unlike most educational
      games, Galactic Protection Squad has been field-tested on hundreds of students,
      and research shows measurable improvements in student learning.<br><br><strong>Educational
      Details:</strong><br>This game examines the following curricular concepts in
      mathematics: simple multiplication, balanced equations, whole numbers, parts
      of a whole number, subtracting from a whole, and visual representations of simple
      fractions. In the first 7 levels, players build their skills in these educational
      concepts and the final level is an assessment, testing the player''s new knowledge.
      There are altogether 40 concepts involving fractions in middle school math,
      and future game episodes will complete the rest of these learning goals.<br><br>Visualizing
      and interacting with fractions is a struggle for many students, in elementary,
      secondary, and university years. This game is a virtual reality experience where
      students build kinesthetic intuition towards operations involving fractions
      while engaging with problem-based activities in an experiential setting. This
      adventure escape room based game allows students to use their curiosity for
      solving the puzzles, which sequentially build the skills necessary to understand,
      visualize and complete operations with fractions.'
