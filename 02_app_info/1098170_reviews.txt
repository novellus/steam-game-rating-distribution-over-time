Bewitching to me.\n\nCon:\nOverly fragmental plot alienates episodes to each other. I have trouble to see how my options affect the whole story, even I tried so hard to imagine each episode is one jigsaw in a bigger picture, but they're not.\nBanal narrative. [spoiler]An antagonist came from no where, without any drive, being eager to murder two broadcast hosts. [/spoiler] And a [spoiler]gas leak[/spoiler] flashback, no connection at all, inserted suddenly. C'mon, I am the one who is getting suffocated. \nPoe overacted in a fulsome manner.","timestamp_created":1609821478,"timestamp_updated":1609821478,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx8u16PYCcf7MwAI="}
