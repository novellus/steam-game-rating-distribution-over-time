      PIGEON HUNTER is a light gun shooter video game in which ducks appear one or
      two at a time, and you are given three shots to shoot them down. You receive
      points upon shooting each duck. If you shoot the required number of ducks in
      a single round, the player will advance to the next round. Simple, right?

    review: This game is exactly what it says it is, a homage to the NES classic Duck
      Hunt.  If you fondly remember the original this will put a smile on your face.  It
      is about as basic as a game can get, but so was the original.  The game is very
      very short, you can play threw it in 5 minuets, but there is replay value for
      a few go rounds here.  I could also fault it for a lack of polish, but that
      could not stop it from putting a smile on this old gamers face.  Totally worth
      a couple bucks if this one sparks any nostalgia for you.
