A word of advice to those struggling with the high score achievements - you can shoot everything, and I mean everything.  I've had several runs with each of the ships, and found the second ship to be the best for my playstyle.  It's slow compared to the others, but it obliterates all who stand in its way muhahaha.  Try each ship and see which one you're most comfortable with.  Keeping your multiplier up is the key to getting a high score.  The multiplier will reset to zero every 4 seconds without a kill, so you've got to be quick at destroying ships... and that's exactly why I found the superior firepower of the second ship to be the best.  Trouble staying alive?  Always keep moving, and be sure to use your boost and special attack.  Good luck!","timestamp_created":1609335535,"timestamp_updated":1609335535,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42e732fYCfcHjvgI="}
