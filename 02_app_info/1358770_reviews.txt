The game has some unique mechanisms (skill point trading system, moving monsters) and puzzle-solving part that require the player to be a big brain in order to beat the game, and player even needs some predictions to dodge the damage! The game currently has a bit bugs that just ruin the momentum a little. BUT as long as the creator keep fixing them, this is a great game to waste another 5 hours of your boring life! Worth the price, recommends add it to wish list.\n\nPros:\n-Unique system, fun to play\n-Moving monsters for you to dodge, sometimes can be challenging!\n-Some FINE anime art, girls are cute\n\nCons:\n-Personally hate the \"stamina\" system, not working so well in this game\n-No hints or skip for puzzle solving, which means small brain like me will easily stuck for a LONG TIME\n-A few bugs, hate to see it\n\nScore:\n7/10","timestamp_created":1598091525,"timestamp_updated":1600593741,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zMi01fQCc/mBnQI="}
