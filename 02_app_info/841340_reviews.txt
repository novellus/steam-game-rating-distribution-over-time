I think there are ways to tweak it to make it more playable, but generally I equate it to playing retro games with touchscreen controls with no tactile feedback and no real accommodation for that either. Cool idea, and for $2 it does what it says on the box, but expect a novel experience, not a serious way to play Tetris.","timestamp_created":1601776718,"timestamp_updated":1601776718,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi6LV+PQCftndpQI="}
