    review: 'It''s a short game with a straightforward story, but it''s still a good
      game to occupy half an hour, if the player chooses to try to see every consequence
      of every choice.


      I do wish there''s more to this game - it left a few bits uninvestigated and
      a few questions unanswered, so I guess it''s something for another time. Needs
      a bit of polishing here and there, but nothing much that impacts the gameplay
      negatively.'
