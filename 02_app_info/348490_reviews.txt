Gets a bit grindy and / or repetitive in the long run, but its multiplayer works quite alright and it can be fun to play with friends. Worth it's price if such a genre hybrid fits you well, if not, might be good to pick it up on sale.","timestamp_created":1597157199,"timestamp_updated":1597157199,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yZn/7vMCfsHomgI="}
