With it's well written lore and characters, Slimes is a game I can very much recommend for people looking for a unique narrative.\nThough I'll also note that the narrative is very morally draining. I found myself putting the game down for days after an hour of playtime out of necessity, so don't go into this expecting something uplifting.\n\nThe turn-based combat is very well designed, constantly encouraging you to come up with new strategies to get past different enemies. Even by the end of the game where I had thought I found an undefeatable strategy, I'd still get caught off guard by encounters where one of the two party members would be stunned or debuffed in a way that countered it. The way combat strategies tied into the story of the two protagonists who completely hated each other made the design all that much better.\n\nOnly complaint I have is in the UI. Slimes suffers from using a very basic version of RPG Maker UI, where the game's core mechanics and the functionality of RPG maker don't fit well together.\nFor example, every time you want to use a gun, you have to use \"Equip Gun\", select the only character who can equip guns, get taken out of the skill menu, then go back into the menu to actually use the gun. This is only a bigger annoyance where if you want to reload outside of combat, you have to manually equip each gun and reload it, going through dozens of menus after each battle.\nThe game does give you a \"Full Reload\" skill about halfway through, but considering it only exists to make the UI less painful, it honestly should have been unlocked from the start.\n\nNone the less, if poor UI and heavy writing don't sound like a deal breaker, very much recommend this to both RPG fans or people looking for a new kind of story.","timestamp_created":1609955829,"timestamp_updated":1609955829,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40Iy27PYCfKyIwQI="}
