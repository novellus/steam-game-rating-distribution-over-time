The game was developed by Daily Magic Productions and published by Big Fish Games Studio.\n\n\"City of Fog\" is the first episode of \"Dark Dimension.\"\n\nSince this is a collector's edition, it comes with extra features that are not available in its counterpart; the standard edition.\n\n[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]\n\nGame Visuals\n\nI want to mention that the visual for the game is nicely done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGame Audio\n\nI want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are no game difficulty modes to choose from.\n\nThe notebook keeps track of the progression in the game. Such as story events and clues.\n\nThere is no interactive map in the game. The player has to remember where to go in the game.\n\nThere is no padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in place. The inventory panel does slide up when it is being moused over.\n\nThe hidden object scenes consist of the following: Traditional word lists. Some of these hidden object scenes may require little or no interactions.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them.\n\nSince this is a collector's edition game, there is a bonus chapter, it can be accessed only after the main story is completed.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThere are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Game's Strategy Guide; Soundtracks; Concept Art and Wallpapers. Most of these extra features can be accessed only after the entire game is completed.\n\nFinal thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.","timestamp_created":1547092115,"timestamp_updated":1600537833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.576566338539123535","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44qXf0/QCdtr3twE="}
