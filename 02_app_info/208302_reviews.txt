However it is still a good route with good scenarios and a very nice driving experience. The scenery looks empty by more recent standards but you probably won't care when you find how great the route is. It was great to get back to this route after so long not playing Rail Simulator (doesn't work well in modern pcs)","timestamp_created":1610132516,"timestamp_updated":1610132516,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyo3Y8fYCfIDOwQI="}
