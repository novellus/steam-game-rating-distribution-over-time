So some places have enemies impossible to kill but who hurt you a lot, some places have enemies that you can kill but who hurt you for 1 or 2 HP and some places have enemies that you kill with them giving you no damage.\n\nThe combat is not the main attraction of the game. It's mostly about solving puzzles and figuring out secret paths. There are vague hints to things but the game doesn't hold your hand almost at all, ever, and that's what's so great about it. You will feel you are stuck, but when you end up finding a new hidden path or solving a puzzle it feels really good.\n\nNow, at this current moment I finally feel like I'm actually really stuck so it could be that's the end for my game :D\nTried to get some help from the forum but let's see if the dev or someone else helps.\nBut even in this situation, while wandering around aimlessly, just going through as many screens as possible trying to see what I have missed, I was able to find a couple of new things I had missed, but neither of them helped with what I was trying to achieve. Still it did make me feel that maybe there is a way.\n\nIt's relatively fast to go around the world, and you will even end up unlocking some teleporters that help you going through the world faster.\n\nThe game does look and sound a bit cheap and unpolished and amateurish especially compared to the likes of Fairune, but make no mistake, there's a lot of love poured in to this game. It's fantastic gameplaywise and the puzzles end up getting quite tough the further you go and you have to give attention to what you see in the world or you will end up getting stuck in no time.\n\nThe music sounds like MIDI music, and it perhaps is. While the initial gameplay music gets a bit too repetitive after a while, there are some very good songs playing during the game. Each new area has its own music and a few of them are REALLY good. And again, there's a bit of \"unpolished amateurness\" in the music but many of them are actually very good compositions and you'll probably end up humming some of them when you are not playing the game.\n\nDeaths are pretty rare in this game. Just be patient, grind a bit, use save/heal points efficiently with grinding and you have no problem. In later game there will be some enemies that are impossible to kill and who kill you immediately upon touch, but you are warned about it. Those are the places you end up seeing the Game Over screen, but those screens are really fun to try to get through (and the game over tune is great!). As said, the main challenge in the game is to figure out puzzles and secret paths completely on your own.\n\nI'm playing this with and Xbox360 controller and it works well with it. Sometimes you have to tinker around a bit in the menu screen before the controller is fully working, but it works well after that. And the controller only uses the directional and one action button while menu/map/inventory/etc buttons are usable only on the keyboard, so that design seems odd. If you play with the keyboard only then there obviously aren't any problems with that.\n\ntl;dr\nThe game looks and sounds a bit unpolished and amateurish but don't let it fool you, it's a FANTASTIC game and if you love games that don't hold your hand you will love this.","timestamp_created":1601556314,"timestamp_updated":1601556314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+b6M8vQCevyYpQI="}
