The year two promo cards are phenominal. I'm especially a fan of the additions to Trade Fed. Since WWG doesn't seem to want to tell you what you're buying, see below for the new ships. Also, as far as I can tell, it adds 2 new ships per faction, not 1 base + 1 ship as advertised.\n\nExplanation: T=Trade, HP=Authority/Health/Whatever, C=Combat\n- Unaligned: [b]Merc Battlecruiser:[/b] 6-cost; pick-your-faction with Draw 1\n- Trade Fed: [b]Federal Transport: [/b]2-cost; 1T 5HP, faction +2T <- my favorite here, a great inclusion to any deck\n- Trade Fed: [b]Security Craft:[/b] 4-cost; 4C 3HP, faction +3T\n- Trade Fed: [b]Bounty Hunter:[/b] 5-cost; 7C, faction +5HP\n- Star Empire: [b]Imperial Smuggler:[/b] 2-cost; 3C and [i]Draw a card, then discard a card.[/i]; scrap +2T\n- Star Empire: [b]Knightstar:[/b] 5-cost; 6C, and [i]if opponent has a base in play, gain an additional 3C[/i]; scrap Draw 1\n- Blob: [b]War Kite:[/b] 2-cost; 5C; scrap to destroy target base.\n- Blob: [b]Stellar Ray:[/b] 5-cost; 3C, Draw 1; scrap +6C\n- Machine Cult: [b]Probe Bot:[/b] 1T, scrap 1; faction Draw 1; scrap +3C <- [i]possibly the best low-cost scrapper in the game at this point. Some trade, draw, AND self-scrap when no longer needed![/i] \n- Machine Cult: [b]Cargo Mech:[/b] 5-cost; 4T, scrap 1; faction Destroy Base\n\nGambits are nice; in the physical card game, I love using them in a draft-pick system, where player 1 picks one, player two picks 2, then player 1 picks his second; after the match (if playing more than one), remove the 4 chosen gambits from the pool for the next draft pick (to prevent repetition).\n\nSame as with the previous gambits in this set, though, you're stuck with the bland 2-at-random base mechanic, which sucks and often leaves one player possibly feeling helpless.\n\nSome of the gambits are a huge departure from the previous set though, which is nice. The one that lets your vipers do +2C actually makes vipers useful throughout the game. There are a couple in there that let you scrap early on, which gives you a massive advantage over the one who doesn't have it. Scrap both my vipers on turn 1? Yes, please.\n\nHowever, I've noticed that a couple of the gambits in the digital version are gimped compared to their physical counterparts. And, I realized that it's because WWG didn't actually code in a persistant scrap heap, or the ability to add cards to the trade lineup. \n\nCompare:\n\n[Physical] Black Market: Add an additional space to the trade row above Black Market. Once per turn, the player who revealed Black Market may acquire a card from this space for one less than its trade cost. Otherwise, it functions as a normal trade row space for all players.\n\nWith:\n\n[Digital] Black Market: Scrap: Choose a faction. This turn, all cards of that faction cost 1T less than normal.\n\nAnd compare:\n\n[Physical] Triumphant Return: Scrap to Draw 1; When you reveal this Gambit, you may pay the cost of a card in the scrap heap and put it into your hand. (Scouts and Vipers cost 0)\n\nWith:\n\n[Digital] Triumphant Return: Scrap: Pay the cost of a card in your discard pile to put it into your hand. (Scouts and Vipers cost 0).\n\nSo yeah, I am underwhelmed with the gambits themselves. Get the set for the ships, though.","timestamp_created":1533335681,"timestamp_updated":1533335877,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.663709640502929688","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42Jb8gOUCdI/EpwE="}
