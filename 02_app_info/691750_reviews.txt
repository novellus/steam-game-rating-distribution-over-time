Windows mode allows for a much larger viewing area.  This game is quite old school arcade (for those of you that remember the old quarter eaters) in many ways including the one thing I really disliked which is that some of the bosses are WAY over powered.  Specifically the ones that just slam into you as you don't have any hope to move fast enough to get out of the way.  You can be at full life and shield and within Â½ a second of being rammed, your done.","timestamp_created":1608405910,"timestamp_updated":1608405910,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn9CdvvYCdqLBuwI="}
