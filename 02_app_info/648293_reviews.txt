Just a handful of hairpins.\n\nMugello: Both layouts are excellent and have a great attention to detail.\n\nCars:\n\nF355 Challenge:  Absolutely fantastic. It is an absolute dream to drive- especially with a stick-shift.\n\nFerrari Gr. 4 car ( I can't remember the name) Looks great, sounds great, drives great- but it is unbalanced. It can compete easily with the weaker Gr. 5 cars, but it is in gr. 4. It is way more powerful than the Beemer pro-car and the Porsche spirit of Le mans car. \n\n458 speciale: It's... alright. It just feels like another super-car.\n\n250 GT + testarossa- My favorite car in this pack. It balances well with the other GTC cars, and it expands the category nicely. Same story with the 250 testarossa.\n\nF12tdf- fantastic car to drive- the lowish down-force gives it a great feel of the point where excitement meets fear. Ferrari territory.\n\nFXXK- This car is absolutely nuts! But I don't like it. It has 1,000 horsepower carried through the rear wheels, and it feels as if the first four gears are just not present- their ratios are so short- and cannot be extended... It also feels as if it never has any grip, even in slow corners.\n\nF40: fun car, however hard to drive.\n\n\nOverall, I give this pack a 7/10- the best cars far outweigh the issues. Wait for it to go on sale, and you will be quite happy.\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1609263145,"timestamp_updated":1609263145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gtzj1/YCffrAvgI="}
