    review: Moto Racer 4 is quite challenging and has a good variety of different
      tracks and bikes. In addition, you can unlock more characters over time. The
      controls feel a bit clumsy at first, and it takes some time to get used to.
      If you can overlook the fact that the title is not a graphics bomb, you can
      look forward to a solid arcade racer with fun gameplay elements. Fans of the
      old Moto Racer parts should definitely try Moto Racer 4, as the game is not
      offered at full price either.
