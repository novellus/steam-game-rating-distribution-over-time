There are two primary reasons:\n\n1. Content: There just isn't enough content. \n     a. Main Story: You can play through everything that is here within 10-12 hours.\n     b. Variety of Content: There simply isn't much unique about the towns, different parts of the \n         map, magic, weapons, enemies, etc. At the moment one of the criticisms of the \n         development path is that the devs have put in too much focus on expanding the \n         \"content\" of the game by focusing on equipment rather than the story or size of the \n         world. I personally would rather have a more limited weapon and character set while \n         having a longer story to play than have a good variety of weapons but a short game.\n\n2. Game Mechanics: Like other people I have to complain about the \"save\" mechanic in this game. You can only save the game by sleeping in a bed. Beds are located in towns and camps. I wasted so much time in the early game because I tried to play through quests without going back to the town and saving my progress midway through the quest. With my character and equipment choices it simply wasn't possible to finish certain missions without going back. I didn't have enough health and had yet to acquire good armor. After failing multiple missions several times I finally decided to defeat half the enemies in a mission before returning to town to save. This made the game play more of an annoyance than enjoyable. This could be fixed by giving the user the ability to buy a \"bed roll\" that they could use at different parts of the map. \n\nI realize that the model of game development lately has been to release a game to early access before it's finished, get some financial support, and then finish it. If people don't buy the game as it is will the devs keep working on it? I don't know but even if you do pay there is no guarantee they will finish it or that if you buy it today they'll finish it fast enough that you'll still care about the game at that time.\n\nI can't recommend people spend their money on this game at this time. Even if this game had twice the content it's hard to know if I'd recommend it for $20. I bought it for $13.99 and I can't recommend it at that price either. I think there are games that are finished and or superior in their current state for the same or less money.\n\nSome people might think that someone like me spending $13.99 for nearly 20 hours of playtime is worth it but I'd have to disagree. The first 8 hours I didn't enjoy that much. I like to solve puzzles so figuring out a way through a challenge, even one that isn't enjoyable, is something I regularly do. I think many people would quit and there are large numbers of reviews at under  8 hours. The other 10 hours were more enjoyable overall but I found the save issue to be a constant annoyance and the lack of content as I traveled was constantly on my mind. \n\nSave your time and money - at least for now. Check back in 6 months. This game has a long way to go.","timestamp_created":1609849222,"timestamp_updated":1609849506,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwjcGg6fYCfrHXwAI="}
