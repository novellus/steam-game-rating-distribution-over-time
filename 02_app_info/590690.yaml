    review: "Play this game.\n\nYes, there aren't that many people who play this as\
      \ much as Pavlov or VRChat. \nYes, I only have 3 hours into this game. I just\
      \ beat the single player races just to get gold medals in all of them. I'm about\
      \ to move into the challenge track sections, while I'm still looking for a group\
      \ of people to play this now and then. \n\nBut this game has some fast paced\
      \ action that is matched by it's catchy fucking soundtrack. In a niche market\
      \ that's plagued by shooters, Sprint Vector offers a refreshing change of pace."
