    about_the_game: Stage of Light is a lighting sandbox where you can build stages
      with procedural modelling tools and control both lights and stage structures
      with integrated DMX controllers.<br>Every device in the game can be triggered
      with DMX signal.<br>You can program them from DMX controllers and create nice
      light shows.<br><br><strong>Builder features</strong><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>19
      lighting fixtures with different effects and capabilities.<br></li><li>Fire
      machine with DMX control.<br></li><li>7-axis industrial robot with 3 different
      size(can be controlled with DMX too).<br></li><li>Ability to build stage trusses
      with almost any shape or size.<br></li><li>A special stage builder system that
      helps you to erect a stage with a few clicks,<br>if necessary resizes trusses
      when you move them around.<br></li><li>Scaffolding truss builder system that
      allows you to the create scaffolding structures very easily.<br></li><li>Video
      panel builder system which allows you to install huge video panels on scaffolding
      structures.<br></li><li>Cube builder system to create stage floors or other
      interesting shapes.<br></li><li>Undo/Redo system for almost all building operations(Move,
      Rotate, Scale, Add, Remove etc.).<br></li><li>Position and Rotation snapping
      options for ease of use.<br><br><strong>Lighting controllers</strong><br><br>Dmx

      Effect Generator<br>- Chase Modulator<br><br>All Dmx consoles can be controlled
      by clicking their buttons or moving faders &amp; wheels.<br>Playbacks can be
      triggered by moving faders with mouse or key presses from your keyboard.<br>If
      you have an external MIDI controller you can also trigger playbacks with it.<br><br><strong>Visual
      Content</strong><br>In the game there is a 2D graphics engine which generates
      visuals to display them on video panels. You can use built-in graphics or configure
      them with the visual scripting system in the game. Mapping 2D visuals to video
      panels can be done with a few clicks.<br><br>In this sandbox you can record
      everything you have done in the game to a save file and load the save file later
