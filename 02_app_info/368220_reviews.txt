But this game is probably the next best. Lovely looking maps and graphics for a CC game, nice sounds, and good UI make it the most modern CC game to play if you want hand drawn maps as opposed to the most recent 3d ones (which I personally dont like)\n\nWhen I first started the game my mouse was scrolling the window far too fast. But someone recommended I change the Windows 10 mouse precision in the mouse settings to 'on' and that seems to have sorted the map scrolling to a reasonable speed. Still shoots off occasionally but most of the time is fine now.\n\nYou get lovely French maps in this game with lots of good US units and tanks against an outnumbered German army so its similar to other CC games in that you either play defensively or offensively depending on which side and game you like to play. \n\nNow that I have my mouse issue sorted I would say this game and Cross of Iron are the two best Close combats games you can get today. And they are both superb, suspenseful, intensive, and immersive games to play.","timestamp_created":1609595682,"timestamp_updated":1609876762,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2b2I6vYCdNbdvwI="}
