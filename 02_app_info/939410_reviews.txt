One large map with seven items to find.  Finding an item triggers a baddie which walks around for a few moments before disappearing.  You'll run in the large map from location to location and there may be creatures in the woods which will just disappear after they are triggered for a few moments or you just outrun them.  Honestly, the first one I saw was stuck in the gate of the \"House\" area and it looked like a ghost chicken spreadeagled.   I think they are supposed to be baby ghosts?  At the beginning of the game your journal details what the entire story is.  Exploration for notes and other story items is pointless in the game.,  There are small arbitrary scrawlings or notes that do nothing to add to the story.  You are just supposed to find the seven items, drop them in the lake, the exit is highlighted and \"Game Over\" when you go there.  No additional story.  No bosses.  Nothing.  It's absolutely not worth 10 bucks.  2 bucks is about where this game should be and you should only bother to play it if you are really bored with nothing else to do.","timestamp_created":1597029470,"timestamp_updated":1597029470,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8/mX6/MCcNvCmgI="}
