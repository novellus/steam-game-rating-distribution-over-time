A twice widowed woman who died in 1935 leaving no will and no heir. It's said the maze was a crazed project she had worked away at for years before her death. She had fervently planted and shaped the trees muttering about looky loos, and nosey brats as it grew bigger each year, surrounding her house and grounds, and slowly growing taller and taller. After nearly 8 years without anyone seeing her, the local authorities assumed her dead, and entered the maze. They found her home in a state of disrepair, food clearly long rotten, and it appeared no one had lived in it for quite a long time. They searched the home, and what they could of the maze itself, but failed to find her body or any information regarding her death. Without a will in place, her property was left to the state, and turned into a local park, open to the fair when it visited town.<br><br>It's said that from time to time kids will wander in on a dare, or couples will enter trying to find old Ethel's home as a quiet place to be together. Often they come out safe and sound, if a little excitable, but the town has always had a higher than normal rate of missing persons. No one has ever been found in the maze. In the light of day it's simply an overgrown hedge, and a dilapidated home from the late 1800s.<br><br>This year the maze has been designated as an attraction and the Fair needs some help setting up after previous employees have either quit or disappeared.","about_the_game":"<img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1302240\/extras\/Maze_1_steam.png?t=1603921119\" \/><br>Labyrinthine is a cooperative horror game that may make you never step into a hedge maze again...<br><br>You and up to 3 friends can embark in an online cooperative experience as you try to unravel the mystery of the abandoned happisburg hedge maze.
