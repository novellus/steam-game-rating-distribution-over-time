Find the interesting Characters of Helmia and recruit them to join your forces.

These Characters have different races and different classes, the race and class changes the Characters Abilities and stats. An example of a Character is a Guard who is a Human and a Knight. <br \/>\r\nEvery Character has four abilities, which you can always change with older or newer abilities as you progress the game. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen exploring the world you will enter so called Dangerous Zones, where you have to fight Bandits or other Captains. You will send out three Characters to face the threat (or less if the rest of your Characters have &quot;died&quot;), your Characters have Health, Stamina and etc. The Health and Stamina is the most important to keep your focus on, if the Health reaches zero then the Character will &quot;die&quot; and you will replace them with another Character who hasn't &quot;died&quot;. If all of your Characters have &quot;died&quot; then you have lost the fight. <br \/>\r\nEvery time your Characters use an Ability they will lose Stamina and you need Stamina to perform Abilities.

The first is to change your Character with another in your party, when they are not in combat they will rest and regain Stamina every turn. The other one is to rest your Character whilst in combat, they will regain more Stamina but they still can be targeted by the enemies. <br \/>\r\nIn combat you can also use items to regain Health, Stamina or to increase your other stats on your Characters.","about_the_game":"In Crossroads of Helmia you will explore the world, meet its inhabitants and build your own team.
