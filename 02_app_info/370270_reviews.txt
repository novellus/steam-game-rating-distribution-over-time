This vortex leads to a fifth and, up until now, lost dimension. If he succeeds in defeating us, he will destroy our world, opening a gateway for his kind as well as the strange mutating effect that this dimension has on all organic life forms. His forces are far too strong for us to defeat in a frontal attack which is why I was sent to slip past his Omni-eye scanners and make an assassination attempt on the greatest evil that man has ever known. It will take absolutely all of my wits and skill but it is imperative that I reach his fortress and send him back to the sulfurous plane from whence he came.","timestamp_created":1488166390,"timestamp_updated":1593287727,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.556650280952453613","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+arW+/ICfIagcw=="}
