Often you'll feel trapped and don't know what's expected of you in these strange escape rooms featuring cold, technical CAD graphics overlayed with crayon characters, a contrast that in some rooms works quite well and in others it only looks jarring.\n\n[i]Hope[/i] doesn't provide much feedback when trying out item combinations, the English translation is wonky at best, but SOMETHING about it, maybe the sternness and total lack of self-awareness, draws me in. But it's definitely not for someone looking for an easy, relaxed experience, more like... playing with a rock you found on the lawn, all by yourself.","timestamp_created":1599378214,"timestamp_updated":1599401400,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542546391487121582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7JLwsfQCcqmPoAI="}
