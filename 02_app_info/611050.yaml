    review: This is rad. Moriarty Endgame is a bold step towards the future of the
      graphic novel/comic book. I had to play through twice since the first play I
      was so focused on the creative shader use and the blending of 2D comic sprites
      in a 3D immersive plane that the story went right over my head. The creators
      throw us right into the world of Moriarty with very little hand holding -- which
      is nice. The writing and art style are consistent with a high fidelity voice
      over and sound effects leading the pace. I was briefly removed for one moment
      in a scene where we learn how Moriarty gained his super power. It felt forced
      and unnecessary in comparison to the subtilty in which other major plot points
      were revealed. That being said, the dark matter super power story will make
      a great episode on its own. It also moved a little fast for my taste. One thing
      that is wholy unique to comics as apposed to digital media is the ability to
      'travel at your own pace.' To handle this the developers implemented a simple
      forward and reverse feature that allows you to easily restart a scene or skip
      to the next (I would guess each scene is the equivelent to 1-5 panels in a normal
      book).  Still, I think there could be a more creative way to let the reader
      move at their own pace. These are nit picking observations, and at the end of
      the day Moriarty provides a concise and cohesive product, which is twice as
      impressive when you consider they are paving the way. I am excited to see what
      the team puts out as they become more comfortable exploring this new take on
      the media.
