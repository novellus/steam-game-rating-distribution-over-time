The desire to play \"one more round\" is through the roof! And the movement somehow feels unique and fun! Getting in the zone with this game feels amazing! And very souls-like in the way that you win by getting better and learning patterns, and a tiny bit of luck in how and when those patterns come out at times. Highly recommended!","timestamp_created":1609590056,"timestamp_updated":1609590056,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538590610027313232","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxOTC4fYCfdLavwI="}
