    review: 'I quite enjoyed this game.  A childcare worker senses all is not well
      at a home.  A little boy is locked away by his stepfather because of his psychic
      abilities.  It is part of an evil plan by a politician.  You are on the run
      with the boy to avoid the politicians henchmen catching you as you delve into
      the child''s background.  What you find horrifies you.

      The storyline sounds over the top, but it is so well executed that it is believable.  Graphics
      are crisp and sharp.  Voiceovers are good and so is the music.  It is a gripping
      story with an extra chapter.  HO scenes are shadow items which you use to interact
      with other objects in the scene.  Puzzles are on the easy side, but are varied.

      My only gripe is that I couldn''t go fullscreen in this game as the picture
      was tearing all the time.  Yes, I did adjust vsync to no avail.  Someone suggested
      a free program which helped a lot.

      It took me 5 enjoyable hours to play, but buy on sale.  Hope they make a sequel.  8/10.'
