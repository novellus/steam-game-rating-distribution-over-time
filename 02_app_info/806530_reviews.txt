It has the same cyberpunk aesthetic, the same RPG-ish elements where you can customize your character with cybernetic enhancements, and a story about mega corporations destroying the world.  This is 1000% my kind of game.  The graphics look like a higher end SNES game, and the music is awesome and keeps you pumped as you blast your way through hordes of androids and cultists.  There are six different characters to choose from and almost endless ways to customize them, so there is a ton of replayability.  Yeah, some people may not care for the grind of leveling up your characters, but there's no reason that you HAVE to do that.  I have my two favorite classes and I'm focusing on leveling them up.  I don't care much for the \"tank\" characters so they'll probably end up the last to be maxed out.  Plus the devs have a double XP event going on now, so it's the perfect time to give it a shot and get your characters a great head start.","timestamp_created":1608839093,"timestamp_updated":1608839093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528972983360290527","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sIuSy/YCfIDuvAI="}
