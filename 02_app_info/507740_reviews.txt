It's all relatively good stuff and is done in a very fast succinct manner. However at the same time I feel like the creator of the tutorial should've bundled this together with a much broader lesson on lineart to give more value. As it is 5$ for something you could have obtained fairly easily from a book on drawing lineart.","timestamp_created":1520589744,"timestamp_updated":1520589744,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552845537662506104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+MSNheICd5qWmwE="}
