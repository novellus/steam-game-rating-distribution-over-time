I was quite wrong.\n\nI know it's a cheap little indie game, but I found it boring. When you create a save, you are immediately put to work, coming up with a movie. You hire actors and actresses, directors and staff. Then you wait for something because you can't continue until something happens? I don't get what I'm waiting for because the game makes it confusing. At this point I decide that I'm bored, I've just wasted 10 minutes of my time and I want a refund.","timestamp_created":1477808975,"timestamp_updated":1588388211,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.348607629537582397","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k5XU6fECfvitZA=="}
