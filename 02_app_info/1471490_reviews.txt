I wasn't expecting so much quality in it. I started to play unpretentiously and while playing I realized how wonderful this game is as much as in gameplay and 2D graphics. Each level requires more attention and prowess because they eventually get harder than the previous ones, with new features, new tasks and new items. Every run of this game makes you wanting to get the best of the level, which are 3-stars and that only will be possible whether you start thinking faster, memorizing the timing and the orders of when each task needs to be done.","timestamp_created":1607436176,"timestamp_updated":1607436176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":32,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.443605631589889526","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqLGqofYCcoKYuAI="}
