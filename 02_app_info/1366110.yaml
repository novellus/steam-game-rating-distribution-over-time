      /><br><br>Inspired by the popular Punch-Out!! and the obscure Neo Geo series
      Crossed Swords, the arcade-style Child Arms is a game in which you can fight
      all foes to reach each character's personalized ending, or you can duke it out
      in online or local battles. You can also play mini-games and even alter characters'
      appearances and behaviours in the color and AI editors.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1366110/extras/IF_10-5-20_3-28-02_PM.gif?t=1606876131"
      /><br>Child Arms takes place in a 16th century unlike our own, wherein humankind
      remains youthful far longer, and have accordingly shaped their world differently
      from ours. As a player, you can select one of 8 fighters from varied backgrounds
      as they explore their previously-undiscovered world, rising to the challenge
      of combatants along the way.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Large
