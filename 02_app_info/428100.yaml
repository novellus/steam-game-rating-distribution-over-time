      /><br><br>Travel Beyond the Reality You''ve Always Known. <br><br>Two thousand
      years ago, the Kingdom of Jastamune was thrust into a war, the only survivor
      being a magician known as Reverent Sulada. In a last-ditch effort to save the
      Kingdom, she encases herself in magic and sleeps for two thousand years, eventually
      being unearthed by the Alpha Omega Company, dedicated to researching the implications
      of their pollution-filled world. <br><br>As she is freed from her magical spell,
      nobody knows what to make of her, and the leader of the company - La''lele -
      refuses to help at first. However, she, as well as many of her other employees,
      are magically transported to the past by Sulada, much to her chagrin. Despite
      her dismay, the world of the past is pollution-free - a perfect opportunity
      for study, to the delight of the company''s research leader, Faryl. <br><br>As
      research begins, La''lele and her companions try to complete their mission as
      quickly as possible, but quickly realise their situation is much more dire than
      it thought to be, when they discover who they are fighting against... <br> <br>Explore
      the land of Jastamune through the eyes of the leader of the Alpha Omega Company
      - and put a stop to the war that changed the world two thousand years ago! <br><br><img
