The art style might not be the hyper realism some people are looking for, but it is genuinely pretty in some places. The exploration part, for example, leads to areas with all sorts of nooks and crannies to explore, dolphins to swim with, etc. \n\nI was just sort of mesmerized as the dolphins go through different behaviors, including diving, surface feeding, corkscrews through the water, etc. Even their calls change. It has a ton of potential that was sadly never realized and I agree, the controls are clunky and broken.\n\nYou can only move forward or twist your hand in an strange way to go backward or to the side, but you can't turn. Sometimes it felt like I was fighting the Rift controllers. Others I was flying through the water. I'll still give it a thumbs up as the statues let you explore even when the broken climbing and jumping mechanic don't. \n\nAlso, swimming with dolphins and blue whales. It's just a shame it was never completed.","timestamp_created":1577331002,"timestamp_updated":1577331031,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4va+QoO8CdrGG5wE="}
