Sometimes we gamers and developers are not open to new experiences, we often avoid anything that isn't \"player-friendly\", but doing this we close ourselves to experience other kinds of emotions. Eternal return is one of those games that try to achieve something different, something that defies the norm.  The lack of polishing works in its favor, creating a world that is hard even to move around. If it was the intention of the creator to create this feeling or he just accidentally did this, we may never know for sure. In my opinion, Eternal Return ask a question to us \" Do we really love video games as a media for any kind of experience, or we just love to be spoon fed and gain instant gratification?\"\n\nIf your answer is the first one, then you should play this game.","timestamp_created":1550369367,"timestamp_updated":1550369367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.572222232818603516","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4veTN/OgCduWKuwE="}
