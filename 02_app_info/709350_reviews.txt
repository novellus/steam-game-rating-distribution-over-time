Only downside is that there seems to be an unreleased (at least on Steam) sequel that might complete the trilogy.\n\nWould recommend. Buy the bundle.","timestamp_created":1536117422,"timestamp_updated":1536117422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.554655849933624268","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+/bu0+UCcvGFqgE="}
