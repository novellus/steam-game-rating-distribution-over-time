      /><br><br>Our story follows Lauren Northfield, an FBI agent  who was unlucky
      enough to have received an unsolicited parcel through the mail. In it, a key,
      and a small note that read:<br><br><i>&quot;We look forward to your visit.&quot;</i><br><br>Two
      years prior, a co-worker of hers had received the same parcel and invitation.
      Only he never came back. Desperate to establish her reputation at the bureau,
      Lauren resolved to finding out the truth behind the origin of the parcel, as
      well as the fate of her friend. Her investigation leads her to a dilapidated,
      mysterious motel hidden behind a thick fog, said to have been abandoned decades
      ago... <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1451370/extras/Uncover_the_Secrets2.png?t=1609300861"

      /><br><strong>E</strong>xplore a sprawling, twisted 3D motel that is occupied
      by eerie tenants who hold secrets that could be the key to freedom. In classic
      survival horror fashion, explore through cinematic, fixed-camera perspective,
      utilizing tank controls and managing inventory --- all the nostalgic utilities
      you'd come to expect. As a one-man band, there were limitations in what I could
      implement, but paying homage to the old style of horror was something I had
      to give considerable attention to; details could not be compromised as I pursued
      a genuine return to form that I'd felt was missing in the more action-oriented
      turn that survival horror has taken.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1451370/extras/Find_The_Truth2.png?t=1609300861"

      /><br><strong>Q</strong>uestion the evasive folks at the Motel who seemed to
      know more than they let on; get the truth, dig deep for the information that
      someone --- or something --- desperately wants to keep hidden. I took the liberty
      of diverting from the original formula to implement dialogue choices. Adding
      conversational branches, even if the choices aren't particularly plentiful,
      can add much more to the immersion. <br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1451370/extras/Escape_The_Nightmare2.png?t=1609300861"

      /><br><strong>F</strong>ight your way through the dark apparitions clawing at
      your back, desperate to drag your corpse into the deepest, inescapable tombs
      that hold all souls who dared to pass through the mist and lodge at the Moonlight
      Motel. There's a haunting dynamic found in playing someone vulnerable and frail,
      which adds to the anxiety of gameplay. I spent almost a year creating a video
      game that pays homage to that old school PS2 style survival horror. I wanted
      to return that feeling of dread, vulnerability, and mystery that has been lost
      for some time.
