    review: "This DLC is quite straightforward. It allows you to create a non-historic\
      \ character to start your dynasty off. The character takes the place of a historical\
      \ character, and you get to choose his or her dynasty name and shield, age,\
      \ stats and traits, appearance, religion, culture and if you\u2019re married\
      \ (with children). Some things, like traits, cost points though and you have\
      \ a limited amount of points, so you can\u2019t make Crusader Clark Kent (without\
      \ cheating). Starting off with a custom ruler will also disable achievements.\n\
      \nAn argument can be made that this DLC should be free, because it doesn't add\
      \ any content. On the other hand, customization in strategy games is not a given\
      \ (I don't think any other Paradox Grand Strategy game had had any significant\
      \ amount of customization prior to CK2) nor was it present in the base game.\
      \ The developers went out of their way to make customization possible and coders\
      \ probably had to work more than half an hour to implement these features.\n\
      \nBuy this DLC on sale, if designing a custom Crusader King is your thing.\n"
