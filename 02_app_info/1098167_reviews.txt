It captures the lines of the prototype in all aspects. The loco responds well to the controls, sounds are good and the exhaust effects are as you would expect from an Alco.  The original model epitomises the Pennsylvania complete with the distinctive radio antenna which has now been made as a child object enabling repainters to produce versions in other liveries. A welcome update enhancing the value of this loco to the enthusiasts of the transition period. This is recommended to those enthusiasts and anyone who wants to run something different.","timestamp_created":1584417747,"timestamp_updated":1584417835,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/7Cq8/ACfu7U+AE="}
