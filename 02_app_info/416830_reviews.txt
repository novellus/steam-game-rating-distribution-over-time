Absolutely loved the mechanic of creating your own platforms and the speed that you could move. But the story and narration and the main character design and maybe even the overall art style kind of bugged me. Tried it a second time on the next day because I thought I could get past the skin to the game and enjoy the core of the gameplay. But it just showed me for a great game you really want everything to come together as a complete package.","timestamp_created":1609302438,"timestamp_updated":1609587099,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ418C34fYCeMjVvgI="}
