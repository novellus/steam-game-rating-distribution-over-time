      city. You'll create a wide variety of resources from agricultural products,
      minerals, trade goods and everything else in-between to see your settlement

    review: City building in this game is easy if you want to just get through, but
      can be difficult when trying to get absolutely perfect. There is a calm and
      peaceful atmosphere to the game that I am becoming very fond of. I do recommend
      this to anyone looking for a relaxing and enjoyable city-builder RTS.
