The tooltip remains. I pressed every single button on my keyboard and mouse...the tool tip still remains. Game paused, waiting for me to hit the prompt. I tried my bluetooth keyboard, pressed R, hit all the other buttons. Tooltip remains. Every button on my attached controller did nothing, tooltip remains.\n\nI don't know what I'm doing wrong but as far as I can tell this is broken.","timestamp_created":1559776385,"timestamp_updated":1559776385,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.41063573956489563","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/tr6lOsCd+7owgE="}
