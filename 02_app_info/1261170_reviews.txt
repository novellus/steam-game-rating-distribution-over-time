It still is VERY VERY SHORT. I completed it in 17 minutes as you can see above. If you make a game like this, then please... add way more words or then make the words randomized! This isn't that much of a waste of money though, since it's only a few cents (at least when it's on sale.) I still would've liked to use to cents to buy something else. \n\nTL;DR: It's way too short. It's also darker than the original.","timestamp_created":1608897130,"timestamp_updated":1608897130,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4b3vzPYCdeuDvQI="}
