    review: "A real Sierra Classic. Never played it back then, but it features everything\
      \ that made Sierra adventures so much fun to play.\n- great locations/atmosphere\
      \ -> check\n- great storytelling -> check\n- great puzzles -> check\n- historical/educational\
      \ background -> check\n- many dead ends -> check\n- multiple paths to complete\
      \ the game -> nice... check\n- funny -> well it has its moments but the story\
      \ is not about gags and humor.\n\nHowever this adventure might not appeal to\
      \ everyone. Especially younger audiences that are not used to this kind of game\
      \ mechanics (text parser, dead ends, no hint system, lots of trial and error)\
      \ might find it hard to enjoy this game. You can get stuck a lot. Be patient\
      \ and you will be rewarded or just use a walkthrough, but you will miss out\
      \ a great part of the experience that made those games so great.\n\nThis is\
      \ a little gem from the golden era of adventures. \n\nFor classic adventures\
      \ fans it's worth more than the regular price. For adventure game fans in general,\
      \ get in on sale."
