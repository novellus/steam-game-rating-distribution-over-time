The good news is we definitely have not abandoned the game, and agree with you that the game is currently too short! We should have a progress update in the next couple days. To be candid, Covid impacted each of us on the team differently, but collectively, it drew our progress to a halt. \n\nTo give you a heads up, we have been creating new levels, as well as new music and other features which we will roll out for the full release. We have an internal date set which I'm hesitant to state as we haven't made it official JUST yet. :) \n\nBut thank you for playing and we welcome more of your feedback!"}],"cursor":"AoJ4hvSy1fUCdKairQI="}
