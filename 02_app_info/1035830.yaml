    about_the_game: An action-puzzler where you try to create patterns to damage the
      various creatures of the Dracolord's domain. By clicking on the arrow orbs,
      you initiate chain reactions that add damage to your attack. Larger patterns
      will place new spells on the board, but there is also the risk of awakening
      the evil dracostones. Think fast, take chances and find the secret way to the
      final boss to win the game and end the Dracolord's reign forever!

    review: 'Dracologic attracted me with it''s nice arcade-like visuals and I am
      a huge fan of that since it does remind me like I''m playing an arcade game.  It
      does seem to have some intricate puzzle design and helps a little in understanding
      how the game works. However, what takes away from the game is not exactly describing
      what does what.


      Like, what does the colored orbs do? What different kind of spells do what?
      What is the objective of this game? I know I''m to defeat the dragon, but I
      don''t get a lot to work with besides that? There''s so many questions I find
      myself asking as I''m just simply clicking around at colors as they do intended
      effects. I''ve only ever progressed past three enemies before losing and before
      that, I''ve lost a few times because of how fast the game can end.


      I just found myself lost in understanding completely as to what I''m to do to
      get the maximum amount of fun here. Every time you lose a game, you have to
      sit through the small tutorial again and again. That''d be fine to help me understand
      HOW to play the game. But I bear to repeat - what am I doing and what is what!?


      And speaking of lacking it''s instructions, rather more in-depth instructions,
      there''s not a whole lot to tinker with in settings. Actually, there is nothing
      to tinker with for settings. No resolution changes, no sound options and none
      of that to be found here. It''s just run the game, try to understand it to the
      best of your abilities and go from there. Well, I appreciate the sentiment,
      but I don''t have the patience for games that cannot bother to introduce players
      to it and give them reasons to enjoy it.


      All I can say that''s good about it, is that it has nice visuals, gives you
      an arcade-feel and it can be fun. But what can make it more fun is if it clarified
      everything revolving around what''s in the game. Those qualities alone though,
      don''t really make me want to recommend this and I hate to be the first to review
      this game since nobody else has reviewed it to not recommend it. I hope in the
      future, since it''s been released this year, that development continues and
      more things are added.


      But for now, I''m refunding.'
