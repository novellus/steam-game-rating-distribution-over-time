      \ result was the 7800 Manor Class and an initial batch of 20 locos rolled out\
      \ of Swindon Works in the late 1930s. The Manors were put to use on rural areas\

    review: This should not be listed as in the Pro range IMHO. It's shown as being
      released 2 Apr 2020 when in fact according to the JT Documentation show it originates
      in 2013. The physics aren't up to the normal pro range standard and some of
      the cab detailing is a little cartoon like. Save your money I wish I had !
