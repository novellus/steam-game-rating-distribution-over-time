      \ <br>Good Mourning tells a compelling story about rejoice and regrets, redemption\
      \ and letting go. It\u2019s a tale about good and bad, self-reflection, choices\
      \ and chances, all the ups and downs of ordinary life, but through a filter\
      \ of fantasy. <br><br>Good Mourning is a narrative game with high emphasis on\

      \ are randomized for every playthrough. The goal is to generate emergent narrative\

    review: "After I played Platonic Partnership's first game \"Lydia\", which affected\
      \ me deeply, I immediately sought out their other games. When I saw that \"\
      Good Mourning\" was available, I bought it and played it immediately. \n\n\"\
      Good Mourning\" hit closer to home for me, but I don\u2019t think I enjoyed\
      \ it quite as much as \"Lydia\"; however, they are completely different. The\
      \ story is really interesting, accompanied by an amazing atmosphere, art style\
      \ and soundtrack. The game as a whole, especially the ending, really affected\
      \ me, and \"Good Mourning\" has a lot to say about life as a whole, the decisions\
      \ we make along the way, and the regrets we have afterwards.  I saw a lot of\
      \ myself in the main character, and unfortunately, that\u2019s not entirely\
      \ a good thing. I will definitely be replaying this soon, because I didn\u2019\
      t experience everything. \n-- 9.5/10 --\nThe reason I give it a 9.5 instead\
