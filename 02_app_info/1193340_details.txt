You have been saved by a mysterious group of people and they helped teach you how to survive in this new reality. Though it was tough, they taught you how to fight, craft necessary items, and survive out in the wild.<br><br>But you should NEVER underestimate a zombie horde. They broke into your home, and though you fought tirelessly, it was hopeless from the start. Now, you are alone once again.<br><br>But at least you are alive, and with all the knowledge that you have, you can start anew once again. Use your skills to craft tools for both survival and defense, get your own farm going, and go out to scavenge and save lives. Zombies will come for you eventually — all you can do is prepare yourself and your home, so be sure to have your defenses ready and your machine gun turrets fully armed. The zombie apocalypse is a tough thing to overcome even if it happens in a cute pixelated universe, but don’t lose hope just yet! With dozens of crafting options, you can turn your home into an indestructible fortress, set up your own food production systems, and venture out into the zombie infested wilderness to gather valuable loot and survival gear, and save as many people as possible.<br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1193340\/extras\/attack.gif?t=1608541906\" \/><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1193340\/extras\/Zelter_KeyFeatures_localization_En.jpg?t=1608541906\" \/><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Survive and build your home mid zombie outbreak<\/strong><\/h2><strong>Zelter <\/strong>takes resource management systems to a whole new level.

Use this opportunity to rebuild your crew together, after all, saving one's life creates an excellent first impression. Once they are a part of your crew you can direct them to craft essential supplies, guard vital positions, accompany you on your scavenger hunt, and help you to build an impenetrable fortress, ready for the inevitable zombie attacks.
