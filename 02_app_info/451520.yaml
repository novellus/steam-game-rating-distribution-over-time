    about_the_game: 'theBlu: is a deeply immersive VR series that allows audiences
      to experience the wonder and majesty of the ocean through different habitats
      and come face to face with some of the most awe inspiring species on the planet.
      The series, which is directed by Jake Rowell (Call of Duty, Final Fantasy, Superman
      Returns), has been designed as beautiful moments in passing or a collection
      of memories that powerfully tap into the vast potential of VR. The debut episode,
      featuring an incredible close encounter with an 80 foot whale, is already recognized
      as one the most iconic room scale VR experiences to date (a Sundance Film Festival
      2016 selection). Additional episodes in this bundle take place on a teeming
      coral reef and in the very deepest region of the ocean. Gain access to new modes
      of discovery in each episode. Slow time and capture pictures in Inspector Mode,
      and return to a meditative version of each location in Ambient Mode.<h2 class="bb_tag">The
      first three episodes of theBlu, contained in this bundle, are:</h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Whale
      Encounter<br><i>An undersea encounter with the largest species on earth.</i><br></li><li>Reef
      Migration <br><i>Witness the magnificence of an undersea migration on the edge
      of a coral reef.</i><br></li><li>Luminous Abyss <br><i>Venture into the deepest
      region of the ocean to discover the iridescent abyss.</i></li></ul>'

    review: I mean it's a really nice VR experience, don't get me wrong. I just don't
      think it's a good value. It's so incredibly limited. This should be one of those
      free experiences. Hell, you can find some free experiences that are way better
      than this. But whatever. You could do worse. If you need a little VR thing to
      show grandma, this would be a perfect choice.
