    review: "[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift [/h1]\n\nThis ride is okay. I think\
      \ the problem with it is that the snow was poorly animated. I think the snow\
      \ falling is very vital for immersion in VR and I've seen it done better in\
      \ so many other games. The sad part is that I liked everything else about this\
      \ ride. But because it's snow themed, it's very important to get that detail\
      \ correctly and it wasn't in this game. \n\nThe ride itself was enjoyeable.\
      \ Lots of speed then slow downs. Not sure how long it was but it felt like roughly\
      \ 4 minutes long. I liked the airplane 3d model flying above and then crashing,\
      \ that was very neat. The wolf 3d model looked amazing as well. That wolf is\
      \ used in some of the other coaster rides, but is the most appropriate in this\
      \ ride. The vistas look really good.\n\nRate 6/10. If the snow had been done\
      \ correctly, this probably would have been the best VR DLC out of the bunch."
