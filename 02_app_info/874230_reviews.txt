The controls and mechanics are simple and straightforward.  It is an okay game for some entertainment but that's it.  Get this if there is nothing else that interests you or if it's part of a bundle like how I got it.  I'm not sure if it is even worth the $2 price but if you want it go for it.  I only recommend this game because it's playable and helps to waste time but that's it.","timestamp_created":1589234544,"timestamp_updated":1589234920,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpI3ygvICe/CQhwI="}
