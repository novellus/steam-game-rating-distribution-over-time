    about_the_game: "At twilight in Kentucky, as bird songs give way to the choir\
      \ of frogs and insects, familiar roads become strange, and it's easy to get\
      \ lost. Those who are already lost may find their way to a secret highway winding\
      \ through underground caves. The people who live and work along this highway\
      \ are themselves a little strange at first, but soon seem familiar: the aging\
      \ driver making the last delivery for a doomed antique shop; the young woman\
      \ who fixes obsolete TVs surrounded by ghosts; the child and his giant eagle\
      \ companion; the robot musicians; the invisible power company lurking everywhere,\
      \ and the threadbare communities who struggle against its grip.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nKENTUCKY ROUTE ZERO is a magical realist adventure game in five acts,\
      \ featuring a haunting electronic score, and a suite of hymns and bluegrass\
      \ standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers. Rendered in a striking visual\
      \ style that draws as much from theater, film, and experimental electronic art\
      \ as it does from the history of videogames, this is a story of unpayable debts,\
      \ abandoned futures, and the human drive to find community.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nOriginally published episodically over a span of years, the game now includes\
      \ all five acts along with the &quot;interludes,&quot; which were originally\
      \ published separately. It has also been painstakingly localized for French,\
      \ German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish (both European Spanish\
      \ and Latin American)."
