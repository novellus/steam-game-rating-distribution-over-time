I can state with confidence, that this game has the potential to grow into one of the greatest games of all time, and time to come.\n\nFrom the depths of the Steam store lies this beast, undisrupted and undisturbed. My first impressions weren't very high, however, I didn't think I was about to launch such a life-changing product. Oh was I so wrong. From the get-go, I was immediately immersed within the world of [i]Nymphalalalalia[/i]. My adrenaline levels shot up as I was greeted by an explosive and action packed environment. Colours and particle effects galore. My hands snapped to the keyboard, trying to save my creature from a horrendous and cruel, yet beautiful death. Alas, I couldn't save him from its demise. From an adrenaline rush to a heartbreak, I had no idea about the emotional rollercoaster I was lining up for when buying this game, and it wasn't going to stop there. I respawned back into the action refreshingly fast. No need to wait around in this game. The combinations of the stunning visuals and the deep, satisfying sound work brought the life right back into me, along with the adrenaline. \n\nThis time, I was ready.\n\nUsing one of the primary selling points of this game, I was able to transform into a fast critter, zooming across the map at ludicrous speeds. I was about to flank the enemy team. I converted to a strong titan, and using it's shotgun like projectiles, took out enemies with rapid succession. There are no words to describe the satisfaction and triumph I felt during those few seconds of my game time.\n\nI could go on and on about the moments I had, exploring the two highly detailed maps. The first being open and vast. The second incorporating more close-quarters combat with a maze of towering spires. It makes you feel insignificant in its world, but you soon discover the difference you can make for your team.\n\nIn terms of menus and navigation, the game throws you right in, with no return. It's straight to the point. Simple, yet detailed. Casual, yet refined. The story is incorporated into the main menu, conveying its importance and allowing users to get right into the deep and fascinating narrative. The thought put into each and every corner of this game in mind-boggling. Extremely impressive. \n\nTime to cut to the chase and get down the the basics;\nThe gameplay fast and action packed. Lots of options when it comes to play style, increasing the height of the skill ceiling. The gunplay is also vast in options, with each creature comes a new type of projectile, and a new playstyle. By quickly changing between creatures you can create your own powerful and unique playstyles. \nThe visuals are remarkable, and already prepped for future gaming and rigs. With the option to go up to 8K resolution you can be sure that graphics haven't been looked over when the devs made this game. With excessive amounts of colourful particles, you can find yourself caught up in beautiful chaos.\nThe audio is responsive and helps with the gameplay. Each character has its own sounds that can be used to identify them, even without any visual aid.\nThe story is deep, hidden, and meaningful. The names of the creatures and maps are intriguing. They really immerse you in the narrative and gameplay. \n\nTo sum it all up, a single, not even two reviews could successfully describe the euphoria and joy that this game brings you. Play it for yourself to experience this beautiful, lawless, masterpiece. \n\n9/10\n","timestamp_created":1577027401,"timestamp_updated":1577027401,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.554698765277862549","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40o6Kl+8Cf7+O5gE="}
