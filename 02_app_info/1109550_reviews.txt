The commentating is AWFUL. And there is no way to turn it off. It is thickly accented, way too loud and spoken in broken English. There are about 15 infuriating phrases, one of which plays about every 10 seconds. The only tolerable way to play it is with the sound on mute. The physics are mediocre. \n\nYou have no choice but to watch the bowler slowly walk back to his mark between balls. And it takes about 10 seconds. EVERY. BALL. \n\nFor some reason all the character models are complete giants, approx. 8ft tall. And when I say 'all the character models' - there is 1 model. So every player, keeper, bowler, and all the fielders - are completely identical. \nThe game basically feels like it was made by 1 kid in his bedroom. Thats certainly where the audio was recorded! \n\nI only recently learned about Steam's refund policy - if I had known about it when I bought this I would have instantly applied for a refund (a fact Steam didn't seem to care about when I wrote to them recently - disappointing.. even though I've never ever asked for a refund before and been a loyal customer for years) \nÂ£11.39 is SO overpriced, this is not as good as a free game.","timestamp_created":1599655825,"timestamp_updated":1599655825,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45tm6ufQCf4vhoAI="}
