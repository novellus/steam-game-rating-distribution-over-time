    review: "I dislike how the level design combines long mundane parts with quick\
      \ bursts of skill. If you look at the GOAT difficult platformers, either the\
      \ entire level has a consistent difficulty or there's not much leadup to the\
      \ hard parts, making the game more interesting throughout. You also usually\
      \ checkpoint more often. In Pivot Pilot, I felt like I was often going through\
      \ a pretty long level and ended up failing a hard part, then doing it all again.\
      \ \n\nAnother major issue I have is the occasional \"no way to know that except\
      \ by dying\" elements. For example, a fourth saw that has to be mid-air jumped\
      \ right after three saws that you have to drop past. There's really no way to\
      \ read this except through sheer luck, and when you fail you have to do allll\
      \ of the level again (which exacerbates the first issue). Just one of several\
      \ examples in the game. In general, there's not enough of a telegraph and many\
      \ levels are virtually impossible to sightread. I've always preferred level\
      \ design where it feels like it really is feasible to sightread if you're mechanically\
      \ good enough.\n\nThird main thing I didn't like: the controls don't feel that\
      \ good. Idk. You have to quickly double tap to double jump to max height, otherwise\
      \ it's too short. Mid-air movement feels imprecise. Some parts require a lot\
      \ of precision, far too much for my taste. \n\nIt's not all bad ofc. The pivoting\
      \ mechanic is a great gimmick, there's still some decent platforming, a banging\
      \ soundtrack, and interesting level ideas even if the execution didn't live\
      \ up to it. It's not a garbage game, but I did dislike a LOT of parts, enough\
      \ for me to not recommend it. Also keybindings reset when you exit :("
