    review: The Support the Dev DLC is a really nice way to show support, especially
      as the base game is such brilliant fun and totally free. The DLC gives you a
      gold ship in the base Pirate Seas game, and a gold vampire carriage if you have
      also bought the Vampire Night expansion.
