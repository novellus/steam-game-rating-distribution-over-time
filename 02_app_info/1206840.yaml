    developer_response: We regret the failures you may have, the part that was frozen
      has already been repaired, the game is somewhat short, but judging by the price,
      it does not seem like something terrible, we remember that it is our first project,
      something you should know how all this works . We are working on both this project
      and another one that I assure you that if you are going to love it, this game
      has been running since after August, but you just have to remember that we are
      a small studio, in fact, there is only one person behind all this , however,
      thanks for trying our game. Greetings and we regret each of the problems you
      might have.

    review: "**WARNING READ THIS REVIEW BEFORE BUYING IF YOU DO BUY AFTER READING\
      \ THIS REVIEW**\n \nOkay...how do I explain this...either this game is literally\
      \ 2 minutes long, or the game \"freezes\" when you get to a certain point...\n\
      \nI've got through the first puzzle, got through all the doors and boom it just\
      \ ends, or freezes.\n\nIf the game ends there, do not buy it...if the game freezes\
      \ there, it's not suppose to happen, do not buy it...\n\nThe game it's self\
      \ is literally doors, hallways that you already been but copy pasted to confused\
      \ you...doors and more doors, the first puzzle is literally rediculous honestly...you\
      \ are left with numbers with arrow that point to other numbers and then you\
      \ have question marks and you need to find out what doors they are by using\
      \ process of elimination.\n\nI just found a free game on steam and left a review\
      \ about how great my experience was, now I get this...so yea, do not buy this\
      \ game, sorry devs, not sorry!"
