    about_the_game: 'WINNER: IGF China award for BEST GAME!<br><br>Cubetractor is
      a neo-retroesque action-strategy-puzzle hybrid where you defeat enemies through
      an unconventional cube-pulling, turret-buildling mechanic. <br><br><br>The game
      carries elements of a reverse tower defence and a grounded bullet-hell dodger
      to deliver a unique gameplay experience presented in a classic top-down perspective.<br><br><br>You
      play as Endroi, a menacingly happy-go-lucky quadrubot as he strives to master
      the art of Cubetracting -- the art of attracting Cubes. It''s a deceptively
      straightforward skill that involves dexterity, acute awareness, multi-tasking
      and tactical positioning. You''ll have to strategize, solve and fight your way
      through multitudes of enemy installations to achieve your coveted goal.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li> 40+ maps for you to pull, crush and build: Levels carefully
      designed to bring out the emergent dynamics in a unique mechanic.<br></li><li>
      Symmetrical Balance: Why do bad guys always have to be stronger than you? In
      Cubetractor, the enemy structures are exactly the same as yours, other than
      they got there first. Defeating them is a matter of thoughtful timing and positioning.<br></li><li>
      Purely indie-made: Done by 2 people, living off their savings, working off random
      coffee joints.<br></li><li> Hardcore Awards for Hardcore Players: The main levels
      are designed for speedruns. Collect all the batteries, reach the finishing goal
      within impressively tight time limits -- do all that without a scratch -- to
