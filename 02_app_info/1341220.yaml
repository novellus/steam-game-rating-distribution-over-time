    review: 'Almost perfect, but solving later puzzles isn''t as satisfying as it
      could be,


      The first 10-20 levels are easy enough to figure out in my brain (that''s not
      very good at math), but in the later levels, moving cards around helps me visualize
      the final answer better, but what happens, is I stumble into the answer randomly
      as I''m fumbling around w/ the cards.  Give me a "Submit Answer" button and
      it''d be perfect.'
