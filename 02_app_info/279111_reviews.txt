Also, just like Mirak, he is annoyingly slow. You will hanging on, like, forever, waiting for Ork swinging his axe. And I can't say he does noticable bigger average damage, than Malaknim, for example. Therefore, his developement will feel like mindless boring grinding. \n\nHe does not have his own story, aside of levels from mediocre-to-appaling \"Ork Story\" DLC levels. And, considening that Orks in Sacred 3 were implemented just as the race from \"Standard fantacy setting\", it doesn't add anything significant to Sacred 3's \"lore\"... if you can call it that. Ugly face, animations that hardly can be called as \"fascinating\"... \n\nDefinately, there is much more reason to buy \"Orcland Story\" than that DLC. The latter at least contain some battlefields and story snippets... Placing \"Orc of Thrones\" to the main \"Sacred 3\" page instead and describing \"OoT\" with the plot of independent \"OS\" seems to be either unreasoned, or involve players to be even more puzzled, if \"Sacred 3\" just wasn't enough for that. \n\n\n[code]\n* [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/12320]Review of the \"Sacred Gold\"[/url]\n* [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/225640]Review of the \"Sacred 2 Gold\"[/url]\n* [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/247950/]Review of the \"Sacred 3\"[/url]\n   * [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/279110]Review of the \"Sacred 3: Malakhim Hero [DLC]\"[/url]\n   * [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/261161]Review of the \"Sacred 3: Orcland Story [DLC]\"[/url]\n   * [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/279111]Review of the \"Sacred 3: Orc of Thrones [DLC]\"[/url] (you are here)\n   * [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/279112]Review of the \"Sacred 3: Z4ngr13f Weapons Spirit [DLC]\"[/url] \n[/code]","timestamp_created":1552067323,"timestamp_updated":1557599675,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.584905624389648438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p5yL1OoCd9HLvAE="}
