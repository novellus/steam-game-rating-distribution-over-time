    review: "Nettes Spiel f\xFCr Kinder!\n\nMan wird hier neben dem Verarzten der\
      \ Tiere auch in Bezug auf die Umwelt etwas geschult. \n\nIm Sale empfohlen (ich\
      \ hab es mir f\xFCr 1,49\u20AC geholt und finde es gut).\n___\n\nW\xFCnsche:\
      \ \n\nTimer weglassen. Beenden-Button einf\xFCgen (konnte keinen finden? Taste\
      \ P?). Vertonen/Sprachausgabe.\n\nSteam-Sammelkarten, Tolle Abzeichen, Profilhintergr\xFC\
      nde, Emoticons, Profilavatare, Profilrahmen...\nEin paar sch\xF6ne Steam-Errungenschaften\
