      /><br>Zone 10 is an original take on the tower defense genre. In the game, you
      can mine asteroids to gain money and spend it on building and defending your
      own custom maze.  The game takes place in deep-space where you command a spaceship
      that is in charge of defending a space station from attack. The game is divided
      up into two phases separated by a timer. The first being, &quot;Explore&quot;,
      where you use your spaceship to mine asteroids that are defended by marauding
      pirates and then use the proceeds to purchase maze blocks, upgrades, and defensive
      equipment such as turrets and ships. Once the timer reaches zero the enemy will
      attack your Starbase.  Try and survive as long as you can!<h2 class="bb_tag">Build

      /><br><br>We have designed specialty maze blocks that when placed next to each
      other form pathways, obstructions, and different colored platforms. The various
      colored platforms allow you to place corresponding turrets or landing pads that
      allow you to fight off incoming enemies.<h2 class="bb_tag">Enemies</h2><br><img

      /><br><br>The two types of enemies are separated into space ships and assault
      troops. Assault troops are dropped onto your space-station by transport ships
      and will follow your maze to the command center and damage your starbase unless
      killed by your turrets. Spaceships will harass and blow up your turrets and/or

    review: This is a really fun Tower Defense Game. I like the building mechanics
      and how the enemy ships can blow up your turrets. I'd like the stats to be a
      little clearer and maybe have a health bar over your turrets. Fun game.
