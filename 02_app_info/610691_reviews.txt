The dice should be able to be manually set to a position because they sometimes rotate if you release them too quickly after moving or if they lie on top of each other and then take one down.\nFor an official dlc I expected more. There should at least be no bugs that prevent the player from playing the game because the cards always disappear. \nAs long as the bug is not fixed I can not recommend the game.","timestamp_created":1609707233,"timestamp_updated":1609707233,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47uOB5fYCfsGYwAI="}
