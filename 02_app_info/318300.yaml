      \ elder sister Candace is not very happy of their tricks. She is always ready\
      \ to bust the brothers and tell their mother on them. And Phineas has a pet\
      \ platypus called Perry who has a secret of his own. He just pretends to be\
      \ a silly amenable pet but in fact lives a double life as a secret agent codenamed\
      \ P battling the malicious scientist Dr. Doofenshmirtz\u2026 On the whole, they\
      \ all have a lot to worry about!<br />\r\nThis time Phineas and Ferb decide\
      \ not to fritter away their energy. They are going to build the coolest rollercoaster\
      \ in their backyard! But to assemble such an enormous construction they need\
      \ a good drawing and a lot of different parts which are not so easy to find.\
      \ And tattletale Candace is up to stick her nose where she doesn\u2019t belong\u2026\
      \ And where is Perry the Platypus? He is on a secret mission again! Brave Agent\
      \ P is on his way to save the town from another wicked design of Dr. Doofenshmirtz.\
      \ Someone must help him! And, of course, one shouldn\u2019t forget about building\
      \ the rollercoaster. The fun begins!"
