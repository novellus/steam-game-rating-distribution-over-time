    about_the_game: Story is an unusual RPG game which leaves you a lot of place for
      your own interpretation of in-game events, characters and your own choices.
      The title refers to the fact that you create your own story rather than you
      are given one just to read. It doesn't mean that there's no plot but the plot
      is left for you to uncover in your own way.<h2 class="bb_tag">Explore the Tomb!</h2><br>In
      Story you are a Skeleton living in an ancient tomb, which is robbed by ruthless
      adventurers. The tomb has many secrets waiting for you to uncover them.<h2 class="bb_tag">Smash
      your enemies!</h2><br>There's no one who could escape your vengeance! Kill everyone
      you find in the tomb (even your own character if you want).<h2 class="bb_tag">Every
      choice matters</h2><br>In Story every choice matters and has it's consequences
      which will lead you to one of the <strong>35 endings</strong>.
