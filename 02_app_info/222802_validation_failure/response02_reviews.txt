Its basiclly an AK with bigger mag. Big woop. You get this for preorder but if you buy this later you are SOOO stupid. I bet you waste money on single player dlcs like Saints Row 3/4 guns/packs or Just Cause 2 dlcs didn't you? If so, you are the cancer thats killing good consumer practices.\n\nEdit: I'm still 100% behind what I said, but consider this people. Metro is suppose to be a surival game (not to the extent of say STALKER) where life in the underground is hard and monsters fucks you up in two hits. Having bullet hose just kills my cheeki breeki style. And if $1 isn't a waste, next time you're at a store; go  buy a $1 pack of gum at the check out. You don't really need it, but heck its gum. Enjoy that stick of minty fresh breath for like 5 minutes till its gone. While I have an extra buck to spend on other shit.","timestamp_created":1378237998,"timestamp_updated":1395011604,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":186,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.282924860715866089","comment_count":42,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4vnK5sQCdbCLDA=="}
