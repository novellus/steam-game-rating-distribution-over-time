    about_the_game: BloodRayne is a dhampir, born from the unnatural union of vampire
      and human. Blessed with the powers of a vampire but cursed with the thirst for
      blood and a weakness to sunlight, Rayne is challenged with her most personal
      battle yet as she hunts down her siblings. They have banded together and pledged
      to carry on their father's legacy of creating a new era of vampire supremacy
      where humans are mere cattle. Rayne's siblings have created 'The Shroud,' a
      mysterious substance that will render the sun's lethal rays harmless to vampires.
      Now only BloodRayne stands between an unsuspecting humanity and a horrifying
      vampire dawn.
