Do not buy it hoping for HOTAS support, sadly they removed the support shortly after putting it in and several websites still show the game as support it. While technically you can set it up for HOTAS controls, it will forget your keybindings whenever the game is closed. Upon asking their twitter they stated that there are no plans to correct the issue as HOTAS is not officially supported.\n\nTLDR: Good game for keyboard and gamepad. Do not trust the sites that say games have HOTAS support, controls great with HOTAS but having to redo your keybindings whenever you boot the game turns it from a fun game to play on a whim into a slog before the run can even start.\n\nIf the bug is ever fixed, this review will go thumbs up and be glowing with praise, sadly the keybindings issue ruins the entire experience for me.","timestamp_created":1609905495,"timestamp_updated":1609905495,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vYv26vYCf6fzwAI="}
