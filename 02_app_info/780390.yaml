      /><br>Space Bob vs. The Replicons is a beautiful yet challenging light-hearted
      epic space adventure that combines hand crafted planets with procedurally generated
      puzzles, hazards and resources. Help Bob and his daft companion AI fight off
      a full scale alien invasion while having no clue as to what's happening or why
      time keeps resetting whenever they make any meaningful progress.<br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2>Explore a multiverse that is never the same
      twice, while mastering a unique physics based resource collection system that
      challenges Bob with grappling loot and resources to anything and everything
      before trying to man handle it back into orbit where it can be crafted into
      much needed equipment and upgrades. <br><br>At first, something as simple as
      landing on a planet and returning with some essential resources will likely
      end in failure and death, but don't give up. Bob never truly dies and his story
      progresses even through death and multiple game restarts. Explore further and
      you'll discover that Bob is part of a much bigger and more mysterious adventure
      where death is just an opportunity to get it right next time rather than truly
      starting again from scratch. <br><br>Space Bob vs. The Replicons offers the
      choice of two very different game modes. In the default Rogue-lite mode your
      first objective will be to escape through the jump-gate. Once you've managed
      that you'll find yourself transported back in time to discover that it's only
      just the beginning of your battle against the Replicons. To truly escape you'll
      need to explore further, solve mysteries, meet new friends, complete multiple
      objectives and master your skills to ultimately take the battle deep into the
      Replicon mothership itself.<br><br>Whether you live or die, an average default
      play session is never the same twice. At first, you'll die frequently and struggle
      to do seemingly simple tasks but with patience, careful resource management,
      time and practice you'll learn to survive long enough to unlock checkpoints
      and discover that death is not as permanent as it seems. Dig even deeper and
      you'll find yourself working with mysterious forces to save mankind from alien
      obliteration over multiple consecutive games.<br><br>However, if you prefer
      your games to persist over tens of hours, there's the all new Survival mode.
      With six dynamic difficulty settings, you can choose anything from a relatively
      relaxed sandbox exploration adventure to a nail biting battle to secure essential
      resources while fending off an ever increasing army of alien invaders. <br><br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Technology</h2>The game may initially appear to use traditional
      2D sprites, or vectors, but instead uses polygons to model every object, planet,
      and blade of grass. This allows for incredible performance, even on low end
      hardware, but also the ability to seamlessly zoom from viewing an entire planet
      down to individual blades of grass without any visible pixelation. <br><br><br>At
      the start of each game a new system of planets is generated, each remixed and
      respawned with different resources and loot to create an open-world experience
      where no two games are ever alike. <br><br>All objects are physics enabled which
      creates the heart and soul of the gameplay. You'll need to master Bob's multi-functional
      grappling gun, that can connect anything to everything, and use it to solve
      an emergent stream of physics based problems in order to get loot and resources
      back to your refinery ship in orbit. Bob's grappling gun can even stick Replicons
      to walls, each other, or anything else before they eventually overwhelm every
      planet. Alternatively, you can blast them to pieces and salvage their body parts
      or take things to the next level and salvage them alive!<br><br>Good luck, Bob.
      You've got this!
