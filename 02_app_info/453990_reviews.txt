Mibibli's Quest is still to this day an absolute gem, and if you're a fan of Platformer-Shooters, I couldn't recommend this game enough. It carries a vibe and aesthetic that no other games I've played have had, and its simply so brilliantly unique with everything that it does. The game both tests your patience and your skill, so buckle up if you're not used to more difficult games. Overall, Mibibli's Quest is a game I haven't seen many people play or talk about, so I hope you give it a try, and if you like it, spread the word even further.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nTwo years ago, my friend stole my laptop for about 10 minutes, then gave it back to me with the original free version of this game booted up and ready to play. Ever since then, it has become one of my favorite platformers of all time. I almost feel ashamed about just now finding out about this version on Steam. Needless to say, I instantly bought it and now I intend on playing it for many months of tears and cries of joy to come. Sooner or later, once I finish this paid-version, I'll come back and edit this on my thoughts on the new content. For now, I already give this game 1,000 thumbs up, if you like platformers or a great challenge, buy this game.","timestamp_created":1500196879,"timestamp_updated":1609621715,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g8e74vYCctuMgAE="}
