You didn't want me to hear me talk about this game? You want me to talk about Pokemon? Can that wait until the end please? Thank you.\n\nLittle Town Hero is Game Freak's recent outing from their “Gear Project” system. Mixing the strategy from both card and board games, Little Town Hero offers a very unique RPG experience. Even as someone who loves the game on the Switch, I can only recommend it with caution because of the battle system. If you're into card and board games that's long and has loads of strategy, then you can jump right in, otherwise stay away from it. The lack of a free demo doesn't help either because this is a game that sorely needed it. As of this writing there's an issue with the pricing for certain regions, so don't spend over 30 bucks for this until this is fixed. I even feel that the price is really steep, topping on this being a divisive title is a gamble.\n\nThe battle system is something I must comment on because this is the meat of the game. I'm aware that some were turned off or intimidated because it sounds overly complex. The truth is, the battles are easy to learn but VERY hard to master. Let me walk you through it because this is the biggest thing I need to tackle the game for.\n\n[u]Attacking with Ideas:[/u] You have three Idea types to use. Red is Attack that can be used once per turn, Yellow is Defense that can be used many times and Blue is Support that can do various effects while drawing a random Idea from your Headspace (think of this as your draw pile). All your Ideas all start out of Izzits. As long as an Idea remains an Izzit, they can't be used but are immune to most attacks. You need to turn an Izzit into a Dazzit by spending Power to activate them. At the start you can only use 3 Power per turn, but every three turns it'll got up by 1 until you reach the maximum of 6. As you can guess, more Power means you can activate a quantity of Dazzits or more powerful ones in a single Turn. \n\nOnce you break all the enemies ideas, then you can attack them if you got a leftover Red Ideas to use. This doesn't mean a direct hit on the enemies Health, you also need to reduce their Guts, which are shields to protect it. If you get an All Break but don't have a Red Idea to use, you gain a Break Point instead, which can be used to swap Ideas from your Headspace or Revive them.\n\nAs your Ideas are used up, you'll eventually run out of them. You need to revive them by either using the aforementioned BP, have your Hearts damaged or get it from some Support effects. Knowing this, you need to your Ideas effectively. Keep in mind that due to the sheer randomness of the game, you're not guaranteed to achieve an All Break on every turn or you can strike the enemy.\n\n[u]Think Things Though:[/u] With that said, this is where the battles show a weak spot. This game encourages you to look at the fight from every angle. From the map view, to your Ideas, Support and the enemies, there's a lot to consider and decide which is the best course of action. If you don't take this into account and carelessly choose Ideas left and right, you'll end up painting yourself in a corner when you get low on Ideas and have no choice but to Struggle to either Revive them, or lose the fight entirely. You don't want to do that. With that said, this game would either make you feel clever for taking your time with things, or make you feel stupid for making a rash move.\n\n[u]Eureka!:[/u] Starting in Chapter 2, you'll gain access to the Eureka Tree which lets you spend Eureka Points to buff your Ideas. While this is super helpful for fights later down the line, the problem I have is that it's rather unbalanced on how much you get them. After you fight bosses or complete side quests, you get Eureka Points that you can use. The issue is that you're not going to be able to max everything out at the end of the game unless you deliberately lose the fight, which gives you more depending on how much damage you were able to deal to them.\n\nEven worse is that some of the hardest side quests in the game (like Visualization which lets you re-fight old bosses in a weaker state) don't give you enough points to make it feel like it was worth it. The finding chickens quest? Gives you 3 Points, but that's not a lot at this point in the game. That's really generous compared to the really hard Visualization side quests, in which you only get 1. There's two more Visualization bosses you get after beating the final boss, but at this point you can't even use those points because there's nothing left to do. I really feel cheated here because I feel that instead of reaching my full potential by working hard, I had to take the easy way out. This rookie mistake stood out to me the most. Having be able to max out at the end would really make the adventure feel worth it because you're constantly getting stronger, and I hate it when the game doesn't let me do that fairly. It's not a deal breaker, but it's disappointing to me.\n\n[u]Sidenote:[/u] LTH runs way better on PC. Unity games don't run as well on consoles for some reason. The game is initially capped at windowed 720p, but can be changed in the options on the main menu.\n\nAlright, let's talk about Pokemon so that Gigantimaxed Copperjah will get out of my front yard.\n\nThis game was released and developed around the same time as Sword and Shield. This wouldn't be an issue if those games didn't have the infamous “Dexit” controversy that limited the number of Pokemon in the games. This made people assume that LTH is why the cut happened. This is why Little Town Hero got so much hate. Guys, let's be real here.\n\nGame Freak stated in several interviews that Dexit was unavoidable because they can't stop adding new Pokemon in the games. They even said this wasn't a decision they made lightly. LTH wasn't the cause of it but the Pokemon games themselves. Remember Gear Project that I mentioned from above? It's a system that allows Game Freak to make games outside of the Pokemon mainline. They made Tembo, Giga Wrecker, Pokemon Quest and Pocket Card Jockey during the development span of the 3DS Pokemon games, and the Dex cut did not happen then. If Gear Project is to blame, then the cut would've happened sooner when Harmoknight was developed during X&Y.\n\nEven if LTH wasn't made during SwSh and GF hired more programmers, Dexit is still going to happen. The decision to support a handful of Pokemon is to give the developers a break from facing monotony to update all 800 species to get them to working on the Switch's hardware. That's a horrible thing to put on them along with crunch.\n\nGame Freak did not split the team in half when SwSh and LTH were in the works. Not only LTH was made by 60 people, but the credits for both games show that over 20 people worked on both titles, including key people like Satoshi Tajiri, Ken Sugimori and Jun'chi Masuda. This misconception came from the “Team A (Gear Project) and Team B (Pokemon)” that was said in one interview. It's just another way of saying that two different groups are working on different projects within the company. It had nothing to do with quality.\nProtip: Never say that the others teams is inferior to Team A in any industry. You're basically saying the people in those other teams are terrible even if they were assigned to them against their will.\n\nI can go on but I'm hitting the review limit here. Criticize the game for flaws and other issues all you want, but remember that game development is very complicated and I only scratched the surface of it. I'll leave it that even if Masuda wasn't the producer for SwSh, even if LTH wasn't a thing and they got tons of people on board, they'd still agree that the Dex cut had to be done. It sucks, even I was disappointed. Yet I understand why this has to happen. It's not worth the stress of reviewing all 800 models and animations just to continue the tradition Pokemon has up until now.","timestamp_created":1594333101,"timestamp_updated":1606523553,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":85,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.603860259056091309","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zoCRhvYCfoeVlAI="}
