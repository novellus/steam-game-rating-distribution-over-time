Not a deal breaker for me, might be for some.\nAll the pieces are always oriented correctly, this could be a plus or minus depending on your preference. With these puzzles, it seemed to make no real difference, as the pieces were so similar. (see below)\nDownsides are the music, pleasant tinkly piano music that gets monotonous fast (but I turn that off and play my own music, so no biggie) and the cut, which is very cookie-cutter, taking out piece shape from the jigsaw equation almost totally. Except for the edges, there are exactly two shapes. The game wont let you click to wrong pieces together, so it isn't as bad as if it was a physical puzzle, but a little less fun.\nIn addition the one puzzle I did on several size options has big white sections, which is irritating, total coverage of puzzle with some sort of image would be preferable. \nIf I could add a feature, it would be one to spread the pieces out, on the larger puzzles this can become a bit of a bother, but nothing serious. \nAll an all, and easy thumbs up, got it on a good sale, which helps. Nothing special, but better than some other jigsaw options out there.","timestamp_created":1608677629,"timestamp_updated":1608769587,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48/iIyfYCf6alvAI="}
