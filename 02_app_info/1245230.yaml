    about_the_game: "&quot;Dungeon Rose&quot; is a real-time chess game that is lightly\
      \ developed and highly competitive. Players in each round need to work with\
      \ 50 other players to survive on the same map at the same time, the game is\
      \ more difficult. Improve your character's combat effectiveness by earning silver\
      \ and gold rewards in battle.<br />\r\nHere are some basic survival guidelines:<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n(1) The assassin's difficulty is relatively low, suitable\
      \ for novices, and the wizard is relatively difficult.<br />\r\n(2) Try not\
      \ to fight with people at the beginning, grab the monsters, search for experience\
      \ balls and equipment, and develop as soon as possible.<br />\r\n(3) Equipment\
      \ quality White &lt;Blue &lt;Gold, double-click the equipment in the treasure\
      \ chest to pick it up.<br />\r\n(4) Find the key before the countdown in the\
      \ upper right corner, and you can enter the next level with the key.<br />\r\
      \n(5) The key killed by the player will be taken away by the opponent, of course,\
      \ you can also use this method to grab others.<br />\r\n(6) At level 1, priority\
      \ is given to attacking mobs at level 1 (except for lava spiders). Mobs at level\
      \ 3 do not lose a second, while lava spiders at level 1 can spike, (but experience\
      \ is not enough to immediately rise to level 2.<br />\r\n(7) Be careful when\
      \ you have blood, those insignificant villains will definitely kill you first\
      \ ...<br />\r\n(8) Wooden organs can push you far, can be used to hurry, and\
      \ sometimes can save your life.<br />\r\n(9) Try to use the time to read the\
      \ note to open the box and adjust the equipment.<br />\r\n(10) Common skills\
      \ can be considered to unlock evolution, the effect is significant ~<br />\r\
      \n(11) If you do not know the equipment skills at the beginning, you can study\
      \ it in the introduction interface outside the battle.<br />\r\n12) Join the\
