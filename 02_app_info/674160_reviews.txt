My coat rack was scarier than this game! that's not even a joke! My reaction is on youtube.","timestamp_created":1603880290,"timestamp_updated":1603880290,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7eCtt/UCe8POqgI="}
