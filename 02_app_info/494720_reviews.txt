I got bored with beating my own score in video games over twenty years ago, and Morphblade doesn't really offer anything more than that. If the developer could find a way to build a story around this game like he did with Gunpoint (a great game that I played through twice), then maybe it would have a better chance of holding my interest.","timestamp_created":1610156624,"timestamp_updated":1610156624,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiIm08vYCcIvYwQI="}
