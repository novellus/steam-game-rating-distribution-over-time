You die a lot. Beautiful art and music. The three characters are all unique and interesting though I like the starting one best personally. There are a few unlockable skills (6 per character of which 3 can be active at any given time) which make figuring out the combat a bit more interesting. I like that there's Chilean soldiers in the rift helping you fight,  love those dudes, especially the pistol/sword dude and shotgun/axe guy (spearman is fine I guess, but he's got molotovs instead of a firearm, so boo). Found myself trying to save them in combat as much as I could and kneeling at the wounded guys' sides a minute before dashing off into the abyss to avenge them. Good for a few hours of pretty fun combat at a time. Repetitive environments. Each character is stuck using their single weapon type. I enjoy the story, but there isn't much to it, you're part of a warlocks dream and have to go down and end it before it starts up again and the next hero gets a go, or just dive back in. The monsters of the abyss can be captured with your special ability once you charge it up through power ups and you can swap  to your captured monster and play as them which is a pretty awesome dynamic. When your hit points hit 0, you must control a Chilean soldier as they struggle to survive monsters and get to an alter to resurrect your main (and way more powerful than the little guys) hero.  The gameplay requires patience and precision, and sometimes you still get killed even though you did it all right, but that's life. It's a fun game with satisfying combat, great music, and a couple really cool and unique ideas well implemented.","timestamp_created":1610011307,"timestamp_updated":1610011307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v92J7vYCdqWdwQI="}
