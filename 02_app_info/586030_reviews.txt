Each plays very differently and allows different strategies\n- the maps are fantastic and I love that positioning your units is key to be successful\n- the artwork (I am talking about the finished art) is just beautiful\n- there is a time-out, that pairs you with the AI, if you cannot find a PVP match within a certain period of time (really important due to the still limited playerbase)\n- the generous login rewards and in game rewards (but see comment on lootboxes in general below)\n- no seasons (yet); you rank up permanently, if you win enough games and as such play against opponents with similar skill/collection\n\nWhat I don't like about this game:\n- I more and more dislike lootboxes/microtransactions. I bought the steam summer sale. It allowed me to have a better collection from the start and a better playing experience than starting from scratch, I think. So far, so good...\nHowever for potential expansions,  I would prefer to pay a fixed amount and get the full expansion set. The cards could be unlocked while playing the game, giving you long-time motivation, instead of anxiety opening what you don't want or need to improve your current deck. \n\nOn a sidenote:\n- that the art is unfinished doesn't impact play\n- I don't think the game is unbalanced (anymore). Sure some matchups are harder than others, but that's part of the package having heroes with different abilities and armies. I play mostly green, but not because it is particularly strong, more because its suits my playstyle.\n\n@Spiritwalk Games: Good luck! I love the game!\n\nThank you for reading my short review. Give Shardbound a try, it's after all a free to play game.","timestamp_created":1515407578,"timestamp_updated":1515407578,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.723839342594146729","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwuZLV6uACe+y5lQE="}
