      \ boy into a raging psychopath. Luckily, an Earth-like exoplanet within an achievable\
      \ distance from the Solar system had been recently discovered. Pooling volunteers\
      \ from around the globe, a first-of-a-kind interstellar spacecraft was built\
      \ and sent to colonize the yet unexplored planet. The gargantuan ship was named\
      \ Pilgrimage, embodying the hopes of all of the humanity. To everyone\u2019\
