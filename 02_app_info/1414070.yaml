    review: 'This game is a good game, don''t let the graphics fool you.


      It builds on the concept of sokoban quite well, even if many of its puzzles
      drift away from the main idea of sokoban and become more like a better version
      of chip''s challenge. Much of ''those'' stray puzzles are welcomed additions
      when compared to the variety it already has when focusing only on its more sokoban-like
      puzzles of pushing objects onto spots.


      Being only 200 levels long, it''s rather short when combined with its relative
      ease, albeit its difficulty does fluctuate. For me, it took only 22 hours to
      beat all of the levels... This ensures that the game can''t possibly overstate
      its welcome, if such a thing was possible with its variety.


      The game organises its variety further and keeps the game fresh with 10 chapters,
      20 levels long per chapter, each focusing on different elements or sets of elements.
      The game is also divided into sets of 100 levels, consisting of the initial
      10 levels of each chapter, and the last 10 levels of each chapter.


      Only one game element seems particularly underutilised and not fully explored,
      but otherwise, the game uses all of its elements in a lot of different combinations,
      again being reminiscent of chip''s challenge at times.


      Whether you find the game hard or easy, I think you''ll find its solutions interesting
      and satisfying most of the time.'
