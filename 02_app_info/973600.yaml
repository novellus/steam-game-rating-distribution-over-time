    review: 'It''s cheap, it contains a lot of tools and it''s pretty easy to use.
      I''m sure the program has it''s limits, but it''s hard not to recommend for
      the price. Support is also very fast. I had an issue, reported it on their website,
      and got a response the next day with a fix.


      Others have mentioned that you can''t add content from the online store in this
      version. I myself have no need for that, since I already have effects and other
      things I can add manually, but for those that are interested there may be a
      solution: https://steamcommunity.com/app/973600/discussions/0/2246677986016017090/


      Edit: I got it on sale for 9.99 euros, in case anyone is wondering.'
