    review: "A lot of people are saying that \"It's not co-op!\". It IS co-op, just\
      \ not online, and the devs never stated that it was online. \nWith that out\
      \ of the way, i recommend this game. It's slightly buggy and the controls are\
      \ a bit wonky at times (i recommend playing with a controller) but other than\
      \ that it's really fun! The sound design is good, and the game keeps surprising\
      \ you. Just when you start to get a bit bored, the game tosses something new\
      \ at you. \n\nit costs less than a dollar, pretty good time killer if you ask\
      \ me"
