    review: 'Expectations were high after playing "Greed: The last scientist". Sadly,
      said expectations were not met. Some of the Hidden Object screen had a new mechanic
      that involves clicking a random object to move it aside to find the hidden object,
      or said object is shown in separate pieces that the player has to assemble.
      Kudos for trying something new but it wasn''t executed properly, in my opinion.


      The story was weak, even for a game of this genre. The logic behind using some
      items was wackier than usual right from the start. Puzzles are the usual recycled
      ones from the company''s other games but in fewer amounts. Felt like the picked
      the most boring ones, too. Playing time was much shorter than previous games.
      If I had to find something nice to say about the game... Graphics were nice,
      I guess?


      If you must, get this in a bundle. There''s much better games out there.'
