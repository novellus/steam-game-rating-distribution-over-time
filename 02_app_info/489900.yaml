    about_the_game: "<strong>Bayla Bunny</strong> has discovered a book full of maps\
      \ to magical treasures and loot, and sets out on an exciting adventure to discover\
      \ them all. Energized and ready to explore, she takes off running and once she\
      \ gets going, she rarely stops! <br><br><strong>Bayla Bunny</strong> offers\
      \ a fun gameplay experience combining the best of platform- and runner-games,\
      \ and your task is to control Bayla as she hops, runs, jumps, bounces, ducks,\
      \ swings, rides and rocket herself through 27 challenging levels collecting\
      \ coins, keys and treasure chests full of goodies. The faster you complete a\
      \ level, the higher ranking you will achieve. But this is not an easy task \u2026\
      \ Obstacles will hinder your progress, and you will encounter enemies such as\
      \ rowdy raccoons, pushy porcupines, raging bulls, evil mushrooms, crazy plants\
      \ and frog kings all while avoiding flying arrows, rolling barrels, dancing\
      \ fireballs, speedy cannonballs, pounding hammers and dangerous dynamite! <br><br><strong>Bayla\
      \ Bunny</strong> is not only cute; it is a fun game suitable to anyone looking\
      \ for an exhilarating platform experience full of rewards and surprises."
