The aim of the game is to win from the Virus, this as Bacteria or Nanobots.\n\nGameplay\nYou have your collectors, mines and fighters (and you can shoot these torpedoes). These all you can spawn with one single button Z, while holding down the Z button you can see the different units and select them like this. So your collectors collect and grow bigger and on some point you might want to recall them using the X button before they get wiped out by the enemy fighters. You also have mines that circle around your \"base\" for defensive purposes mostly.  Then you have fighters, these attack enemies anywhere in the playing field by bumping in them (this eventually kills them as well). As the last unit you can use there is the torpedo, well looks like a kamikazerun.. but anyway you can use this to directly attack the virus. Depending on the size of you main body the units you have can be smaller or larger too. \n\nUpdates\nNone for a while I see, that's why I'm changing my review.\n\nNew verdict\nOk, checked it out today 26-03-2019, things changed is sound options and difficulty. It looks abandoned by now.. no new messages ? ? ? I mean it is ok like what it is now but I'd understand if you're looking for some depth then I'd not recommend this right now.","timestamp_created":1459074404,"timestamp_updated":1553633107,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558706462383270264","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4w/vv3ekCeoieVA=="}
