      /><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>At it''s core, VOID Arena is a classic ARPG Experience
      wrapped in a first person perspective.</strong></h2> Your adventure will start
      in one of three major cities: Sylvannar (Half-Elf), a struggling new colony
      for the least wanted of society, Kel''Druu (Drawrf), an underground dwarven
      mining city with a dark under belly, &amp; Ban Yakoi (Human), a place once teeming
      with riches and wealth, now is little more than a barren wasteland. Once  your
      character progresses through the introductory quest, you will gain access to
      the Sanctuary as well as all the abilities in the game and your first set of
      Legendary Armor. At this point it is up to you whether you want to progress
      your character through the story or try something else. Progress in the story
      will unlock both new areas of the map and unique loot and can always be played
      with friends. If you have already finished the story or if a story narrative
      is not your cup of tea, you can travel to either the Arena or The Wilderness
      for some PVP Action. The Arena can be entered with friends or solo, The Wilderness
      is a unique gameplay mode that combines PVP &amp; PVE requiring you to collect
      3 different books to escape with your life and your loot.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1280210/extras/gameplay.gif?t=1609276531"
      /><br><br>The ultimate goal in VOID Arena is to bring balance back to the world
      by restoring the grace that it once had, or to find and keep it for yourself
      and be the eternal ruin of all. Delve into perilous dungeons, loot legendary
      items, create your own builds to decide the fate of a dying world.<br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Core Mechanics</strong></h2><br><br><strong>Combat
      </strong>- Choose 6 active abilities and 4 passive abilities from a seemingly
      endless pool of magic &amp; physical skills. <br><br><strong>Loot System</strong>
      - A background program which weighs the player''s progression through the game
      as well as current active skills always giving you a better chance at finding
      loot that meaningfully improves your character.<br><br><strong>Crafting </strong>-
      Collect materials dropped by enemies or from breaking down unwanted loot. Use
      these materials to craft weapons, armor, potions. <br><br><strong>Exploring</strong>
      - Exploring the world of Kynn will grant you access to the different areas of
      the map. Once explored an area can always be fast traveled to. Almost all zones
      feature semi-procedural level generation and will be slightly different each
      time they are visited. <br><br><strong>Semi-Permanent Death</strong> - Any item
      which is not Soul-Bound either equipped or in the inventory will be lost upon
      death. Lost Items can be recovered at the location of your death.<br><br><strong>Seasonal
      Play</strong> - Players can choose to create either seasonal or permanent characters
      which individually will not share the loot in their stashes. If a seasonal character
      is created, their story progress and leaderboards will be tied into the current
      season. Seasons will rotate every 90 days. Each new season will feature meaningful
      updates in the form of season-only armor, weapons, abilities, events or mechanics.  <br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>The Wilderness</strong></h2><br><strong>The Wilderness
      is a unique game mode that brings together the worlds of PVE &amp; PVP</strong>.
      As an objective based game mode, the only way to &quot;win&quot; is to collect
      the 3 different books and use them to open a portal back to the sanctuary. Each
      player or group enters the wilderness with 1 of the 3 books and must eliminate
      at least 1 other player to collect the remaining books.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1280210/extras/books.png?t=1609276531"
      /><br><br><strong>Wilderness encounters will feature up to 100 players</strong>
      and can be joined solo or with a group of up to 5. Within the wilderness, players
      will find unique enemies, delves and loot. Upon death a player may choose to
      return to the sanctuary, having lost any non-soulbound loot that they have found.
      They may also choose to return to life up to three times, and attempt to retrieve
      that which they have lost.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1280210/extras/Add_a_heading__1_.gif?t=1609276531"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>The Arena</strong></h2><br>The Arena is found deep
      within the underbelly of Kynn. The Arena can be entered alone or with up to
      4 allies. Arena matches can be played in two modes: Casual or Ranked. Ranked
      matches will track seasonal progress and grant rewards based on your rank as
      compared to other players. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1280210/extras/arena.gif?t=1609276531"

      generated series of dungeons that will both test your skills and reward you
      with riches... that is, if you can survive.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1280210/extras/rift.gif?t=1609276531"
      /><br><br><strong>Void Rifts</strong> are semi procedurally generated dungeons
      where by defeating enough of the rift''s minions you will summon the rift''s
      protector. Defeating the protector will grant the player riches beyond their
      wildest dreams. <br><br><strong>Infinite Rifts </strong>harbor similar evils,
      though this time in waves. Each subsequent wave will become increasingly more
      difficult and each 4th wave will end in a massive boss battle. If the boss is
      vanquished, participating players will open a portal to a  &quot;treasure room&quot;
      where they can claim their spoils and return to the sanctuary or try their luck
      by increasing the difficulty and venturing deeper into the rift.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Itemization</strong></h2><br><strong>Itemization
      in VOID Arena is the underlying system that supports progression in the game.
      </strong>While there is no obvious leveling system in the game, the most impactful
      versions of items will only drop in higher difficulties. Players benefit from
      a background loot program that will ensure you getting the items that you need,
      along with a random chance to get almost any items in the game. Items come in
      varying rarities: Common, Uncommon, Legendary, Artifact &amp; Grand Artifact.<br><br><img

      /><br><br><strong>Items can drive stats such as damage, defense, resistances
      and elemental bonuses</strong>. Some special items can also directly affect
      the way that skills work. This effect can be as simple as adding extra damage
      to completely replacing the skills with a new ability.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1280210/extras/treasure.gif?t=1609276531"
