    review: 'some decent digital junk food. it''s pretty much infectinator in vr and
      fer $6 rounding up it''s worth it for some time wasting. edit got to the a rank
      levels and i got some bugbears


      1. turret target prioritisation is bad. like trying to shoot unarmed civs halfway
      across the map while someone is stabbing them in the face kinda bad also don''t
      lead shots making them miss long range targets.


      2.when enemies hit zero health they don''t die right away and linger for a second
      or 3 and they keep attacking during that delay not so bad in early game when
      is just cops but it''s annoying late game when they start throwing high dps
      enemies at you like the sword men


      3. some maps are a little on the busted side and troops have a bad habit of
      getting stuck and being incapable of moving on them'
