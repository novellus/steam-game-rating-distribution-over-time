It is definately a beginner friendly song.  If I didn't like the vocals to this song as much as I do then I would not recommend this one, but even though it's boring to play I love the vocals so it still gets a thumbs up from me.  I can always use this as a warm up or cool down song.\n\nDon't know for the Guitar.","timestamp_created":1498526701,"timestamp_updated":1498526701,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548298776149749756","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43NrJ89wCfP6hfQ=="}
