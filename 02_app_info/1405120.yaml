      /><br>In the Dungeon and Puzzles, Hero can use different abilities by switching
      to a different type of equipment. You can use a sword to attack monsters around
      you, use a bow and arrow to kill enemies from afar. Push the obstacles back
      using a shield, and even pull the monster forward to change its position using
      gloves. You have to think about what kind of ability needs to be used in every
      step, kill all monsters and reach the exit to clear the level.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1405120/extras/Steam_20200923-2.gif?t=1601541440"
      /><br>This game has 150 hand-crafted levels. The player has to understand the
      game's mechanics to be able to clear levels. In order to reach an advanced goal,
      you have to optimize the solution. Sometimes you even have to discard the original
      solution you made before. Looking at things and thinking of a new way from a
      different perspective, then you finally reach the goal.<br><br>If you clear
      the level by spent fewer steps than the standard, welcome to share your amazing
