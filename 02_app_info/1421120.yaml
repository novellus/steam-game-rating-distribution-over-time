    review: "So this is an old platformer from the 80s. Do not expect revolutionary\
      \ mechanics.\nI used to play this on an ATARI and I love the experience of the\
      \ retro mode.\n\nThe modern mode adds side-scrolling which makes the game less\
      \ static. There is no vertical scroll for some reason. \nThe spider enemy looks\
      \ terrifying, the skull is neat and the snake is ok. The player character is\
      \ awful and breaks the experience. You really can't put this into a game in\
      \ year 2020.\n\nThe retro mode has some interesting differences from the original\
      \ version. In the 1983 original there was some clipping so that a small part\
      \ of the character model could be inside the chain without this resulting in\
      \ death. The hitbox has been corrected in this version, however. Also there\
      \ appear to be been some additions that I have not completely reviewed yet.\n\
      \nOverall, I am happy to own this version of the game."
