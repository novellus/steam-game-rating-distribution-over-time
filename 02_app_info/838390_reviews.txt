Merry Glade is a weird game with one incredibly hard and barely possible very early level, and it still gives me nightmares to this day. Nonetheless, the game isn't great, but some people might have fun with a quasi-puzzle game about avoiding obstacles and stuff\n\nNot the most interesting game ever, not the most functional, nor the most pretty, nor the most anything. This game doesn't do anything particularly memorable, other than have some mildly cool enemy and trap designs and stuff, although I'm having trouble remembering any other than the wolf and the UFO","timestamp_created":1608673323,"timestamp_updated":1609534416,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513483941555023193","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyMTu3/YCf62jvAI="}
