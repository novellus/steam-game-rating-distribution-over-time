    review: "I bought this a while ago on sale, I knew it was in Early Access but\
      \ it showed promise and I thought WarioWare in VR would be a thing that's hard\
      \ to mess up.\n\nI waited for a big update before trying it. An update that\
      \ never came, because as it turns out it's abandoned by the devs and hasn't\
      \ been updated in 3 years. I decided to give it a try now and it's extremely\
      \ lackluster.\n\n\u2022 The default button bindings for the Vive wands shows\
      \ how old it is: you grab with the side grips rather than with the trigger.\
      \ Thankfully you can change this.\n\u2022 There's a distinct lack of anti-aliasing\
      \ despite every model being made out of a handful of triangles.\n\u2022 The\
      \ game defaults to 3 players, making it clear that it was never planned to be\
      \ enjoyed alone. I doubt it would be very fun sharing your headset every 3 minutes\
      \ anyway...\n\u2022 Props often spawn outside the safe area, which makes it\
      \ either impossible for me to interact with, or makes me risk knocking furniture\
      \ around.\n\u2022 About half the minigames are reskins of others.\n\u2022 If\
      \ you win the minigames during the screen transition, it makes validation sounds\
      \ but it doesn't count as a win.\n\u2022 A lot of minigames rely on color-coding\
      \ or remembering lists, which has no place in a game like this and makes certain\
      \ minigames unbeatable if you're colorblind.\n\u2022 The game lacks personality.\
      \ The music sounds like copyright-free stuff you grab as a placeholder. The\
      \ \"great job!\" voiceline is grating and plays every 10 seconds. There are\
      \ barely any sound effects, or the ones that are in don't sound good (popping\
      \ a balloon makes a *thud* sound). The main menu has the pictures of the devs\
      \ hung on the wall for you to look at, so you can put a face on the complaints\
      \ you have after coming to the realisation that you bought an abandoned test\
      \ game.\n\nPerhaps I should've tried the demo. Oops."
