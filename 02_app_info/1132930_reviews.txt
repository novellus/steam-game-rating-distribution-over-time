This is not too bad. Sure, the level editor is very limited and you can complete the campaign in under a hour or less. You can easily dodge The Phantom if you just go around him when he gets close. This is like the only horror game where you can customize your surroundings. In other games, the developers just either make you have to code your own or they aren't targeting horror audiences. So, since this is the only game like that out there, It's definitely something to buy if you can't code or are looking for a time killer with just barely any replayability, which stinks but I guess no game can last forever","timestamp_created":1608926104,"timestamp_updated":1608926104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnIHezfYCfriTvQI="}
