I don't know if the game will be better viewed if the player can make the scenario last longer.   \n\nThe game becomes extremely boring once the player finishes the research of the first type of armoured car and owns a lot of them. Because in the game the armoured units are almost invincible against others and the AIs produce mainly infantry even if they are able to produce other units. This makes the system of tactical battle completely unbalanced and the shabby interface and mechanism of tactical battle are also dissapointing.\n\nThe strategic interface is comparably better.  However it should still be better designed. There are 3 resources (populations, industry points and education points) in the system and you would find in most cases only the education points are important.\n\nNo doubt with such a cheap price one can only acquire a crudely designed game. The content is seemingly rich but indeed monotone.","timestamp_created":1609894648,"timestamp_updated":1609894648,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjNvM6vYCeZbvwAI="}
