    review: "This game is NOT worth the money. I've been a huge fan of beat-em-ups\
      \ for years. If you too are a genre fan and are fairly tolerant of games' shortcomings,\
      \ I strongly urge you to avoid this title regardless!\n\nRoad Fist is an unlikely\
      \ attempt to combine the traditional arcade beat-em-up with contemporary 3rd-person\
      \ melee-combat action games, namely Dark Souls. The concessions to the latter\
      \ really increase the difficulty. You have to beat each level one one life,\
      \ with no health items (at least that I saw), and restart the level when you\
      \ die. A stamina bar a la Dark Souls decreases each time you attack and slowly\
      \ regenerates. leaving you unable to attack if it runs out. The only controls\
      \ are punch, kick, block, and dodge/roll. That's right, no running attacks,\
      \ no jump button.\n\nThe control scheme really ruins the game. The graphics\
      \ are fully 3D, and the perspective is level compared to the more elevated perspective\
      \ of the traditional beat-em-ups. Unlike such fully 3D beat-em-ups as Fighting\
      \ Force, The Bouncer, or The Rage, the camera is basically fixed and only moves\
      \ left or right. The controls are absolute rather than relative (i.e. if you\
      \ push down, your character turns and then runs down no matter which way they\
      \ were facing). Enemies, however, can attack you not just along the x-axis but\
      \ from 360 degrees. This gameplay, control scheme, and camera angle do not work\
      \ well, and the enemies have very precise hitboxes. They can shift position\
      \ slightly out of your barrage of punches, which demands a fine-tuned adjustment\
      \ once you notice they're just slightly out of your line of fire. A fine-tuned\
      \ adjustment, easy with relative controls, is all but mpossible with this type\
      \ of absolute ones; your character cannot turn in place. Enemies can, but not\
      \ you. And there's no reason for this. Say you're facing right and press left.\
      \ Your character will start to turn around, then begin to run up or down in\
      \ a sweeping semicircle covering more than half of the vertical space until\
      \ they're running left.\n\nMaybe it's better with a gamepad. The developer has\
      \ a small note in the features list (and on the options screen) that a gamepad\
      \ is \"recommended.\"\_ If the gamepad would make the difference, they should\
      \ list\_ \"bloody nigh impossible without a gamepad\" as a feature! I've attempted\
      \ the first level two dozen times and have only once managed to get past the\
      \ first five enemies. Not only do you have a single life, but these mooks will\
      \ drain your life bar as quick as a boss in Final Fight boss if you're not playing\
      \ it so defensive as to make the game feel like a different genre entirely.\
      \ There's no reason for the game to be like this. It's as though the developer\
      \ hardly did any beta testing and was so desperate to add a twist to an established\
      \ formula that they stripped it of what made the formula fun in the first place.\
      \ Man, and I really wanted to like it!\n\nThe graphics are pretty good, and\
      \ the game could have had potential. I try to see the good in these in indie\
      \ game but can't wrap my head around these design choices. Some beat-em-ups\
      \ from the golden age and mid 90s admittedly had unfair difficulty/bosses and\
      \ cheap deaths. Play Road Fist (at least with keyboard and mouse controls),\
      \ and suddenly Battletoads Arcade seems fair and indulgent. No exaggeration:\
      \ the melee controls for the original Alone in the Dark felt more userfriendly!\
      \ Even if you like this type of game and are more skilled gamer than myself,\
      \ don't be fooled by that fun-looking gameplay video. You'll be disappointed.\n\
      \n Also, sometimes the game will freeze on the main menu, meaning you'll have\
      \ to go switch to Task Manager to close it.\_"
