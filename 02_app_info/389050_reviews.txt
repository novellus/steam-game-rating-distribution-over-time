Specials are done with a diagonal down input rather than command inputs like traditional 2d fighting games. That said the characters tend to be fairly unique despite the limited movelist. Easy to pick up though a few characters have some depth this game makes a great starting point for new players to 2d fighting games as well as a good side game for 2d fighting game veterans. A few character matchups require more work from one player than the other but even in those cases there is a way for either player to win.\n\nAlso the netcode is really good making it good to play online with friends.\n\nOnly real downside is that it's been unfinished for a long time but the roster is there and all the most important game modes are there as well Career/arcade mode, Online ranked, Online invite with steam friends, Vs local, Vs computer, Training mode, and some other ones I can't remember right now (challenges and something else I think). Only thing missing is a lobby system for multiple players to hang out in without being steam friends which would make the game easier to stream and play with viewers.","timestamp_created":1608268084,"timestamp_updated":1608268084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwsu6PuvYCedeNuwI="}
