    review: 'Good game for a good price.

      Clear and easy, old school interface.

      If you struggle with Campaign set up, for start, you can leave it up to the
      AI and only engage in the tactical battles.

      I like vintage music and radio broadcast from the game.

      Long and interesting gameplay even in the Early Access stage.

      I am happy to support this project.'
