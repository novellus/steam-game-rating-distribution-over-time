If you have any interest in procedural content generation you should seriously consider getting this.  If you are a game developer that uses Unity you should get this regardless of intention just to have this wrecking ball in your tool belt.  Support is fantastic. Got an update for a bug I submited in a few days.  The potential here is mind boggling.  The community is small at the moment but once some games are released that make use of this fantastic i'm sure the user base will explode.   The current asking price is a steal for what you get.  I can see them charging hundreds of dollars easily once word gets out.","timestamp_created":1500951083,"timestamp_updated":1500951083,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.592613279819488525","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4//7pu90CeZztgAE="}
