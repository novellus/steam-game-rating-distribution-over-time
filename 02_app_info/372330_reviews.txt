There are a lot of games with better art style and story that are just a little more expensive. If You had an extra 4$ to spend You'd find a lot better games than this. I know that these game series feature the same characters but it makes most of the work being copy pasted games with a poor story. The story is so short that if You were to complete it fast enough You could even get all the endings and refund the game. Story isn't the best here but if You were to play one game from this series I'd recommend this one. And it's also easy to max achievements. So I just recommend getting it on sale for easy achievements or anime backgrounds.","timestamp_created":1609571995,"timestamp_updated":1609571995,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41/H94PYCc+7SvwI="}
