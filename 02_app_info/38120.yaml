      \ only you won't have to experience the nasty smells! You will, however, be\
      \ required to invest the money you earn in new equipment. Building a cheese\

      \ a specific task, such as producing a certain number of eggs. Each new level\
      \ is more challenging than the last, so you must increase the capacity of your\
      \ warehouse and improve the performance of your production facilities. You can\
      \ even buy a larger truck capable of delivering more goods to market! All of\
      \ this makes dealing with the occasional bear easier. Featuring compelling and\
