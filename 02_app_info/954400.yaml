      Boys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable\

      \ age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color.\
      \ If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the\
      \ correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and\
      \ the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color\

      \ easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.<br />\r\n\
      School-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is\
      \ divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first\
      \ to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding\
      \ addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples\
      \ and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach\
      \ the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.<br />\r\nThose who are\
      \ learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will\
      \ be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.<br />\r\nTo make\
      \ the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset\
      \ colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open.\
      \ Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the\
      \ image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing\
      \ the color scheme to suit your taste. Try the program right now!"

    review: Bought this for my little kids as there isnt a lot of kid content on steam.  This
      was easy for them to learn and play, and they like it enough to dump hours into
      it.  Worth the value.
