    review: I ended up returning this game. The user interface was garbage and it
      was hard to tell what I could pick or not for character before starting the
      game. There is no guide as to what buttons do what for the characters. Some
      didn't seem to do anything other than one thing while others did a special related
      to thier sport. Even without all those issues which were really bad the game
      just didn't feel like it would be fun. I will admit to not actually getting
      to play it with others before I returned it.
