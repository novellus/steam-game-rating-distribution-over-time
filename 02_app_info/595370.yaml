    review: 'Appears to be censored, this is 480p and come with English Dub audio
      only. (kind of wanted to watch the Japanese one where people get sent to shadow
      realms, main character peeping tom and Kaiba trying to commit suicide.)


      I bought this on sale for a dollar, why? because it''s time to -d-d-d-d-duel.


      Why are you reading this.'
