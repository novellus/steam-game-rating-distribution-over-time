    short_description: Speyarranoth is a classic sci-fi space asteroid shooter in
      3D. You control the game using WASD and shoot with the space key. It's wonderful
      to just blast full speed through the asteroid fields lasers ablaze and enjoy
      the explosive light show.

    developer_response: Thank you for your honest review! As this game is in Early
      Access Program for a low price I was hoping to elicit constructive criticism
      for my first published game and build an early adopter community to steer the
      direction of the game. I will try to put more effort into the game in the future
      to address any concrete issues identified by users as well as consider new features.
      I will start working based on concrete issues identified in your YouTube review.

    review: 'I play a LOT of trash games that should never belong on the Steam store
      front.


      This game has to be the absolute WORST game I''ve played in this year 2020.  The
      year 2020 has been a year I''d like to forget with Covid and everything else
      that''s just been bad right along with it.  This trash game is a pretty good
      game to define what kind of year 2020 has been for so many of us.   - But that
      doesn''t mean you should purchase it!  Oh HELL NO!


      This Game Should Be Called "SlapaLazyDevaLot" and not "Speyarranoth"!  Would
      have been a MUCH better name!

      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh_iAd375zQ&t=49s


      NOT RECOMMENDED!  If someone gifts you this game, Do NOT play it, Do NOT accept
      it!  ..Instead, un-friend them immediately and mute them forever!  They are
      NOT a friend!  ;-)
