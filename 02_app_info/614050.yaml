    review: "It's like someone tried to mix heroes of might and magic with the pit\
      \ people overworld aesthetic and then dumbed everything wayyyy down. \n\nThat's\
      \ not to say it's a terrible game, hell at 3 bucks Canadian it isn't even a\
      \ bad value proposition if you want something to play for an hour and then forget\
      \ it ever existed.\n\nBut again, it's just way to dumbed down. The \"strategy\"\
      \ aspect of the game which is supposed to remind you of heroes is instead an\
      \ automated battle in which you have very little control besides casting a little\
      \ spell every once in a while. This feels like a tug of war game without the\
      \ tug of war part, strategy is more or less out the window and combat is more\
      \ about throwing as many units into the fray as possible- Which isn't much because\
      \ the devs decided that, instead of having units take up a given value, it would\
      \ be a good idea to have every unit type have their own individual cap based\
      \ on how strong they are. This means that, instead of a \"strong\" unit taking\
      \ up a certain amount of your total supply, you can only have x number of that\
      \ unit based on your current stats. \n\nThe other aspects are also lacking,\
      \ any sense of empire maintaining is non-existent even compared to the heroes\
      \ series which was already barebones in that aspect. Instead of crafting units\
      \ you exclusively get more units by just hiring them at buildings located around\
      \ the map for gold that you find laying around (you do get an income but it\
      \ is negligible considering how little you get for how much time it takes to\
      \ send you more). The plot is minimal and doesn't receive any input during playing.\
      \ It's basically the same level of plot that early super mario games offered\
      \ (i.e. Hey look, the princess is kidnapped! Let's go wander around and do shit\
      \ I guess\").\n\nOverall: Not a terrible game but very underwhelming in every\
      \ aspect."
