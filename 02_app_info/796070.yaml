    review: 'This is quite a good Hidden Object game. I thought the story was interesting
      (for this type of game). The mini-puzzles weren''t just the same ones they always
      use over and over in the newer games. There was some back and forth, but not
      too much. It was almost six hours (on Easy level with a couple of skips).


      Keep in mind it is quite old. It has a Hint button that is largely useless,
      but it does have a Strategy Guide. I found that to be sufficient at the couple
      of places where I got stuck.


      It has oodles and oodles of hidden object scenes. These are the original kind
      with a list of items, usually with one or more interactive item, but well done
      I thought.'
