    review: "A interesting premise and gameplay mechanic and if it had been any longer\
      \ I would have been bored. The story certainly builds up an interesting world\
      \ that our survivor is now exploring in the past and present however it feels\
      \ a little convoluted that he just happens to land around 90 minutes away from\
      \ the same place where I assume everything went wrong.\n\nThe controls feel\
      \ a little janky at times but I think it was just me not realising I couldn't\
      \ teleport into the present as it was no longer solid, however there are parts\
      \ where it does let you teleport in and then kills you after the jump. Because\
      \ of this you have an expectation about how the lantern acts and it makes it\
      \ a bit annoying trying to work out why it's not activating.\n\nThe voice acting\
      \ wasn't great tbh, and some of the sound mixing was a little off, some voices\
      \ were really quiet, some were normal.\n\nThe way it's drawn is really nice,\
      \ though the animation feels a bit jank, like I'm playing a more grimdark drawn\
      \ to life. \n\nIf they make a second one it could definitely go for some other\
      \ mechanics to make it more interesting. Story line wise, I feel like they've\
      \ sort of given themselves a dead end though I guess you could write the astronaut\
      \ back in. Some more solid interactions/reactions with the NPCs of the past\
      \ would be nice too.\n\nI recommend it if you can get it for cheap and you just\
      \ want a small adventure game to pass the time."
