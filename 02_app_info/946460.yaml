      \ /><br><br>An occult yuri game created by members of 2ch, Seven days with the\
      \ Ghost takes place at the girls-only Keisei Academy, in the modern era where\
      \ magic exists alongside science.<br><br>Ayako is told that the Occult Research\
      \ Club will be closed down if more members don\u2019t join, so she does whatever\
      \ she can to attract interest in order to save her club. To do so, she attempts\
      \ to explore the legendary \u201CSeven Wonders of the Academy.\u201D However,\
      \ each wonder she seeks out only results in failure. Finally, she tries the\
      \ only thing that\u2019s left, the Seventh Wonder: \u201CGet kicked by a horse\
      \ and die,\u201D which turns out to be more than outrageous\u2013<br><br>She\
      \ accidentally digs her own grave out of curiosity, and finds something strange.<br><br>These\
      \ are the strange, fun, and\u2014 precious seven days of Ayako and her friends.<br><br><br>With\
      \ only seven days left for her investigation of the Seventh Wonder, Ayako happens\
      \ upon her friend Anna and another girl, Komaki, making love in Anna\u2019s\
      \ room. Ayako seemingly had no intention to peep but in the process of doing\
      \ so she comes across the ghost. Ayako screams in surprise and is subdued by\
      \ Anna who discovers her peeping. Unable to explain herself, Komaki is convinced\
      \ that Ayako is some sort of pervert and Anna dismisses the idea that a ghost\
      \ appeared only because they were having sex. <br><br>Dejected, Ayako returns\
      \ to her room where Miyabi, the ghost, appears before her again. She finds out\
      \ that Miyabi in fact is a fan of peeping on girls making love. With no way\
      \ of writing a report on a ghost that is not only, not haunted by the past or\
      \ a grudge, and instead simply has a unique past time, Ayako tries to find a\
      \ way to convince Anna and Komaki that the ghost is real. <br><br>The plan is\
      \ basically to convince Anna and Komaki to get it on in order to lure the ghost\
      \ out. What Ayako doesn\u2019t realize is that seeing Anna making love to another\
      \ girl is also causing her to question her own emotions and desires as well.\
      \ These are the odd, fun, and precious seven days of Ayako and her friends.\

    review: "One of the longest yuri VN that I played. \nSurprisingly, it was a well\
      \ written story. It took me 7 hours to finish the whole game and I wasn't bored\
      \ not even once. Sure, there are some weird moments (people who played should\
      \ know what I'm talking about), but overall I was really satisfied.\nRest of\
      \ the game was as good as the story. \nBeautiful art, soundtrack that wasn't\
      \ bad and good voice acting (which is actually a rare thing when it comes to\
      \ yuri VN).\n\nApart from some grammatical errors, the whole game is pretty\
      \ much flawless."
