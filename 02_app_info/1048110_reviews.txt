In this current version, there are a few glitches. The best example I have thus far is the image for the Cleric's Church links to the same image as the Fighter's Keep. There were a few other instances such as this, though this is the one that springs to mind. Once those are taken care of, this will be an excellent addition to our weekly game. Well done!","timestamp_created":1553725287,"timestamp_updated":1553777738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.6961326003074646","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkdiX4ukCc8T6vQE="}
