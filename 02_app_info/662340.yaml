      \ /><br><br>Howdy, Squidly here and I\u2019ve been at this project for like\
      \ 2 years now for some reason. Seriously, who\u2019s idea was that? But yanno,\
      \ me and my core team of way-too-good-for-me devs have kept at this for so many\
      \ years cause we deeply believe in it. We believe this game deserves to exist,\
      \ its story deserves to be told, its world deserves to be explored, and we have\
      \ worked tirelessly in service of that. From day one what we\u2019ve wanted\
      \ was to make something you come back to a decade from now and think about.\
      \ We hope that you get to know Aine and her world, and we hope through figuring\
      \ this game out, you\u2019ll feel that you yourself are a part of this too.\
      \ For as long as I\u2019ve lived I\u2019ve dreamed of making a world that people\
      \ would want to explore filled with characters that they\u2019d get to know\
      \ and feel for. Through its loooong development, however, I\u2019ve discovered\
      \ a game is greater than its parts. Lemme tell you - it took us two Kickstarters\
      \ to make this happen. We got our butt kicked hard repeatedly. But what brought\
      \ us back up every time was the community, our humble Discord, our backers,\
      \ our fan artists and speedrunners. This game is not just about Aine\u2019s\
      \ journey, it\u2019s not just about yours either, what this game is about is\
      \ the journey we all take together. That special connection people have when\
      \ they join together to do the impossible, to slay that dragon, that\u2019s\
      \ what this game\u2019s about. It took a gajillion hours of effort from way\
      \ more people than just the core dev team to make this happen, and hopefully\
      \ it shows. I hope Renaine is gonna be that kind of game that lasts, a true\
      \ modern classic, and we\u2019d be honored if you\u2019d join us to its finish!"
