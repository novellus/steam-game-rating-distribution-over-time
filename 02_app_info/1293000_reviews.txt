Shot shaping is in full effect and the disc flight paths are damn near to the real thing. The game is challenging enough that you can never be complacent, but also forgiving enough that it is immensely fun and rewarding when you execute a nice shot.\n\nGreat stuff in this game, and hoping some new courses are coming soon!","timestamp_created":1601922424,"timestamp_updated":1601922424,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzIuB/fQCdvCJpgI="}
