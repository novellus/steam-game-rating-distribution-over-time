This time, your daughter is kidnapped by a mysterious wizard, and you have to save her. This time, you play as Alura. There is a bit of a Christmas theme in the game (collecting morphing objects unlocks five Christmas cards to download).\n\nPlot is decent, the minigames are fun, the HO scenes are thrilling, and the characters are vibrant.\n\nWould recommend getting the bundle.","timestamp_created":1536119978,"timestamp_updated":1536119978,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525563895702362061","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgdf40+UCcYWGqgE="}
