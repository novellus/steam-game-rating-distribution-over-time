It diversifies interaction with other stellar powers so substantially that diplomacy feels like an entirely different playstyle.\n\nThis only becomes more obvious when diplomacy is neglected (say, by playing as Fanatical Purifiers). Whereas genociding all of the filthy xenos is cool, what's even cooler is seeing the fruits of your strategy culminate in political supremacy--whether it be through having effectively dominated the galaxy by overpowering diplomatic weight, or by federating the majority of the galaxy. And the types of federations too! Truly tremendous are the changes made to Stellaris with this expansion, and it is easily a 10/10 addition.","timestamp_created":1609564639,"timestamp_updated":1609564639,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.393700778484344482","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48enh4PYCcunPvwI="}
