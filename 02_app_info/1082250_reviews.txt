Really scratched the itch for a lonely dungeon adventure.  As one of my first VR experiences it really blew me away.  It's not a long game, and it's not a game you play for the graphics, but the adventure is really cool and a great VR experience.","timestamp_created":1602093068,"timestamp_updated":1602093068,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7oWMgvUCc8O6pgI="}
