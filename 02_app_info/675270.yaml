      /><br>You and your teammates (local co-op) are armed only with a guide book
      (100+ pages, hyperlinked) to instruct you in your task of launching rockets.
      Work together to complete complex puzzles by entering codes, pushing buttons,
      flicking switches and turning knobs in order to win the game!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/675270/extras/orange.png?t=1603911629"
      /><br>Assemble your team and assign different roles in order to work together
      and complete your mission. There are numerous missions of varying difficulty,
      designed to be played by 2, 3, 4 or 5+ people effectively. There's also a custom
      mission mode where you can balance the game depending on your group size or
      preferred level of difficulty.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/675270/extras/guideblue.png?t=1603911629"
      /><br>The main game is split up into different sections of the launch, with
      different panels requiring completion in a particular order. Prelaunch panels
      have to be completed before T-0, propulsion and flight panels whilst the rocket
      is in the air, and orbit panels whilst the rocket is in orbit - all the while
      worrying about debug panels.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/675270/extras/stages.png?t=1603911629"
      /><br>The 100+ page PDF guide book can be downloaded for free by your teammates
      and includes instructions for the 20 propulsion 26 prelaunch, 11 orbit, 5 flight
      and 4 debug puzzles that are in the game.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/675270/extras/nrs.png?t=1603911629"
      /><br>The puzzles are designed to be hard, both in terms of knowing what to
      do and being able to actually perform the operation on time. To alleviate some
      of this difficulty, there is a <i>fixed mode</i>, where puzzle answers will
      be the same each time that mission is played (e.g. press the red button on the
      propulsion panel at 60 seconds). Conversely, <i>random mode</i> has different
      answers each time and cannot be completely planned.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul
