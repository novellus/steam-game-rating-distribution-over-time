So it's a must download. Very useful app. Thank you devs for your hard work!\n\nOriginal review below --------\n\nI do recommend this app at the current sale price of $3.75.  However, I would not recommend it at the suggested sale price of $14.99.  I know what this app wants to be, it wants to be a useful commercial / freelancer / self-professional marketing / advertising / UI / prototyping VR standard.  However, the app is still too barren to recommend at full retail price.  It's just missing too many features and it has to compete with the likes of Tilt Brush if it wants to ask for $14.99.  \n\nHowever, there's a good core app here.  I enjoyed playing around with it.  However, it needs more tools and more tutorials to be useful in the way it wants to be the standard in prototyping in VR.  And I hate to say it, but it really does need a way to listen to my music when I'm working with this app.  Yes, even professionals will want this feature when using a HMD.  I think the devs really need to keep in mind that many people will buy this app, but will have no intent of ever prototyping anything (in VR or IRL), it's just something to experiment in and have fun.  They need to focus on not just professionals, but casuals like me.\n\nRate 6/10 needs more seasoning, but buy on sale to support it's growth if you're into this kind of thing","timestamp_created":1505878955,"timestamp_updated":1520716371,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.668143153190612793","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4w8rwiOICdLfnhQE="}
