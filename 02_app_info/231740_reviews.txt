You'll get levels and equipment, and there is a story that is primarily a cheesy spoof on the tired tropes of the role-playing genre. Those things, however, are secondary to the real meat - slaying legions of pixelated foes.\n\nThis game would probably be better on a phone, where you fill idle seconds with monotonous grinding and aren't looking to get too involved. But when you want to engage with games on a PC, there are deeper experiences out there. This game, with its paper-thin and simplistic combat, just isn't worth the time investment.","timestamp_created":1609520209,"timestamp_updated":1609520209,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xqu43/YCeOC5vwI="}
