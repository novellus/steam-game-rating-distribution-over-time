Diery Heaven is a secret fetish game for sadomasochists and I know that because I'm pretty sure completing it makes me one of them. At minimum I'm an unpaid intern. At numerous points I was ready to tear my hair out and it hurt so good.\nDiery Heaven is a game that costs less than two bucks and feels like one of those things you put together as a final project at a game dev boot camp. It consists of five jumping puzzles and I use the term puzzle in the loosest sense. Essentially you are making precision jumps over a variety of moving and stationary platforms and dodging barrels that fall from the sky.\nIt's funny that the game advertises itself as a calming experience because I honestly can't remember the last time I felt this stressed while playing such a simple indie video game. There's no time limit or score or competition to speak of, but Diery Heaven ramps up the stress levels by making each section tough as nails. It doesn't help that the controls are somewhat inconsistent, your character's interaction with the environment is rough, and things move way too fast.\nDiery Heaven is one of those games that is going to frustrate you until the puzzle clicks and you figure out how to work around the systems. And then it'll infuriate you as every fall sends you back to the start. I honestly have a lot of respect for the creator ThroneLab because despite the minimalist style you can tell that a fair amount of thought went into each section.\nFirst person platformers are difficult to pull off and Diery Heaven makes this easier by letting you see your body which helps in precision landing. Movement even in the air is pretty precise except during the massive spinning staircase bit and ultimately four of the five sections are quite gratifying to finally conquer. You want to stand up and give your computer double middle fingers just to reinforce that you beat it.\nThe last stage isn't good, and I'm not entirely sure that this method is what the developers had in mind. But it worked, and I did it my way. So tough cookies.\nI took about 50 minutes to beat the game and that doesn't include the time I spent punching the wall and throwing every curse word in the dictionary at my computer. By the end of it I had a splitting migraine but an odd sense of satisfaction and several potentially fractured knuckles. For two dollars you can have some fun with a short game that doesn't expect anything further from you in return. There's a paper thin plot in there somewhere that could fit on the back of a Kraft Dinner box and who cares.\nCheck it out. I give it a B-\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcZDliw_7FE&feature=youtu.be","timestamp_created":1601847729,"timestamp_updated":1601847729,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.599531590938568115","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tpPk+vQCcYb1pQI="}
