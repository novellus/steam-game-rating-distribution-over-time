Some level traps were also slightly altered.\n\nAs a result, it's not just new character movements and abilities, but whole levels to re-learn as well. Sadly, Kurona's levels don't have as many changes as the other two, though there are still some subtle ones. Ray and Copen however each have very different enemy placement compared to the original game.\n\nAs for the characters themselves:\n\nRay:\nWith the claw, and the aerial dash that damages enemies, gameplay is built on close combat, which is just perfect for the game's scoring and combo system. It is highly satisfying to move around and avoid enemy shots until you're close enough and unleash the highly damaging claw attacks.\nDo yourself a favour and forget that the \"bullet\" attack even exists and focus entirely on the claw and the dashes. \nThough as a result, Ray's game system has very few customization possible, since most of it is related to the \"bullet\" shots, which in Ray's case, is better un-used.\nHowever, Ray is probably the one with the most and best enemy placement changes, which really take his 2 main moves into consideration: dash into several flying enemies in a row, then land and claw the next enemy, and so on.\n\nKoruna: \nDo yourself a favour and unlock the spear drop attack ASAP, which can be acquired once you're past the intro stage. This attack defines Kurona's playstyle and without it, she otherwise plays very much like Ekoro.\nThis sprear drop attack is just like the pogo jump in the Duck Tales game series, and again, being a close combat attack, is just perfect for the game's scoring and combo system. There is a lot of freedom of movement with this move, and once you unlock the hovering ability on top of it, you'll just be bouncing from enemy heads to enemy heads constantly, and again the result is very satisfying.\n\nCopen:\nDue to helping combat pod, he is the one with the most customization options. You can customize both your own shots and the combat pods, meaning there are tons of different possible combinations.\nCopen also has aerial dashes that can be performed diagonally which gives him more air maneuveribility and overall speed than any other character.\n\nSadly, there result of this is that for the most part it's not too compatible with the game's combo system. Due to the faster pace and the added pod attacks, it is very easy to accidentally hit enemies in the distance as they spawn and therefore ruin your scoring streak. So for the most part, I'd just use the \"Phalanx\" attack for the pod, which acts like a shield.\n\nConclusion:\nI think I had more fun playing with Ray and Kurona than with any of the original game characters.\nIn the original game the scoring/combo system felt like it was added on top of the game to add a challenge, even though most attacks risked ruining your combo.\nIn this DLC, with Ray and Kurona being centered around close combat, the combo system shines under a new light; and even if you don't care about the scoring, the playstyle of all 3 characters is very different from those of the original game, which, on top of the new enemy placements, warrant a playthrough.\n\nP.S: I can't believe I'm the first non Japenese review for this DLC\nP.P.S: I'd still pay for a PC port of Azure Striker Gunvolt 2, it's never too late IC!
