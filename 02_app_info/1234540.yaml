    about_the_game: "Meet Bob.  Bob is lost and can't find his way home. Help Bob\
      \ navigate through the Tower of Contrivance. Bob is distressed, which has caused\
      \ him to move at random. Guide him through all 50 levels through whatever means\
      \ necessary. Bob is a good boy. Protect Bob at all costs! <br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nEach level is a self-contained puzzle. Levels progressively get more complicated.\
      \ If Bob or any part of the level gets out of control, you can reset the level\
      \ at any time. It is a simple game with a simple premise, but it is not so simple\
      \ to complete. It will test you. Relax and go with the flow."
