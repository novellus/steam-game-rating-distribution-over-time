A peaceful park, lots of snowmen in different hats.  You build them and then you can hug them if you want.  There is a second part of the game but opinions seem to be mixed about that.  The main game is more then enough on it's own, especially since it goes on sale a lot, I paid less than 2$.  A funny thing though, I built the last snowman right in front of the gate that you need to walk though to finish the game, so I didn't get the achievement.  Honestly more amusing than annoying though.  I enjoyed the time I spend in the snowman park.","timestamp_created":1609734854,"timestamp_updated":1609734875,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528985500335693359","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ495zr5fYCfaClwAI="}
