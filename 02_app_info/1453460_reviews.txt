It raised my heart rate on more than one occasion, which even CoD doesn't do anymore for me.\n\nThe audio is crisp and satisfying as well. Just wanted to note that.\n\nRecommend!","timestamp_created":1607988511,"timestamp_updated":1607988511,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.58749997615814209","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kbDlsfYCf8ulugI="}
