While it is cheap, arcade fun, it's also very light on content. I got this on a Steam sale for $3.59 USD and still think that was too much. Whole game can be finished in 25-45 minutes. There are only 5 levels / scenes. The first three levels just involve shooting at static targets within a time limit.\n\nLevels 4 has a higher difficulty curve and requires moving and shooting at moving targets very quickly. Although there are three weapons, you only really use two of them, which is the handgun and the AK-47. While you can two-hand the AK, you really don't need to. Reloads are semi-realistic as you'll need to pop in the clip and then charge the weapon before firing. \n\nYou have full locomotion but there is no snap or smooth turning. You can reset view but you're not quite always facing the direction you're looking when using it. The voice acting is laughably bad and difficult to understand. The game ran smoothly and there are only a few options that were already set to epic. \n\nThis is cheap arcade fun at the end of the day. While I did have fun, there wasn't much to the game. I am giving a neutral recommendation. Buy on deep, deep sale or in a bundle. I don't think it's worth $8.99 USD, there simply isn't enough content and the quality of content is overall lacking. I'd say it should be $1.99 at the absolute most given what's here.\n\n[b]Rate 5/10. I think they stole a clip from Snoop Dog, but hey, that's Thug Life 4 real ...
