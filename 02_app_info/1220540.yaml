      \ as Steam DLC.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[b]Maiden and Swordsman[/b] is\
      \ an openworld RPG.\n\n[b]- Disclaimer -[/b]\nFor the purposes of this review,\
      \ the adult patch [b]is[/b] installed.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nBefore starting\
      \ a new game, you must choose a character. You can pick either a combat or magic\
      \ oriented character. What each character can/can't do is unclear to me (since\
      \ I can't read Chinese).\n\nThe goal is to find NPCs and complete quests, which\
      \ generally involve killing one or more enemies. You start in a \"hub world\"\
      , which houses shops and possesses no hostiles. Each world is huge, but lacking\
      \ interactive content. You can expect most of your playtime to be walking from\
      \ point \"A\" to point \"B\". Leveling up is an arduous grind, and if you enter\
      \ the wrong location you'll be smashed by enemies hundreds of levels above you.\n\
      \nAs you level up, you can enhance your stats and learn new attacks. The character\
      \ I chose had the ability to \"poison\" enemies, which removed a set percent\
      \ of health each second. This allowed me to kill enemies that would otherwise\
      \ take [i]hours[/i] to kill in minutes. She could also summon (one) companion,\
      \ who made cheesing enemies with my poison [i]even easier[/i]. This game is\
      \ deeply unbalanced (if you couldn't already tell).\n\nI've seen the interface\
      \ and progression system in at least two other titles. [i]I smell asset rip.[/i]\n\
      \n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThe world is under siege, and um. . . these mutant monsters\
      \ have wreaked havoc by \"corrupting\" otherwise normal folk. . . and you're\
      \ the hero who's been chosen to beat back the mutants.\n\nI. . . can't read\
      \ Chinese.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe title screen showcases cast of clashing\
      \ [i]asset flips[/i], but the animated sbackground is a great touch. Under \"\
      Set\" (or \"settings\"), the langauge, volume and resolution can be adjusted.\
      \ Overall, the user interface is basic (and one I've seen from other Unity games).\
      \ Even though my language was set to \"English\", the character select screen\
      \ was in Chinese. The in-game assets do look good, but are [i]clearly[/i] a\
      \ mash of widely used Unity assets.\n\n[b]- The Goods -[/b]\nThe \"Adult\" DLC\
      \ makes a lot of (female) characters go shirtless. Expect upper female nudity.\n\
      \n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nGiven the bugs, visuals and [i]awful[/i] balance, I strongly\
      \ [i]disrecommend[/i] this game. I enjoy these kinds of (generally [i]bad[/i])\
      \ RPGs, but this is one that I couldn't get behind. I feel like I'd been pranked\
      \ with an overpriced piece of [i]memeware[/i].\n\nMaybe this is shovelware,\
      \ or maybe this is a passionate project made by an overextended crew. In either\
      \ case, it's grossly overpriced (at ten USD) for how [i]fun and functional[/i]\
      \ the content is.\n\n[h1]Support the Wombat[/h1]\nIf you enjoy my reviews, please\
      \ follow my Curator page. I live and die on your thumbs (up) and follows.\n\n\
