      </h2>Stand Out is the ultimate fight for your life. You will be parachuted on
      a wide island and you will have to explore your surroundings to find weapons
      and equipment to fight for your survival. Use vehicles to move faster and keep
      an eye on the deadly barrier that shrinks the battleground during the game and
      forces the players to murder each other. Only one will remain.<br><br><br><img

      /><br> <br>We designed the game to be the ultimate VR fighting competition.
      It features a wide choice of weapons fitting all fighting styles, from blades
      to sniper rifles. The 3 maps based on real places offer epic combat situations
      in forests, plains, abandoned towns, a nuclear site and many more.<br> <br><img

      up ruins to get a clear line of sight, chase your opponents in furious gunfights
      between motorcycles and cars on steep mountain roads. You will have to do whatever
      it takes to win this merciless fight.<br> <br>Die, learn, and improve to finally
      be the last man standing.<h2 class="bb_tag">this Is Battle Royale.</h2>
