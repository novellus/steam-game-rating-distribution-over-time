Some, such as water puddles, gravel, and speed bumps will only damage your vehicle a little at a time. Others will stop you dead in your tracks. The weather changes each time you make a run, simulating different seasons.\n\nThere are 4 vehicles to choose from, but only the tractor rig is available to begin with. The others must be unlocked. There are 54 Steam Achievements.\n\nThe controls are simple. You turn with the Left and Right arrow keys on your keyboard, Since every highway is made up of straight sections only, you only have to use the arrow keys to change lanes to avoid hazards in the road or to pick up the power-ups, Nitro and Jet Engines.\n\nWorth the low price. :)","timestamp_created":1593863061,"timestamp_updated":1593934301,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60952836275100708","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49Oj4jvMCfL/bkgI="}
