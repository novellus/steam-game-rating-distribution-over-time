    review: An enjoyable shooter that offers a decent amount of content. The visuals
      are crisp and colourful and the soundtrack is great; it fits the action perfectly.  It's
      fun bunching up a load of robots around one of the explosive barrels and taking
      them all out with a well-timed shot. I can imagine the game would get a bit
      repetitive after extended play; best enjoyed in short bursts. Worth a try.
