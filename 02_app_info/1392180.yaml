      \ a set of Characters, which you find by exploring the world of Helmia, The\
      \ highest amount of Characters you can have in your party at any given time\
      \ is six.  These Characters have different races and different classes, the\
      \ race and class changes the Characters Abilities and stats. An example of a\
      \ Character is a Guard who is a Human and a Knight. <br />\r\nEvery Character\
      \ has four abilities, which you can always change with older or newer abilities\
      \ as you progress the game. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen exploring the world you\
      \ will enter so called Dangerous Zones, where you have to fight Bandits or other\
      \ Captains. You will send out three Characters to face the threat (or less if\
      \ the rest of your Characters have &quot;died&quot;), your Characters have Health,\
      \ Stamina and etc. The Health and Stamina is the most important to keep your\
      \ focus on, if the Health reaches zero then the Character will &quot;die&quot;\
      \ and you will replace them with another Character who hasn't &quot;died&quot;.\
      \ If all of your Characters have &quot;died&quot; then you have lost the fight.\
      \ <br />\r\nEvery time your Characters use an Ability they will lose Stamina\
      \ and you need Stamina to perform Abilities. Depending on the Abilities the\
      \ Character might not have enough Stamina to use any ability and then you have\
      \ two options to choose between. The first is to change your Character with\
      \ another in your party, when they are not in combat they will rest and regain\
      \ Stamina every turn. The other one is to rest your Character whilst in combat,\
      \ they will regain more Stamina but they still can be targeted by the enemies.\
      \ <br />\r\nIn combat you can also use items to regain Health, Stamina or to\
      \ increase your other stats on your Characters."
