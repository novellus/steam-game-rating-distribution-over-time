    review: 'You know, I want to like side scrolling shooters. I like randomized loot
      and narrative storytelling to pull me through the missions.


      But.


      Drifting Lands has some...problems.


      - Enemy bullets are very hard to see. They move slow (unlike enemies! Expect
      to take most of your damage from either bullet spam or fast moving ememies)
      but they''re very hard to actually SEE in around the various explosions and
      other effects (FU weather, FU).

      - Enemies can spawn behind you, no gun shoots behind you.

      - Speaking of which, 90% of the gun designs are trash. I can tolerate exactly
      three of them: Triple Gatling, Scatter Laser, and the Trident. And of those
      3 the Scatter Laser is the best. Why? Bullet spread or the lack thereof.

      - Guns fall into one of two (annoying) buckets: ZERO bullet spread or UNCONTROLLABLE
      bullet spread. Triple Gatling has a very narrow spread, but non-zero, Scatter
      Laser has the best code and seems to pick its own targets, Trident cyclically
      adjusts its spread over time (the outer two guns reciprocate up and down in
      a tolerable spread cone width).

      - Double Gatling starts narrow and spreads wider over the course of about 1
      second, then [i]pauses all firing[/i] to reset. Machine Gun resets to zero spread
      whenever you stop firing, then gets wider (to about 160(!) degrees) as you hold
      the fire button. Single Laser has no spread (its a SINGLE laser). Etc.

      - A bajillion meaningless stats. 90% of equipment is trash because it only has
      a primary attribute (the thing the slot does, eg. armor plating gives armor,
      fuel cells give energy) and then a collection of primary an secondary modifiers
      (the more the better, the rarer the more). I don''t even know what some of them
      do and don''t care because having them or not having them makes no difference.
      Is 5% slower shield recharge worth 1% more critical chance? Is 4.8% less focus
      loss reduction worth +7 shield HP? I don''t know and I don''t care. The only
      thing that matters is that the new piece should on average have more total stats
      than the old piece.

      - Three primary attributes: Structure (hp), Navigation (dps), and Power (skill
      effectiveness) exist solely to make you spend money to equip items. That''s
      it. If you actually care about a stat, its Navigation because each point is
      raw 0.35% more DPS. Everything else only matters to equip the best gear and
      buying stat deficiencies is [i]CHEAP[/i]. By the time I unlocked Difficulty
      2 I almost had enough cash to outright buy the 2nd hull upgrade, skipping the
      first.

      - Market: don''t bother, the only reason the market exists is to sell off gear
      you can''t use. Nothing you can buy here (even uncommon/blue) isn''t better
      than the trash tier common garbage you just sold them from your last mission
      (to say nothing of the rares your ship is built out of).

      - Blueprints: MEH. I wish these didn''t exist. The only part you can equip more
      than one of is armor, so why would you spend money to buy three copies of the
      same item with different attribute modifiers? Just give me the item and get
      rid of blueprints. I mean I GUESS if you''re playing on "destroy my stuff when
      I lose" mode, but honestly even then, why bother? You''re spending money for
      the privilege of spending more money...

      - Money is useless, see Market and Blueprints. That''s basically the only thing
      you can spend money on and you get so much of it (even after the game''s plot''s
      atrocious 90% tax rate). I mean I GUESS I could buy more storage space for loot
      back at the hangar...

      - Keybinds are...tolerable. Good luck figuring out what the defaults are without
      going to the settings menu. And good luck figuring out which skill slot (in
      a diagonal 2x2 grid) is which keybind (if #1 is the bottom, and #2 is on the
      right...then #3 would be the top..? Nope! Its the one on the left. They''re
      unlabled though, so have fun!) Still not sure why [Alt] acts like the "press
      A to continue" button but no other key does. Why yes I wanted to confirm that
      when alt-tabbing.

      - "Move loot from ship to storage? Yes, No, No and never ask again." Uh... what
      about "Yes and never ask again"?

      - Skill usage (ie. how does I aim skill?) No idea. Press button, things happen,
      have fun learning how to use the dash skill in the direction you actually want
      to go. Grab the aoe detonation skill as your offensive one, repair, and then
      the bubble shield because they''re always useful. Do whatever you want for the
      fourth I guess.

      - Various cutscenes that do nothing. They''re literally "ooh shiny animation"
      between short bits of dialog are unskippable. No reason. There isn''t any voice
      over or text or [b]anything[/b], they''re just 5 to 30 seconds of nothing. And
      you''re going to see the same ones over and over again.'
