A lot of it reminds me of the game series, Silent Hill, in the way it's presented - atmospheric and delightfully creepy. This has to be one of my favourite DLCs for RMVXA. If you're planning on making a horror game, this pack is a MUST for you. You won't regret this buy.","timestamp_created":1499753769,"timestamp_updated":1499753769,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gs2SmN0Ccb/Mfw=="}
