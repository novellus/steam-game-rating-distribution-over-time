The shop itself on the screenshot was never a exclusive part of this dlc. The screen was used because the upper left button with which you were able to buy ingame 7 days premium account and this dlc made a permanent premium status possible.The shop emnu itself was never a port of it. The shop menu was deleted when we deleted the complete ingame shop from the game because players didn't liked them. In the description is nothing written about a exclusive menu, only about the extras you get. if you don't like the extras which will get more when game content increases please refund it. We will exchange the screenshot and rework descriptions of the game/dlc to make it easier to understand and ebtter show the actual systems. We simply forgot to exchange this specific screenshot during postdevelopement process. Sry for the problems\nBugDuck Games Team"}],"cursor":"AoJ40uLv5vACduPJ9wE="}
