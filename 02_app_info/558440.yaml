    review: 'This game was my way of getting into the Christmas spirit and let me
      tell you, it was awesome. The game kinda reminds me of Buster Bros but with
      a twisted story and sometimes, weird game mechanics and politically incorrect
      humor.


      I''ve beaten it on Bronze and Silver modes, just beaten Level 2-2 on Gold mode.


      As per the game dev''s request in the opening cut-scene to be shown a Let''s
      Play of this game, here ya go:
