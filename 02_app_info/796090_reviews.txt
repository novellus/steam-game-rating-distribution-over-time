However, it is also very short with only a handful of hidden object scenes, some of which with questionable quality.\n\n[h1]Long version:[/h1]\nDanse Macabre 3: Deadly Deception moves its setting to the United States but otherwise it follows the theme of the series: it takes place in the early days of the 20th century and involves a murder investigation tied to the entertainment industry. In this case, our story starts at a boarding school where we deduce that the victim is not who we think she is, which eventually leads to a rather unusual culprit and motivation, at least within HOG standards.\n\nAlthough Eipix added the usual amount of extra content, the main story is woefully short. Similarly, the excellent voice acting and plot cannot fully hide the gameplay issues; there are almost no conventional puzzles and while there is a large variety in hidden object scenes, they range from effortlessly easy to annoyingly tedious.\nHowever, these are mostly comparisons to the previous entries of the series. On its own, Deadly Deception is a good HOG, it just fails to follow up an even better one.","timestamp_created":1534767573,"timestamp_updated":1534767573,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.688991129398345947","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gNXRq+UCdtDxqAE="}
