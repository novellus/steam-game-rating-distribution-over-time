    review: '"Radio Station" is a 40-minute long narrative first-person game with
      a slightly confusing story that takes place entirely without your input, it
      is told via radiocommunication messages that are all voiced in Russian. English
      subtitles are provided as well, and while the translation is a bit clumsy, they
      are clear enough to tell the story.


      This story takes place in a country torn apart by war. It is winter, and food
      is scarce. The protagonist needs medicine for his family, and an acquaintance
      promises to provide it if he fetches a box with food from a nearby barn. While
      trying to do that, the protagonist ends up in an underground chamber with a
      radio unit.


      There is almost no gameplay. At first you walk a few minutes along a linear
      path until you find the barn. A bit later you need to remove two barricades
      to get access to the radio unit. And then you listen to radio messages in Russian
      for 30 minutes, with long pauses between each message, while you don''t have
      anything to do at all. Most of the messages aren''t even related to the plot,
      they are just exposition to flesh out the setting, and they often introduce
      new characters that then don''t appear again at all. After this, exactly one
      more action becomes available, and then the game ends.


      The game does not have any puzzles, just 4 instances where you need to do very
      obvious interactions to open doors or break a barricade. There is no room to
      explore, as the entire game takes place on two extremely small maps with linear
      paths only.


      There''s little reason to talk about the graphics, as the screenshots already
      show most of what the game has to offer. Five of the six screenshots on the
      store page show the snowy scenery that you''ll encounter during your 2-minute
      walk to the barn, and the sixth shows the room that you spend 30 minutes in
      while listening to the radio. The sound effects are fitting, and the voice acting
      seems decent, though that''s hard to tell as I can''t understand their language.


      The game has no usability functions whatsoever. There is no way to rebind keys,
      no FOV slider, no y-axis inversion, and no way to save the game. Granted, for
      a 40-minute game with almost no interaction, most players can probably live
      without them.


      I can''t recommend the game, as there is barely any content and almost nothing
      to do. This is more a proof of concept, or perhaps a short audio drama, rather
      than a game. That said, what''s there is at least somewhat competently done,
      and it seems that the author would be able to produce something worth buying
      if he put more effort into it - a _lot_ more.'
