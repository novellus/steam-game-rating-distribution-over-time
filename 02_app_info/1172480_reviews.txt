However, the game's creators are lampooning the genre and challenging the common tropes. There is a sense of humor that pervades the game mechanics, story, and level design. The jazzy music and old-school sound effects are particularly noteworthy.\n\nThe gameplay is a straight-up \"collect-x-things-and-reach-the-exit\". Along the way, there is an opportunity to reach optional challenges and discover hidden areas. \"Hidden\" areas are an integral part of the required player path as well. \nWhile there are no in-game instructions (or if they exist I skipped them), the controls are taught to the player through text bubbles. I scratched my head during the first hour or so of about 4-6 levels about exactly what button does what and specifically how to enter/unlock a hidden area. The game engine feels solid and I generally feel the mistakes I made were my fault and I understood why.\n\nI would have liked to see a more genre-standard ramping up of difficulty in the level design, level complexity, and introduction of game mechanics. As I player I felt like I was immediately dropped into level 10, instead of level 1. This may turn off some players, but this lack of a \"textbook\" game design philosophy can be felt across the game and more often than not is a positive and refreshing attribute of the game. Given its relatively high difficulty, the game's mainstream appeal or kid-friendly appeal may be limited.\n\nTechnically, the game performs well on my Windows PC with a wired Nintendo Switch Pro controller. The collision detection, checkpoint progress system and enemy AI are all competently handled.","timestamp_created":1599750027,"timestamp_updated":1599750027,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ474aivPQCdcX7oAI="}
