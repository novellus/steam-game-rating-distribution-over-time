There are almost no(I am not even sure that there are solos there, didn't bring myself to play all songs completely yet) solos, if there are even any. You might rarely stumble upon something thar doesn't involve power chords but it'll be extremely basic as well.\nEvery song is in different low tuning, which is the most primitive way of achieving heaviness for songs.\nEven to play different songs in this pack you gotta retune your guitar.\n\nThere is no challenge, there is no variety, there are no guitar techniques here, and as a result there is no payoff of learning and mastering these songs. You can't train some technique or work on your guitar skills here or become a better player by playing this. \n\nIt's kinda fun only if you just want to cosplay a Skillet guitarist. If so - be my guest. Paying this amount of money for doing that if you can do this for free isn't worthy IMO.","timestamp_created":1538077473,"timestamp_updated":1601421470,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.461538463830947876","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk42K7vQCe9XGqwE="}
