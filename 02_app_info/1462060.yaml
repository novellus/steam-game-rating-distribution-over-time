    about_the_game: "There is no dentist with a long line to him, from which you really\
      \ want to get up and leave, although this is no less scary, the situation is\
      \ different. In the middle of the night, you woke up in one of the hospital\
      \ wards from a strange noise. Someone groans and groans. Something is clearly\
      \ not in order, it's time to get out of the dirty bed and take up your hidden\
      \ knife. But it seems that the knife will not be enough, so you need to see\
      \ if one of the patients was reasonable and hid something heavier than a knife\
      \ :)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe gameplay consists of a search for objects and a\
      \ battle with zombies. There are many rooms and doors in the hospital, from\
      \ which you will have to look for the corresponding keys. Opening some rooms\
      \ will help you replenish your ammunition, others will give you way to the exit\
      \ from the hospital. The game has an inventory for a limited number of items.\
      \ You only have to keep the essentials with you. In the course of the passage,\
      \ you will find more powerful weapons.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach attempt to complete\
      \ the game will be different from the previous one, as items and enemies always\
      \ appear in different places. Cold long hospital corridors and intense music\
      \ will immerse you in a frightening atmosphere."

    short_description: You have to get out of a hospital filled with zombies. In the
      course of the passage, you need to inspect all the places so as not to miss
      something important. A large arsenal from knife to flamethrower, but a limited
      amount of ammunition will make you think about their consumption.
