Pretty much anything you do will lead to a different ending. Top notch work done here, except for the fact that the ropes in you have to cut in the very beginning are just luck based. Frustrating. Please anyone comment if there's something I haven't realized.\n\nThe graphics side is a bit lacking with the main area being just a huge hollow stone cube with nothing to look at. Well positively thinking the lack of clutter makes objects of importance stand out and the game gets a cozy jam feel.\n\nAt the sale price of 0.65â‚¬ It's probably worth it. There's about an hour or so of content if you try to 100% the game.","timestamp_created":1609549860,"timestamp_updated":1609549860,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyrmp4PYCe6zJvwI="}
