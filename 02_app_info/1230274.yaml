    about_the_game: "Winding through the beautiful Alpine Inn valley, the Engadin\
      \ Linie from Rivet Games features the 57 km Swiss meter-gauge railway from Pontresina\
      \ to Scuol-Tarasp. Built as the first RhB line to be electrified with single\
      \ phase alternating current, the metric-gauge line was opened in 1913 to the\
      \ public - and is now waiting for you to discover it in Train Simulator!<br><br>RhB\
      \ started construction of the core Engadin Linie from Bever to Scuol-Tarasp\
      \ in 1903, taking nearly 10 years to finish the route, because the long tunnels\
      \ between Guarda and Scuol presented the miners with unexpected challenges.\
      \ It was the first RhB route to be electrified right from the beginning - and\
      \ also the test route for the new single-phase alternating current while the\

      \ of Upper and Lower Engadin following the Inn River. The first section comprises\
      \ the Samedan to Pontresina railway which was built as a link between the Albula\
