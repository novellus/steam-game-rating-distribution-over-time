    about_the_game: FRACT is a musical exploration game. You arrive in a forgotten
      place and explore the vast and unfamiliar landscape to discover the secrets
      of an abandoned world that was once built on sound. As you start to make sense
      of this strange new environment, you work to rebuild its machinery by solving
      puzzles and bring the world back to life by shaping sound and creating music
      within the game. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/243220/extras/lead_header.jpg?t=1606262688"
      /><br><br>FRACT features a beautiful open world to explore and decipher with
      music-based puzzles, stunning visuals, and an amazing score that evolves as
      you play. As you progress through the game, you unlock tools to make your own
      music in the FRACT studio, where you can also export and share your creations
      with others. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/243220/extras/studio_header.jpg?t=1606262688"

    reviews: "\u201CFRACT OSC is one of the best original games released on Steam\
      \ in a long time. It is abundantly clear that it has been created by a team\
      \ that shares an equal passion for both music and games, and its unique concept\
      \ and gorgeous, vibrant world deserve to be explored by as many people possible.\
      \ If you\u2019re in ownership of functioning eyes and ears, then you owe it\
      \ to yourself to play this game.\u201D<br>9/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/fract-osc\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Game Revolution</a><br><br>\u201CWhen\
      \ you succeed and the final piece of the puzzle slots into place, your reward\
      \ isn\u2019t a text backslap, achievement popup or skill point, but a drop.\
      \ Beats and bass crash in as the record you\u2019ve been piecing together reaches\
      \ a crescendo. It\u2019s like having Boards Of Canada noodling away behind you\
      \ as you work on the world\u2019s hardest jigsaw puzzle and both of you having\
      \ two very different eureka moments at the same time.\u201D<br>8/10 \u2013 <a\

      \ Twin rather than gross racism, I can't help thinking this is the sort of game\
      \ he would have come up with . . . Like all great interactive experiences, this\
      \ is a game that happens almost entirely in your own head, an ongoing internal\

    review: 'First of all, the devs forgot to program in a jump button, so I''m constantly
      getting stuck in crevices everywhere I go, making exploration cumbersome. This
      is fine in a game like The Witness, but there are so many slopes and winding
      paths that I couldn''t stand walking around not long after the tutorial.


      The world itself looks nice, and I''m sure the puzzles are cool, but I was barely
      able to find any before I gave up, so I can''t really comment on their quality.
      The game lacks any kind of coherence or player guidance in general, which other
      (similar) games have done far better.


      Despite having an interesting concept, I cannot recommend this.'
