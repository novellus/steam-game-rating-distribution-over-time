For what it is, it's actually quite impressive. This is all the work of one man, a fighting game with a Fire Pro Wrestling style creation suite, and a season mode that procedurally generates fighters. Imagine what would happen if a company picked this IP up! Unfortunately, the creator seems to have dropped off the face of the planet, so we may never see a Final Slam 3, but people need to give this game a fair shake.","timestamp_created":1590119930,"timestamp_updated":1590119930,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiZOinfICd7K3iQI="}
