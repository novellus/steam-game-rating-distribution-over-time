      /><br><br>SMIB (Space Multitask Intelligent Bot) is a small and smart robot
      created by humans for critical missions. It can be sent to planets in diverse
      environments, being remotely monitored and controlled by operators on Earth.<br><br>Its
      current mission is the most important so far: a strange syndrome is threatening
      people all over planet Earth - they are not able to smile anymore!<br><br>Scientists
      have developed a formula that can be the cure. The problem is: its components
      can only be found in distant planets.<br><br>So now SMIB will be sent to these
      planets and you, as the most senior operator, recruited back from retirement
      due to your unique familiarity with SMIB, will have to program it, defining
      its movements and actions so that it completes his tasks safely.<br><br>Carefully
      analyze each scenario and plan the route by using the limited supply of energy,
      the strategic recharge stations, and the special tools.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>In
      each new Area, SMIB will show up in a position far from the exit. The player
      will have to program it to reach the exit successfully.<br></li><li>Gameplay
      has two phases: in the planning phase, SMIB is on hold, the player analyzes
      the Area and places the commands where appropriate.<br></li><li>Programming
      is made by placing, along SMIB''s previewed path, commands like: change direction,
      jump, push an object, among others.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1300060/extras/dl-commands.gif?t=1607979497"
      /><br></li><li>Once planning is complete, the player presses the Play button,
      and the Execution phase begins: SMIB starts moving ahead until it reaches a
      command placed by the player, executes the command and goes on, until reaching
      another command, an obstacle, or (hopefully!) the exit.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1300060/extras/dl-play.gif?t=1607979497"
      /><br></li><li>But be careful: SMIB battery has a limited capacity of executing
      commands: if the number of available commands is not enough to reach the exit,
      planning has to aim to reach one of the intermediate recharge stations available
      in the scenes. Once recharged, plan the next path to finally reach the exit.<br><img
      src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1300060/extras/dl-battery.gif?t=1607979497"
      /><br></li><li>Each different planet will have a sequence of Areas, and the
      desired formula component will be found in the final Area.</li></ul><br>Help
      SMIB find the cure and bring it back to Earth!'
