    about_the_game: "NJ Transit\u2019s classic Arrow III electric-multiple-unit railcars\
      \ began rolling out of General Electric\u2019s erecting halls four decades ago\
      \ and have since become an iconic fixture of New Jersey\u2019s commuter railroading\
      \ scene, serving on many NJ Transit routes including the North Jersey Coast\
      \ Line, Morristown Line, and Northeast Corridor.<br><br>A perfect addition to\
      \ Train Simulator\u2019s North Jersey Coast &amp; Morristown Lines Route, the\
      \ venerable \u201CJersey Arrows\u201D have a design heritage dating all the\
      \ way back to the Pennsylvania Railroad\u2019s MP85-class \u201CPioneer\u201D\
      \ electrics and similar \u201CSilverliner\u201D EMUs. <br><br>Beginning in 1978,\
      \ 230 Arrow III cars were constructed by General Electric with carbodies supplied\
      \ by Avco. The order consisted of 100 two-car married sets (with cabs on one\
      \ end of each carbody and a shared pantograph) and 30 single cars with dual\
      \ cabs. In the decades since, the Arrow III EMUs have served as workhorses across\
      \ the NJ Transit electrified system, and 160 of the cars remain on the NJT roster\
      \ today \u2013 and are expected to remain in service at least through 2020.\
      \ A key reason for the longevity of the Arrow III railcars was a fleet-wide\
      \ rebuilding program undertaken in collaboration with ABB Traction in the early\
      \ 1990s that included replacement of the EMUs original DC propulsion with microprocessor-controlled\
      \ AC systems as well as addition of dynamic-braking capabilities and other upgrades.\
      \ <br><br>Train Simulator\u2019s Arrow III puts you at the controls of these\

      \ for service on the North Jersey Coast &amp; Morristown Lines Route\u2019s\
      \ Morristown Line as well as on much of the North Jersey Coast Line and the\
      \ Northeast Corridor. The Arrow III EMUs have, over their long and storied careers,\
      \ operated regularly from both New York Penn Station and historic Hoboken Terminal,\
      \ providing countless and diverse authentic operating opportunities. <br><br>The\
      \ Train Simulator Arrow III includes the two-car \u201Cmarried\u201D set configuration\

    review: Definitely a great add-on if you're a big collector of NEC rolling stock.
      The side doors and windows do open and you can get a central view (other than
      the traditional right and left side view). The major problem I want to point
      out which unfortunately led me to not recommending this is the career scenarios...
      They're just not driveable. I can't even go even 20 miles under the limit with
      no stress on the brakes/throttle without getting a driving quality reduction
      for no entire reason for the vast majority of the session. This in particular
      happens most on the legacy 'Northeast Corridor' route. It's basically impossible
      to get a perfect score (yet I don't know how other people do it and still make
      it on time to every station is beyond me). Personally I've never been fond of
      the drive quality penalty. I would propose you'd either remove/fix that feature
      to begin with, and/or fix this specific DLC since I'm having most problems with
      this one with it. Otherwise I'm keeping my review as-is. It's not fair to me
      and takes away the realism from the career scenario.
