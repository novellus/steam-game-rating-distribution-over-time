When the expansion is installed, you still might not be able to access the restricted areas, nor will you get some of the extra content bonuses (such as the Purple Dragon Knight for character creation).  In order to overcome this, do the following:\n\n1. Launch DDO through Steam library, NOT through desktop shortcut, etc.\n2. You will then be provided with a product code with the option to paste to clip board (this did not appear when I used my desktop shortcut launcher).\n3. After you login, enter the DDO Store.\n4. Enter the code in the redeem code section on top right.\n5.
