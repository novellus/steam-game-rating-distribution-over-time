    about_the_game: "<strong>A Science Fiction Visual Novel unlike anything else</strong><br>Join\
      \ Yomi Alliance Academy and become a Starship Officer in this unique role playing\
      \ Visual Novel. You are the lead character, but events won't revolve around\
      \ you as the space is a huge space and you're but an ant there.<br><br>Choose\
      \ who you want to be with each species and gender which will change gameplay\
      \ and dialogues, putting you in greater risks or shielding you from the Galactic\
      \ Community's opinion. Become who you always wanted to be in a Sci-Fi opera\
      \ and do your job to help in dangerous missions which will require skill and\
      \ preparation.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Attend Yomi Academy: a game-within-the-game\
      \ experience which will prepare your character with all the skills he/she/shem\
      \ needs to survive in the outer space!<br></li><li>A 70+ hours long Visual Novel\
      \ with RPG elements with an everchanging story based on your choices and actions!<br></li><li>An\
      \ adult plot featuring space exploration, social conflict, politics, love and\
      \ betrayal.<br></li><li>Choose a specialization from a range of 7 and a job\
      \ from over 21 different choices<br></li><li>Every different job activates different\
      \ events during missions and situations, meaning you can replay the game dozens\
      \ of times to discover something new in the story, gameplay or interactions\
      \ with other characters.<br></li><li>Choose your character's species from 4\
      \ different ones, and choose the gender as well. Introducing an hermafrodit\
      \ species in the game, people will react to you differently and even the romance\
      \ options you'll be getting will play differently. <br></li><li>Explore 4 different\
      \ romance options with each character having her own agenda and personality.\
      \ <br></li><li>Adult scenes are featured in the game with all kinds of romantic\
      \ partners. Adult scenes can be completely removed in the Settings menu.<br></li><li>Full-HD\

      \ designer Sasquatchii.<br></li><li>Interactive consoles and cinematics.<br></li><li>Monthly\
      \ story updates which will keep you stick to your screen for hours!</li></ul><br><strong>Huge\
      \ Replayability</strong><br>You can get to choose a wide variety of jobs and\
      \ specializations as follows:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Command School (choose\
      \ to become a Commander, Representative, Manager, Navigator or Hot Shot Pilot)<br></li><li>\
      \ Engineering School (choose to become a Mechanic, Specialist, Starship Designer\
      \ or System Specialist)<br></li><li> Operations School (choose to become a Basic\
      \ Operator or an Operations Manager)<br></li><li> Security School (choose to\

      \ an Astrometrics, Science, Social Surveyor or Planetary Surveyor Officer)</li></ul><br>Each\
      \ school means different stories in the game and every playthrough is different\
      \ with each career choice!<br><br>One of the first missions in the game will\
      \ be to reply to a distress call from an orbital station which was attacked\
      \ by unknown assailants. If you play as a <i>Navigator </i>you will be tasked\
      \ to navigate between the hazards of the region, or maybe escape or intercept\
      \ an hostile vessel. If you play as a <i>Security Officer </i>you might be tasked\
      \ to join a boarding party to secure the station, while if you play as a <i>Doctor\
      \ </i>you might be tasked to deal with survivors and injured people... Nothing\
      \ is the very same in Yomi Alliance!<br><br>Also, every different job will feature\
      \ its own gameplay design, as of using consoles, interfacing with the computer\
      \ or interviewing prisoners. It's all up to your choice and you can play the\
      \ game dozens of times to have a different side of the story to unfold!<br><br><strong>Deep,\
      \ Engaging Storyline</strong><br>You will be able to play a character whose\
      \ species is chosen amongst FOUR different options and three genders (one species\
      \ is a mixed gender hermafrodit as well!).<br>This choice will also affect your\
      \ story as people will react to you differently and even the romance options\
      \ you\u2019ll be getting will play differently.<br>There will be 4 different\
      \ romance options in the game and each character has its own agenda and personality\
      \ so they are all different each time you play them! The different outcomes\
      \ given by your choices are literally by the dozen!<br><br><strong>Adult Content</strong><br>You\
      \ can enable or disable adult content via the Main Menu interface.<br>Adult\
      \ content features mild violence, sexual intercourse with FULL-HD animated sex\
      \ scenes and adult themes, including dealing with racism, terrorism and prejudice."

    developer_response: Greetings. Thank you for your feedback, maybe a little too
      harsh since the game clearly states is an Alpha Early Access and the duration
      of the content is clearly stated. I am deeply sorry for your disappointment
      with the game, I hope you can enjoy it more with every update I'll publish in
      time.
