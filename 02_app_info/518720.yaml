    review: "El juego es muy arcade y divertido, sin embargo tiene fallos graves a\
      \ medida que avanzas  en las fases... cuando est\xE1s apunto de morir se te\
      \ queda la pantalla sin imagen (en el visor VR) mientras que en el monitor de\
      \ PC el juego continua, haciendo imposible volver a seleccionar alguna opci\xF3\
      n en el visor VR para continuar con la partida. Adem\xE1s, hay una fase en la\
      \ que despu\xE9s de terminar con todos los enemigos, el juego no te indica por\
      \ donde seguir y no te permite continuar... parece un juego en fase beta."
