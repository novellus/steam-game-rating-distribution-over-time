    review: "It's a good, fun game.\nA pleasant combination of a card game with match\
      \ 3. \nIf you play match 3 for exciting visuals where the screen shakes and\
      \ gems begin glowing hard when you link a huge chain, you might not get that\
      \ here.\nBut if you enjoy strategy and deck-building, this would totally be\
      \ for you.\n\nIf you enjoy MTG, Yugioh, Chess, anything like that. You might\
      \ find this very fun. \nLater you'll unlock passive abilities which let you\
      \ spend resources, which are gained from linking gems, to affect the board.\
      \ (Clear lines, etc.) But a lot of the cards can also perform this function.\n\
      \nThe dev also seems like a really nice person and is still working on the game\
      \ and has made good changes over the period I've played the game.\n\nSome may\
      \ be thinking \"10 bucks? That's a bit much for a match 3 game.\" but the card\
      \ game and RPG stuff in it make it worth 10 bucks easily, I think."
