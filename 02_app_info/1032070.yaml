    review: 'A well though out and executed game that respects the player and elicits
      feelings of adventure and discovery by providing very little information at
      the start and allowing you to work it out as you progress. This type of mature
      and intelligent game design is lacking in most modern titles from indie, all
      the way to AAA.


      The "choose your own adventure" story line was well written and the varying
      strategy required to pass each level was fantastic and kept me feeling engaged
      and rewarded as I worked out how to make it through each night.


      Overall I thought it was really well developed from start to finish and at the
      end of the day it was just great fun to play.'
