I'm definitely not trying to downplay Reaper; after all, it's the software Jean-Marc used to create the soundtrack for this game. However, you only get it free for 60 days, whereas Audacity is freeware that you can use ad infinitum. All you have to do is open up Audacity -> File -> Import - Audio, letting you load and play the stems just as easily.","timestamp_created":1507849005,"timestamp_updated":1507849005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552238762378692627","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/Lyzid8CeNqIiAE="}
