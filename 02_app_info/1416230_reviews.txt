If you came from the early days of the World of Tanks, expect it to be like an alpha release with periodic update to become a full game.\n\nCore functions are ready: tank controls, shell logic need minor corrections, few tank missions, etc. \nSome minor fixing:\n- few in-battle dialog lines not translated\n- shell vs game objects logic (e.g. how the shell behave versus wooden & stick fence, very thin tree) \n- FPS drop when there are so many tanks destroyed, optimization needed \n\nSo far, no major gameplay bug. No progression is to be save anyway.","timestamp_created":1609403238,"timestamp_updated":1609846680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwnN2V6fYCdKSFvwI="}
