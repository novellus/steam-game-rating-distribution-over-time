      notes: Given the criminal investigation nature of this detective series, strong
        subjects like homicide and sexual assault are mentioned. There is also a pixel-graphic
        depiction of crime scenes. Strong language and profanity are frequently used.
        Supernatural subjects are discussed.

    review: 'One thing this entire series suffers from (Silver Creek Falls included)
      is the dialog doesn''t feel...natural. ALL the games suffer from characters
      not talking, but just being exposition dumps. It''s not natural, and it''s very
      robotic at times. It really draws away from the intrigue of the game, which
      at its heart, is an OK military mystery sort of thing.


      That and the abrupt endings. Those are the WORST. I get you want to leave it
      on a cliffhanger, but this just annoys more than builds interest and a desire
      to see more.


      Only get on sale, if you HAVE to own it.'
