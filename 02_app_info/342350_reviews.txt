And it has no sound settings in the options! So I recommend going to the bottom right of your desktop and right-clicking on the speaker icon and click \"Open Volume mixer.\" Of course the game has to be already running to lower it.\n\nOther than that, the game is oddly beautiful for a pixel game. It doesn't even feel like one. The art direction must be that good because the atmosphere is spot on for this game. Sound design is amazing too. Gameplay is great, the puzzles aren't that hard and the controls feel good. Overall great game.\n\nI did however experience some strange motion sickness on the \"Red Plane,\" where everything is the color red. I say strange because I'm running the game at 2000fps with a 144hz monitor (v-sycn doesn't change how it feels) so I guess seeing RED on everything I see gave me a hard headache. Might be personal thing so other than that, the rest of the game is A-OK.\n\nedit: Ethan's mom is pretty hot.","timestamp_created":1609904494,"timestamp_updated":1609904554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgcDy6vYCcPrywAI="}
