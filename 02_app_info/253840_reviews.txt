While I still enjoyed the more classical pixel style of the older series, this new art style brings colors that jump off the screen, while still keeping the animation quality at the series high standards. And while the sound design does leave a bit to be desired, the music is fantastic as you would expect when Jake Kaufman is involved (Shovel Knight, Shantae series fame). This game is just a pleasure to look at, and the character design is probably the best it has ever been in the series.\n\nThe gameplay on the other hand has taken a step back. While the platforming is still enjoyable, its difficulty in combat has taken a step back from Pirate's Curse, as some of the returning transformations such as the monkey form make dodging enemies a breeze. The emphasis on movement over combat still shows off the smart level design Wayforward is known for. And the boss fights do bring it a bit more this time around, as they are better designed then in Pirate's Curse. But a lack of length in gameplay and just a overall lack of difficulty plagues the game a bit. \n\nOverall, the game still is an enjoyable romp that keeps with the Shantae style. If you've liked the previous games in the series, you'll love Half-Genie Hero. Just don't expect an evolution in the gameplay.\n\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgfpjp1KdYM\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The art work and presentation change is fantastic, as the new color and line work really bring Shantae and her dancing booty to life on the screen. \n[*] Good color choices as always: putting the foreground and the action elements with the stronger hues. \n[*] Music selection by Jake Kaufman is fantastic, appropriate for the levels in question. \n[*] Boss fights have definitely gone up a notch, as they felt like more of a test of my overall skills then previous games. Giga Mermaid fight was a prime example of a good difficulty: not too hard, but needing to take some skill in order to execute.\n[*] Good humor as always from the writers of Wayforward. Some groan worthy puns as always, but it's the good kind of humor.\n[*] Level Design great as always. Always good to go through the first time, but still fun to go through on the next few playthroughs. \n[*] Enemy variety is good. Good mix ups of melee versus range.\n[*] Good difficulty for the casual player.\n[*] Performance is flawless. 60 FPS with no drops.\n[*] Character design elements are fantastic as always. Being able to recognize Shantae in her transformations is fantastic through the specific characteristics like her headband and her eyebrows.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] The gameplay's combat has taken a step backwards. A bit easier to deal with enemies, and the enemies just don't pose the challenge they did in Pirate's Curse.\n[*] Was Hoping for more after beating the game. I know that more content with new characters is coming later, but I found myself disappointed.\n[*] Sound Design does leave a little bit to be desired, as some sounds seems to be missing, while others don't make a lot of sense in the big picture. Squeaky sounds on grabbing metal rings for example. \n[*] Shorter then the last games, and to me it showed a bit. Just didn't have the same impact over the full game's length.\n[*] The Genie sub-plot here doesn't work as well as other games plot lines. The thread connecting the various substories is missing, unlike in Pirate's Curse.\n[*] Keyboard default configuration must have been done with someone with giant hands.\n[*] Missing sound sliders.\n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.
