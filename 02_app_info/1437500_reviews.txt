Probably my favourite, i actually finished it twice.\n\nAll in all, good thing you didn't have to complete games in the collection otherwise i'd be missing 3 games with no idea what to do for 1 and bugs stopping me from beating the other 2.","timestamp_created":1609636309,"timestamp_updated":1610075190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr7b97/YCcZ31vwI="}
