The game, unfortunately, isn't.\n\nSee those cool spartan wireframe graphics? That ethos extends to all aspects of the game's design, even to things it really shouldn't extend to, like basic interface and combat feedback.\n\nFirst, set your mouse aside, you won't be needing it. This is keyboard-only. I decided to write it off as \"immersion or something\" and sort of went with it.\n\nSecond, by god, everything is so *slow.* Turning is slow. Moving is slow. Scanning objects (inspecting) is slow. Which, hey, that must be immersion, since you're in a stories-tall mech, right? Well, no. You're in a \"mecha,\" which I guess is closer to a powered exoskeleton, unless we're supposed to believe humans are busy skittering around like ants building house-sized landmines for you to step on. In other words, you're person-sized. Taller, I guess (?) stronger, and encased in armor, but person-sized. Which, to me, begs even more questions:\n\n- If I'm person-sized, why am I so slow? An unarmored person could run around me in circles and I'd never be able to catch them.\n- If I'm person-sized, why's there this weird infrared wireframe display thing? It made sense to me when I imagined a stories-tall war machine that's essentially a block of steel, but if i'm just some dude, some eye slits and a flashlight would do fine, thanks.\n- Why is there absolutely no feedback whatsoever that I'm taking damage? If I'm person-sized, there should be the sound of bullets ringing off the armor, the concussive effect of the impact not being fully absorbed, maybe my I-guess-it's-infrared display kicking static or flickering. Something beyond a sound effect of gun shots and a number in the corner going down.\n- What's the processor on this thing, a Pentium 2? It. Takes. So. Long. To. Scan. Anything. Is it rocking, like, 64mb of RAM? Because the thing can't even chart a map.\n\nAt some point it hit me. These \"aesthetic\" or \"immersive\" choices aren't intentional. They're just lazy. Why figure out mouse control? Screw that, it'll just be keyboard-only. Graphics? I'm no good at those, how about we make it look like a Virtual Boy? Combat feedback? The sound effect is enough. Automap? Would take too long to figure out, scrap it. \n\nUltimately the game's presentation feels like it never made it beyond the prototype phase. Instead they claimed it as intentional for immersion and style and pushed it out the door.\n\nThis isn't to discourage the use of a style like this. It's quite cool, really. But since that kind of minimalism *increases* the immersion, the lazy little things like no combat feedback or auto map or consistent sense of scale *really* stand out in a *really* bad way.","timestamp_created":1607459319,"timestamp_updated":1607459319,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zdWCovYCfpmhuAI="}
