It's not a bad price. It has voice acting. But there's not enough content for me to suggest someone pick up this pack, though there's also not enough of a price difference for me to tell people to not get it. The point is, you gain nothing more than what you'd expect for a $0.50 story: one scene, a short conversation, no CG, and no impact on the characters or main story. Skip it if you don't have the dolla-dollar bills to throw at it. Get it if you're the type to watch deleted scenes from movies.","timestamp_created":1593354492,"timestamp_updated":1593354492,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.609609603881835938","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhoPV/fICcceFkQI="}
