    review: "I can't recommend this game enough. It's incredibly satisfying to beat\
      \ the snot out of everything in sight, and in as flashy a manner as possible.\
      \ The game has a real charm about it, the plot reminds me a lot of Need For\
      \ Speed: Most Wanted in that it's very straightforward. You're gonna become\
      \ the best robot mech boxer, and that's all you really need to go on story-wise.\
      \ \n\nMy sole warning is that if you have a cheap mouse, it may not survive\
      \ some of these levels, since you have to click rapid-fire to punch out all\
      \ the enemies and their projectiles and it can get really intense in certain\
      \ areas"
