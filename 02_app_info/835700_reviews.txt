I’m a big fan of point and click adventures and love puzzles so this was quite different, but I still enjoyed playing it. There were lots of hidden objects to find, some find 5 of a particular type of object, spot the difference puzzle and a maze that was my favourite part of the game. Some of the hidden object scenes have items that take a while to find. There is a hint system but I didn’t use it and so it took me about 5 hours to complete. I especially liked all the additional information you could click on to learn more about the story and author. I think I clicked on every one of these options (ok I’m a nerd, but I’m willing to bet some of the information will show up on Jeopardy at some point lol).  No bugs or glitches while I played (I’m running Windows 10). I would recommend this game if you get it on sale, as a fun relaxing way to spend an afternoon.","timestamp_created":1609712512,"timestamp_updated":1609713687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nbOa5fYCf7+bwAI="}
