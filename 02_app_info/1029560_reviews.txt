Sometimes it was hard to see where I was aiming\n- Add objective markers/direction markers. Sometimes it wasn't obvious what I was supposed to do\n- For weapons that can be charged up before firing, add a \"charging bar\" or some other indicator to display how charged the weapon is\n- Possibly add more health packs\n\nPros:\n- Great performance\n- Great textures and models (general look of the game looks awesome)\n- Lots of content (levels, pilots, tanks and weapons to choose from)\n- Satisfying physics\n\nCons:\n- I die quite fast (might just be because I'm bad at games)\n- Some of the bombs have a lot of knockback which sends me flying into other bombs (this might be intentional as the level literally has \"knockback\" in the name\n\n\nBugs:\n- Rarely, the camera will be in the wrong place but only if you want to go off the main path\n- During gameplay, my cursor will not come back after failing a mission","timestamp_created":1608753122,"timestamp_updated":1608753122,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrZHKyPYCcMzIvAI="}
