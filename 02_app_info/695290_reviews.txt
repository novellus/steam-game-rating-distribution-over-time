Not a game you can just pick up and play. You gotta go practice your shots, especially putting. Very frustrating at first but once i learned the nuance of putting with a mouse, it is very rewarding, You must putt out everything, so pratice. Just like real life. Anyone complaining about putting, they havent spent time going to putting green. \nFor me, its very addicting and man, I love the announcer, sounds like an actual person reacting to your shots, along with ambient nature sounds, totally recommended!","timestamp_created":1609742950,"timestamp_updated":1609742950,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw54OK5vYCdYeowAI="}
