In the defense of the game, there are many creative and well-designed puzzles, but sometimes you are stuck for 2 hours, doing some excessive backtracking with limited visibility (assuming you can see at all). There is a section where I walked for like 20 minutes in complete darkness which should give you an idea of what kind of game it is. I completed the 'normal' difficulty around 15 hours (with no hints), and as far as I can tell the madness difficulty adds some new content. I was very close to rage quitting the game many times, but the curiosity got the better of me.  It has a lot to offer in terms of psychological mechanics and how you interact with the puzzles, arguably more complex and thought-provoking than many games in the genre. Don't expect puzzle logic, the hints will guide you maybe 25% of the time, there are many 'leap of faith' moments where you find things by accident. \n\nYou will be very disoriented in almost every location (I even got a headache a few times), but the first area essentially works like a stage select, just not in a conventional way. The game alternates between walking-simulator gameplay and difficult platforming, and as you complete the stages, more levels will be available. Also, it has a unique mechanic where you can interact with the world by closing your eyes which could have all kinds of unexpected effects. Additionally, you can make yourself smaller in order to squeeze into tiny places.  Not sure what game I can compare it to, it's not exactly like the LSD: Dream Emulator, but it falls into that category of exploring the faq out of your surroundings. To say that this game is very atmospheric would be an understatement, it's a complete mind ****** experience that genuinely made me delirious. Some of the puzzles rely on sound, although I find that I can't use it properly, not sure if I misunderstood the mechanics or if the sound levels are not balanced.\n\n[i] Props to the developer for actually coming up with some unique ideas and not just recycling what has been done in the past, I don't know how many people will appreciate that cerebral aspect of the game though. I play a lot of games in this genre that do something similar but not as good. Not sure how to describe it properly, but it feels like the game explores anxiety on a much deeper level. [/i]. \n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ pretty lengthy game (could take over 10 hours with no hints)\n+ second difficulty changes some things\n+ lots of creative puzzles that incorporate a unique mechanic \n+ very atmospheric, occasionally funny,  interesting narrative \n+ achievements & secret areas\n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\n[u] Exploration/Backtracking/Hints [/u] - I would put some particle effects around the items that you can interact with, most of them look like a prop unless you are looking directly over it. I know there are checkpoints, but if you leave the stages you have to backtrack all the way, I wish you could use checkpoints if they were already unlocked. As for the hints, I think you should add more sticky notes, hide them if you have to, some of the puzzles are way too cryptic dude - it feels like looking for a particle of sugar on the beach. I am not sure if the sound puzzles are working correctly, I never noticed any sudden changes in the soundtrack during the eye mechanic, not enough to consider it a clue anyway. \n\n[u] Puzzle Design/Stage design [/u] - the puzzle frustration was very sporadic, some of the \"easier\" stages gave me more trouble than those near the end. For example, the stage with 4 portals was pretty intuitive, you could logically beat it if you were paying attention. Then you play a platforming stage (the one with the bright fog), and you just have to 'leap of faith' in a few spots. The point being is that some stages do a good job at hinting at the solution, where other stages were too random with very useless hints. The one with the blood bath was kinda misleading in my opinion, it gave me a hint toward the last puzzle in the chain, sending me on a ghost chase. I think the game would be more enjoyable if it was a bit more intuitive...\n\nOut of the 8 regular stages, I enjoyed maybe 4 of them. The problem is that the first 3 platforming levels were relatively dull when compared to some of the psychological highlights. Now the last platforming stage had a lot going on thematically so it was significantly better, I wish you maintained that level of creativity across the game. \n\n[u] Technical Notes [/u] - every 90 minutes or so the game freezes after death, it happened about 5 times. I also had a few Unreal Engine errors upon startup crash but I forgot to copy them. I didn't have any performance issues, but it uses a substation amount of GPU like most UE games (not sure if the optional FPS cap would help). On a side note, is there a technical reason you have to use the mouse scroll to change swimming depth? Should be toward the camera.\n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 7/10 [/b] \n\nOne of the most creative games I ever played, more of an artwork than a game in a way (feels like self-expression), but it comes at the price of extreme frustration with puzzles that can be hard to digest. Don't get me wrong, I like cryptic exploration games, it was just a bit too much - I was getting headaches because I spend so much time in platforming stages with too much brightness. In the end, I am happy that I finished the game, gives you that - \"Thank God this **** is over\" feeling, in a good way (oh yeah, and then you unlock madness difficulty, nope). The game is not for everyone, still one of my favorites just because it had so many cool ideas. \n\n[code]Review By: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/ [/code]","timestamp_created":1608857470,"timestamp_updated":1609576874,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.656381845474243164","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgcCQ4fYCf9f1vAI="}
