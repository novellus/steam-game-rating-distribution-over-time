But seeing that there was remaster, I decided to pick it up and give it another shot.\n\nI'm kinda impressed at how much fun I didn't have this time. Stuttering issues, keyboard and controller input lag, clipping thru some objects but not others of the exact same tile, and some trees just *stopping* at top like they had a flying lawn mower give 'em a buzz cut.\n\nI only got 14 minutes in before I realized that somehow this \"remaster\" has somehow been *less fun* than the original. I wanted to love this game so much, but sadly... it wasn't to be.","timestamp_created":1579025570,"timestamp_updated":1579025570,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjcPQ0u8CcM/56wE="}
