    review: 'got this on sale, didn''t expect much from it. it''s actually really
      fun ????

      i''m confused

      like, the character models are a little weird, but it has a lot of awesome ideas
      and executes them in a way that is just like, fundamentally enjoyable??? i didnt
      know video games still did that'
