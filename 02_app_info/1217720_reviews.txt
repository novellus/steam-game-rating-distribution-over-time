Sometimes those are game breaking, but avoidable if you make your moves slowly. Took me 40 mins to finish every level, in which the first puzzles actually puzzled me on how simple they are and I thought more points could be made if all the blocks were cleared, and lost several minutes because of it. This is not a game for people who like challenging puzzles. This game has none.","timestamp_created":1604005189,"timestamp_updated":1604005189,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42JqKu/UCeab2qgI="}
