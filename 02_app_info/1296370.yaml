    developer_response: "We can assure you that we\u2019re working on this bug - player\
      \ controllers not appearing in-game seems to be an issue with the current version\
      \ of the SteamVR Plugin for Unity. Powering the controllers on before launching\
      \ ThinkFast may resolve the issue in the meantime."
