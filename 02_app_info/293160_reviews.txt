You can do almost anything on this game.\n\nPros:\n+ You can select human, elf, orc, werewolf, undead and other unique creatures as player.\n+ You can add skill points to many abilities. This will improve weapons accuracy or items quality.\n+ Player will explore a huge world. It includes a lot of dungeons and some offshore islands.\n+ Player can steal items from NPC. It's a good way to get more experience points at beginning.\n+ Player also can attack and kill everyone. If you have the best equipment, no one can stop you.\n+ Random weapon and equipment characteristics. They depend on your Foraging ability.\n+ If you have very high points of Persuade, then you can get more benefit or change someone's mind in a quest.\n\nCons:\n- No ending screen.\n- No happy end. All endings are very dark and sad. \n- Because there has no limit to your action, if you kill a very important NPC (i.e. the evil councilman Isoldor) before completed your main quest, then you must restart the whole game.\n\nActually, the story of Antharion is very bloody. You will find human sacrifice places everywhere. So many prisoners and innocent civilians were killed by cruel ways. Obviously, these devs created a sadly world. It has no redemption and future.","timestamp_created":1599288539,"timestamp_updated":1599288539,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4987BrvQCcJnynwI="}
