Steam, stop allowing random people to publish broken crap and then steal people's money and not offer them refunds when it so clearly was a scam in the end.","timestamp_created":1594523760,"timestamp_updated":1594523760,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2LbBoPMCeejalAI="}
