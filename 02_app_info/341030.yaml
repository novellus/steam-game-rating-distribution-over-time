      \ so, you must capture regions over the world, and defeat your enemies in battle.\
      \  <br><br>The world has about 130 regions open to conquest. The regions have\
      \ variable income and VP values (set randomly in the Standard scenario) and\
      \ unknown until conquered or spied upon. Each region not owned by a Major Power\
      \ usually has an independent Minor country owning and defending it. <br><br>Each\
      \ Major country is controlled by a human player or the computer, or is designated\
      \ neutral and then acts as a Minor country.<br>Hotseat play is possible, with\
      \ an option to limit to 4.00 minutes the playing time per player. <br>Each game\
      \ turn represents roughly one season. <br>Game lasts till victory conditions\
      \ are achieved.<br><br>Scenarios: game offers 3 scenarios: one starting in the\
      \ year 1880 with an historical setting, one in 1914 with historical positions,\
      \ and an open ca-1870 standard where nation only own their starting home territories\
      \ (free-for-all non-historical) <br><br>The game has 3 main phases, each player\
      \ entering them in sequence, i.e. Build Phase (Spring only, with: Army &amp;\
      \ Navy Construction, Fortification, Economic Aid, Espionage, Subversion),  Movement\
      \ Phase (Army &amp; Navy),  and Combat Phase.<br><br>Gameplay of each phase\
      \ is rather simple and straightforward, as follows:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"\
      ><li>Army and Navy Build Phase (Spring):  Create new armies and fleets in your\
      \ Supply Centers<br></li><li>Fortification Phase (Spring): Fortify army units\
      \ (except in Supply Centers which are already fortified). <br></li><li>Economic\
      \ Aid Phase (Spring): Lend money to other Major countries; which is added to\
      \ their Treasury. Or Lend money to neutral Minor countries; which they use immediately\
      \ to build armies.<br></li><li>Espionage Phase (Spring): Learn the approximate\
      \ (not always accurate) army strength and the income of a Minor country or of\
      \ an region controlled by a Major country. And the region\u2019s VP value <br></li><li>Subversion\
      \ Phase (Spring): Spend money to bribe a Minor country's army, weakening the\
      \ country's defense or causing a coup (giving you control of the said country\
      \ in return).<br></li><li>Movement Phase (All turns): Move armies to adjacent\
      \ regions only. Move navies alone or with armies from one port to another (or\
      \ carry regiments to amphibious landings on enemy holdings). <br></li><li>Combat\
      \ Phase (All turns): up to twenty rounds of battle; each consists of naval (if\
