Aimed towards kids and young ones, this platformer makes you help a cute little dino traverse the good looking and well designed levels. With the levels getting more challenging as you progress, Cork The Volcano makes you think and use the skills you just learned to move towards the end game. Aimed towards kids, but recommended for all ages who love a fun and fairly challenging platformer with a cute story.","timestamp_created":1604613257,"timestamp_updated":1604613257,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48uaZzfUCeITHrAI="}
