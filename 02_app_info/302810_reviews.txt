It's not the best game out there but it's worth it on sale just for the sheer interestingness of the fact it's a 2011 source zelda game that is expected to fully release in december 2020. This isn't just some indie revival project for source or something either, i remember seeing this game WAY WAY back and i'm glad i finally got a hold of it.

So yes we are of course inspired by Zelda but we wanted not to make a clone but rather create a unique mix for a unique experience using our favourite engine \"source\". And making such a game in source is really really difficult haha yes. Thanks for following us all the way. <333"}],"cursor":"AoJw+fqOxPMCcNnGlwI="}
