In a bizarre turn of events, a plot is attached to the game.  A pirate, through the shenanigans of treasure-seeking, is trapped by a curse.  The only way to free him is, you guessed it, winning money through the game.  After a certain amount is collected, he'll be freed from his supernatural bonds.  In fact, every now and then the pirate will attempt to help secure his freedom by sneaking a pirate-themed question into the game.  These questions are in the vein of the Impossible Questions of Volume 3, but centered around pirate knowledge (for example, one question asks for the name of Blackbeard's parrot).  Beyond that, everything else is standard fare.  Like The Ride and Headrush, there's no option to select how many questions the game will have and the comedy is stellar as always.  The Lost Gold is certainly worth all of your doubloons and is great to share with friends over a bottle of rum.","timestamp_created":1483213587,"timestamp_updated":1608922782,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47999998927116394","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk6vRzfYCesaVbg=="}
