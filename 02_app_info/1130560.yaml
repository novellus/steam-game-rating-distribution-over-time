    review: 'This is more of a neutral review that leans slightly into the negative
      due to lack of polish, effort and bugs nearly a year after launch..


      https://youtu.be/CqRo2c0TN3c


      At 14.99 RPG NPC Simulator isn''t very expensive. It''s also not that cheap
      either. The game lacks a lot of polish and doesn''t feel like a lot of effort
      went into the game. There are some good ideas but overall the execution is pretty
      poor.


      The audio is all over the place. I''m sure the customer noises are for your
      information but hearing them across the map breaks immersion and just doesn''t
      feel right. The noises themselves were kinda meh. All around just meh.


      Visually the game was also sort of meh. Scale on the Players? NPCs? Patrons?
      People buying your sh*t... They were way too short. They were all about 5ish
      feet tall and all the same height. Just one of those little things that''s really
      insignificant but glaringly immersion breaking. Like a tiny paper cut on your
      finger while you try to type. It''s the tiniest of wounds but always at the
      forefront of your mind whenever you touch a key.


      The UI was pretty bad IMO. The laser pointer selector kept going away whenever
      you touched the stick. You''d have to attempt to scroll with the stick again
      to get it to come back. Where you needed to look to interact with the UI vs
      where the response information was presented were at opposite ends of the menu.
      Just poorly designed. Having recopies show up before purchasable items when
      you can''t craft anything for quite some time seems poorly implemented. There
      just wasn''t much I liked about the UI.


      I did like the mechanics I saw though. Wandering around and scavenging for loot
      from dead adventurers and just designing and running the shop in general. A
      lot of good ideas, just very low effort implementation. I would have liked to
      see some other adventuring mechanics and I would have liked to try crafting
      but that appears to be a mid to late game mechanic.


      Which brings me to your goal, or lack there of. With the flat games like this,
      you have a story or a MP goal of building up a town. There''s a purpose for
      getting all that money aside from just hitting achievement goals. There was
      no purpose here. No feeling of progression. The leveling system had no meaning
      other than to ding every once in a while. I didn''t see any new unlocks or mechanics.
      So... What is my overall goal? I didn''t see one.


      This is overall a mostly neutral and meh review but I think it leans more negative
      than positive. Which is pretty disappointing because I expected I would like
      this game and was going for a win after MoH. Oh well... Maybe next time...'
