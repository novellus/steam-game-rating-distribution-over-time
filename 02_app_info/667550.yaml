    review: "I like the game, but this is obviously a product of someone who doesn't\
      \ have a huge pool of experience. \n\nThe game is fun, weapons are awesome and\
      \ the controls are sluggish but fitting. Once you play for a bit you understand\
      \ why different turn speeds and such are important. Basically, the foundation\
      \ and combat for the game is great.\n\nHOWEVER, and this is why I would NOT\
      \ recommend the game as it is, it was not utilized well. First off, there is\
      \ no tutorial. If anybody can tell me what the hell DATA is, feel free to inform.\
      \ Upgrades seem to reset every level for some reason, and when you reach your\
      \ third level, MASSIVE difficulty spike. Basically goes from a regular shooter\
      \ with a few bosses per level to full boss rush within one level transition.\
      \ Flashbangs, trap black holes, and tracker missiles (which have icons on them,\
      \ implying you can either dodge or neutralize these missiles but you would be\
      \ mistaken) are suddenly bombarding you constantly. Get to level three and if\
      \ you're really unlucky, you'll have died before the screen finally faded off\
      \ of white. Or you'll get trapped in three black holes and get blasted to hell\
      \ with tracker missiles. The levels are also really constricted. May be by design\
      \ but I personally don't like it.\n\nOverall, I think this game would benefit\
      \ heavily from outsourced play testing BEFORE updates rolled out, even though\
      \ I think this game is entirely finished and won't be updated further. Either\
      \ way, as of now I think you have better options out there. Keep looking."
