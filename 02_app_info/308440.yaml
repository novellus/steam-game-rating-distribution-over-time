    review: "Shopworn Match 3 mechanics receive a new lease on life in [i]Pushcat[/i],\
      \ a cheery [i]Boulder Dash[/i] derivative brimming with attractive pixel art\
      \ and goofy dialogue.  Players assist the indomitable title character as he\
      \ travels through various worlds in search of gems which yield smiling silver\
      \ coins.  When three or more gems of the same colour are matched horizontally\
      \ or vertically they transform into the coins, much to the delight of the covetous\
      \ cat.  After a set number of coins are collected, Pushcat can escape through\
      \ the catflap and proceed to the next area.  Although Pushcat can become trapped\
      \ or reduced to ashes by exploding Aztec Death-heads and have no choice but\
      \ to restart the level, he never needs to worry about being crushed from above\
      \ by falling blocks; this element makes the gameplay far less tedious than that\
      \ of many [i]Boulder Dash[/i] imitators.  Most levels require some degree of\
      \ planning, but every once in a while there are more freeform, endurance-focused\
      \ trials where Pushcat simply needs to stay alive while pocketing a larger number\
      \ of coins.\n\n[i]Pushcat[/i] boasts numerous chiptune renditions of notable\
      \ ragtime and classical pieces (The list of featured works is conveniently located\
      \ in the credits scroll).  The soundtrack eschews Scott Joplin tunes in favour\
      \ of slightly lesser-known pieces from the ragtime repertoire, and they're all\
      \ quite perky.  The intense Baba Yaga segment from Mussorgsky's [i]Pictures\
      \ at an Exhibition[/i] is effectively employed in the levels where Pushcat encounters\
      \ the cumbersome but dangerous ghost who seeks to put an end to his silver hunting,\
      \ and there's a vivacious arrangement of Chopin's [i]\xC9tude Op. 25 No. 1[/i]\
      \ as well.\n\n[i]Boulder Dash[/i] fans will appreciate this nicely presented,\
      \ moderately challenging puzzle adventure."
