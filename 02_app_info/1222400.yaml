    review: 'I liked this one overall. It has some problems, but all together it was
      a good experience. I enjoyed the romance and I get the impression that it''s
      probably the selling point for the game. I liked the companion characters, and
      I wish there was more meaningful interaction outside of their routes. I also
      liked that even in the individual routes there was a lot of ways to romance
      the characters.


      This definitely felt like the first in a series and ill pick up the sequel when
      it comes out. I hope that whatever comes next irons out he issues. I wont go
      to much into the issues because theres already a bunch of reviews and I think
      this game deserves a little extra positivity.'
