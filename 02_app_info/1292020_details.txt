{"1292020":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Armoured Commander II","steam_appid":1292020,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"In Armoured Commander II, you play the role of a tank commander in World War II, leading your crew through a campaign in one of the major conflicts of the war. ArmCom2 features over a dozen campaigns set between 1939 and 1945, and over three hundred vehicle, gun, and infantry unit types. The terrain map for each combat day and the types of enemies you encounter are randomly and procedurally generated, which means that each playthrough of a campaign will bring new and unexpected challenges. Your commander and crew gain experience and can improve their stats and gain skills over time, but they are also vulnerable to injury and may be seriously wounded or killed during the course of a campaign.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Visual Style and Gameplay<\/h2><br>The visual style of the game follows the roguelike approach of using a character set rather than bitmap graphics. All in-game displays are rendered using a modified and expanded Petscii character set, as used in the Commodore 64. This keeps the focus on the gameplay rather than on graphic effects. Sound effects are also generated using samples from the C64's SID sound chip.<br><br>The gameplay is turn-based, so you can pause and consider your options at any point in the game. You can also save and continue your game at any point, and can have one saved game per campaign type. You can choose to take on the role of your Commander, meaning that if your Commander is killed in the game your campaign ends (Permadeath), or you can continue playing through an entire campaign, replacing your tank and crew as needed.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Early Access<\/h2><br>Armoured Commander II is currently a playable game, but I do want to continue to refine and expand the game further. I have continued to develop the game since its Early Access release, adding new campaigns, nations, and so on. All future additions to the game will be free to anyone who has purchased the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Roadmap for the Future<\/h2><br>Moving forward, I plan on adding campaigns covering all the major theatres of the war, including appropriate historical unit types, and new game mechanics for them where appropriate. After the game leaves Early Access, I'd also like to expand the range of campaigns beyond this, to include the Pacific and South-east Asian theatres, and perhaps one day, earlier time periods like the Spanish Civil War, and later ones such as the Korean War.","about_the_game":"In Armoured Commander II, you play the role of a tank commander in World War II, leading your crew through a campaign in one of the major conflicts of the war.

Despite being attributable to wargames and in particular to simulations, Armored Commander II is a practically unique product of its kind. Another gem of a landscape full of stars like the indie one, the title proposed by Gregory Adam Scott is difficult, varied and long-lived. A new indie pearl, in a nutshell.
