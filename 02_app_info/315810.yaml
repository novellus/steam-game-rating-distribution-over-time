    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag"><i>The final love story on a dying planet.</i></h2><br>In
      the near future, an ominous red star suddenly appears in the sky. Its presence
      is about to bring about the extinction of all life on Earth. The unified government
      proposes an evacuation project to take all of mankind into space, but in order
      to make the seemingly impossible project a reality, 'felixes' are brought into
      the world. Engineered to be highly intelligent with perpetual youth and longevity,
      the genetically modified superhuman felixes stand as humanity's only hope for
      survival. <br><br>Sion, the most gifted of the felixes, has been kept in a research
      facility built on a solitary island for the past hundred years. Her sole purpose,
      saving all of humanity. Ryou Haruna, a soldier from the Earth's unified government
      is sent to watch over Sion, who desperately seeks freedom from the military
      that's imprisoning her. Earth's last love story is about to begin.<br><br>----<br><br>A
      tale of the planet's final love story told using the full force of minori's
      critically acclaimed illustrative style, engaging musical compositions, and
      the highly talented staff that has led fans coming back for more every single
      time!<br><br>Eden tosses aside the traditional sprite and talking heads conventions
      used by many visual novels and instead employs a far more cinematic approach
      consisting of almost all event illustrations. Told using a widescreen resolution
      of 1024 x 640, eden promises a play-experience more akin to enjoying a movie
      than reading a book. We hope that this new approach to the visual novel medium
      provides a much more enjoyable experience for everyone.
