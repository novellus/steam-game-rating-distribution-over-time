The acting is well done and make for a believable experience.\nThe story focuses on the moments of despair and pyschologoical horror of WWI while also offering a brief glimpse of humanity that occasionaly took place on the battlefield.\n\nCurrently a steal while on sale.","timestamp_created":1509459554,"timestamp_updated":1509459554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7Z2zud8Cf/b7iQE="}
