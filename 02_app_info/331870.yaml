    review: "Let's get this out of the way first, if you played and enjoyed World's\
      \ Adrift, buy this game. \n\nThe flight is pretty good, the world is beautiful,\
      \ the music is nice, and it doesn't overstay it's welcome. It took me just over\
      \ three hours to play through the game, with an extra two and a half afterwards\
      \ to find all the cool stuff and get the dialogue and achievements I missed.\
      \ If you do play this game then make sure to check in with the NPCs in the Settlement\
      \ regularly so you don't miss anything like I did.\n\nI only really have two\
      \ issues with the game. First, there's never much indication that you should\
      \ head back to the Settlement between puzzles, nor is there any way to go back\
      \ to the things you missed there once you've completed all the temples. You\
      \ also can't get a lot of the hints twice, meaning if you missed them the first\
      \ time around then tough luck. Secondly, There's no way to explore after you've\
      \ beat the game. This one's pretty minor but it would've been nice to be able\
      \ to find the things you missed without making a new save.\n\nOverall, a solid\
      \ 8/10 experience. It's not very long, so eighteen dollars may be a bit pricy\
      \ for some. If you see it on sale then definitely pick it up."
