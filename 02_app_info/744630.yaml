      \ The environment is gorgeous. In this huge maze, player would see many extinct\
      \ animals and learn some skills from stone age. in china Ming Great Wall, shooting\
      \ is not easy, I tried many times to go through it. The stories (find by yourself...LOL)\
      \ in maze is really worth exploring and watching, \nI would definitely give\
      \ it 5 stars recommand. \nIf I have plan to China, I might put Shudonggou in\
      \ my tripList...HAHAHA"
