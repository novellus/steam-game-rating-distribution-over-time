This is that, the game. It's a UE3 arena shooter and feels like it stepped out of my teenage years. It's good.\n\nThis blast-from-the-very-near-past has a focus on large maps with high-speed chases, low-to-the-ground flying, and a compelling mix of cat and mouse gameplay as your health is also your ammo, which does not regenerate while using your jetpack (and sitting still is usually a death sentence). Flying high in the air is death. Sitting still is death. Shooting all your bullets is death. Go snort a line of caffeine and / or stimulants, grab a rifle, and get ready to fly! You're gonna need it.\n\nTake a fighter jet, wrap it around a person, give it way more guns than should be possible, and congratulations, you have an exosuit. The game really nails this feeling, and has a very high skill ceiling if you can get past the initial cliff. The (current) community is small, but active. There are efforts to organize matches three times a week on the discord.\n\nit feels like some kind of mixture of ace-combat, armored core 4a, starwars pod racing, and tribes. These are all very good things.","timestamp_created":1603230695,"timestamp_updated":1605647176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503611326217651367","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwlPKB7PUCeYWRqQI="}
