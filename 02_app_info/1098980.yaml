    about_the_game: Control George, the hapless inhabitant of a sleepy English countryside
      village, as he gets turned into an undead nightmare, by his own best friend
      in their final throws at life, before they die; as George goes about  town,
      his diet changes from jam sandwiches and quavers, to human guts and brains.<br><br>You
      will control George and his ever growing undead horde, depending on how good
      you are, via a 3D tabletop view of his village. Walk around the landscape, get
      down low and look down into the streets, place down  target flags to let George
      know where you want him to wreak havoc.<br><br>You have the power to decide
      which villagers turn and fight for the army of the undead, as long as, you have
      enough undead to bust through the police barricade  and escape town into the
      rest of the world in search of more victims.<br><br>There are four difficulty
      levels, each level will determine how many of the living you will need to turn
      into the undead, to escape the village and progress the apocalypse.<br><br><u>Music

    review: "This is essentially a demo for a larger game at the moment. \"ZomB\"\
      \ is a light strategy game where you loosely control a main zombie followed\
      \ by the zombies they turn. Humans just sort of, stand around until a zombie\
      \ kills them. The game looks good, but suffers from having zero content. The\
      \ three levels are easy to play, but there's not much to do but run from enemy\
      \ to enemy while your zombies pounce on anybody that gets close. \n\nAs far\
      \ as I can tell, the Dev has abandoned the game. No updates, no steam community\
      \ presence, nothing."
