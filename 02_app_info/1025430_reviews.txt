I was visually attracted to the art style for a top down shooter and thought this was a game I could get my friends into after giving it a quick play through.\n\nArt, Lighting & Rendering 5/5\nLoved the appeal of the modeling, colors and textures.\n\nAnimation & FX 5/5\n\nMusic & Sound 5/5\nI loved all the sounds the guns made, when they hit their targets or the environment nearby. I don't know why but I enjoyed shooting the lamp post just to hear that ping sound. Voice overs took me back to the arcade days. \n\nGameplay & Controls 3/5\nThis is where I feel the the game could improve for a solid top down shooter (I played with a keyboard and mouse).\nI felt the speed of the game to be a bit slow. Most top down shooters have faster paced movements. It took me forever to get around the map looking for the coins as part of the first side mission.\n\nControls are limited, LMB to shoot, RMB for a grenade, R to reload and Spacebar to roll. I enjoyed the simplicity but everything felt slow.\n\nMenus 2/5\nMenus where hard to navigate and seemed rather oddly keyed compared to most games. When I did click on a Menu button it didn't always work, especially when I died and wanted to restart the 1st Mission. This is where the game loses points. Upon restarting the first mission, I SPAWNED out of bounds! I had to quit the game entirely to replay the 1st Level.\n\nThis game seems rather polished at first glance but there are some tweaks to make the game smoother, more enjoyable and playable after running out of respawns. I would recommend this game but these issues are critical to a fun and successful game. If there is an update and the menus / respawn is fixed so I can continue playing, I would recommend it but for now, it is what it is.","timestamp_created":1587136599,"timestamp_updated":1587136599,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.58995819091796875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vdKtxPECdci/gQI="}
