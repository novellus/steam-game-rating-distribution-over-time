    review: 'The other cheat/extras DLC for Estellium Legends, this one gives you
      the catboy protagonist of Falnarion Tactics II, Tolem Felstein.


      Unlike Ether, though, Tolem is a mediocre class, and the most notable thing
      about him is that you can steal his unique sword - which is way better here
      than it is in his own game! - and give it to another sword-wielder if you want.
      Unfortunately, sword-wielders aren''t good in Estellium Legends, so that''s
      also pretty much a wash. This one comes with three "win any fight instantly"
      buttons, but you really shouldn''t need five of them. I didn''t really see the
      need for any, myself.


      As an upside, the ero-pictures are much better-drawn than they were in the first
      Boom Pow Pack, but spending $4 on two lewd pictures and a naked character profile
      doesn''t seem like a great idea to me, I didn''t use the Doom Blasters, and
      the catboy is neither useful nor that unique. Can''t recommend this one.'
