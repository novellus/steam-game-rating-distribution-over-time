All the DLC contents can be accessed from the game folder. For additional information about the contents, read the description above on the store page.\n\nArtbook is pretty good for artists, obviously! But the soundtrack alone is well worth the purchase because Rochard has one of the best music in my opinion. Please support the developers, composers, and artists for their hard work! [i]Rochard 2[/i] is the thing, so let's make it happen sooner. If you can't afford to buy, you might as well wait for it to go on sale.","timestamp_created":1434078664,"timestamp_updated":1434488678,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.704906344413757324","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw54SM/80Cd9OgPg=="}
