    review: 'It is not a very good game, true. Reviewers are right.


      But, if you already own and have played "Men of War" & alike, this game is worth
      giving it a try. The historical setting (Soviet Aghanistan war) and the original
      9th Company Russian war movie clips keep you engaged and motivated.


      Runs well on Win 10 (1440p@144Hz) and game engine is good. Controls are manageable
      for RTS veterans.'
