    review: "I already reviewed Episode 1 in the Steam page of that episode, so here,\
      \ I am going to talk only about episode 2. [list][/list] But before I get into\
      \ it, I want to mention once again some key factors that will be present throughout\
      \ the whole game, that concern graphics and soundtrack! For a 2018 game the\
      \ graphics are pretty OK, I can notice a glimpse of a very peculiar art style,\
      \ given a caricaturist look to the characters and highlighting a lot of facial\
      \ traces and details. In regard to the soundtrack, it is quite immersive and\
      \ it fits like a glove in the game and contributes to this atmosphere of mystery,\
      \ suspense and occultism.[list][/list] But let's get back to the episode! And\
      \ so far so good, like the last one, the Episode 2 did not disappoint. [list][/list]\
      \ I get the feeling that the second episode is a bit smaller, but the puzzles\
      \ available are much more challenging. The game is getting far more darker,\
      \ and honestly I do not know what to expect anymore.[list][/list] Like I did\
      \ on episode 1, I replayed this one twice on different save files. The plan\
      \ is to understand the different outcomes that I can get, and even save resources\
      \ for the really important choices.[list][/list] My only complaint is that episode\
      \ 2 not only seems shorter but also more repetitive. I am saying that because\
      \ on Episode 1 the exploration was incredibly fun, everything was new, and on\
      \ this one you keep running the corridor from room to room at some point. Yes\
      \ you get access to amazing new areas, but they don't seem enough. [list][/list]\
      \ To get an idea, you cannot even access your own room (where I have a lot of\
      \ resources that I couldn\u2019t grab before) and honestly, where the hell is\
      \ the toilet on this mansion? I know that we are at the ending of the XVIII\
      \ century but there were already toilets back there. Maybe Richet's mother is\
      \ hiding there all along\u2026[list][/list] But so far so good, a really nice\
      \ second episode that I quite enjoyed! Fully recommend it! (Don't forget to\
      \ check my review of the other episodes on the Steam page of each one of them)."
