    review: "[conclusion, copied up here for TL;DR purposes]\n\u201CIn conclusion,\
      \ the creator of this game has undertaken an incredible task. Creating an alternate\
      \ reality home to truly sentient beings, and simultaneously holding a mirror\
      \ to society and saying \u201CLook! Look, we are no different! You are no more\
      \ real than what I have created here!\u201D\n\nNeedless to say, I will be purchasing\
      \ the rest of the collection, however I will be waiting until they are no longer\
      \ on sale, so I can ensure \u201CWilliam at Oxford\u201D gets every penny of\
      \ the \xA3883.99 of all of his games at full price.\u201D\n\n[Review]\nEveryone\
      \ must play this before they die. Is it a game? I don't know. Is it a demo?\
      \ I don't know. Is it someone's first unity project, with asset store assets\
      \ and unexplainable design choices, which in some stroke of genius ended up\
      \ for sale on steam? I don't know. Is it an absurdist art piece? I don't know.\n\
      \nIs it an experience? Of this I am certain.\n\nEverything about this game is\
      \ genius:\nThe decision to include authentic roman pagodas, geisha, anime children,\
      \ bamboo forests and cherry blossom trees in the fishing and hunting minigame\
      \ that is included for reasons known only to the genius creator, and god herself.\
      \ \nThe japane- I mean roman village that has an unexplainably high level of\
      \ work put into it, then hidden inside a forest in said minigames.\nThe flat\
      \ skeletons in the european style crypt level. \nThe floating stone walkways\
      \ around the palace level. \nThe dramatic menu music that continues to play\
      \ when you load up a level, giving every scene, including \"snake fight\" (which\
      \ I will get to later) giving everything an air of urgency and dramatic tension.\n\
      The empty colosseum with missing grass textures, allowing you to reflect on\
      \ the emptiness inherent in the human condition.\nThe gradual decrease in detail\
      \ from the first level (which has a surprisingly high texture and asset quality\
      \ - it is clear that this first level is where the big budget for unity market\
      \ place assets went.) to the rectangular candles and boxy corridors of the later\
      \ levels, bringing on a gradual creeping awareness of the fact that even while\
      \ in the real world, we fool ourselves into believing things are more real than\
      \ they actually are.\n\nBut all of this pales in comparison to the highlight\
      \ of the entire game; the minigames - nay - megagames.\n\nYes, in the main menu,\
      \ for this game about travelling in the roman empire, there are several minigames\
      \ packaged with the scenes you can explore. I have briefly mentioned them in\
      \ this review, VR Snake football/VR snake fight of course, as well as VR Fishing\
      \ and \"VR Wild shooting\" (big thanks to the developer for including \"VR\"\
      \ in every one of these names, I needed the reminder that I was in fact playing\
      \ in VR, and not real life! important safety features are included in this game\
      \ too!)\n\nSnake football is so influential that the creators saw fit to feature\
      \ it not once, but twice in the main menu, with buttons much larger than even\
      \ the \"roman scenes\" that the game is marketed with. \n\n\nSnake football\
      \ is a grand undertaking, blending both football, the arcade game snake, MC-Escher\
      \ style architectural rules, light hearted cartoonish graphics, and philosophical\
      \ deconstruction of our society. I won't go into this any deeper, since it should\
      \ be obvious to anyone who plays, and I don't want to spoil the big twist at\
      \ the end.\n\nThis level is so important in fact that it has been included twice.\
      \ Once under the name \"Snake football\" and again under \"Snake Fight\". Make\
      \ no mistake, these are in fact the same game, however the decision to include\
      \ two buttons to the same game allows the user to understand its importance.\n\
      \nThe next section is really important, and is where the biggest philosophical\
      \ questions lie, so please, read this until the end.\n\nWhen you first open\
      \ \"VR fishing\" or \"VR wild shooting\" you are first greeted with a cheerful\
      \ anime girl style \"hee hee\" laugh/gasp, as you are transported to the previously\
      \ mentioned field near a japane... roman, roman village where you can hunt a\
      \ variety of fish, deer, birds, rabbits etc. using one of two different tools,\
      \ depending on which button you chose to press in the main menu. \"fishing\"\
      \ gives you a trident to spear your quarry, loudly celebrating your victory\
      \ with a jingle and then in a bold choice, exploding the fish you have caught.\n\
      \nIn \"Wild shooting\" you are given a bow. You can spawn unlimited arrows to\
      \ throw at the floor, or to load into your bow and fire. When you successfully\
      \ hit an animal, (some challenge even at point blank range, it is a relief that\
      \ the animals do not flee from you) You are shown the harmful consequences of\
      \ your actions, when deer emit a \"cry\" emoji above their heads, to show how\
      \ your actions can affect the emotions of those around you, showing how a lack\
      \ of empathy can cause harm.\n\nWhen you hit a smaller animal, such as a rabbit,\
      \ chicken or goose, their fate is even worse. They fall over and emit a skull\
      \ emoji, which appears to signify death. I am a little fuzzy here on what the\
      \ intent of the creator was here, it was a little high-brow for me. I think\
      \ it has something to do with either the death of the author, ego-death (or\
      \ the complete loss of a sense of self) - something that can either be seen\
      \ as a positive thing, to be desired and attained by meditation and reflection\
      \ on \n the universe itself, rather than one's place in it,  or alternatively\
      \ an unhealthy mental state that can result from distancing oneself from one's\
      \ own identity after experiencing trauma. Either way, a profound and meaningful\
      \ choice that I myself am unable to fully grasp.\n\nHidden in the bushes is\
      \ a village with fully animated people, going about their daily lives, occasionally\
      \ freezing in place, blissfully unaware of their existence within an artificial\
      \ construct. The reader of this review may jump to the conclusion that I initially\
      \ did, that the author is trying to say that we ourselves are like these pseudo-japenese,\
      \ roman villagers, trapped between two identities, which are both equally meaningless\
      \ as both have been set up for the entertainment of some \"higher beings\",\
      \ however upon thinking, I have realised that this is not the case at all. \n\
      \nThis village was hidden away from the player. It is clearly not meant to be\
      \ found, and yet a lot of work has been put into making this one of the most\
      \ detailed areas of this game. (I imagine this is even where the majority of\
      \ the HDD space is used for this game) It seems that so much care is put into\
      \ this area that so few will experience... until one realises that we- the players,\
      \ are not the intended audience. \n\nIndeed this section is designed not for\
      \ us- but for the inhabitants of the village itself. The creator, much like\
      \ our own creator, has built a space for them to explore and live in. Unaware\
      \ of the \"outside\" reality, and yet they have everything they need in their\
      \ little world. \"William at Oxford\" has accomplished something that no human\
      \ has ever done before -  They have created a true, living breathing universe\
      \ inside of a computer simulation, with sentient beings, much like ourselves.\
      \ Not for our entertainment, but as a gift to the created themselves.\n\nIn\
      \ conclusion, the creator of this game has undertaken a truly incredible task.\
      \ Creating an alternate reality with true sentient beings, and simultaneously\
      \ holding a mirror to society and saying \u201CLook! Look, we are no different!\
      \ You are no more real than what I have created here!\u201D \n\nNeedless to\
      \ say, I will be purchasing the rest of the collection, however I will be waiting\
      \ until they are no longer on sale, so I can ensure \u201CWilliam at Oxford\u201D\
      \ gets every penny of the \xA3883.99 of all of his games at full price."
