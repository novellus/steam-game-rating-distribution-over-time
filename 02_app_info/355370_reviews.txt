It has good characterization and it's thought provoking. I was actually going to favorite this, but I changed my mind. \n\nWhere my issue lies and what ultimately is causing me to rage quit and never even want to look at this again is in the ending.  If you fail, not only do you have to restart the difficult endgame puzzles but you have to go all the way back to the day before that and redo the last boulder cave puzzle before you can retrigger the climax.  Hours of time just freaking lost with nothing to show for it. \n\n\nThey also throw some bizarre mirror light puzzle at you in the endgame that the game no prior experience with and no explanation.  it appeared that I was supposed to use them to reflect on the switch, but I could move some of them, couldn't move others, couldn't figure out how to flip the mirrors and had only ten minutes. Since I still don't know what to do, I have no idea how to go about solving it, even if I replayed through the five puzzles that i would have to redo to get back to that point. \n\nI couldn't figure it out and I no longer want to.\n\nI already redid the boulder puzzle once. I genuinely wanted to get to the ending (If you look at my time, I've logged about 40 hours on this)  but it's become too tedious. I did originally give this a not recommended, but after I cooled down a little, I changed it to recommended. With reservations.  \n\nThis game had a lot of care put into it and it was overall a positive experience. But it needs a better checkpoint system or manual saves, or just a way of lowering the difficulty. (however cheating this may seem.)\n\nOther annoyances: The character moves as slow as molasses at times and the game crashes on you if you try to interact with the boulders from the ground after you move them onto the geysers.","timestamp_created":1547087258,"timestamp_updated":1547102423,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/bCfm+gCeqb3twE="}
