    about_the_game: Use your communication skills to bypass internet security measures,
      and successfully hack into the most secure banks. Choose to take on the role
      as Hacker, taking direction to disarm each protocol; or Control, and relay instructions
      to your partner.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1281610/extras/HackerSmall.png?t=1599212369"
      /><br>As the hacker, you are the heart of the operation. You're the one in the
      midst of the danger, and the only one with visuals of the bank's database. Following
      instructions that Control gives you, you must make your way through all the
      bank's security measures in able to withdraw funds to your account. Every mistake
      made can cause a potential detection in the system, initiating a lock out. Stay
      cautious as White Hats may try to trace you, resulting in a total lockdown -
      leaving yourself and Control without any loot. Choose your partner wisely, it
      might just be the difference between wealth and imprisonment.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1281610/extras/CONTROLsmall.png?t=1599212369"
      /><br>As Control, you are the brains of the operation. Staying in a remote location,
      you won't have a direct visual of the bank's security, but you will have access
      to the tools that the Hacker needs in order to penetrate the database. You are
      responsible for safely guiding the Hacker past security measures, and into the
      victim's system. Wrong instruction relayed to the Hacker may result in their
      imprisonment. Find out what the hacker is able to see, and with that information
      you will be able to unlock vulnerabilities in the system, and then relay instructions
      back to the hacker on how to bypass security measures.<br><br>In the end the
      only way to guarantee a successful transfer is to work together and stay in
      constant communication. If one person fails, so does the other.<br>Good luck
      and stay hidden.

    review: 'This is a super fun game that I hope gets more development, more players,
      and more attention because it''s very deserving of it. Think of Keep Talking
      and Nobody Explodes, but centered around hacking and solving puzzles instead
      of defusing a bomb. But HEX has a leg up because, instead of having a manual
      for the user to flip through and take forever reading all of the different situations,
      the puzzles here are much simpler and easier to understand. Instead, what takes
      time is the execution of those puzzles, and the communication either between
      the two players or between you and yourself. I [b]LOVE[/b] that HEX comes with
      single-player functionality, which means I can play this game as much as I want
      on my own without [i]having[/i] to coordinate with a friend. It''s much more
      fun working together in co-op, but the single-player option is very much appreciated
      in a game like this.


      It''s still Early Access, so there''s more to see in the future. Already, a
      substantial update was released to improve the way you learn about nodes, from
      both the Hacker side and the Control side. The demo wasn''t updated, so the
      demo features the old method of "learn as you go" and I got to see how poorly
      that played out. It''s great to see the devs have taken players'' feedback to
      heart already and made such a large update centered around the learning experience.


      There''s a few things I hope to see from HEX before it fully launches. I spy
      some uses for the money we''re stealing in "coming soon" menus, and the devs
      promise more puzzle nodes, but my personal desires are for some achievements
      to work towards, some accessibility work like the difference between 0 and O,
      and some minor bug fixes here and there, mostly related to typos or voice line
      cutoff. I would also love an option to save custom games with a custom image
      and description, maybe even with Steam Workshop, but I do realize that''s a
      bigger ask.


      Really, what''s here is already a nearly-complete package, it just needs a little
      more time in the oven and it''ll be a great addition to any co-op lover''s library.
      If you''re at all interested in hacking games like this, or if you really enjoyed
      Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, HEX is right up your alley.


      Edited to remove my mention of wanting Remote Play Together support because
      I realized that it still shares one screen, which wouldn''t make sense for this
      game, my bad.'
