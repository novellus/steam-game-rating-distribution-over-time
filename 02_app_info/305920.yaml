    short_description: Another Perspective is a puzzle platformer following the very
      confusing adventure of someone looking for something. Swap minds to see the
      world in different ways! Where one mind sees a bottomless pit, another might
      not. Where one sees a locked door, another sees a key. To change perspective
      is to change reality!
