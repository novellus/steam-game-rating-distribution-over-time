    review: "This is honestly not that good. I would give it a neutral recommendation\
      \ if I could, because there are some good ideas and design in few places, especially\
      \ in the last dungeon (which has problems of its own too), but overall the DLC\
      \ feels like a small piece cut from the original campaign, only worse and on\
      \ rails. Unless you're a hardcore Kingmaker completionist you can safely skip\
      \ this, and even then, the DLC campaign has almost nothing to do with the base\
      \ game and little to no effect on your kingdom from the main story. It's not\
      \ terrible, but generally a lot poorer than the base game, so I can\u2019t recommend\
      \ it."
