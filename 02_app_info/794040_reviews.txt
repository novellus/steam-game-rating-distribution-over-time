There are virtually only two new spells to the Arena version vs. the original game which is overwhelmingly disappointing.  The weapons are all the same--nothing original.  Truly, the developers should have focused their time on improving the original game and not even wasted the time creating the \"Arena\" version.  It is not worth even the mere $5 dollar price tag.","timestamp_created":1571980425,"timestamp_updated":1571980425,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596022129058837891","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48rbVgO4CfevY1AE="}
