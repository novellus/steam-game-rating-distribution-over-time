The game is pretty doable at first but towards the end I feel like I died way too often despite having the best upgrades and guns and stuff so bit unbalanced there but its not too bad, definitely worth a try if you're into like top down shooter type stuff. 6.5/10","timestamp_created":1569230632,"timestamp_updated":1569230632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxObbru0Cdrfe0gE="}
