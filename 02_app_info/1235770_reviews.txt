It is fun, funny, and scratches the vball itch. One MAJOR problem imho, though.\n\n[strike]If the the other team launches it out of bounds on your side, say on a blocked hit, it counts as you hitting it out. Drives me crazy!\n\nThe other small issue I have is that if a player blocks a shot they should be able to pass the ball right after, that's legal in volleyball on blocked shots. Maybe if the player jumps then it doesn't count as your first hit.[/strike]\n\nEDIT: Dev has fixed both issues I raised, quickly. They rock! I immediately went to test these 2 features, and got stuck playing for too long.\n\nFun new issue I found, I'd consider it a feature rather than a bug. I won a point from a player on the opponent's team hitting the ball twice in a row, and we kept playing the rally. The points were awarded correctly, and I got to serve so it was all good.
