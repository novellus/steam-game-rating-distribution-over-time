Never finish a title. Ban you from making comments about them and their lake of skill coding. This game like all their games so far is unplayable and is finished in their eyes. Made me feel like I've been mugged. It's just stupid how crappy this game is.\n\n I can only assume that now that steam allows refunds this company will disappear very quickly. 30 odd hours and I never made it around the track once. There was no point as I could never make the controls work well enough to play.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Ghost%20Machine","timestamp_created":1439721057,"timestamp_updated":1551623287,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":98,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.871922791004180908","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jY79oekCd72AQw=="}
