    review: 'I honestly did not enjoy the base game.

      And I already gave it a negative review.

      But this cool DLC needs a positive one.

      If you like the base game, this is great.

      This DLC actually gives you new maps.

      And new maps are additional playtime.

      Buying additional playtime is awesome.

      It is much better than a worthless skin.

      Perhaps it''s a bit overpriced by default.

      But it''s so cheap during the discounts.

      If you like the base game: This is nice.

      And if you don''t, then don''t buy this.

      Nothing else to say, a positive review.'
