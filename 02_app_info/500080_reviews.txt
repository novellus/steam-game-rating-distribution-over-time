But the rest of the cards are usually just things you get if there's nothing better on offer.","timestamp_created":1489504725,"timestamp_updated":1489504725,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.659436583518981934","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gM3Z5toCcfywdA=="}
