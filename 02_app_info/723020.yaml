    about_the_game: '<strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Planet earth, year 3571. Humans have
      lost technology, but their heritage is still alive: droids, mutant animals,
      monsters, aliens... Time travel safely by sending an avatar in the future. Control
      it from your computer and see how many time you can survive! </h2></strong><h2
      class="bb_tag">Role Playing Game</h2>3571 The Game is a <strong>role playing
      game</strong> in which you can create an organic avatar in the year 3571. You''ll
      be able to control its movements and experience safely what it''s like to time
      travel : explore, make friends, work, fight, upgrade your skills and die.<h2
      class="bb_tag">+ Roguelike</h2>Like in <strong>roguelike</strong> games, if
      your avatar dies, your game is lost for ever. If you want to play again, you''ll
      need to create a brand new avatar in the year 3571. Be careful: you''ll be sent
      in a very different version of the Earth to avoid spacetime paradoxes.<h2 class="bb_tag">+
      First-person shooter</h2>Thanks to a third-person camera drone, you can see
      your avatar''s body while playing. At any time you can also activate an internal
      camera, and see exactly what your avatar sees. If you find a gun, the gameplay
      will feel like a <strong>first-person shooter</strong>.<h2 class="bb_tag">+
      Survival</h2>As you will experience hunger and thirst you''ll need to collect
      food and water to survive, like in most <strong>survival</strong> games. Hunt,
      fish, find fruits or even steal: do whatever it takes to keep your avatar alive.<h2
      class="bb_tag">+ Open-World Sandbox</h2>3571 The Game is also a <strong>sandbox
      simulation</strong>. You can also gather resources like wood or stone to build
      weapons, armors and even buildings. The game have no other goal except surviving,
      so you are free to explore the world like you want and set your own goals.<h2
      class="bb_tag">+ Micromanagement</h2>3571 The Game is also meant to be a very
      simple kind of <strong>micromanagement game</strong>. You are able to recruit
      people in your clan, and make them fight for you. Soon you''ll be able to equip
      then and give them orders.<h2 class="bb_tag">+ Single artist original art project</h2>3571

    review: 'Pros:

      Good Concept (Everything is generated and every ressource and enemy is limited.)

      Unique Artstyle (Silly little dudes trying to survive in a 1990''s like game
      world.)

      Single Developer (Much respect for him, because he made a game he wanted to
      make.)

      Procedural Generation (Love it or hate it. Personally I love procedural games.)


      Cons:

      Unoptimized (I have a decent PC and sometimes my FPS were above 30 and sometimes
      under 30.)

      UI (I played with 1920x1080 and the UI was very small and looked odd.)

      Physics (Furnitures are as light as feathers and flew around everywhere.)

      Mouse (The mouse movement was bad. The mouse smoothing is way too high.)

      First Person (Too much headbobbing and doesn''t feel "good".)

      Third Person (In small areas the camera was sometimes in the roof.)




      I wish I could enjoy the game, but in the current state I cant. It''s unplayable
      for me. I hope this feedback is helpfull and I hope I can enjoy this game one
      day.'
