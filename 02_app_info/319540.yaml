    review: "[h1] A Year of Rain [/h1]\n[h3] A new, unique RTS that had potential,\
      \ but due to lack of publisher faith, was crippled at launch and abandoned soon\
      \ after [/h3]\n\nSo...  This game is pretty good.  It's pretty much like a Warcraft\
      \ 3 spiritual successor.  Better than WC3 Reforged in a lot of ways.  \n\nAs\
      \ much as I want to love this game however I can't pretend I'm not disappointed.\
      \  The game was released unfinished, and abandoned very quickly.  I don't think\
      \ Daedalic had any faith in it, they released it before it was ready and didn't\
      \ even give it a chance to build momentum and customer faith.  They were hoping\
      \ for a big launch with their unfinished early access game, didn't get it, and\
      \ abandoned the game rather than wait.  As a game dev I understand the circumstance,\
      \ but you can't expect an EA title to sell like a finished one.  It does come\
      \ with a beefy campaign, that can be played solo or coop.  It has full on voice\
      \ acting, in game cutscenes, etc.  Plus skirmish mode, and of course Online\
      \ mode.  So the content is there, it was mostly finished even, but as expected\
      \ needed work, which is the whole point of early access.  Pathfinding can be\
      \ pretty bad sometimes, which REALLY hurts the play experience in an RTS.  Other\
      \ than that however the game-play is pretty polished and AYOR really gives WC3\
      \ reforged a run for it's money IMO.  I do hate the Coop AI, because I prefer\
      \ to play solo and I have always hated Coop RTS campaigns with AI allies (like\
      \ Red Alert 3) but still the game has SO MUCH potential it makes me depressed.\
      \  I'm just disappointed that Daedalic seemingly launched this game to try and\
      \ make back as much of their money as possible without ever really planning\
      \ to support it, they basically lied about it, but in an underhanded way so\
      \ they could shrug off blame. \n\nThey launched it as early access, but I really\
      \ don't believe they ever planned to support the game unless it was a smash\
      \ hit right out of the gate, which to me is kind of insane to expect.  Early\
      \ access is supposed to support further development, not be your big money making\
      \ release.  I understand, first hand, how difficult the industry is right now,\
      \ but these types of situations only further shake customer faith in new ambitious\
      \ projects.  If Daedalic can sell a game for 40 bucks, promising to support\
      \ it's development further and then just dump it a few months later, then how\
      \ can anyone be optimistic about early access. Launches that are handled like\
      \ this are one of the reasons the industry is in such a sorry state in the first\
      \ place.  The worst part is that the devs that actually worked on the game are\
      \ certainly very passionate about A Year of Rain and it shows, but their higher\
      \ ups clearly never had much faith in it at all.  \n\nOverall I recommend the\
      \ game if you can get it on sale for the campaign alone, but I am very disappointed\
      \ with how the game was handled and it still needs a major bugfix and QOL pass.\
      \  In my opinion it was never given enough of a chance to become what Daedalic\
      \ wanted it to be because they would just rather cut their losses and move on.\
      \  Now A Year of Rain will just fade into RTS obscurity and from the amount\
      \ of passion that was put into it I really feel it deserved more.  This could\
      \ have been a fantastic WC3 styled RTS and really could have been something\
      \ big in the RTS genre.  Now it's just completely dead. Thanks Daedalic, I will\
      \ never purchase another EA title from you again. "
