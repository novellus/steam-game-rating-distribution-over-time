The new characters are interesting and fit into the roster.  \nWhile not directly OP, I feel the new guy and gals are not perfectly balanced - but that is the case with the original roster as well. Since there are now more contenders, a run becomes longer and more difficult. But hey, that's why are here, right?\nOther than that, nothing else changed.\n\nThe in-game art and animations of the new characters are on par with the original ones I would say. The new stages are a mixed bag for me. I love the new snow level, the night level is okay, the temple with the sunset is somewhat hard on my eyes.\nAs noted, the character portraits are of lower quality (or at least a slightly different style) which makes them look a bit displaced, but I do not really mind. All in all, a welcomed addition.","timestamp_created":1596946773,"timestamp_updated":1596983911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pZTq6fMCeqOpmgI="}
