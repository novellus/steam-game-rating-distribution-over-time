    review: 'https://youtu.be/tUO5jAzkaRQ


      I have never been railroaded so fucking hard while also having to backtrack
      90% of the game. It felt like the whole game was waiting in line at the dmv.
      There are about 5 main rooms you are going to be walking back and forth through
      and let me break down how these rooms work. And remember this game is 30$


      Each of the rooms will have 6-7 exits only 1 of which will be open to you, the
      rest will be either locked doors or have invisible walls blocking your path.
      You proceed through the only exit that allows you to leave and perform a mundane
      task such as grabbing a med kit or checking to see if an elevator has power
      (spoiler it doesn''t.). Afterwards you travel back to the first room and proceed
      through another exit. Another stupid check, another new exit. The whole game
      is walking back and forth among a few rooms and every once in awhile you have
      to fight a zombie which is beyond fucking buggy.


      Combat happens one of two ways. Either you go toe to fucking toe with the zombie
      and just throw haymakers until one of you drops or you will have to bug the
      zombie by attacking him then moving to the right so you can glitch into them
      a bit. Several times you and the zombie will attack each other and you''ll both
      die. Also dont bother trying to run the zombies melee swing has a stupid far
      range on it.


      Graphics were not to be shabby but the sound. Oh the sound. Or I guess I should
      say the lack of it. You will only hear a few things throughout the game. A crunching
      sound that happens when you do almost anything, like opening doors, putting
      on a band aid, or walking up to a knife. The other sounds are an ambient rain
      that only happens on loading screens and running water that happens in one of
      the rooms. Other than that pure silence. Oh and also the main character is voiced
      by a text to speech program so there''s that.


      This is an incredibly shallow game that has intentional obstacles to stretch
      out the length. If you were able to freely explore the game could be finished
      in 10 minutes instead of an hour.'
