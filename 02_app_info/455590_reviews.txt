I am playing for two hours now, trying to beat my girlfriend's highscore, which she set after her very first run. And finally, finally I catched her up. I am still stucking in level 1 but YES, I'VE BEATEN HER HIGHSCORE! Hotline Miami hard game? Check this, it will show you a new definition of what 'hard' means! Well... there is still the possibillity that I am just sooo bad at this... no, that seems wrong (I did much better with 'Daddy Long Legs'), it must be the game.\n\n[strike]This game[/strike] Level 1 is good and fun and recommended, I've bought Clumsy Runners due to its pixelart (love it), its soundtrack (love it) and because it is fucking... cute (I don't say that often). And I don't deny my purchase so far. Well the downside is, if you are bad at the game you won't see much of it. Controls are customizable, I've tried different key setups, tried one finger, two fingers, one hand, two hands, failed with all of them, in the end my only change was to put 'standing up' on space as well.\n\nToday evening there will be a moment of pride, me saying to my girlfriend 'Believe it or not but I've beaten your highscore!' Probably she will smile and say 'Give me five more minutes with the game please...'","timestamp_created":1466449703,"timestamp_updated":1587922347,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.429684937000274658","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4v4Tj2/ECd7SnWg=="}
