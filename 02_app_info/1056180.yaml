    about_the_game: Wake up in a world with no recollection of how you got there.
      A world full of secrets, hidden rooms, dungeons and towns; Cathedral features
      a vast world, meant for exploring! You control a nameless protagonist, a knight
      from a different world, who teams up with a spirit known as Soul. Figure out
      what makes this world tick, and how to get back home.<br><br>Unravel the secrets
      of your past by finding the five elemental orbs. The orbs, placed in ancient
      times by the demi-god known only as Ardur, are protected by five fearsome guardians.
      Make your way through their dungeons, meet them head-on in combat, and see if
      you can best them!<br><br>Along the way, you will find magical items that allow
      you to explore even further, and reach new areas, towns and dungeons.<h2 class="bb_tag">A
      large world to explore</h2><br>Cathedral features a large interconnected 2D
      world, containing more than 600 rooms to explore. Use the handy world map to
      find new locations, items and backtracking opportunities. The world of Cathedral
      is completely hand-crafted, and contains many unique areas, secrets and puzzles.
      Each area of the world is designed to be distinct and unique with its own puzzles
      and challenges.<br><br>Cathedral is not a game that will hold your hand, but
      rather allow you to set out and explore on your own.<h2 class="bb_tag">Modern,
      tight controls meet retro-inspired graphics</h2><br>Cathedral is an homage to
      games of the past, built using modern technology. The game makes use of the
      NES color palette and sound capabilities without following the restrictions
      fully, which allows us to draw inspiration from both the 8-bit and 16-bit era.<br><br>The
      game is designed to be played using a game controller, such as an XBox, PS or
      Switch controller, but works well with keyboard too. Regardless of which you
      choose, you will play a game with extremely tight and fine-tuned controls.<h2
