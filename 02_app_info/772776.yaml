    short_description: "Much like the killer, \u201CJIGSAW\u201D is much more than\
      \ it seems. The cast and crew share their experience working on a film in which\
      \ the Producers went to great lengths to keep the film shrouded in mystery leading\
      \ up to the theatrical release."
