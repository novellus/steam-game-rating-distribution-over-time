    review: It is a lot of fun . I have to use my mind to match things . Split decisions
      are hard for me to do , but I still enjoy trying to win . I never do win , but
      I keep trying . The shadow game I really don't care for , but that's because
      I'm not good at it . I like to keep playing it , because it keeps my mind active
      . I like playing all the games and trying to win !!
