Which is fine because 3 unit types only.\n\nYet you've got so little control that there is no strategy to be had: fixed starting positions, fixed order of actions, you only choose where a unit goes (without waypoints) and what it hits.\n\nAs a result, slow units block the way of faster units. Which is stupid. Also, for some reason, beefcakes in heavy armors cannot climb stairs. Which is stupid.\n\nPointless.\nDon't spend a scrap on it.","timestamp_created":1605029072,"timestamp_updated":1605029158,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx6vM2fUCd4LLrQI="}
