The concept is really interesting. The idea of being “death’s little helper” is interesting, and the cloaks are super fascinating and a cool mystery to try and unravel. Plus, the concept of cutting dead/dying people’s tongues out to collect their stories is super fascinating and unique\n\n[b]So, now, the negatives [/b]\n\nThe story can be oppressively depressing. I mean, I know the subject of collecting people’s tongues after they die is dark, but come on. Everyone hates each other and constantly argues to the point where it stops even being interesting storywise, and it felt like half of the time, even when leaning on my character’s strengths, I would never be able to succeed at anything. I’d try calling in some of the favors I’d earned, only for nothing to come of it. Yet I feel like I still had more success than the average player considering I’ve gotten achievements that 13% of people who played it had. If I had more success than average, I can’t imagine how obnoxiously hard it must feel for other people to play this game\n\nThere were a lot of times where it felt like what I would choose didn’t matter, and I was destined to ruin things, which is really not what I like to see from a game that’s supposed to be based around your choices. I felt like I was frequently being railroaded, and the choices didn’t do nearly what I expected them to do, so I never had any idea what would happen based on my choices other than me failing in some way or another. It made it difficult for me to keep playing the game-- when I’m trying to do something enjoyable, I definitely don’t want to constantly feel like everything I do is futile and that I’m screwed no matter what I do\n\nFor example, at one point [spoiler] my character was hit with a court summons for apparently antagonizing Kara, the librarian, and causing problems in the library. Which is weird because I never did that. Throughout the library scene, I took Kara’s side and did what I could to be polite, so I have no idea why my character would have been put on her blacklist. I feel like this is also related to an issue with the characters seeming to hate you no matter what you do. Kara specifically felt like this, since throughout my entire interactions with her in the early part of the story, we seemed to be getting along well. Suddenly, she dislikes me enough to put me on her blacklist for seemingly no reason, despite the fact that it still says the she “finds (me) amenable”. [/spoiler] I wanted to like the characters, but stuff like this made it really hard for me to connect to them since it felt like no matter what, they wouldn’t like me\n\nIt seemed like my character stats hardly changed throughout the entire story. Maybe I was just picking all the wrong options, but I feel like most of the time, a good portion of your choices will affect your stats in some way or another with all the COG and Hosted games. However, several of mine remained exactly the same from the first chapter to the end of the story, which made it feel even more like my choices didn’t really matter. This feeling was only made even stronger by the fact that there were a lot of long pages of text, some of which would end without even giving you a choice of something to do. It felt more like I was along for the ride than actually able to make a choice in things, and while that’s not necessarily a bad thing, for a game where the whole point is you making choices, I felt like nothing I did really mattered\n\nI also encountered tons of glitches that made it nearly impossible for me to understand what was happening at times, sometimes things that I assume are from the code would appear alongside the actual text, and characters I’ve never met before would be referred to as though I was supposed to know who they were. I believe one other reviewer here mentioned that these could be easily patched out, and while they probably could be, it’s been 2 years since the game came out and the bugs are still there, so. Not really a great sign. At one point, [spoiler] I ran into a glitch where I was supposed to be interviewing three tongues. One of them needed to basically be resuscitated, and I managed to do that. Yay, based on the rarity of the achievement, that’s something kind of difficult to do. The excitement of having done something difficult on my first try was marred by the fact that I ran into a glitch where even after having gotten the thoughts from the resuscitated tongue, I could select to hear from it again. Assuming that there was more from it, I chose that option, and since the game was apparently only programmed so you could make three choices in this segment, that means I completely missed out on one of the stories [/spoiler]\n\nThe worst glitch I had was an issue where what I assume there could have potentially been a conflict between myself and another one of my coworkers. However, there must have been a coding error or something, because instead of there actually being a person that I was up against, it would say “no one”. I assume what was supposed to be happening is depending on relationships with coworkers, you would have to try and succeed against one of them here, but since I had a neutral to positive relationship with all of them (allegedly, it felt like they all hated me), it just said there was no one\n\nTo show how completely incomprehensible this was, [spoiler] again with my character being called to court, and I tried to call in a favor with Pedita. It said that “no one” had the same target, so I thought “oh, okay, that’s good”. Then the next sentence says “she throws you a hateful look”, and context says it's not Pedita doing that, which implies that someone else is. But the only other person who could be involved here is Roza since no one else uses she/her pronouns, and Roza’s not involved. Then several times throughout this page of text, it again refers to no one as if there’s a person that should be here. [/spoiler] It got to the point where I thought that this had to be some kind of intentional thing, like the author was trying to play with my mind somehow. Honestly, I wish it was because then I would have at least been able to figure out what on earth was happening in hindsight\n\nMy ending also felt highly anticlimactic, and like countless plot threads had just been abandoned. [spoiler] I never learned what was up with the ministry and why my house was hated so much, what was going on with that assassin, what was up with the cloaks-- really anything about any of the mysteries that were set up throughout the story. I didn’t even get anything happening with my RO, though granted, with how I was treated by them sometimes, I'm not even sure if I was successfully romancing them. [/spoiler] I’m sure I probably just got a bad ending, but even the bad endings of other stories from COG/Hosted don’t leave every single plot thread from the story unanswered. Maybe one day I’ll replay the story to try and get something better so I can at least have some answers, but I doubt I’ll be doing that any time soon due to just how hard this thing was to slog through near the end\n\nI’d probably give this game a [b]3/10[/b]. The concept is interesting, but there are so many issues and the plot was so difficult for me to follow that I finished the game feeling unfulfilled and lost. Kinda disappointed I spent my money on this, especially when the demo was so promising, but at least I got it on a sale","timestamp_created":1609101965,"timestamp_updated":1609101965,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47O780vYCce/vvQI="}
