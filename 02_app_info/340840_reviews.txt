I thoroughly enjoyed this.\nIt builds up and maintains a real creepy atmosphere in a depressing dystopian world which I just absolutely loved.  You make your way from memory to memory, accessing crime scenes, solving puzzles and trying to figure out what has happened.  The story is markedly cryptic but it gives you just enough to keep you intrigued, and there's at least some amount of an effort to tie things off in a neat enough ending.  Some of the puzzles did veer into pixel hunt territory, but nothing unforgiveable (especially as there is always youtube) and it must be said the English translation was definitely a bit ropey at times, though certainly not the worst I've seen in horror games on steam.\nSome mechanics, though they fitted thematically, I don't think they quite worked out mechanically given the genre.  There's a cohesion/sanity meter which you must keep up to stay alive, and it slowly is eaten away over time as you exist in this putrid world.  And while that was great at first as it really put the pressure on to move quickly, I found that after I died a few times it was very easy to speed your way back through a level hovering up all the cohesion-restoring potions whilst expending barely any.  And after a while I ended up with a ridiculous amount of potions that I never needed to worry about taking my time.  Having a limited number of potions that was reset in each memory likely would have worked better.\nAlso I really didn't like the save mechanic.  You could deploy an 'anchor' which saves your game but if you wanted to save again you had to go and pick it up and deploy it again.  Again I think checkpointing would have made more sense.\n\nBut with those nitpicks aside it's definitely a good game that just hasn't got the visibility it deserves.  I loved the creepy doll design.  And the game did a wonderful job of NOT bombarding me with jumpscares accompanied with the soundtrack screaming in my ear, as steam horror games tend to do.  Instead the game just let the player engage with the setting and horrors naturally.  And I definitely did jump more than once, like when I was busy rummaging round through the drawers of a room when I noticed I'm silently being watching by an unspeakable horror in the corner of the room.  Chilling stuff, the game really does a great job of getting under your skin.\nAnd though there were bugs, the developer must be applauded for how they're still working away at this over 2 years post launch.  I encountered a game breaking bug and the developer had it resolved and a new patch out straightaway.  It clearly is a labor of love this game for the developer and I recommend you pick it up and support them and hopefully they're put out more quality games in the future.","timestamp_created":1599605594,"timestamp_updated":1599605594,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+Yr7t/QCfM7UoAI="}
