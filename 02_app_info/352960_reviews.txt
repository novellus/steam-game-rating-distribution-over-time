It runs out of content after the first 3 levels (~40 minutes), everything repeats including the \"boss\".  The missions are just shooting down boring enemies and the terrible design doesn't become readily apparent until you fight the POS that is the final boss.  It is an unfair shitshow.","timestamp_created":1606194094,"timestamp_updated":1606194094,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+5uo/PUCeq+XsAI="}
