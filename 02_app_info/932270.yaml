    review: July the Lost Child  is a cryptic voxel based experience disguised as
      a point and click adventure game. Its strongest points are an unnverving atmosphere
      and refined camera angles during cutscenes. After some "rewinds" it becomes
      clear that the gameplay is based on trial and error. Performing some actions
      and using the few items at disposal as fast as possible is the key. Despite
      many misspellings and the unskippable cutscenes (they're cool but after ten
      times...), I really enjoyed the experience. But I'm aware it's not for everyone.
