    review: I need to know something about this game... when you enter the Desert
      Temple and go through the spike traps and make it into the next area with the
      moving boulders.  I got reset to the beginning of the dungeon with no ways to
      reactivate the boulders to move i cant get passed one of the boulders to go
      where i left off.  I'm concerned there is a bug im dealing with or is there
      something I'm missing?
