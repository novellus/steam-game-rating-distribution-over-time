I finally got around to playing this. Was it worth it? Nope, I would have been better never playing this game and leaving it in my backlog. I would have been better never having spent these .99 cents. C'est la vie. This is a great concept game, with very bad execution. As many people mention in the reviews, the controls are horrible and indeed they are. I questioned my sanity several times. Where am I going? Is my ship moving? Should I keep going?
