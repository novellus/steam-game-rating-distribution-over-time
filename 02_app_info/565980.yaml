    review: "A good Choice of Games/Hosted Games entry. You can finish this is in\
      \ two hours, one sitting, so if you are in the mood for a short mystery, this\
      \ one's for you. This is part of the Evertree saga, but this is a complete story.\
      \ The sequel is more of an \"another story by the same protagonist\" thing,\
      \ this gives you a satisfactory conclusion to the events it introduces. \n\n\
      Traveling from point A to point B, you stop to spend the night on an inn. In\
      \ 3 hours time, you will find a body. How you want to spend those 3 hours is\
      \ up to you, and will heavily influence what happens. You can try to get closer\
      \ to a particular guest or staff member, try to solve a mystery you stumble\
      \ upon, or just keep to yourself. As the evening moves on, you may discover\
      \ different clues. Do well enough, and after each segment you'll be treated\
      \ to a nice stats bonus. Once you discover the body, you'll have to make an\
      \ educated guess at who (or what) is behind the incident. What I like here is\
      \ that it seems the game doesn't reward you for making the one correct answer,\
      \ but by making one that makes sense according to the clues you have gathered\
      \ up to that point. Afterwards, you have to deal with the incident to the best\
      \ of your abilities, and fight for the best outcome, whatever that is to you.\
      \ \n\nI like how straightforward the stats are. You only have 4: Combat (melee\
      \ weapon and intimidation related), Guile (Stealth and deception), Perception\
      \ (ability to read situations, surroundings, and Bow use), and Magic (self explanatory).\
      \ \n\nI think the story was clever and the writing was good. I feel quite satisfied\
      \ with this game, and it gets a strong recommendation from me, definetly worth\
      \ experiencing if you are a fan of interactive fiction, or want to try it out\
      \ for the first time."
