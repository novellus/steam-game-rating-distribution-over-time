I am sorry you didn't enjoy it. You can always refund of course. I am currently developing a new game in the style of Bladequest, but highly improved. Enemies will have ragdoll physics and you will be able to kick them, block them and parry their attacks, which gets rid of the problem you described. And there will be so much more like housing, pets, more enemy types like goblins and humans, special boss enemies (trolls, demons etc), physical based traps, totally new weapon system, a semi open world, with a brand new random level generation system, which also allows the generation of caves and even outdoor levels, additionally to the castle ruins you know from Bladequest.\n\nYou can follow the development on my YouTube channel (@PhodexGames), where I upload quality devlogs every week.\n\nBeta testing for Raidborn is also coming closer, so you can get your hands on it soon. I hope this can make it up, that you didn't have fun with Bladequest. I would also give you a special discount, or any form of goodie for Raidborn, when it gets released. Just email me at contact.phodex@gmail.com, so I can contact you when it gets released.\n\nAll the best and and have great day,\nMarkus (Phodex Games)\n"}],"cursor":"AoJw07PAwfACfYjh9AE="}
