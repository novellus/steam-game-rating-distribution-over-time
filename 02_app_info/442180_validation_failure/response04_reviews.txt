It is no longer a demo, BUT it is only an hour's worth of content. No Multiplayer, just an hour long \"Season\"\n\nPros\n- Game looks great(CryEngine Basic is nice)\n- UI is pretty good\n\nCons\n- Voice Acting is the WORST I have ever heard in a video game to date\n- Sound mix is terrible. Music is Overbearing the voices, so you can barely hear voice/game\n- Missions are so basic. Run to panel, flip light from Red to Green.\n- Boring as hell\n- Cutscenes are just god awful\n\n\nReviewed Mar. 19,2016\nI am totally confused.\n\nThis is a Demo, for an Alpha, of a game that isn't in Early Access..... I have no words. Here is my Video Review.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2taQe6MsG4","timestamp_created":1458407668,"timestamp_updated":1464498314,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":151,"votes_funny":8,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513302981853485107","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwsdu5/dQCfOjSUw=="}
