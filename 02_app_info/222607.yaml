    about_the_game: "The dual voltage Class 92 electric locomotive is now available\
      \ for Train Simulator in the privatised livery of English, Welsh &amp; Scottish\
      \ Railway (EWS) livery.<br><br>The Class was built by a consortium of Brush\
      \ Traction and ABB Traction between 1993 and 1996 with the intention of running\
      \ services through the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France. All locomotives\
      \ were fitted with dual voltage operation to allow operation on either third\
      \ rail 750v DC or overhead 25kV AC power, with most electrical systems duplicated\
      \ to reduce the possibility of locomotive failure in the Channel Tunnel. <br><br>In\
      \ total, 46 locomotives were built in the Class and shared a body shell with\
      \ the Class 60, albeit with a modified front end. The locomotive was fitted\
      \ with both rheostatic and regenerative braking, in addition to standard Westinghouse\
      \ air brake equipment, and an electrical train bus was fitted to enable two\
      \ locomotives to work in multiple formation, either double-heading or in push-pull\
      \ formation with a Driving Van Trailer (DVT).<br><br>Post privatisation, the\
      \ fleet was split between EWS, European Passenger Services, Eurostar (UK) and\
      \ SNCF; the six locomotives retained by Eurostar were initially earmarked to\
      \ head sleeper services through the Channel Tunnel, but this project was quickly\
      \ abandoned.<br><br>The BR Class 92 for Train Simulator is available in former\
      \ BR Railfreight grey livery with EWS overlay stickers to replicate the locomotive\
      \ as it looked under EWS ownership. The locomotive features functioning dual\
      \ voltage operation, vacuum circuit breaker to isolate power supply, PBL brake,\
      \ variable wiper speed, pantograph up/down control, power mode selector and\
      \ AWS. Also included are loaded and unloaded Megafret container wagons.<br><br>The\
      \ locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive\
      \ the EWS Class 92 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such\
      \ as those available through Steam. Also included are scenarios specifically\
