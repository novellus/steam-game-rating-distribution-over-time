    about_the_game: "Liquid Rhythm is a wildly innovative beat generator, sequencer,\
      \ and software MIDI controller. It's powered by a rhythm synthesis engine that\
      \ gives you instant access to quadrillions of rhythmic patterns that can be\
      \ manipulated with a comprehensive suite of MIDI effects called Molecule Tools.\
      \ Paint drum patterns using a palette of note clusters that provide new visualizations\
      \ for MIDI data, make beats using multi-sample drum instruments or your own\
      \ samples, and run it standalone or integrate into your workflow through VST/AU/RTAS/Max\
      \ for Live.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><br><strong>Accent Modifiers</strong><br>Accent\
      \ Modifiers target the velocity and groove of notes; basically the things that\
      \ make music not sound like renegade robots hijacked your studio and started\
      \ making music. You can think of Accent Modifiers as avenues to <u>humanize</u>\
      \ your beats and free them from totalitarian robotic rule.<br><br><strong>BeatBuilder:\
      \ BarForm List</strong><br>When you\u2019re creating a drum track, the Beat\
      \ Builder is your best friend. By default, it\u2019s a really straightforward\
      \ look at some commonly occurring patterns for whatever instrument you have\
      \ selected. For example, if you\u2019re working on a snare instrument, the Beat\
      \ Builder will instantly highlight snare-specific patterns you can insert into\
      \ regions with one click.<br><br><strong>BeatBuilder: BeatForm Sequencer</strong><br>A\
      \ regular sequencer loops one or two bars and you input notes one at a time.\
      \ The BeatForm Sequencer takes that model to the next level:  Each space in\
      \ the sequencer can hold one or more notes, up to six. You can think of the\
      \ spaces in the BeatForm sequencer as placeholders for groups of notes. All\
      \ it ever takes is one click in the BeatForm Sequencer to get a cluster of notes\
      \ in any given space. <br> <br><strong>BeatSeeker</strong><br>The BeatWeaver\
      \ Rhythm Synthesizer can be an intimidating mass of information to negotiate\
      \ through. That\u2019s why the developers at WaveDNA built the BeatSeeker, an\
      \ intelligent algorithm that highlights the most commonly occurring patterns\
      \ for whatever instrument you\u2019re working on. Our team of astute scientists\
      \ studied several hundred songs from a variety of genres to ensure its accuracy.\
      \ <br><br><strong>In-Line Editing</strong><br>Liquid Rhythm\u2019s Pencil and\
      \ Paint tools turn the Arranger into something it should always be\u2013 a Canvas.\
      \ Rhythm is art, your screen is an easel, and these are the tools of your trade.<br><br><strong>Media\
      \ Library</strong><br>Liquid Rhythm features a handful of  distinct kits, each\
      \ mapped to the General MIDI standard of percussion (which is a fancy way of\
      \ saying that when you hook up your MIDI drum pad, everything will work just\
      \ the way you\u2019d expect it to). There are six electronic kits:<br><br><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li>DnB<br></li><li>Dubstep<br></li><li>HipHop<br></li><li>House<br></li><li>Techno<br></li><li>Trance</li></ul>\
      \ <br>...and four acoustic kits:<br> <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Acoustic<br></li><li>Pop<br></li><li>Rock<br></li><li>Soul</li></ul>\
      \ <br><strong>The Music Molecule</strong><br>The Music Molecule is a new representation\
      \ of MIDI. More importantly, it\u2019s a simpler and more musical representation\
      \ of MIDI. Unlike traditional MIDI editors, Liquid Rhythm doesn\u2019t require\
      \ you to have any theoretical understanding of music or the piano. It\u2019\
      s our way of grouping notes together in a 4/4 bar to let you actually paint\
      \ entire bars of music onto your arranger.<br> <br><strong>VST/AU/RTAS</strong><br>Integrate\

    review: 'Despite the many mixed reviews, I have to say this...of all the compositional
      software tools I have, Liquid Rhythm is one of the best, in large part because
      it''s so focused. You have an improbably large number of ways to generate beats
      in this, and so it lends itself to sophistication. If you''re just making a
      four-on-the-floor you don''t need this at all, but if you need complex fills,
      polyrhythms, call and response or even a starting motif for melodies...this
      is the place to go.


      The problem with software-assisted composition is simply that most of it gets
      too detailed and fiddly - it makes student-grade composition, and then once
      you know what you really want you start fighting the tool to get it, which means
      you don''t really "stay in flow" at all. The remainder is like an arranger keyboard
      - great, very flowing, until you want to edit the style, and then equally as
      fiddly and tedious, if you can even do it.


      But if you take a bits-and-pieces approach to building up the composition you
      don''t have to feel quite so limited. My favorite software arranger is Chordpulse,
      but it has no style editing at all. What to do? Export the midi to the DAW,
      then substitute in some rhythms exported from LR and it''s practically a new
      style. Like a lot of things, you have to use it judiciously. The point of using
      these tools isn''t to replace your ears and brain, but to get you out of the
      rut of your muscle memory leading to the same ideas over and over.'
