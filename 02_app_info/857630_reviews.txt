Nope \n\n(not even in the set worth it, drags down the otherwise high quality set)\n\nWatchable on normal screen without VR set.","timestamp_created":1573863071,"timestamp_updated":1573863071,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1575299238,"developer_response":"Thanks for the interesting insight KrigarNooben.
