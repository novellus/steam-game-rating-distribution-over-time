But it definitely needs polish and some rework of mechanics. The scrollcrafting feels very satisfying, needing to manage your health and mana to draw the symbols is really cool. The reaload mechanic is really unique and cool too and I like it, but I have to agree with some of the other reviewers here that this is not really the game for such a mechanic. The battles are great, if very short compared to the time you spent afterwards scavenging the room for chests and the parts they contain. And the music really pumps you up for the battles against the enemies and bosses.\n\nTLDR: Great game with cool mechanics and great music. But needs polishing and maybe a rework of some of these mechanics.","timestamp_created":1609778012,"timestamp_updated":1609778012,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9uOP5/YCc/63wAI="}
