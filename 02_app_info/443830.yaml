    review: muy buena historia aunque si hay que tener bien pensado lo que decides
      hacer ya que en mi primer historia termine escribiendo un libro de fantasia
      y siendo la burla de los demas lo cual me llevo a separarme de la sociedad y
      vivir de mis recuerdos....... si sera mejor que reinicie y empiece una nueva
      historia
