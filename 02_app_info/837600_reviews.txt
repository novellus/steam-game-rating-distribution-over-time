There are nice propaganda posters and the game gives off an oldschool FPS vibe if you are into sort of thing. However, the friendly AI is annoying and the ending is anti-climactic. Overall, Operation Thunderstorm is a much better game in my opinion. Royal Marines Commando is only recommended if you play subpar ww2 FPS.","timestamp_created":1596015697,"timestamp_updated":1609458143,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563953518867492676","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48cnL3fYCdOibmAI="}
