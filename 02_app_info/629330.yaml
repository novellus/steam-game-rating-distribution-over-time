    review: Despite the scarcity of these songs in the actual game, every single one
      of them evokes the feel of Team Fortress 2's hectic gameplay to a tee. Even
      on its own, this soundtrack is a joy to listen to and I'd recommend it to anyone
      who likes the game's superb art direction.
