However, I've been playing MotoGP, and nearly all other racing games of all types since their inception. I'm not even gonna take the time to list them all just to prove my knowledge and worthiness... I'm a racing game junkie born in '84... nuff said.\n  \nSo here's why I quit so early...\n\n1. Engine audio is absolutely awful. Clearly just some layered saw-tooth waves with some unintelligent use of reverb. What happened to the days when they took the time to go out and record real audio of each individual bike; manufacturer, class, any modifications, track and weather conditions, object proximity, part performance and or failure, etc.etc. \n\n2.  Graphics; running i7, 7700, 1070, blah blah blah... yes running ultra... no not looking like ultra. Idk about this one.  I hope I'm doing something wrong cuz these graphics seem worse than PS4. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.\n \n3.  WTF is up with the handling?  Listen, I'll accept the fact that I might simply be overlooking something, but I'm pretty sure I've gone through every menu and setting available from easy settings through pro... I can't even finish a lap without sliding out, or turning a horribly slow time.  So please, if you guys have any advice on settings or what I may be doing wrong, please let me know.  This is the #1 killer for me.  I can deal with sub-par graphics and audio, as long as the game-play is smooth and enjoyable. Also, I use an XBOX cont., if that says anything...\n\n4.  This is a nit-picky one: character, livery, helmet, suit, bike etc. Customization is ok... I feel like more in depth options should be standard these days. We've all seen what can be done, let's include at least that.\n\nSo yeah, that's what I gathered in 1 hr of play.  Really hope someone can show me where I've gone wrong in the settings, because I really want to like this game.","timestamp_created":1610083196,"timestamp_updated":1610083196,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxvub8PYCcIW7wQI="}
