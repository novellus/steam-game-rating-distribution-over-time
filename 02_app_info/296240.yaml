    review: 'What is The Promised Land ?


      A simple and fun casual strategy game, for people who just want a more calming,
      relaxing experience this is a good pick, its pretty much a strategy game where
      you assign workers to do their job at colonizing this new place they just arrived
      like sending some to collect resources, others to mine, craft items, cook, explore,
      etc, its the usual stuff you normally see in games like this but more in a linear
      and smaller scale way, sometimes the game even tries to get a little more off
      the charts like when pirates attack your land and an angry bird-like minigame
      start playing, this is a rare occurrence tho, but for the most part its a cool
      game to chill and pass some time, it comes with really good visuals and songs,
      worth checking out.'
