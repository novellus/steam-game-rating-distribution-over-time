Back then it was more of an \"experience\" because you could only ride the dragons on a couple of pre-made routes.  Since then the developers have added more dragons, dragon and player customization, free flight, a bunch of new environments and several mini-games.  The dragon models are just beautiful and my daughter loves collecting eggs and gems.  The developer updates the game frequently and we can't wait to see what they add next.","timestamp_created":1609806694,"timestamp_updated":1609806694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw55j95/YCfY/HwAI="}
