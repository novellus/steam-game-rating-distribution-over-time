Their isn't enough of a challenge to get excited about or new mechanics. Also it's not really polished which I figured going in since it's a budget title. However the one thing you need are perfect hit boxes in a game like this and it doesn't have it.\n\nSo really interesting idea but not executed well. I would love to see what the developer is going to release next.\n\nVideo version: https://youtu.be/tc6xJ7sYSRc","timestamp_created":1520692285,"timestamp_updated":1520692285,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45NmUiOICcrqnmwE="}
