    review: 'Was expecting a more reliable game.


      i have xbox one and xbox 360 controller. both doesn''t work with this game.


      i can choose item at the beginning, like what controller, options , etc... but
      once i start the game the mars helicopter is about 3 feet from the ground and
      doing nothing else but hover.  both xbox controller are not working at all.


      tried re-installing the game, trying some other vr game that works really well
      with both xbox controllers.


      but this game is a NO GO with xbox controllers.


      i will be waiting for an update that will probably fix this problem, in the
      mean time, this games is a DOA and cannot be played as it is suppose to be.


      it''s $$$ not well spent i tell ya all!
