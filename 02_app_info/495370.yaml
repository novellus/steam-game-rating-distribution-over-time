    about_the_game: Explore the galaxy and discover the secrets of long-forgotten
      worlds. Uncover lost treasures of the past, discover ancient technologies, and
      guide your empire into a new age of prosperity. How you choose to handle unexpected
      events and challenges will have a direct impact on how each newfound treasure
      functions within your empire.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Features:</strong></h2><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li> <strong>New Colony Events:</strong> As you colonize planets,
      new colonization events will challenge your people and your integrity.  Each
      new event  provides new Ideology choices that may award unique planetary improvements
      and ship components.  Some of these events appear later in the game, so keep
      your eyes open! <br></li><li> <strong>New Planetary Improvements:</strong> During
      your explorations, you will uncover new and unique planetary improvements that

      new components work on your ship.  Work fast against your enemies - each of
      these ancient treasures is unique and you can only have one in a fleet at a
      time.</li></ul>
