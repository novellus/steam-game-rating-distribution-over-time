    review: "Jazz swings. And Absolute Jazz swings absolutely.\nBut on a more serious\
      \ note, HOLY PECK Gbone! My man! You have not only boosted the quality of the\
      \ music compared to the first game, but you have also somehow created a song\
      \ for EVERY UNIQUE ENCOUNTER! Sure, not every song is perfect or memorable,\
      \ but the ones that are? Whether it's the menacing oboes (I think they're oboes\
      \ anyway) of \"Betrayal\", the aptly named \"Ze Perfect Song\", the danger conveyed\
      \ in \"Brass Boss Starter Pack\" of, [spoiler]\"You are fighting 3 Shareholders\
      \ at once, boy are you going to get your head handed to you now!\"[/spoiler]\
      \ or just the sheer Mother 3 levels of absurdity in \"Pencil Gang,\" this soundtrack\
      \ is excellent. It also costs as much as, if not less than, a hamburger. That\
      \ also helps. \nIn the words of our wise salesman Jerome, \"YOU WONT REGRET\
      \ THIS!\""
