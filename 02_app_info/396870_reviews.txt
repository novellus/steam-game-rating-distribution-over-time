Beautiful and diverse scenery, pleasing musical score, complex story, and very challenging puzzles. This is a stand alone game. If you have played other Black Cube games by Simon Mesnard, you will have the added bonus of returning to familiar themes, objects, and characters.\n\nThe backstory is told through logs and video ransmissions. There is an incredible amount of creative detail woven into the story of the Black Cube universe, the adventures of Philip Forte, and the ARK. There are languages to decipher, numbering systems, machinery, energy sources, and teleportation... all laid out for you to explore at your own pace.\n\nThe game is built around a 'hub' from which you travel to 5 satellite moons, each with a unique environment and artistic style.\n\nThe 2018 \"Light\" version of Catyph has improved point and click navigation and some additional hints for the more complex puzzles. This was the version I played. The Steam timer is not implemented in this game so my actual time playing is not the .3 hours shown, but around 12 hours total.\n\nOne caveat - this game is not for those who like easy games. Black Cube puzzles are some of the most challenging I've encountered and require extensive note taking and (in some cases) a calculator. Puzzles are varied in form and always intriguing. I will admit that I did refer to the walk-through at the Black Cube site on several occasions. Not because I was stuck and needed  a solution. Instead, there were times when I needed more insight into the intent or mechanics of a specific puzzle.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this game and highly recommend it to players who enjoy stretching their brains and using critical thinking skills while exploring a very immersive landscape.","timestamp_created":1592799787,"timestamp_updated":1592799787,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.617287099361419678","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4//6Q7fICfOa5jwI="}
