In fact, it's the worst game ever and my words are wisely chosen. It's really bad. Like really, really, really bad, just worse. The developers failed at everything they coud poissibly have failed at and that's already understatement. \nThe point of my review is: I would need to invent a bunch of new words to review this \"game\", as none of the languages that currently exist on this planet offers a phrase which could even closely be an appropriate expression for the low quality of this waste and I am still polite calling this software-trash \"waste\". \nAs I said, to the fact that I am limited to nothing more than the human ability to paraphrase abstract conditions such as for example the unimaginable amount of bad properties of InsanZ, what I say as a nice and optimistic reviewer trying to see the best in every situation, there is no chance I could ever be able to tell you how bad that game is. \n\nI am honestly quite surprised that what I just said is a thing I would ever need to say. This game impressed me in a way no other did and no other will ever do. If the lack of anything possitive to say about it hadn't forced me to give up, I would still be fascinated by exactly these things mentioned. And that is honestly quite amazing. That's why this \"game\" needs to receive a thumb up... \n\nInsanZ is so bad that it's almost becoming good again, but it differs from all the other bad games by being even worse than the worst games ever. \n\nLet me try something different to give this review a point...\n\nI am pretty sure [strike]that it's more enjoyable to have a full minute slide down a gigantic cheese grater leading into an acid bath while being naked with your body lit on fire having your head stuck in an upside-down toilet bowl stuffed to the top with one week old human excrementory than to play this game[/strike] anyone would still refund InsanZ with the reason of beeing disappointed how bad it is to play if you got the price that was to pay added to your steam-wallet instead. During sale it was available for 2,19 $$, which is quite a bad joke by the developers, who are at least kind enough to add the DLCs for free when you purchase the \"Game of The Year (Edition)\" which is a bad joke as well. \n\nThese DLCs don't even change anything, one doesn't even have any files contained until you re-install them manually from your file browser, but well, at least they were free.\n\nIf you want to hear anything about the \"game\" itself, don't even bother. InsanZ offers nothing the store oage tells you, instead you will be punished with the worst designed game world ever, where no corridor can be determined as one. You will also get to see the ugliest copy-pasted textures ever, get to hear the most cancerous in-game \"soundeffects\" ever and you will witness the most random deaths in any video-game, ever. Well, there's more... Useless doors, sceletons with cakes as heads sitting on toilets, bugs without an ending, spelling mistakes, a \"game\" where the frame glitch during the broken eternal loading screen is the most entertaining feature and there is a glorious License Agreement where the developers proudly confess to have used the worst free game creation sotware they could possibly have used...\n\nNow please forget that InsanZ exists.\n\n[b]You have been warned![/b]","timestamp_created":1516729203,"timestamp_updated":1516826043,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":13,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537225723266601563","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p5T4lOECcLb1lgE="}
