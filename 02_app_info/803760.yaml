    review: so have played this game for a few hours and its pretty good :) takes
      a bit of getting used to but looking forward to future updates :), well worth
      the money the one thing i would like to see improved is the map as it confuses
      me and also whats the underworld haha. but honestly well worth the buy and glad
      i did
