      \ the iconic Layton Lake District. Now get ready to face nature\u2019s most\
      \ challenging conditions during a rare hunting expedition to Medved-Taiga National\
      \ Park. Inspired by the harsh, frozen landscape of Siberia, you\u2019ll traverse\
      \ the unforgiving tundra, enter into the drunken forests and venture out on\
      \ the frozen bay. Here, the weather can turn at an instant, leaving you swept\
      \ in whirling snow and surrounded by cracking ice.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">THE ANIMALS\

      \ /><br>Despite its grim appearance, Medved-Taiga National Park is bustling\
      \ with life. You will find prey like Musk Deer, Reindeer (also known as Caribou\
      \ in North America) and Wild Boar. But larger species also roam. The majestic\
      \ Moose travels these plains, as does the fierce Brown Bear. Perhaps most unique\

      \ /><br>The open world of Medved-Taiga National Park measures 25 square miles\
      \ (64 square kilometers), the same impressive size as Hirschfelden and Layton\
      \ Lake District. It features a brand new, exciting narrative with 32 missions,\
      \ 50 side missions and countless unique sights to discover. <br>You take the\
      \ role of an expert survivalist and hunter contracted to assist Alena Khasavovna\
      \ and her scientific expedition. In addition to being a highly-trained climatologist,\
      \ Alena hails from a reindeer herding people native to the region, offering\
      \ her a unique insight into its challenges. The expedition is off to a bad start,\
      \ and it's up to you to gather your group, help the locals and make sure everyone\
      \ gets through the expedition in one piece. But it won\u2019t be easy. Not everyone\

    review: "I\u2019m blown away by Medved-Taiga. I picked out this one expecting\
      \ to have some fun in a winter themed setting and play through maybe a quarter\
      \ of it before getting bored. I\u2019m not bored yet.\n\nThe mapmaking is absolutely\
      \ phenomenal. Even working within the constrained theme of a forest in winter,\
      \ almost every location feels unique. There are endless expanses of ice shelf,\
      \ a dramatic kilometer wide crater containing its own environment, kettle ponds\
      \ and frozen swamps that are all distinct from each other, and forgotten settlements\
      \ half reclaimed by nature. The changing light over the course of the in-game\
      \ day adds even more visual variety to the map than the other DLCs. This place\
      \ is a pleasure just to walk through.\n\nThe storytelling is unusually good.\
      \ The actress playing the DLC\u2019s expedition leader is wonderful. Her mixture\
      \ of friendly and sardonic commentary makes for a fun voice in your ear throughout\
      \ the main quests. The in-game lore flavor texts, side missions, and occasional\
      \ bits of human activity on the map are all written/designed in a way that really\
      \ do make the player feel like they\u2019re in a place at a forgotten corner\
      \ of the world with stories and culture all its own. You\u2019re one dot in\
      \ a continuum across thousands of years. Not many games pull such a feeling\
      \ of place off.\n\nOn the negative side of things, it\u2019s a shame that the\
      \ DLC doesn\u2019t include any new guns. The Mosin-Nagant from one of the weapons\
      \ pack is fun to bring to its native habitat. Including an SKS would have been\
      \ useful on the new smaller game animals and matched the theme nicely. There\
      \ are also some difficult photographic missions that may make you want to throw\
      \ your keyboard or controller against the wall.\n\nMedved-Taiga is definitely\
      \ worth picking up. I\u2019ll be sorry when I run out of side missions, but\
      \ expect I\u2019ll keep walking through its hills and tundra for a while. Play\
      \ on a winter\u2019s day after you\u2019ve walked along a real trail \u2013\
      \ and don\u2019t forget to open a window to let the cold in!\n"
