You hold the controller to your chest and a big floating ball floats in front of you inflating and deflating as you breath\n\nThat is all this game does.

Is that something that would make you be interested in checking out the app again?  What else would you like to see?  You might also check out the computer-guided breathing and the music in-app until we reach GA.\n\nBest,\n@owocki\n"}],"cursor":"AoJw0LfG3dgCfJejaw=="}
