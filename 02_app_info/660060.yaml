    review: "I picked up this DLC because it was on special, I had a few dollars of\
      \ spare cash and I really like pistols. In my opinion, World of Guns is useless\
      \ without at least one DLC pack - although theoretically you can unlock all\
      \ of these ten guns on your own without paying money, it would take you weeks\
      \ and weeks and weeks of playing time. \n\nHowever, do be aware that some of\
      \ the guns in this pack, like the Desert Eagle, can be unlocked by other packs,\
      \ and unlocking a gun for the second time is useless and you will have essentially\
      \ wasted your money.  This seems to be an issue with all of Word of Guns' DLC\
      \ and I find it pretty unfair. Don't buy the DLC via the Steam Window without\
      \ first checking in the game's own shop whether you have actually already got\
      \ the guns.\n\nBasically, a player has two options: he can download a single\
      \ DLC pack of his favourite weapons and forget about unlocking the others. Or,\
      \ he can purchase the Guns Full Access pack, which looks incredibly expensive\
      \ at first, but if he wants to unlock everything it will prove to be the best\
      \ value by a LOOOONG way. Especially when it is on special.\n\nIn short, I will\
      \ recommend this DLC, but only because it was on special and I like pistols.\
      \ The All Acess Pack would be better value for money in the long run, however."
