      or anything, but it's still something...<br><br>HUH!?? This place is NOT like
      what I'd imagined! My professor just gave me a couple of quick lectures - like
      some kind of in-game tutorial for noobs - and then ran off! Leaving ME to take
      care of his creepy-looking animals. Actually... I'm not even sure if these are
      even animals at all? Professor called them 'Fantamals'. Am I in some kind of
      Farm-sim Valley?<br><br>WHAT?! Someone stepped up to me while I was out shopping,
      and is challenging me to a Fantamal fight! He keeps his one in a weird bottle...<br><br>That's
      right - Professor gave me one of those bottles too when he gave me the Fantamal.
      Guess I should've paid attention during that tutorial instead of just clicking
      through...<br><br>Ok then - I Got It! Let's Fight!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>[Game
