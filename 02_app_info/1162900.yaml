    review: "Watch my video here https://youtu.be/QiTfCFgfe5I\nPlayed on the Rift\
      \ S. Steam version.\n\nGraphics are very nice with good amount of detail. I\
      \ like the textures used and I like the character models.\n\nAudio is OK. The\
      \ laser guns make the right sci-fi sounds, however this is one area that could\
      \ do with more love from the devs. Being hit by laser fire or a grenade is no\
      \ existence.\n\nGameplay is like a Overwatch like, but not as good or nice.\
      \ It's an arena shooter with 4 classes. Each class has it's own abilities. DPS,\
      \ tank and healer etc. It's alot of fun and require some good team work to win.\n\
      \nI did find some bugs playing on the Rift S. I got stuck in place for a bit,\
      \ it drifts left and right plus I lost tracking on the right controller. Playing\
      \ on the HP Reverb was fine minus the poor tracking of WMR. I had to use track-pad\
      \ on the HP Reverb, no options for thumbs-sticks. Also on the Rift S you had\
      \ to click in on the right stick to use snap turning and snap turning is my\
      \ only options as of making my video.\n\nOverall it is fun, but it needs to\
      \ fix the bugs and improve the audio. Also need to release of as many VR platform\
      \ as possible with crossplay. If the developers doe these I think this game\
      \ could be great. \n\n\n"
