    review: 'I like this game,I like the idea,I like the art(most of it),but the snow/rain
      are too much,you can''t see anything when it''s winter or raining,also,the font
      isn''t that great,but it''s readable,and another thing that isn''t that good,is
      the shortage of wood,maybe it''s just for me,I always have stone,but never wood,and
      if I want to buy it,just 10 pieces,ITS 1000$,it''s way to much,at least at the
      start of the game.These were my complaints,but the rest of the game is cool,I
      really like it,and hope the developer could fix,or make a setting where you
      can disable the snow/rain and change the font.


      EDIT:Forgot to say,THE MUSIC IS FRICKING SLAPPING,IT''S SO GOOD!'
