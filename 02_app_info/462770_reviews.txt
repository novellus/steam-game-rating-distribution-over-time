It's their specialty.\n\nHowever this game is basically a 3 vs. 3 colorful basketball game, with a graphic adventure (dialog, but no puzzles really) in between, then supposed choices and character development that don't seem to change anything much.\n\nGood: Distinct and unique Supergiant art through and through.\n\nBad: it's basically a basketball game with a lot of dialog between matches.\n\nBuy only if you don't get terribly bored with sport games.","timestamp_created":1610073771,"timestamp_updated":1610073771,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v4H47/YCcoe4wQI="}
