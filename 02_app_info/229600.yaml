    about_the_game: "Bient\xF4t l\u2019\xE9t\xE9 is a videogame for two players. Two\
      \ players who pretend to be lovers. They pretend to be lovers separated from\
      \ each other by lightyears of deep space. They have lonely walks along the shore\
      \ of a simulated ocean, thinking wistful thoughts of each other. Thoughts from\
      \ ancient Earth literature by Marguerite Duras.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe empty\
      \ beach, the strong wind, the gentle music and a small colony of electric seagulls\
      \ are their only companions. Yet their heart is full and their mind confused.\
      \ Walk along the shore, until they meet the emptiness.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n\
      When it all becomes too much, they run towards each other. Enabled by intergalactic\
      \ networks, they touch each other\u2019s holographic bodies in cyberspace. A\
      \ surreal game of chess becomes the apparatus through which they, man and woman,\
      \ can talk. The words they have were given to them, as they have always been\
      \ to lovers everywhere.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nThe sea remains, tugging at their\
      \ hearts when not at their hairs and clothes, as it itself is tugged by the\
      \ virtual moon. And as great as the desire for the other may be, they cannot\
      \ stay away from the wind and the waves and the sand. Every time they find a\
      \ new treasure. An abandoned tennis field. An heap of coal. A dead dog. Ordinary.\
      \ Absurd. Meaningless. Yet comforting.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nEnter a caf\xE9\
      , exit a villa, enter a casino, exit the ruin of an ancient colonial mansion.\
      \ We know this is not real. So it doesn\u2019t surprise us. Nothing surprises\
      \ us. It doesn\u2019t matter when you feel the pain of love. Of being in love,\
      \ of falling in love, of leaving in love. There is no such thing as time. There\
      \ is only love. And it never stops. No matter how much it hurts."
