SInce I did get a response I did decide to redownload and try again and after the update the problem was resolved and I was able to complete the game.In any case I will not be changing this review rating to be fair as I wouldn't hit the like button and recommend this game but it also wasn't horrible either 3.7/10.  if you want a quick mediocre low budget game with a bit of jump scares, and I did like the music then get it, but on sale. I would delete this but through this you do see developers care to improve, do...and with that eventually will make a better game given the budget, time and experience.\n\nOriginal post: Please do not buy this game as it is now.  I will probably be unable to refund this game as it's past two weeks and this is an unplayable game.  Let's call it level 4 with xyz rooms that you have to unlock....I fell through the floor repeatedly when trying to unlock door z...everytime you have to restart the level when this happens....so I am unable to continue because of this falling through multiple floor levels and it loading but not doing anything...DO NOT BUY THIS GAME it is a waste of your money.  I also had this problem when it pulled me out of the train as it blows up and died but that only happened once and it loaded me back on the train to retry.","timestamp_created":1595286459,"timestamp_updated":1595621808,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497925341129302979","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1595325499,"developer_response":"We are sorry to hear that, you are the first who noticed such a thing.\nThank you for the feedback, We checked it out immediately as soon as we saw your comment.\nThe game has updated and the bug should be fixed."}],"cursor":"AoJw+JKewfMCfonIlgI="}
