    review: '[i] My Experience [/i]


      When I first started the game, I was pleasantly surprised. It seemed to be a
      stable and cleverly-written RPG, with a mixture of absurdist humor and late
      stage capitalism that worked well for the experience.


      Outside of the dialogue, I was also amused by some of the actions I took in-game,
      from taking a company loyalty exam to brokering cat trades. I also found the
      process of discovering exactly what the "product" is to be an intriguing ride.


      However, there were a few gripes I had with the experience. On two occasions,
      I was unable to proceed because I refrained from picking a specific dialogue
      choice I wasn''t interested in. The main questline just paused until I selected
      the option that the developer had intended. This certainly conflicts with the
      idea of a game with "multiple endings and choices with consequences."


      Additionally, there is an idea that is mentioned multiple times in the game,
      that DLCs and microtransactions have become necessary due to the unfluctuating
      price of video games over the years. The game portrays this argument as almost
      factual, which I found rather distasteful. High profile publishers like Activision
      Blizzard continue to rake in record profits, even with the $60 price point.
      CEO Bobby Kotick''s compensation rose from 15 million in 2008 to 30 million
      in 2019, where he currently makes 319 times the average employee salary. The
      nonprofit As You Sow ranked Kotick 45th in a list of the 100 most overpaid CEOs
      in America.


      I am very much on the fence about whether to give the game a recommendation.
      I enjoyed the humor and some of its themes, but in retrospect I wish I would''ve
      spent my time playing something else.'
