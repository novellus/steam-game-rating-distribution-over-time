The basic gameplay is as expected:move right and shoot anything that moves and some things that don't. The weapon choice is nice because one can switch between different weapons mid-game. The difficulty ramps up well, but has the dark souls quality of no saves right in front of boss rooms and the knowledge that until you know every pattern you are going to be throwing lives at your problems. \n  The art style gives a hand-drawn look to a genre that I see more 8 or 16 bit games for. This can be fun at times and confusing at others. I'm not entirely sure what I destroyed in some levels but if my bullets collide I'm going to keep firing.\n The level design is fun in that it stays interesting and each level is given at least some context by the overall story. Also the bosses are well designed and fun to fight although the battles can run a bit long with most bosses having a fairly simple pattern.\n The music for this game is interesting and keeps pace with the gameplay. Sometimes it feels a bit overwhelming though when combined with the sound effects and the sound of my character's pained grunts after being hit. \n  I would recommend this game to those who enjoy a challenging shooter with an active developer who is concerned about the game even this far into the product's life-cycle. If you are anywhere near my skill level it will cost you fewer quarters on steam than it would've in an arcade.","timestamp_created":1545186234,"timestamp_updated":1574935584,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.420352280139923096","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0Lve2O4CcpvTtQE="}
