    review: "[b]DLC verdict: Get it on sale[/b]\n\n[b]Comment:[/b]\nThe fairy tale\
      \ atmosphere is what made the Trine games memorable and this is mainly because\
      \ of their soundtrack. Trine 3 has the shortest list (as the game itself is\
      \ rather short). All available in both .flac and .mp3 formats. So compared to\
      \ the other soundtracks in the series it is not worth the full price. Might\
      \ be worth it if you get it on a good sale. \n\n[b]P.S.:[/b] You can press Download\
      \ Album in the Soundtracks section of the library filter and then find it in\
      \ \"..\\Steam\\steamapps\\music\\Trine 3 Original Soundtrack\". Or in the game\
      \ directory if it downloaded with your game.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
