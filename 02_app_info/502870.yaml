      1941 to April 1942. The Battle of Moscow campaign takes place on a large-scale
      map (270 km x 290 km) (168 mi. x  180 mi.) with Autumn and Winter seasonal terrain.

      with their structures have been placed according to historical documents whenever
      such data was available. We analyzed air reconnaissance photos and personal
      photographs of the period to determine the typical airfield layout and their
      unique designs. As it was back then, there are concrete and unpaved landing
      strips, many being temporary grass strips with no other visible signs other

      Klin and Serpukhov are all part of the game space and they were made in great
      detail thanks to the new mapping technology. The cities and towns were created
      using WWII aerial imagery, so their layouts are correct for 1941.<br><br><ul

    review: "A pretty decent package that's worth picking up first if you're looking\
      \ for something to add on after the base game, especially since you get a bunch\
      \ of new aircraft you can use in the Stalingrad career as well.\n\nAs a particular\
      \ appeal for people that want to do a Soviet career as a fighter pilot that\
      \ isn't painful, the Mig-3 is surprisingly not as terrible as its reputation\
      \ might suggest. It's fast, has decent firepower and ammo, can actually climb\
      \ reasonably well and is fairly stable in a high yo-yo maneuver. Just don't\
      \ try out-turn a BF109 in it and like me you'll probably enjoy flying it far\
      \ more than the Yak-1 or Lagg-3. \n\nThe I-16 is alright, again, its more enjoyable\
      \ than the Yak/Lagg.  If you're curious about flying the P-40 though I'd say\
      \ pick up that DLC and this because the P-40 career for BoM is pretty decent\
      \ with few escort missions and the aircraft is pretty fun to learn. \n\nThere's\
      \ also another big German bomber in this DLC. Whats not to like?"
