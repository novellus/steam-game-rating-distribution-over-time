    review: "Part of me appreciates what this game wants to be. It straddles the line\
      \ between Zelda-style action and exploration and a surreal existentialist haze.\
      \ The problem I have with it, though, is that it's boring.\n\nI see plenty of\
      \ people praising this because it's like the classic Zelda. Except the original\
      \ Zelda had a ton of different items. It had money that you could use to buy\
      \ new equipment and supplies. It had a robust roster of enemies. It had catchy\
      \ music. It had fast-paced, challenging game play that was augmented by its\
      \ items and equipment. Anodyne has none of that. Was the original Zelda directionless?\
      \ Yes. Was it horribly vague at times, especially when it came to finding walls\
      \ to bomb? Yes. But there were so many resources back in the day to help you\
      \ out: Nintendo Power, unofficial strategy guides, tip lines: it was vague but\
      \ you could still beat it. And people tend to forget the reason so many of those\
      \ games from that era were so vague was due to the hardware limitations. \n\n\
      Anodyne, after two hours of playing, left me feeling like I was still waiting\
      \ for a game to begin. Screen after screen with nothing in it. Maze-like paths\
      \ that led to the same place. Bland environments. Enemies and puzzles that offered\
      \ no challenge. And man are the tonal shifts bad. Sometimes I could tell it\
      \ wanted to be like Earthbound with its bizarre humor. Then I travel through\
      \ a whirlpool formed by a man I killed into a bloodsoaked nightmare realm and\
      \ perform...an abortion? It was all over the place and it didnt create an engaging\
      \ experience.\n\nIf you want a Zelda-style action game, go play Hyper Light\
      \ Drifter. Go play 3D Dot Game Heroes. If you want an Earthbound or Undertale\
      \ clone, find something other than Anodyne. Its dreary and boring in an attempt\
      \ to come off as deep. But its just boring."
