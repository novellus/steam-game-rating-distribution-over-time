Never played it back then, but it features everything that made Sierra adventures so much fun to play.\n- great locations/atmosphere -> check\n- great storytelling -> check\n- great puzzles -> check\n- historical/educational background -> check\n- many dead ends -> check\n- multiple paths to complete the game -> nice... check\n- funny -> well it has its moments but the story is not about gags and humor.\n\nHowever this adventure might not appeal to everyone. Especially younger audiences that are not used to this kind of game mechanics (text parser, dead ends, no hint system, lots of trial and error) might find it hard to enjoy this game. You can get stuck a lot. Be patient and you will be rewarded or just use a walkthrough, but you will miss out a great part of the experience that made those games so great.\n\nThis is a little gem from the golden era of adventures. \n\nFor classic adventures fans it's worth more than the regular price. For adventure game fans in general, get in on sale.","timestamp_created":1559768018,"timestamp_updated":1598828206,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+8rloPQCe4rowgE="}
