    short_description: Help Dot the pig roll away from the evil wolf chef, thus ruining
      his dinner plans. Throughout the escape Dot will encounter various environments,
      from forests, snow mountains to sci-fi and even maybe a little trip to other
      worlds. Who knows. Maybe he's an astronaut pig. Maybe he's a super pig that
      can fly.
