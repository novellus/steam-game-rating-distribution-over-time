    review: 'This is a very well-done, clever and humorous exploration of the "worm"
      game design, extended to puzzle levels of increasing complexity, special features,
      and adding some physics & explosive-based challenges that made me feel extremely
      grateful that that I''m not a worm with no hands trying to maneuver explosives
      into good positions before they explode.


      It''s cool how, unlike traditional worm games, there''s a bit of physics going
      on rather than "the world is a grid", so the way your tail follows behind is
      a bit wobbly and may get caught on spikes your head passed, and there are cool
      and funny consequences such as eating the fruit that made me invulnerable for
      7 seconds and rushing through narrow passages thinking I''d be ok, but getting
      myself tied in a bit of a knot, and even though I partly survived, then still
      being tied in a knot. Very funny and interesting.


      There is good variety in the levels and the challenge level goes from relatively
      easy to tricky after 12-16 levels, then more tricky and difficult in different
      ways, becoming quite challenging. I''m currently stuck on level 25, which is
      going to require me to learn some new skills.


      Look at the video to see the type of game that it is, but if that''s a type
      you could like, I think you''ll like this as it is quite nicely done.'
