    review: "[i] My Experience [/i]\n\nEvery once in a while I'll take a chance on\
      \ something [b]very[/b] indie. Sometimes it pays off, and sometimes not. Time\
      \ Trouble falls into the latter category.\n\nAlthough the main character's movement\
      \ doesn't look great in the trailer, it feels terrible, most notably in strafing\
      \ and sprinting. \n\nDuring the FPS sections, it's difficult to tell that enemies\
      \ are approaching you, and where you're being shot from.\n\nThe game doesn't\
      \ tutorialize much, and you'll need to consult the menu often to take a look\
      \ at your controls. In both the second and third missions, I found a vitally-important\
      \ character command that should have been introduced when it became relevant\
      \ during gameplay.\n\nI think that this game may just need more polish and \"\
      time in the oven.\""
