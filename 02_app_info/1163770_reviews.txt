This DLC may seem like a way to earn more money, and in two ways it is, but the unexpected storyline really hooked me and tied up a lot of loose ends that I didn't even know where loose ends. This DLC also allowed the player to have a peek into what seems to be the appearance of \"The Town\", and its inner workings (or no-longer-workings). All in all, a great DLC for those who want a bit of lore.","timestamp_created":1609801093,"timestamp_updated":1609801093,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+Onn5/YCfcXEwAI="}
