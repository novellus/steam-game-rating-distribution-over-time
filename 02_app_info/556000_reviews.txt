Inexpensive and wanted to check it out.\n\n - Fantastic art style. The avatar in particular, a Dwarf whose entire body is basically his head, is adorable. It reminds me of the old \"Weeble\" toys from the 70's.\n - A nice dungeon feel with good music.\n\nHowever:\n\nGameplay is shallow; you use WASD to run through the dungeon, which is a single, procedurally generated level. Monsters appear; left click attacks, and right click blocks. There's a blocking animation, but no sense of contact or weight when you do block. Hitting the monsters does produce a sense of contact. They all die easily and you automatically pick up gold. When you get to the end of the level, you're healed to full, transported back to your home room, and get credit for the gold. There's a crafting station there where you can spend gold to upgrade your weapon damage, but nothing else. Then it's back into the dungeon for another short, random level.\n\n...and that's it. No real story. No exploring. No discovery.\n\nPerformance is fairly poor. I was not able to get the game playing full-screen, and I recommend you not change the default resolution, as you can get into a situation where the game won't start at all. There were noticeable framerate drops and video lag issues even with my fairly good hardware, though I didn't toy with the detail settings to try to improve this.\n\nAnyway, it's a shame this game was left to linger in such a basic state. It feels like a well-polished tech demo.","timestamp_created":1499038997,"timestamp_updated":1567830516,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkuT+hO0Ceui+fg=="}
