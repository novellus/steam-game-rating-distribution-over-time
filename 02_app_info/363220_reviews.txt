Like, if that old \"Super Mario Frustration\" ROM hack and Dark Souls had a baby on the Virtual Boy, it would be this. The game was originally made for a contest in which the theme was \"unforseen consequences,\" hence the recurring theme in the story and the tunnel vision. Controls are crisp, music is awesome, aesthetic is amazing, but only buy this game if you have a CRT that can withstand your fist. LCDs are out of the question, you'll break one on the third level. Do not use with a CRT that cannot withstand your fist; you will be horribly mamed by flying shards of glass.\n\nAnyway, ever get stuck on a level of a game like Donkey Kong Land and just have fits of rage after dying on the same level for months? This game summons the same amount of rage, but unlike DKL, it's not because of janky controls, confusing graphics, that horrible GameBoy screen, or a sadistic saving system. It's because each level requires a whole lot of trial, error, death, and inhuman precision. It's simultaneously beautiful and horrifying.","timestamp_created":1490813973,"timestamp_updated":1490813973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oP7bjdsCdMHIdQ=="}
