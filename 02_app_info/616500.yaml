    review: '[[i]Reverting this to a positive review; feedback that the original review
      was too dated seemed a fair point. Besides, some of the changes I disliked seemed
      to have been reverted or changed for the better. Leaving the original negative
      untouched below. I still dislike the overall UI changes, but at this point it
      shouldn''t be a deciding factor for anyone and they''re not going to change
      it.[/i]]


      Short and sweet of it is that Colony Wars is easily the best bang-for-the-buck
      cards expansion of Star Realms, it being a full-standing deck in and of itself.
      If you''re uncertain about which sets to grab, this should be the first on your
      list.


      [--original negative review--]


      Agh ... Colony Wars is a great set and I have no complaints with the cards,
      but ...


      Lots of baffling changes happening here with UI and matchmaking ... cards are
      now slanted in view (seems pointless in a setup with a screen), quick match
      times are whittled down from 3 minutes to 60 seconds (but with adding ~3s for
      each action taken) ... speeds up play at the start but when you hit late-game
      turns where you actually want to, you know, think about what you''re doing,
      it really is not enough time.


      You can''t even concede Realtime matches anymore. The developers making Dawn
      of War III scrambled when they realized they''d forgotten to implement a surrender
      function in that game (and rushed it out in the first patch), and here they''re
      actually taking this functionality away?


      I do really like star realms (have most of the physical cards) but I can''t
      recommend this digital version at all in its current state. Really hoping they
      revert some of the very poor design choices here.


      Quick look at changes both good and bad:

      + Finally a lot of new music

      + ''Play All'' feature speeds things up a lot early game

      + More cards, yay.

      - Unable to concede in Realtime matches. Forced to either watch someone slowly
      gloat their way through their last turn(s) in inevitable circumstances or just
      exit the game and wait for timeout before you can start a new one.

      - Realtime matches whittled down from 3 minutes to ''1 minute plus change'',
      realtime matches can feel very rushed, esp. in late game.

      ? Cards unnecessarily slanted. I mean you get used to it eventually but it feels
      really unnecessary, the original format was perfectly fine.'
