I expected to get bored immediately but I did not. The story isn't the best, but the animations make up for that. It's easy to follow along and the added interactivity adds to the fun. Even if you don't love reading, you could probably still enjoy this game.","timestamp_created":1587085050,"timestamp_updated":1608839296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwO6Sy/YCf7+tgQI="}
