    review: Deff worth the price ($9.99), it's a pretty entertaining emergency management
      sim placing you in control of various emergency units responding to random emergencies
      (police, fire, EMS, utility, etc) with many missions blending the required units
      (i.e a bomb goes off and you need police to arrest the bombers, ems to attend
      to the wounded, fire to put out the fires, utilities to move heavy debris).
      For under $10 you'll get several hours of entertainment, as I say, was more
      hours of fun for less cost than a movie.
