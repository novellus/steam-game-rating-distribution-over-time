    review: 'Game would not run on my laptop that runs most other games just fine
      had to switch to a different machine. Staff did not respond to my post asking
      for help getting to run


      The game is ridiculously on rails and most of your choices do not matter. It
      does a decent job setting up the atmosphere but the characters are generally
      flat and do not develop, most of the game is aimless faffing around. There''s
      one genuinely interesting plot twist but it comes up so later that it feels
      more like sequal bait than anything else.
