I found it difficult to even  get all the letters  dropped for my first few words before  my lives ran out due to constantly hitting the letters, which in this game you are not allowed to do.   \n\nThe premise of this game is to collect   letters from  the  side scrolling  onslaught of weird and wonderful monsters of which there are many varieties (including flying toasters, bloated boomers, velocicopter cats, mosquitomen and many other melded  mosters of   lore and imagination some of which I  could't even start to describe). If you hit the ground, get hit by a monster, or one of its projectiles you lose a life,  you also lose a life  if you shoot  one of your letters.  Those you  need to  collect  when they have scrolled  to the far left of the  playing field.    Once you've filled the grid at the bottom you have to rearrange the letters  into the  correct word  using a combination of the x key and the left and right arrow keys within a specific time.  Once all of the letters have been collected you are on a timer to complete the correct word. While trying to rearrange the word, monsters continue their onslaught, so you also need to ensure you  avoid  incoming  monsters and their   weapons fire. \n\nTrying to  concentrate on  rearranging the letters into the correct word in the time you have available before the  timer bar  is empty  and at the same time avoiding the projectiles and monsters is quite difficult, especially for us males  who can usually only concentrate on one thing at a time. ;)   If you succeed in completing the word  in the alloted time you will earn a power-up such as an extra life or a shield that once activated lasts for 20 seconds;  create the wrong word or  fail to   make the word in time  means no power-up  which makes it much  harder to survive the level, which is as expected   the  dreaded boss battle.  If you fail to kill the  boss you start all over again, though you can add your name to the score board.    The only  positive  if you do fail is that   levels appear to be randomly generated, so  you won't see the same combination of monsters attacking you at each try. Level backgrounds change from level to level.\n\nYou only need to remember   seven keys to play this game,  enter, Z,  all four arrow keys and the X key, all of which are explained in the brief tutorial, which on starting the game for the first time you are forced to endure.  \n\n\n[u][b]Positives:[/b][/u]\n\nExcellent graphics and a fantastic variety of monsters. The ability to earn power-ups if you complete the  word game before the timer  bar runs out and  the randomly generated levels. Finally, you really can't beat the release  price which, with no discount was  only £0.79/$0.99/E0.99/C$1.09  Of the four, Canada is significantly cheaper and is equivalet to £0.58 at present exchange rates.  You can use either keyboard or controller.\n\n[u][b]Negatives:[/b][/u]\n\nYour ship can only move up or down, unfortunately there is no sideways  movement, which in my opinion would have made this a better   'but slightly easier' game, there are only two music scores; a rock  track  when  playing the main  game and  a hip hop track when fighting the boss, both of which really don't fit the game and became annoying after hearing the same two tracks constanly  over the time I played the game. Finally I would make the tutorial voluntary rather than forcing   the player to play through  it  before starting the game proper. Can't save progress.\n\n[u][b]How could the game be improved?[/b][/u]\n\nInclude  forward and backwards movement, add a greater variety of appropriate music  and include the ability to add your own music.   Enable players  to save progress, or at least  continue from the level they died on rather than  have to start from the beginning again (that said, the randomness of the  levels does counter this suggestion somewhat).  Also   add more power-ups and include   different levels of  game play, i.e. novice,  average  and expert players.  \n\n[u][b]Video:[/b][/u]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N6iyfzCpj8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrv4jwaUQyo\n\n\n\n\n[u][b]Conclusion:[/b][/u]\n\nDespite the horrid soundtrack, (the rock  music was okay, but  hearing it over and over  for a couple of hours really got on my nerves, the hip hop just didn't fit the game at all) and the  lack of forwards and backwards movement,   I quite enjoyed this game and would recommend it to anyone into side scrolling shooters. It was an odd combination; i.e.  a side scolling shooter melded with a word game but it did work for me despite   finding it really difficult to progress further than three or four levels at a time due to  the difficulty level.  Pity  progress couldn't be saved, or when  you lost all of your lives be able to restart  from the level you  finished on. That said, therir didn't seem to be a definite level progression in this game.  High scores  and beating  previous scores are the main reward in this low cost game.","timestamp_created":1459472687,"timestamp_updated":1459473342,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.573792874813079834","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw4/vY59MCdK7JVA=="}
