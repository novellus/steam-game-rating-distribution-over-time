    review: 'It''s not ''bad''. It looks quite polished. The environment is nice,
      it has music, and it actually uses a recent version of UE4. It would have been
      nice to be able to locomote and view the environment that otherwise is wasted.
      [b]This office looks nice.[/b]


      I still want all these little VR apps on steam, no matter how insignificant.
      It just sucks that we can''t ''stream'' or otherwise combine all these little
      VR experiences into ''locations'' in the metaverse. At the moment, they are
      all just separate steam apps, that you have to download and install in the clunky
      fashion inherent to computer gaming for decades. You know what I mean?


      Anywho, I''m still appreciative of something like this. I can make a video for
      it, take screenshots, etc. In this way I can indulge my the OCD related to Steam
      collection that has (more or less) ruined my life. Another benefit at the present
      time, is that I can feel alright leaving a negative review, which will balance
      out my collection of reviews that is largely positive. Crass, I know. [spoiler]Sorry
      friend, I liked ''Keep Balance VR'', and will +rep you on that shortly.[/spoiler]
