Do not expect revolutionary mechanics.\nI used to play this on an ATARI and I love the experience of the retro mode.\n\nThe modern mode adds side-scrolling which makes the game less static. There is no vertical scroll for some reason. \nThe spider enemy looks terrifying, the skull is neat and the snake is ok. The player character is awful and breaks the experience. You really can't put this into a game in year 2020.\n\nThe retro mode has some interesting differences from the original version. In the 1983 original there was some clipping so that a small part of the character model could be inside the chain without this resulting in death. The hitbox has been corrected in this version, however. Also there appear to be been some additions that I have not completely reviewed yet.\n\nOverall, I am happy to own this version of the game.","timestamp_created":1609005491,"timestamp_updated":1609005491,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533634781837463379","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s+yM0PYCc5W7vQI="}
