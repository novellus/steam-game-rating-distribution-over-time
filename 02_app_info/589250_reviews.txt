I was bored after about a solid 10 minutes of playing. The \"enemies.\" You can fight are limited to only one type and are only in a single part of the map. Speaking of the map, it looks like the devs got a template of a city done and just stopped. There are no details, it's really small with little to no reason to explore it. I absolutely do not suggest you buy this game, I looked at a couple other super power simulator vr games and they were far better than this.","timestamp_created":1606071540,"timestamp_updated":1606071540,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1608396434,"developer_response":"Thank you for your feedback. I'm sorry you had a bad experience with PowersVR. In case you haven't refunded the game I wanted to let you know that there are currently four enemy types throughout the city, typically located in different parts of it.\n\nI realize that detail in the city is fairly lacking, however as a single developer I had to prioritize either a smaller detailed environment or a larger one which better allows for usage of movement abilities.\n\nI'll try to improve on some of the areas you've mentioned in future updates."}],"cursor":"AoJwktvU+PUCc8L3rwI="}
