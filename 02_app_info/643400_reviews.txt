It's not necessary to watch Selector WiXoss, as only one minor character makes a reappearance, and much of the setting is different.\n\nOverall, this one is a lot more grim compared to Selector. If Selector WiXoss is Yu Gi Oh meets Madoka, Lostorage is Yu Gi Oh meets MahoIku with a dash of Daybreak Illusion.\n\nI should note that despite the comparison to Yu Gi Oh, there's actually very little in terms of fleshing out the card battles. Most of the cards aren't shown, and never explained, and whole battles are commonly skipped. The rules aren't really fleshed out either, and at some point the rules are quite blatantly thrown out the window for action factor, so it wouldn't matter anyway. It follows card game rules roughly to the extent that most stuck-in-MMO series follow actual MMO rules.\n\nOverall, I wasn't entirely sure if to recommend this series or not. It's... not bad. Not particularly good, either. It's very far from a must-watch. I'd have a much easier time recommending Selector. But it is well drawn, and has decent writing.","timestamp_created":1509976429,"timestamp_updated":1509976429,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nPrmyN8CcLjHigE="}
