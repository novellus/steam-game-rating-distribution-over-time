    about_the_game: '<i>Missileman Origins</i> is a retro-esque action-platformer
      set in a world where robots and humans co-exist as civilians. Missileman himself
      is a humble bot that wishes he could, one day, become a hero. He knows he has
      the potential to be one, but it''s never fully realized just how capable he
      would be. His father, Dr. James Qworp, is one among a few scientists to bring
      together a particular group of robots (Missileman included) to set up the first
      ever <i>school</i> for them! Things don''t quite go as planned, as chaos occurs
      when both the scientists and bots least expect it. Could Missileman be the one
      to keep things under control and find out where evil is being generated?<br><br>The
      gameplay itself consists of running, jumping, and shooting, as well as whatever
      else would occur throughout the game''s levels. <br>And when the game doesn''t
      focus on the action and gameplay, it will bring various characters and personality
      to the spotlight with dialogue exchanges and cutscenes all utilizing text boxes.
      There will be six levels, each with a solid length, variety (as well as the
      in-game ABSO Robo High school to explore) and many other surprises! <br><br>-SIX
      WIDE, ACTION-PACKED LEVELS AND BOSSES!!<br>-INTERACT WITH OTHER CHARACTERS AND
      OBJECTS!!<br>-EXPLORE AND FIND HIDDEN SECRETS!!<br>-ONLY <strong>$1.99</strong>
      - TRADING CARDS AND OTHER COMMUNITY ITEMS INCLUDED!!<br><br>Note: If you use
      gaming controllers, it is recommended to use a program (such as Joy-to-Key)
      to manually configure support for this game.'
