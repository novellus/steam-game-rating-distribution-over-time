    short_description: Do you like a cheap chuckle? The objective of the game is fairly
      straight forward - trolls will spawn in increasing numbers and rush towards
      you. Your job is to click on their heads. If you do that, you progress. If you
      don't, you lose the game when they touch you.

    review: Greatest game of 2020! Worth $20? Probably not. If you can grab it for
      $0.99, definitely worth it and grab a few extra copies for your friends for
      the sweet action multiplayer mode!
