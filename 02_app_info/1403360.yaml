    about_the_game: "S H R i M P is a third person platformer where you play as a\
      \ Shrimp set in a world of abstract darkness. You take on the mantle of completing\
      \ a ritual that had been abandoned. Only the first step is clear of this ritual\
      \ which is to collect all the cars. During this journey of collecting cars on\
      \ levels you come across horrific entities roaming around trying to prevent\
      \ you from completing the ritual. You cannot fight back or engage into combat.\
      \ Best you can do is use your abilities to escape from the entities or calm\
      \ the Shrimp from gaining too much anxiety. Will you be able to complete the\
      \ ritual? Are you brave enough to persevere till the end in this forsaken world?<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>demo:</strong> </h2>The demo contains level one,\
      \ level four, and level seven. Each level offers something different for you\
      \ to endure. The demo even includes difficulties to choose from, cosmetics to\
      \ unlock and a few secrets. There are bugs within this demo. The demo is a cloned\
      \ version of the original project. Cloning the project created weird errors\
      \ that took weeks for me to fix up. I made specific changes to the demo project\
      \ that aren\u2019t in the final. To my dismay the contrast/gamma sliders do\
      \ not work despite the work arounds I have done. In the OG version this works\
      \ just fine. Hopefully you\u2019ll enjoy the demo!"
