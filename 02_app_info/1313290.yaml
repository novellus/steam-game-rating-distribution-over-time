      pocket a big part of the traders'' coin - via tolls!<br><br><br><strong>Note:

    short_description: You, the king, need to construct flourishing towns and ensure
      steady supply and demand of their goods! By doing that, you attract cunning
      tradesmen to trade between your settlements and - in turn - pay a decent amount
      of customs to you! Just make sure that none of your citizens starve to death.
