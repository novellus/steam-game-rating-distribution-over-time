Characters are genuinely funny and levels are structured better than the main game. There's never a dull moment, the game gives you a variety of different scenarios to play through. Pretty much the only bad thing about this DLC are the lengthy and frequent load times.","timestamp_created":1592176470,"timestamp_updated":1592176470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/5zH2vICcKWLjgI="}
