The basic concept is challenging and enjoyable.\n\nYet this might be the most critical I'll ever be toward a game that I still really like and would recommend.\n\n1. The main criticism is that there's no real sense of progression. The game does keep track of how many levels you've completed, and after a certain number, new concepts are introduced (like the grey areas in which your boosters don't work anymore), but every level is procedurally generated, so you never feel like you've completed a task to be checked off. You just move on to another procedurally-generated level. It kind of leaves you empty. There's also no time-trials or anything either.\n\n[UPDATE (12/23): After completing 100+ levels, I'm not really bothered anymore by the things I mentioned in the previous paragraph. There's some thrill in never knowing what you're going to get next, and I enjoy seeing the number of completed stages keep going up and up (presumably infinitely, lol).]\n\n2. The procedural generation often doesn't make a lot of sense. I regularly experienced stages where it was a straight shot from platform to platform, and the \"obstacles\" were nowhere near being in my way.\n\n[UPDATE (12/23): This is still true, but I also periodically get stages that truly do feel impossible at first. I even start to wonder if the game accidentally created an unbeatable stage. And it's satisfying when I figure out a way to beat them after all.]\n\n3. The sound is pretty bad. The only sound you hear is the jet-boosting of the ship, which literally sounds like television static.\n\nBut other than these things, great little game! :)","timestamp_created":1511554037,"timestamp_updated":1514046858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547168493270874023","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsbSOwuACd97ZjgE="}
