    review: 'Ooookay... so, as I saw no video record of this game, and because the
      atmosphere seemed interesting, and because there was no precise review of it
      ; I opened the way and goes as a scout.


      Aaaaand... this is full crap.

      The game is clearly not finished and of course will never be. It is a training
      project that the dev decided to sale. Well... I HOPE he considers it as a training
      project and not as his masterpiece.


      First it is very dark, so dark that you barely can see the floor, your character
      while moving or the enemy.

      There is no sound and no music, only a sound of a light breeze. Noting. More.

      The level design is terrible. Absolutely terrible. One of the worst I ever saw.
      For example a closed door at the end of a loooong path. And the lever to open
      it at the start of this looooooooooong path.

      Textures are horribles.

      There are bugs. Plenty of bugs. Such as dialogue that don''t start despite of
      me hurting the key E, such as enemies that stop having a hitbox, such as infinite
      fall from a pit. And crashes, of course.


      Of course, dear dev, you have right to do mistakes because this is the way everybody
      learn. But, please, DON''T SELL your mistakes.


      Nasty review for a nasty game.'
