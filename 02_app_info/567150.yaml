    review: 'I wanted to play such a game and such a game I got.  It''s actually...
      fun.  I like finding the right places to stick puzzle pieces into.  There are
      different images, coupled with a theme and even music/SFX to give you something
      else to enjoy.  Puzzles are not just all the same and the time limit is more
      than fair for a challenge.  There is a hint button, which recharges or you can
      pay for it to hurry up and also if you need extra +30 Seconds?  You get that
      as well... but only once.


      So is the game perfect?  Is anything ever is?  The game... Let''s just say you
      CAN''T play the last level.  At all.  I got stuck on my "Magician" title for
      300 out of 200.  So no last level... Unless you grind nearly 200K coins.  So
      it is doable, but if you tried hard to earn three keys per level, the title
      should be just given to you.  Oh and at times... One of the keys disappeared
      and it says you made a mistake, even though you never did.  That error is especially
      big around level 98... But after a few tries, you can actually get it complete.


      Should you play it?  Well, why not?  I got 11+ Hours out of it, even though
      I never saw the last few levels.  That''s still pretty good!  So if ya like
      it, you can try it... Your choice.


      Thank you for the fun puzzle game!  Hopefully one day the title for "Magister"
      bug will be fixed and I can come back and finish the game.  Thank you! :) :>
