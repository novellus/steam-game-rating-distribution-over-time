    review: 'I had a few different updates to my old review, but I decided to just
      rewrite the whole thing.


      It''s an old game with good graphics, quality music, and a very fast-paced/fun
      gameplay loop, but the gameplay loop becomes pretty unbalanced once you approach
      the end game.


      The end goal for this game is to get a billion of the in game currency. You
      can accomplish that in 2 ways - trading goods in the marketplace, or collecting
      bounties on pirates. The game doesn''t really care which you choose, and you''re
      not locked in to either pathway either - you could do both (simultaneously)
      if you want to.


      Me personally, I found the trading to be boring. It''s more or the less the
      same mechanic you find in other RPG''s, but with less polish. Fair enough, this
      game is significantly older than most of these RPG''s I''m talking about, but
      it doesn''t change how I feel about it. The trading game loop is as follows
      - sail to a town, see their prices, consider whether to buy or sell, then go
      to the next town and repeat. Not my cup of tea, but it works as far as I can
      see.


      Instead, I chose to play as solely a bounty hunter. The gameloop is as follows.


      * Accept a bounty request for a specific pirate (you may run into other pirates
      besides your bounty)

      * Find the bounty pirate by travelling between the towns they were last seen
      in

      * Beat the bounty pirate

      * Make it home alive to accept your bounty

      * Repair your ships and buy whatever upgrades you can afford


      In my old review, I said this loop was fun, but a little chance based. I now
      have to rescind that statement - once you get more than 100 million of the in-game
      currency, bounties become EXTREMELY chance based. Basically, if one of the locations
      that the pirate is traveling between doesn''t have a ship repair shop, then
      it becomes borderline impossible to fight them and survive. Let''s say you travel
      to location A that does not have a repair shop. You find and beat the pirate
      along the way, but you are at very low health when you arrive at location A.
      You now have to go to location B (to repair your ships at B''s repair shop)
      and pray that you don''t run into any pirates on the way. And there''s no definitive
      way to avoid them - the game just rolls the dice and decides whether or not
      to have a pirate encounter. So like I said, chance based. Save-scumming will
      be a necessary tactic in your arsenal.


      One other flaw I should point out - late game means that there will be a LOT
      of enemies on the screen. There may be so many that the marker that identifies
      them (and allows you to choose which enemy to attack) might be covered up by
      other enemies. As a result, it becomes a literal pixel hunt if you still want
      to strategize on which opponents to target. Me personally, I just gave up and
      clicked fire all. Trying to click on individual pixels just drags fights on,
      so it''s not worth the effort anymore. Thankfully, my fleet is strong enough
      that I can afford to just click fight all.


      But all that said, you can sort of deal with all of the above by just running
      from all fights except for your bounty. Annoyingly enough though, the only time
      the game encourages you to flee is in the beginning where fleeing would actually
      be a bad idea. I guess once you get a fleet of strong ships, you are able to
      flee much easier. Regardless, fleeing isn''t that much fun, and ironicallu,
      fleeing is ALSO chance based.


      Still, if you limit your travel to locations that DO have boat repair shops,
      you will eventually reach your goal. Thanks to the flee option, battles don''t
      have to be slow. And when I say slow, I mean compared to the pace before reaching
      100 million in-game currency. This game is actually incredibly fast-paced. I
      can accept, capture, and cash in about 1 or 2 whole bounties in under a minute.
      Currently at 200 million, and each bounty is usually worth a 100 thousand minimum.
      At this point I''ve got an hour or 2 of playtime left until I win. That said,
      it has started to become repetitive.


      All in all, it''s a matter of whether or not you care about the above mentioned
      flaws. I bought this game as a package bundle, so 3 games total for $4.99. In
      that respect, I would recommend it, but for anything more expensive, just don''t
      bother. Plus, if anything I criticized above is something that would bother
      you, then definitely don''t buy this, since the game kind of revolves around
      these mechanics. But I''m dealing with it well enough because the game is surprisingly
      fast paced, so you can approach end game rather quickly. Frankly, if it wasn''t
      for the speed of this game, I would have dropped it once things got unbalanced.'
