    review: "    I bought this game for full price at 4.99 USD. It takes less then\
      \ an hour to finish, maybe a bit more if you are working towards 100 percenting\
      \ this gem. It features a tutorial, a collection of 4 themed worlds, a few weapons\
      \ with upgrades for each and 4 different and unique bosses. The games plays\
      \ rather simply with your standard fair of WASD and mouse or full controller\
      \ support.\n    I was warned as I started that I would encounter many bugs,\
      \ glitches, and an impassible crash on the second worlds boss. I'm glad to say\
      \ I encountered no bugs, save for breaking the magical book weapon post game.\
      \ It runs smooth and has a certain level of charm. Everything you fight is a\
      \ pot including bosses, the merchant the big bad, and even yourself. I can say\
      \ I had fun, even if I had wished the game was juicier and plump with more content.\n\
      \    In the end, you can tell there was effort. In a Steam full of asset flips\
      \ and big titty flops there was a degree of work put into this game. Even with\
      \ this review (and this game even being bought for that matter) are being done\
      \ only as a meme, I can't say it wasn't worth it. Over all I can without a doubt\
      \ give this game 5 Depressed Developers out of 5."
