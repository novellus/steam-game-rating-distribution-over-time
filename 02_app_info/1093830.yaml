      /><br><br>Kotachi received a pair of white revolvers after his grandfather died,
      forged from the constellation Perseus. His weapons target specters, shadow monsters
      that invisibly attack people... and the Zodiac. As one of the few who can, it's
      up to Kotachi to both protect these constellations and use their powers in battle
      to keep everyone safe.<br><br><i>Asterism</i> at its heart is a story-heavy
      turn based RPG inspired by astronomy elements, namely the constellations that
      make up our sky- especially the Zodiac. It can be played in either the base
      game, an RPG with battles and exploration with visual novel style dialogue,
      or as a pure visual novel with choices rather than walking around. Choices accompany
      many of the dialogue menus in both play styles, and can determine how side characters
      end up by the end of the story- including an optional male love interest.<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><ul
