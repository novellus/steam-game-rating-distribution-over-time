    reviews: "\u201CI could not stop playing Rave Heart AT ALL. It was late and I\
      \ was tired, and I told myself that after this scene I would save and go to\
      \ bed, but each scene kept me wanting to play more and eventually I reached\
      \ the end of the demo after about three hours of game play. Ordinarily I wouldn't\
      \ rate a commercial demo, but Rave Heart has enough content to rival many of\
      \ the games here and I enjoyed every bit of it. I highly recommend downloading\
      \ and playing this demo RIGHT NOW.\u201D<br>4.5 Stars \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://rpgmaker.net/games/10335/reviews/6027/\"\

      Overall, this was a very nice demo that I enjoyed playing, and it painted a\
      \ very colorful and interesting universe with many diverse alien races and worlds\
      \ to uncover. It was a bit cheesy sometimes, but the story and characters were\
      \ quite charming, and leaves you wanting to find out more about everything going\
      \ on. I look forward to seeing the finished game, and recommend others to give\
      \ this demo a try as well!\u201D<br>N/A (As he played an early demo) \u2013\
