Controls feel clunky, viewing angles feel unnecessarily restrictive given the core gameplay demands that you look in every direction, gravity switching rotates your viewpoint making it difficult to react quickly... the narrative is barely there, and generally feels more distracting than interesting. The sound design is all a bit uncomfortably tinny.  The visuals are ugly and uncommunicative.  \n\nEven as a lover of first person puzzle games and high concept / low production value indie auteur pieces like this, I was unable to wring any enjoyment out of this piece.  I could sense that some real passion went into this, but I don't think it was enough to carry the project anywhere interesting.","timestamp_created":1554227707,"timestamp_updated":1554227707,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547090888023376465","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x5fM7+kCcLS0vgE="}
