    review: "Quoi de plus ennuyeux que les oc\xE9ans dans un 4X de type \"terrestre\"\
      \ ? Il faut bien avouer que g\xE9n\xE9ralement hormis la fronti\xE8re naturelle\
      \ entre continents, les oc\xE9ans sont souvent inexploit\xE9s dans ce type de\
      \ jeu.\nAmplitude Studios a trouv\xE9 une brillante id\xE9e : des usines - vestiges\
      \ - forteresses oc\xE9aniques dont le contr\xF4le peut influer nettement sur\
      \ les parties au point d'\xEAtre un enjeux qui m\xE9rite que l'on s'y attarde.\
      \ Monstre marin, m\xE9t\xE9o, civilisation mineure de gardiens d\xE9di\xE9e\
      \ tout y est pour rendre ces \"nouvelles\" zones int\xE9ressantes.\n\nEt bien\
      \ s\xFBr la civilisation d\xE9di\xE9e : Morgwar qui m\xEAme pour un jeu Endless\
      \ est sans doute l'une des factions les plus bizarres que j'aie pu voir. (Sur)Puissant\
      \ sur l'oc\xE9an, m\xE9diocre sur terre (renfor\xE7ant l'int\xE9r\xEAt des factions\
      \ assimil\xE9es) et avec un pouvoir global tr\xE8s amusant \xE0 utiliser pour\
      \ qui aime jouer des sales coup diplomatiques, Morgwar propose une fa\xE7on\
      \ d'aborder le jeu originale."
