    about_the_game: "Atlantia is 3D animation software which allows untrained artists\
      \ to easily and quickly make animated movies. It works at a very high level\
      \ of abstraction so users can issue &quot;walk here&quot; or &quot;say this&quot;\
      \ style commands. Users can then spend most of their time focusing on the story,\
      \ instead of the tedious aspects of animation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe software\
      \ includes a growing library of built-in objects and animations. There are text-to-speech\
      \ capabilities so that users can quickly write dialogue and automate lip-syncing.\
      \ A custom, high performance inverse kinematics system helps automatically generate\
      \ dynamic animations and pose characters. The terrain and sky can be easily\
      \ edited to support many different environments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll of these\
      \ things together make it very fun and easy for an average user to make high\
      \ quality animations. Please give it a try!"

    review: 'I love this because it is easy to use

      easy to make animation for people (walking and other)

      I think if add more things,  objects, functions then it will be good easy animation
