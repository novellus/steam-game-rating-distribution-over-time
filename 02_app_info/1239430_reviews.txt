Its name is now ironically its player count\nThere were no hidden gems here, last time I played the game had some real problems running on an ultrawide resolution and as I'd gone over 2 hours steam wouldn't refund (despite me showing proof the game wouldn't run properly for me and that the games support had no real answers). Probably the only game I have ever actually regretted buying. Its a shame, the team videos I saw made them look like a nice enough bunch of people.\n\nPopulation Zero isn't really ground breaking with regards to in game mechanics. It's a survival game that is far more basic with regards to building and survival than say, Ark, Conan Exiles or even FO76. It feels a bit clunky control wise compared to AAA games.\n\nIt's buggy, not feature complete by a long shot. Its a multiplayer game that released without a way to join your friends in game. The servers also seem to have a little meltdown every now and then. But hey that's early access games all over and if you buy into EA you should know by now what you're getting yourself in for.\n\nWhat it does has this cool hook with the seven day reset, I think its a really neat idea and it sets it apart from other games of this genre. Its visually pleasing and it does posses a certain charm.\n\nIf you like games like this, I think you'll enjoy Population Zero. I'm not going to go so far as to recommend the game in its current state and only say you should buy it if you can cope with a far from finished product (even possibly by EA standards) but I 100% think you should stick it on your wishlist or follow to see how it improves over time. I am hoping theres a real hidden gem in here.","timestamp_created":1588886517,"timestamp_updated":1610061727,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1592158142,"developer_response":"Hi, Greg!
