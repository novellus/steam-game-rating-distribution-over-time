There is no overall story, just you press new game and off you go. and just like i said before its pretty easy to pick up especially if you are into such retro looking titles that look like they came straight out of the game boy but if you are expecting an easy time just cause it looks like a gameboy game you will be disappointed as even though this game is easy to pick up actually getting far in the game will take some skill and also the sacrifice of your first born to the RNG gods because even though you start with 6 random characters your overall stats and skills will be different each play though and some runs you will do a little better then others, but if you don't let that bother you then you will enjoy this game.","timestamp_created":1604723103,"timestamp_updated":1604723103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40eq80PUCcvLprAI="}
