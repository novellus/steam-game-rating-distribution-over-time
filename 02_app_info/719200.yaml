      either dug under, built over, or destroyed by players. The wall, combined with

      combat of E-Sports FPS games, the long-term, economy-based strategy of RTS games,

    review: i used to play this game every now and then back when it was still supported
      and loved it then and ive tried playing it for several months basically most
      of 2020 and still its not got any servers up so..assuming the game is now dead
      i wish they kept the servers up for the few of us who still enjoyed the game.
      (Also i played it on a different steam account thats why i have so little hours)
