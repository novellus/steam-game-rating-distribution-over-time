    about_the_game: "This is a game for physics lovers and history lovers. Its UI\
      \ menu interface reflected its own scientific attributes: planets moving on\
      \ the curvature of space-time caused by gravitational fields. <br />\r\nThen\
      \ you can choose a star/planet, such as the Moon or the Mars, for a landing-on\
      \ adventure on an expedition rover, or you can navigate the space from the perspective\
      \ of a spacecraft.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut if you think this game is just such\
      \ a space simulator, then you underestimate it. The aforementioned contents\
      \ are only 5% of the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn fact, this game has very rich\
      \ time and space travel and space exploration functions, and it has great fun:\
      \ <br />\r\nYou can drive a spaceship, explore different kinds of extraterrestrial\
      \ planets, and in a far away galaxy called Magda Nebula, you will fight the\
      \ alien fleet and experience the space battle described in the 'Independence\
      \ Day' movie. <br />\r\nYou can command a submarine, to explore the underwater\
      \ world, and to seek for the lost Atlantis. <br />\r\nYou can also build your\
      \ own world, in the center of the earth, like many Minecraft-like voxel games,\
      \ you will create a paradise of Verne fantasy. <br />\r\nYou can also decrypt\
      \ the secrets of the Relativity, and observe the world seen by a traveler riding\
      \ a photon by flying at 90% speed of light. <br />\r\nYou can also travel through\
      \ wormholes, and come to some lost historical periods: Ancient Rome, Ancient\
      \ Egypt, Medieval Dark Ages, etc., and to defend their civilization with your\
      \ fighting system.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is not a prefect game yet, but this\
      \ is our endeavor to introduce real physics into games."
