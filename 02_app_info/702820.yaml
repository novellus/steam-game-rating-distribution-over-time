    review: "All in all a very good game, especially for its price.\nYou basically\
      \ play a big campaign within a world that seems to be far bigger than what you\
      \ see. And even if there aren\u2018t a lot of areas, there\u2018s much to see\
      \ and you are getting rewarded for exploring.\nYou play 6 different characters,\
      \ which you can interchange within battle. Every characters has a unique set\
      \ of skills, while there\u2018s still room for customization by using scrolls,\
      \ that give them additional skills or attributes. You find the scrolls by exploring\
      \ or doing side-quests.\nAs the description says, there are no usable items\
      \ within battle, so you have to rely on tatics and use the skills of your characters.\
      \ This is done really well and makes you to learn about your characters skills\
      \ and how to use them properly.\nThe developer is very responsive and seems\
      \ to put a lot of passion in his work. There were some minor points that disturbed\
      \ me about his game, and he was very accessible to critisism. I'm looking forward\
      \ to see more of his work.\nIf you are a fan of RPGs with turn-based combat,\
      \ i can really recommend this game. I spent about 20 hours, never got bored\
      \ and still miss one achievement that I\u2018m willing to find.\nTherefore,\
      \ if you like the genre, I can whole-heartedly recommend it."
