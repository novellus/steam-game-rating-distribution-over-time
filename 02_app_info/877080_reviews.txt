I'm enjoying this game so far, and for the sale price I bought it at (thanks to those that lowered it for a time). This game actually reminds me of Genesia, the art style is very much the same which I like very much. The graphics and tiles mesh very well. \n\n","timestamp_created":1609373555,"timestamp_updated":1609373555,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k/OI2/YCcvT4vgI="}
