      notes: While Golden Treasure does not contain any explicit imagery, it does
        include references to the natural processes of life in the wild, including
        hunting, killing and eating of other animals and humans for nutrition, finding
        a mate, and the ingestion of substances which may be psychedelic in nature.
        Intellectual maturity is advised.

    review: Its a good game but I lost all my progress because I accidentally clicked
      new life, not realizing it would immediately erase my current character; I recommend
      making a save feature to avoid these things.
