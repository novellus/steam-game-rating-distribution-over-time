I'm very glad i persevered cos it turned out to be a great original story with lots of clever intuitive fun puzzles and interesting environments. For me personally it also had a healing aspect to it. \n\nIf you only want AAA games then this isn't for you, it's an indie game, and as such it doesn't have big studio production levels, but it's obviously been made as a labour of love and is a rewarding experience in my view.\n\nVery highly recommended.","timestamp_created":1609768944,"timestamp_updated":1609768944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmJjt5vYCf+eywAI="}
