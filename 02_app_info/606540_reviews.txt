The format is more of a series of side stories than a single narrative, jumping from different agents within the agency between each story with Colonel Yuki, the head of D Agency, being a recurring figure.\n\nThe espionage stories explores D Agency's method of operations in various precarious situations, ranging from operating undercover in hostile territory to the death of a fellow agent on the job, which are probably the most gripping part of this series. The fact that the cast changes between stories made it difficult to remember names other than Yuki's, which greatly affected my ability to care about the protagonists themselves. There were a few D agents who exhibited interesting personalities, my favorite being the agent from the Asia Express episode, but most characters are simply forgettable.\n\nThis is one of those series that it is difficult to straight up recommend. It's enjoyable if you are in it for some espionage stories, but don't expect a whole lot of depth.","timestamp_created":1509119901,"timestamp_updated":1509119942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw19ujr98CfOrBiQE="}
