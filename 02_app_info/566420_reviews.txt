Its a new take on fishing that i feel is fresh and fun in a world of sport fishing games. I enjoy the big business feel of the game while it still maintains a small time charming feel. The way you have to make a rout in your head for the boat to follow or risk running out out stamina is really fun although i do Wish there was some sort of option to sleep at sea for a lesser stamina reward. Maybe 3/4 instead of full. The variety of fish is fun and the risk of a dolphin or seal getting caught in your net makes you pay attention to each new catch.  \n\nI do find there is too much clicking in the menu's for repetitive things. \nFor example I feel that the game play could be significantly improved by changing small things such as simply having the sleep and pay buttons at the Inn combined. Instead of having to click sleep and then click to pay 5 coins every night you could just click sleep and it would auto charge the 5 without making you click a second time. Same thing goes for the store. I would love to have a sell option on the main store page instead of having to click the store then click shop then click sell, its unnecessary and makes the menus feel a little clunky. \n","timestamp_created":1511395246,"timestamp_updated":1511395246,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+6eL898Ce5LQjAE="}
