In this adventure, Sam is frightened of the storm raging outside, and decides to put a stop to the thunder. He goes up to his attic, which takes him to Worldwide Weather, where the weather is controlled. Upon his arrival, and a misstep, he accidentally causes part of the system to break and machine components to go missing. As a result, the weather across the globe is chaotic and it is up to Sam to locate, retrieve, and return the missing units to their respective weather services.\n\nOne of the most fun aspects of the [i]Pajama Sam[/i] franchise is that where a missing piece is located is not necessarily the same each time you play the game; each of the lost components may be found and retrieved in [b]different ways with each playthrough[/b]. Not knowing how each run of the game is setup makes the game more fun to replay. How Sam interacts with other characters (who are not missing) changes as well; for instance, what he has to bring to Langston the Snowman might not be the same with each iteration of the game.\n\nWe also see the return of a character from the first installment, [i]No Need to Hide When it’s Dark Outside,[/i] as well as portraits of characters from that same game. There are a lot of extras in these games: in [i]Thunder and Lightning Aren’t So Frightening[/i], the player can click on a bunch of items in any given scene and things will happen (the item might change shape or colour, or something new will appear on screen temporarily). There is no end to the additional content included throughout the game. There are some bonus activities as well, including making snowflakes and seeking out copies of Sam’s favourite comic, “Pajama Man!” In addition, Sam’s “collection task,” as I refer to it, is to find all of his missing puzzle pieces and put the puzzle together (this puzzle changes each time the game is played, as well).\n\nOne of the reasons I enjoy [i]Thunder and Lightning Aren’t so Frightening[/i] more than the other installments is, I think, because it’s a daytime adventure (the other games take place at night or twilight). The brightness and cheeriness of this game makes it more fun, in my opinion, than the others.\n\nMy rating of [i]Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and Lightning Aren’t so Frightening[/i] is 5/5. As with the other games in this series, there are a lot of extras included, making it more fun than it would be without it—the developers gave more than the base requirements to tell the story. Though it doesn’t teach the real way weather is formed, it’s a neat introduction to different weather systems that kids will enjoy. The characters are entertaining, and the game has great replay value. If any [i]Pajama Sam[/i] game were to be recommended to play, I would suggest this one. It’s fantastic. It’s a perfect children’s game.","timestamp_created":1607981335,"timestamp_updated":1607981335,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nYDKsfYCfomeugI="}
