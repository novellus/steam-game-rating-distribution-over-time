A little faster than a C172 but way slower than the 208 this plane is a joy to fly. With a few different types like a belly cargo pod, and a float version as well as the standard you get a fair amount of variety here. Only thing I dislike is there is no altitude hold for the autopilot. A cool bush plane or commuter with excellent flight characteristics that feel pretty real.","timestamp_created":1565992053,"timestamp_updated":1565992053,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kM2ZzuwCf6q+0AE="}
