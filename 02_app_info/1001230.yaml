    about_the_game: '<h2 class="bb_tag">Summary</h2>You are a crew member of a cyborg
      space ship. A signal passes through the ship and hacks everyone''s brains. The
      entire crew loses control and they all start killing each other. It becomes
      a huge battle royal. However, for some reason, you aren''t affected like the
      others by the hack: you manage to keep partial control over your own actions.
      Despite your cerebral limitations you are still the only one left that can do
      something and save the ship. <br>The situation of living the adventure with
      a hacked brain translates to an interesting game play in which you do not control
      yourself in real time. Instead you can only make specific decisions at specific
      moments when the hack in your brain lets you. During these moments time pauses
      leaving you all the time you want to make your decisions. When you finish taking
      your decisions you must unpause time and watch your mindless automated body
      act. During this time you can only hope to survive until the next time your
      hacked brain allows you to make a conscious choice.<h2 class="bb_tag">Content</h2><strong>Campaign:
      </strong><br>The campaign is made out of 81 levels accompanied by a small story
      line that will immerse you into the depth of a dark mysterious future.<br><br><strong>Chaotic
      Universes Mode: </strong><br>In this mode levels are randomly generated. Every
      attempt to beat a ''Chaotic Universe'' is a different experience. There is a
      total of 5 Chaotic Universes that get harder and harder. Each Chaotic Universe
      is made out of 26 levels. During an attempt to beat a chaotic universe you won''t
      be able to save your progress, so if you lose all your lives you will have to
      restart the 26 levels from the beginning. This mode is extremely unforgiving
      and it''s only recommended for more experienced players. It''s not even sure
      that the final chaotic universe is beatable.<br><br><strong>Sandbox mode:</strong><br>In
      this mode you can create your own levels and save them. Creating levels is very
      simple, it''s just a matter of dropping elements into the field. You can mix
      item compositions to create insane fight scenarios. In this mode you can also
      view the saved replays of your exploits. You can even retry to beat the levels
      from the replays.'

      notes: There is mainly fights with cyborgs shooting each other and stabbing
        each other. The cyborgs are completely metallic so there is no blood and the
        style of the game is not realistic.

      survive. Most of the time you have no control, but at key moments you can take
      decisions that are vital: think them through very carefully. The rest of the
      time, watch your body act and hope you make it out alive...'

    review: A unique tactical puzzle game. Many funny moments when unpredicted behaviors
      happen. Highly recommended.
