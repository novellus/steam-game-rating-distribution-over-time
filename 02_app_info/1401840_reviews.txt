The events are fun at first, but eventually it felt like I was only experiencing the same five events over and over again. The biggest problem with the game is that it didn't really feel like any of the stats mattered a whole lot or maybe I couldn't figure out how to raise them up to a point where they would. I also didn't feel like the journey was dangerous. where were the wild beasts and bandits? where were the desert sand storms or tumultuous sea voyages?\nAlso The way that food is done is really annoying and un-intuitive. The game gives you the pounds needed, but then doesn't tell you how many rations are in a pound. I get that if I give food to someone, or if I didn't budget for winter and blizzards pin me down I starve, but why isn't one unit of rations = 1 pound of food? and if it's not then what is it equal too?\nWhen I purchased this game I was hoping for either a good story or a trade management game, but the game falls short on both sides. As a result, after the first play through I didn't want to play it again. If the game was 4-5 dollars I'd recommend, but I felt like some of the content should be more flushed out for that 7-8 dollar price point.","timestamp_created":1604792221,"timestamp_updated":1605566393,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53066331148147583","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qt3N6fUCfN+CrQI="}
