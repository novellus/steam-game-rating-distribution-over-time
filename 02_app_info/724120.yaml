    review: 'This is a thrilling tactical shooter with large open maps.  As you fight
      your way through the hordes of different alien soldiers; you also need to plan
      your route through interesting terrain from rocky peaks to forests and hackable
      teleporters. The terrain and graphics are beautiful with flexible quality settings
      for older pcs like mine. The gunplay is great with a variety of weapons and
      scoping options; made all the more thrilling at the constant danger of being
      outflanked. The A.I. are relentless hunting you down and pathfinding through
      navigating difficult terrain.


      A great and under-rated game has become all the more polished since the February
      update. Adding new maps, gamemodes, better optimization and a shop. They''ve
      also recently added matchmaking and online multiplayer. Well worth the time
      and modest price point.'
