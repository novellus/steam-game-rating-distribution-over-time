This can be the difference of it's success or failure.\n\nShadow Ops: Red Mercury is your basic FPS where you must stop a backpack nuke from getting in the wrong hands and being used. You meet with fierce aggression and many perhaps too many enemies that pop out of nowhere at times. But this games cinematic feels keeps you immersed in the action ducking to find cover and figure out where the hostiles are.\n\nYou team does a good job of helping take out some of the enemies, but you feel outnumbered most of times. Your firefights are immense with exploding drums and grenades making it feel your in the middle of a real mission. The aiming cursor feels very tight making it easy to aim in on targets. This is not Call of Duty, but the action is intense. With details such as breakable and movable objects thrown in the game comes alive with action.\n\nWith all these postives there is one major drawback which is no quick saves along the way. [b][u]So if you die during a mission you must start that level over from the beginning.[/u][/b] This can get frustrating, but makes you proceed with caution next time which brings me to another negative point: the enemies spawn in exact same areas, so its not hard to know whats coming and from where next time you play the level. There are no blood or gore, but a pretty immersive shooter that will entertain the expirienced player for hours.\n\nAll in all this making Shadow Ops: Red Mercury a very solid purchase.","timestamp_created":1609771878,"timestamp_updated":1609771878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518072307109832764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw57D45vYCfry0wAI="}
