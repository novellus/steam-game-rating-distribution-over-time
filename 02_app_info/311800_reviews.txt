Worth noting here, I haven't played any co-op yet so I cannot judge that.\n    First and foremost: I have enjoyed this game and eagerly await what more content will be added before it is in its final form. I am going to list the things in this game I feel were done well and the elements I felt were weakest, as well as a small explanation for each.\n\n    Strong elements:\n            Movement: Gliding, grappling, or teleporting around all feel good.\n             Variety: The selection of weapons and abilities is great, allowing for many play-styles and encouraging replayability. There is also a selection of unique items that can feel very exciting to find and use.\n        Presentation: This game feels satisfying. Whether it’s being launched in the air, setting off explosions, or mowing down enemies with a machine gun it is done well.\n        “Level” design: Initially I felt much of the game was simple and open, but as I followed the story things quickly spiraled into complex and fun design\n        Basic gameplay loop: There is almost always a reward befitting the challenge so it feels good to progress and work your way to some of the more powerful areas.\n        Story: Surprisingly good. There is still much of it yet to be put in the game, but I found myself happy to uncover more of the main story as I went. Also, very few but entertaining side quests. \n\n    Now onto some of the weaker elements:\n        UI: It was mostly good, but for some reason I expect all UI’s to be perfect. The way it tracked important enemy’s was confusing, and sometimes the fire particle effect covered important info. Also I couldn’t find the option to completely unbind actions from any key, which was odd.\n        Bugs: I only had some minor issues, but It came up often enough I want to mention it. Sometimes Items or enemies would be inside of walls and the like, and at one point an object I was meant to defend kept spawning in lava, killing it. These never halted progression, but they kept me from completing or getting my rewards for hacking terminals.\n        Balance: This is the thing I am least sure about, but it seems like some weapon types are much stronger than others. Most enemies are in your face, and there are few bosses to speak of, which means it makes the most sense to have close-range/aoe weapons above much else. \n\n    There is one last thing I want to mention about this game. It is early access, and it feels like it. You can walk into unfinished areas of the map and the most structured parts of the story end far too soon. If you want a completely finished and polished game, then this isn’t it quite yet (This was written in January 2021). Regardless, I enjoyed this game and recommend it to anyone who’s eye it has caught.\n","timestamp_created":1609949640,"timestamp_updated":1609949640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw1L6e7PYCco+FwQI="}
