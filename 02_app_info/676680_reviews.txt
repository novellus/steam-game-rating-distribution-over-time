What I don't like is that It can be hard to tell when you take damage (for example the first time I died to the larger ships I had no idea what was damaging me as I wasn't anywhere near them or any bullets). What I do like is the controls and the power-ups really make the game interesting.","timestamp_created":1510439442,"timestamp_updated":1510439442,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544626593589782715","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5ZrN1t8CeqOIiwE="}
