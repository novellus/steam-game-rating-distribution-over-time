    review: 'One of those obscure, hidden gems I stumbled upon entirely by accident
      in the 2020 Halloween Steam sale. The images and description and gameplay all
      looked fantastic from what little there was, and the tiny handful of reviews
      over the course of two years only made it sound better.


      Castle Agony is a *very* old-school style adventure game, reminding me of attempts
      to imitate the Lucasfilm Games on console, with faint touches of Resident Evil
      and Castlevania thrown in for style points. While the graphics look more like
      Zelda, the gameplay is pure point-''n''-click using the mouse to interact with
      the environment and choose your next moves.*


      Even though the setting riffs off Resident Evil, the tone leans a bit closer
      to Maniac Mansion -- fluffy horror, I think, perfect for the post-Halloween
      mood. Depending on luck, you might have some difficulty early on, but assuming
      you''re thorough and constantly making progress, the game never really hits
      notable difficulty walls and the ending is a bit of a cakewalk. I might even
      say it''s unbalanced in favor of being too easy on the normal difficulty. The
      types of items I got in my run -- not sure if it''s randomized -- meant I was
      only able to make a handful of the possible items a hundred times over, and
      the rest only a couple. This also meant I wiped out the final boss using a nigh-endless
      barrage of molotovs.


      As the level design takes so many nods from the Resident Evil series, the mansion
      is full of secret nooks and crannies and lore. There''s a lot of love put into
      this game by its lone, part-time developer, and while it ain''t perfect, I''m
      really happy I stumbled upon it and got the chance to play it. One of those
      indie gems where the developer immediately joins my list of must-support artists.


      * Don''t use a traditional controller with this game. Steam controller works
      well, however.'
