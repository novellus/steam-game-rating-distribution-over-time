    reviews: "\u201CNancy Drew fans will NOT be disappointed in this latest installment.\
      \ It\u2019s a solid game effort by Her Interactive and those who might have\
      \ been passing on the Nancy Drew series might just want to give this one a try.\
      \ In my opinion, The White Wolf of Icicle Creek is an excellent step in the\
      \ right direction.\u201D<br />\r\nJust Adventure<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201CSuitable\
      \ for all ages, the game also contains some educational tidbits on wildlife\
      \ and brain-teasing puzzles that may make it a good choice for children and\
      \ families, though prospective buyers may want to note that there are some characters\
      \ that fall into possibly offensive racial stereotypes. In any case, though,\
      \ it\u2019s a decent adventure game, and fans of the series will probably find\
      \ it worthwhile to take a look.\u201D<br />\r\nGame Chronicles<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\n\u201CAt the end of the day, Nancy Drew: The White Wolf of Icicle Creek\
      \ is everything we have come to expect from this series of games. It has nicely\
      \ enmeshed puzzles peppered throughout the game, a number of quirky characters\
      \ to interact with and a solidly written dialogue.\u201D<br />\r\nAdventure\
      \ Gamers<br />\r\n"
