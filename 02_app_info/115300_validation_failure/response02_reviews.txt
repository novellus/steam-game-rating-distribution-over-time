I love the modern warfare series but this is the single silliest thing i have ever seen in a video game EVER. They had a bunch of coders and developers in a meeting and they decided somewhere along the way that we didn't need to fight russian's anymore and that the buildings should shoot at us instead....Like i said these games are my favorite COD games but i literally had to stop the game and make this review because i'm genuinely speechless....People got paid to develop shooting buildings with aimbot.
