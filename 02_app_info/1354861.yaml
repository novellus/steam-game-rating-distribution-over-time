      <br />\r\nAt a staggering 32 unique animations, this is the largest Animation\
      \ Collection yet, and a terrific collection for designers not afraid to take\
      \ their players on a journey into the abyss.\t<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n* 10 physical attack animations<br />\r\n* 18 skill animations<br\
