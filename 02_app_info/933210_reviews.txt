Before the review I will not pander to nostalgia because this game does not do the typical \"oh hey i'm based on a retro game\" cliche. It rises above that norm because it strives to be better then games like \"A Hat in Time\" and \"Yooka-Laylee\".\n\nPRESENTATION -----\n\nThe game presents itself as an open world 3D platformer collectathon. And this is where the game truly shines, the levels feel massive with detailed purpose. Each area feels as if the developer thought out how to go about traversing them in fresh and cool ways, In some ways I feel the presentation of this game outshines the big boys that pander to nostalgia like \"A Hat in Time\". The game's atmosphere feels dreary and original, with an emphasis on a more adult looking word.  The game isn't without humor though, as the characters do crack well placed jokes. Overall the constant changing level design keeps the experience truly fresh without nostalgia pandering.\n\nMECHANICS -----\n\nThe game works on a progressive mechanic system, meaning the game always changes how it plays. Examples of this would be the desert level introducing a roll a ball mechanic and the castle towers stage throwing in shrinking/expanding platforms into the mix. The core mechanics are very solid for the playable character. Including stuff like gliding,power glove, and gravity glove. Each of the core mechanics are implemented everywhere so it gives you a sense of skill. Currency upgrades play a role as well. Coins you can use to purchase health and offensive upgrades, as well as item maps for each of the levels to find hidden objects. The main mechanic of the game is collecting \"Hearts\"  they are used to progress at various points in the story. So the game is chocked full of cool ideas and executions that will make even genre veterans happy and surprised by them all, it even switches to \"2D\" in certain segments to freshen it up yet again.\n\nSTORY -----\n\nWhile the story does not reinvent the wheel, I feel it flows pretty well. You play as a bipedal talking cat that likes to eat and dream. One day he has a strange dream that compels him and his friends to literally save the world. The cast of quirky and likable characters really helps this game progress at a rate that doesn't feel rushed or dragging in any way.  And the humor while childish, fits the narrative well. \n\nLENGTH -----\n\nNow this is where the game is worth the selling price. The game is VERY long, Longer than even games like Yooka-Laylee and A Hat in Time. Taking a glance at the level status menu shows around 60 Levels each massive and full of things to do. Even after the lengthy campaign is tons of stuff to do, like finding the last of the coins and hearts. You will always find yourself looking in every nook and cranny for objects you missed during the main campaign. In some ways the length is on par with some triple A games.\n\nCLOSING -----\n\nThis is a great example of what the 3D Platformer genre SHOULD be doing. Instead of pandering to what has been done, try NEW things.\n\nAnd you know what I think this game has done just that.\n\nWith that said for 10 bucks I can honestly say this game has defied my expectations in a fresh and almost exhilarating way. \n\nAnd I think that's this genre needs more then anything.","timestamp_created":1578075080,"timestamp_updated":1578075080,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1Nimtu8Cc/nI6QE="}
