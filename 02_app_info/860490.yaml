    review: 'I really tried to like the story. But unfortunately just barely 2 mins
      into the game it already failed to amuse me. It''s very bland and boring. I''m
      usually very easy to entertain and I do like the other KEMCO games that I''ve
      played. But sadly, I give this one a hard pass.


      I bought this a several months ago and I''m just glad that I bought this when
      it was on sale. I''ll remove it from my library after writing this review.'
