    review: "It's not bad, but depends more on chance than skill, and the strategy\
      \ gets staid quickly.\n \nMost of the thought required is in allocating your\
      \ die results to your actions. This can be a reasonably interesting puzzle,\
      \ but it rarely presents novel challenges. \nStrategic decisions are much rarer-\
      \ it's almost always preferable to fight than not fight, and loot choices usually\
      \ have a best option. \n\nIt's not bad, and enjoyed the first four hours of\
      \ play- but you can probably find better uses of your time and money."
