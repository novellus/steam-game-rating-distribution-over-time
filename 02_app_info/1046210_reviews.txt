I was very hooked on the art style, game play mechanics, and striving for 100% completion of every stage. I managed to get 100% on every level on the original Munchie Match and loved every minute of it. \n\nThe PC version looks amazing. Very smooth gameplay and the addition of 2 player mode adds even more replay value. I highly recommend this title for those that enjoy match 3 puzzle games with a bit of a food twist!!","timestamp_created":1597372743,"timestamp_updated":1597372743,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41be19fMCcYWpmwI="}
