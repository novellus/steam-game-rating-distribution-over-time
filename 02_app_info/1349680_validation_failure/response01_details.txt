Use tetrominos to make your way through the strange new world, solve puzzles and get to know its not too friendly inhabitants.","supported_languages":"English","reviews":"“Tetris and turn-based tactics does seem like an odd mix, but it works surprisingly well and it makes for a very addictive and unique gameplay experience. The pixel art animation is excellent and the game has a lot of charm and a delightful sense of humor. A quirky blocky adventure well worth embarking on.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.alphabetagamer.com\/gunblocks-beta-demo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Alpha Beta Gamer<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1349680\/header.jpg?t=1610065982","website":"http:\/\/gunblocks.com","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Dual-Core, 2.0 GHz<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 2 MB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> GeForce 8800 GT 512 MB, Radeon HD 4870 512 MB<br><\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> Version 10<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 300 MB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Sound Card:<\/strong> Windows Compatible Sound Card<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> MacOS Mojave 10.14<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 1.7 GHz Intel Core i5<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 2 MB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> Intel HD Graphic 4000 or Equivalent<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 2 MB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Sound Card:<\/strong> 1 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"linux_requirements":[],"developers":["Steve Welz"],"publishers":["Steve Welz"],"package_groups":[],"platforms":{"windows":true,"mac":false,"linux":false},"categories":[{"id":2,"description":"Single-player"},{"id":28,"description":"Full controller support"}],"genres":[{"id":"1","description":"Action"},{"id":"25","description":"Adventure"},{"id":"4","description":"Casual"},{"id":"23","description":"Indie"}],"screenshots":[{"id":0,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1349680\/ss_3e2c5f5b75ad33b043922aac34f3d3c254490c5f.600x338.jpg?t=1610065982","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1349680\/ss_3e2c5f5b75ad33b043922aac34f3d3c254490c5f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1610065982"},{"id":1,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1349680\/ss_07429192f60e667049e944557480e0fcbe2dc21d.600x338.jpg?t=1610065982","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1349680\/ss_07429192f60e667049e944557480e0fcbe2dc21d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1610065982"},{"id":2,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1349680\/ss_f68b57ad7256d18b96bb34be72f4cf10656bf99b.600x338.jpg?t=1610065982","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1349680\/ss_f68b57ad7256d18b96bb34be72f4cf10656bf99b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1610065982"},{"id":3,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1349680\/ss_44af9cabb21f43d4a00fb411cc99100b9dd2fd47.600x338.jpg?t=1610065982","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1349680\/ss_44af9cabb21f43d4a00fb411cc99100b9dd2fd47.1920x1080.jpg?t=1610065982"},{"id":4,"path_thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1349680\/ss_141a5b9b5fad6693f9c387e9e207ca2cdcf0a3d5.600x338.jpg?t=1610065982","path_full":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1349680\/ss_141a5b9b5fad6693f9c387e9e207ca2cdcf0a3d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1610065982"}],"movies":[{"id":256803588,"name":"Announcement Trailer","thumbnail":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256803588\/movie.293x165.jpg?t=1601883032","webm":{"480":"http:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256803588\/movie480_vp9.webm?t=1601883032","max":"http:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256803588\/movie_max_vp9.webm?t=1601883032"},"mp4":{"480":"http:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256803588\/movie480.mp4?t=1601883032","max":"http:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/256803588\/movie_max.mp4?t=1601883032"},"highlight":true}],"release_date":{"coming_soon":true,"date":"Spring 2021"},"support_info":{"url":"http:\/\/gunblocks.com","email":"support@gunblocks.com"},"background":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1349680\/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg?t=1610065982","content_descriptors":{"ids":[],"notes":null}}}}
