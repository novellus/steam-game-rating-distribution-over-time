    review: "Seems like it have quite potential to be a really fun game, but for now,\
      \ it's pretty clunky. Game crashes while playing, freezes, slows down all the\
      \ time... I also had to play it on medium config because higher than that the\
      \ game is slow motion, even though my specs are better than the recommended.\
      \ \nIt still needs polishing and optimization, though, it's still an early access\
      \ game, and for it's price, it's not really a problem, but only if you don't\
      \ mind waiting for the devs to fix the problems and finish it, which is something\
      \ that we all know is kinda risky, some devs in the past simply stopped updating\
      \ their games and left it broken. Not that it will happen, but it's always good\
      \ to be careful. Good news is that the dev seems to be updating it regurlarly\
      \ for now, so that's a thing.\nHope the devs make a good job and wish them good\
      \ luck and success with their game."
