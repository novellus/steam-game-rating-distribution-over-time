The controls function well but there are a ton of sections in the game that are not introduced and more so sprung onto the player causing a ton of frustration. Part of the way through the game you come to some swarming death enemies that force you to run away. Scary Girl does not run fast enough to get away from these things but you are expected to know or figure out that you can mash the roll dodge enough to move faster than the normal run speed of the character. It goes on like this too. Somewhere else in the game, you get halted from attaining the normal game loop victory to go and collect 4 bones.\n\nI am finding myself mostly frustrated with the game, which is why I haven't completed it yet. I don't see myself coming back to it anytime soon.","timestamp_created":1608375948,"timestamp_updated":1608375948,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrqqrvfYCfJC0uwI="}
