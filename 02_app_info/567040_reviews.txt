Half the time when I'd enter a new hole, my ball would just randomly move.\n-While it has map-making, the map-making seems to be glitchy at best when it comes to uploading.\n-Multiplayer is a hassle.\n\nOverall, while having some glitches and limited game-play, the fact the game is also not graphically pleasing doesn't help it in the slightest. I would refund it, however I'm actually kind of happy about the steam cards it has. Save your money! Use it on one of the many other mini-golf games available if that's what you're searching for.","timestamp_created":1577021636,"timestamp_updated":1577021783,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.587826728820800781","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vdf0lu8CerSL5gE="}
