    about_the_game: "Ever feel like you're running around in circles?<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nMaddening Euphoria is a unique, challenging arcade game with randomly\
      \ generated level design, in which you control brother and sister duet Mason\
      \ and Millicent Zane as they flee from their own imagined realisation of their\
      \ troubles in life - an inescapable wall of death - while avoiding bottomless\
      \ pits, deadly spikes and speed-reducing pools of thick goo. Keep within spitting\
      \ distance of the wall to receive a short, colourful Second Wind speed boost\
      \ and gain the opportunity to be one eighth euphoric.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot\
      \ enough for you? Don your favourite fedora, go for eight pieces, and enter\
      \ the multicoloured rainbow world of Euphoria where time goes even faster, spikes\
      \ disappear and your survival speeds up dramatically. Or tackle some of the\
      \ game's 150+ challenges ranging anywhere from trivially easy to borderline\
      \ unfathomable.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMeanwhile, choose from 36 game themes (or\
      \ throw it on Shuffle), each with themed poetry telling tales of your demise\
      \ with anywhere from innocent whimsy to incomparable filth, and ranging from\
      \ surprisingly clever to embarrassingly hideous. If you're English, Scottish,\
      \ Welsh, Irish, German, Spanish, Japanese, American, or from Bristol or Norwich\
      \ like we are, I apologise profusely. Also have the game mock your failures\
      \ in one of 51 ways of varying levels of Britishness. And all of this while\
      \ other people's highscores pop up and you wonder what some people do with their\
      \ time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is the flashiest, fleshiest Maddening to date.\
      \ It even has some diamondy bits. And you can turn those off if you're only\
      \ in it for the circles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJust don't buy it if you suffer\
      \ from epilepsy. (Please.)"
