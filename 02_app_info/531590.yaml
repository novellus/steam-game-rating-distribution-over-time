    about_the_game: "Listen to me very carefully. Tooken is the official spoof of\
      \ the Taken franchise.  Bryan Millers (Lee Tergesen) was born with a particular\
      \ set of skills which helped him excel as a CIA operative, get his daughter\
      \ Kim back from sex trafficking kidnappers, and escape the wrath of a revenge\
      \ driven Albanian patriarch. Now he faces the most difficult challenge of his\
      \ life. Aging in suburban America. Reduced to a job as a mall cop, Bryan faces\
      \ 4 serious threats throughout the film.  First, his less than pious daughter\
      \ is turning 21 and dating a horny basketball player in her class. Kim\u2019\
      s virginity is about to be taken. Second, his ex-wife is dating an ex-porn star\
      \ named Money Maker (Reno Wilson) who surely has no problem with his, ahem,\
      \ manhood. Bryan on the other hand is aging and having trouble \u201Ckeeping\
      \ up\u201D, as it were. Third, he has stumbled upon yet another band of Albanian\
      \ thugs who are smuggling explosives into the mall. And fourth, he has to handle\
      \ it all with a tiny Shih Tzu in tow. It was a birthday gift for his daughter\
      \ but he forgot his wife was severely allergic to dogs.  After Money Maker proposes\
      \ to Lenore, Bryan becomes determined to get her back. After all, he is still\
      \ in love with his ex. He enlists the help of his Irish mum Edna, who is also\
      \ an ex-CIA operative. Even though she is pushing 80 and in an assisted living\
      \ home, she still has her particular set of skills that are dying to be put\
      \ to use. Meanwhile, Kim, attends her first college party and Bryan has to ensure\
      \ these horny college kids don\u2019t strip her of her innocence.  It ends with\
      \ Kim\u2019s boyfriend flying out the 2nd story window and into a full body\
      \ cast. At a birthday dinner for Kims birthday, the Albanian thugs from the\
      \ mall kidnap Bryan, Lenore and Edna, while Kim and her boyfriend are in the\
      \ bathroom trying to have sex through the body cast. Bryan is able to call Kim\
      \ on her cell phone and tells her they've been taken. She replies &quot;Why\
      \ does this keep happening to us!&quot; When will the taking end?"

    short_description: Tooken is the official spoof of the Taken franchise. A parody
      of the Taken films and all things Liam Neeson. This wildly hilarious romp is
      laugh out loud funny and action packed.
