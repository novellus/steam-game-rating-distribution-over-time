      \ J94 was introduced in 1937 as the Hunslet Class 50550, general purpose 0-6-0\
      \ saddle tank locomotive. At the outbreak of World War 2, the design was amended\
      \ to allow cheaper and speedier production, and the Hunslet Austerity tank was\
      \ born. Several works were charged with producing the J94 including Hunslet,\
      \ Andrew Barclay Sons &amp; Co, W.G Bagnall, Hudswell and Clarke, Robert Stephenson's\
      \ and Hawthorns and the Vulcan Foundry. Incredibly, the J94 continued in production\
      \ for the National Coal Board almost until the end of British main line steam,\
      \ with the last being produced for the NCB in 1964. The J94\u2019s versatility\
      \ and appeal for yard operators assured the type a continuing life late into\
      \ the 20th Century with the NCB and with numerous industrial owners.  <br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe J94 for Train Simulator includes 8 different loco\
      \ variants, including weathered liveries, and two different control options:\
      \ a standard version which can be driven with the on-screen HUD or simple controls,\
      \ plus an advanced version with accurately simulated steam controls which requires\
      \ keyboard control. Also included is a small colliery route running between\
      \ Maerdy and Tylorstown."
