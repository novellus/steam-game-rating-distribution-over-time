      \ where the player is blind and must explore their surroundings using echolocation.<br><br>Waking\

      \ woman makes the shocking discovery she has lost her sense of sight. Goaded\

      \ solve puzzles and uncover the mystery of what is happening to her.<br><br>As\

    review: 'I found Blind quite enjoyable, at first I really enjoyed the story and
      the puzzle aspect, the difficulty of the puzzles ranged from childlike to quite
      hard, which was fine to me, but the story itself was starting to change from
      a somewhat straight forward plot to a fever dream/psychological horror-esque
      plot (at least in my opinion), which for me felt like a chore, even got spooked
      a few times, mostly by accident because in a few parts of the game, it is quite
      dark. Also felt like story aspects kind of happened for no reason, as a good
      amount of things is not really explained and is left to interpretation. A good
      3-4 hours is needed to beat the game and I do have to mention that the premise
      of you being blind, using echo location is quite original and well made, so
      if you''re into vr puzzle games and/or story driven games with interesting mechanics,
      I think this is a good pick, especially on sale.
