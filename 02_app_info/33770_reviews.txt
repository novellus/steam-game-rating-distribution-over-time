This is rather brazen towards the buyers of the game. \nThe buyers have to make the game playable on Windows 10 on their own.\n\nStarting the game with the parameters  \n“-windowed -w *width of your screen resolution* -h *height of your screen resolution*\n\nOr\n\n“-novideo”\n\ndoes the trick.\n\nThere is also a program for issues like this:\nhttps://github.com/Codeusa/Borderless-Gaming/releases/\n\nI haven’t tried it out. I just tested starting with “-windowed -w *width of your screen resolution* -h *height of your screen resolution*\n\nAnd it worked finely, hence there was no need for me trying the other options.\nStill it would be easy for a big company like steam to include the parameters in the launch-options. Unfortunately they haven’t done it and are selling game in a unplayable state.\n","timestamp_created":1609502053,"timestamp_updated":1609502053,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qIrz3vYCe5awvwI="}
