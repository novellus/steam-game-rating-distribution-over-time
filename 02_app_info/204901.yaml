    review: 'Just played through the other DLC (The Desmond Debacle) in one sitting
      and it was good. Then I started this one. The first puzzle was so tedious and
      jank that I quit.


      If you need to play this because you''re going for 100% achievements, I wish
      you good luck, and will recommend that you play with the sound off (if it''s
      anything like the other DLC, you won''t lose anything).'
