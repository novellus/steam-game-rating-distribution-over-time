I for one, don't play very many of the modes. I'm not a very competitive person, and \"timed/no more moves\" games aren't for me. I play Zen mode almost exclusively. That's not a very good start to a review, I'm sad to say, it just is what I'm thinking about. Back on topic. The game is beautifully crafted, the artwork is just stunning. It's easy to play, yet hard to master. The best thing about it for me, is that I can totally relax, and clear my head while playing. I would recommend it to people who need an engaging colorful game that doesn't easily cause stress.","timestamp_created":1610140385,"timestamp_updated":1610140385,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47o/28fYCcdXRwQI="}
