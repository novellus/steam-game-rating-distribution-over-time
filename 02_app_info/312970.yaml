    review: 'It''s buggy as hell, so make sure you save your game often because there''s
      no autosave and there are occasionally game-breaking bugs. I had to redo entire
      portions of the game twice because I forgot to save.


      The other thing is, the puzzles are obnoxious. Like, the game tells you what
      to do and then sticks its tongue out at you when you try it, like "how could
      you be so stupid as to think that would actually work?", and then you have to
      combine objects in unintuitive ways to complete the game. Like, I played Myst
      before playing this, and Myst was [i]easier[/i].


      That said, I adored it. Cute and fun. (Still, the sequel is better)'
