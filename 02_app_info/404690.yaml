      Surprisingly cohesive, and striking in its resemblance to older Dungeons and\
      \ Dragons campaigns, albeit with a fairly thick Lovecraftian polish. It captures\
      \ a desperate tone by offering numerous ways to die. It\u2019s charming, occasionally\
      \ trippy, and gruesome throughout.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/11/this-book-is-a-dungeon-review-learn-after-reading.html\"\
