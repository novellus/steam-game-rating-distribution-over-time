    review: 'Interestingly enough, I was into this game.  Maybe it''s different than
      the usual character experience.  I was curious to see how this will end.  For
      the most part, the game does play out linear, but there a couple or a few "big"
      moments where there is choice in how this will end.  For me, I was satisfied
      in how I ended the game as the goody two-shoes that I am.


      The gameplay is a point and click.  Most items that are clickable doesn''t mean
      much.  It is just only a viewable item.  Thankfully, with items already highlighted,
      you don''t have to be frustrated in ''pixel finding'' so you stay within the
      story.  There a couple of problems with the layout, however.  Sometimes if you
      move ahead a ''picture location'', you would need to turn around because there
      is another picture location where you can search stuff.  The map layout doesn''t
      make it easy for you to check what is around you.  Then again, it most areas
      aren''t important in moving forward in the game.


      Another small issue is that I wished this FMV game will have at least video
      clips or audio dialogue in the game just like the intro and another hidden video
      (check a laptop) within the game.  But I give that a pass.  I can feel the developer
      put a lot of work into this despite being a short game.  Also, I think this
      is his first game to make, so I don''t expect much.  It was still an intriguing
      point of view as well as some choices in the game.  Great work.'
