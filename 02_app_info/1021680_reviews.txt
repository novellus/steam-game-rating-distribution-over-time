Sure it's not a smooth experience the entire time, but it's early-access and it's still in active development. Already I like this game better than Beat Saber. Its more physically demanding to play: you have to slash your arms like Wolverine versus simply flicking your wrist like a Jedi. I can't wait to see how this game progresses, well worth the entry price.","timestamp_created":1551549937,"timestamp_updated":1559487299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505882322788238525","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ42/erjOsCfYaSvAE="}
