      wanted to train with your virtual Bo, Bokken or Ken?<br>The martial art also
      includes meditation. This brings peace, joy and peace into your everyday life
      and gives you strength for the ever new tasks you have to deal with every day.

      you to train or meditate perfectly. Further areas are already under construction
      to inspire you in new ways.<h2 class="bb_tag">Individual adjustments</h2>At
      the moment we are working on lots of features so that you can adapt the times
      of day, music and much more individually to your needs. So you can concentrate
      on what's important. Among other things, we are working on a music visualizer
      and testing a radio and spotify integration.<h2 class="bb_tag">Always new content</h2>We
      are constantly working on new environments and improving existing landscapes.
      More details, more possibilities, new effects, new music and much more await
      you in the future and partly also as free Early Access Updates.<br><br>h2]<strong>As
      of version 2.0 Guided training units</strong>[/h2]<br>We are mainly working
      on providing you with a virtual trainer. So you can look at techniques and procedures
      and get tips on how to perform them yourself. These virtual trainers receive
      their &quot;knowledge&quot; through motion capture from real masters. They are
      therefore the ideal template for your training - wherever and whenever you want!
      The guided meditation is of course also an important part of our further development.

      you get a feel for the enviroment and the weapons to be used for martial arts
      training. <br>The next level is coming soon. It will contain a separate area
      for meditation.<br>We are looking forward to receiving your feedback! By the

    review: What a waste of money. I wonder about the mental state of the person/s
      that developed what was released. All there is to do is throw around a box,
      break barrels and a few other objects and swing a staff or sword. Three minutes
      into it and you are done. There are two bowling lanes with pins at the end that
      you are unable to interact with, don't understand what this has to do with the
      premise of the game. There is also a duck like creature that bounces up and
      down leaving a trail of fire from its eyes. You are also unable to interact
      with this strange creature, so once again I ask what does this have to do with
      the game? And seeing that this was released approximately 18 months ago I seriously
      doubt there is going to be any further development. I would very much like a
      refund!
