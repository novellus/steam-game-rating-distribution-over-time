But this DLC is truly worthless for the enjoyment of the game.\n\nEven with everything unlocked and the best of the best, you will find every fight boring and absurdly hard.\nThere is no way around it, it is simply designed to be hard whatever you try to do.\n\nYou are not even able to adjust difficulty.\n\nBasically it is a little box where fight simulations appear and you need to defeat those simulations to get a minuscule and most likely worthless reward.\n\nUnless you plan to beat the whole game and upgrade every single aspect of your character to the max so you can at least have a chance to win a fight of this DLC then save your money.\n\nIf you don´t get this with discount and by purchasing the season pass, don´t even dare to buy this as it is most likely you will never use it but to figure out just what I told you in this review.","timestamp_created":1607146049,"timestamp_updated":1607146049,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508196711540222168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43tHXmPYCceq1twI="}
