    review: Planet Stronghold was an enjoyable 10hr Winter Wolves RPG.  If you're
      familiar with Loren and Queen of Thieves this one will feel right at home.  I
      enjoy the exploration interface and the "classic" RPG elements of turn-based
      battles that take a little thought and tactical approach.  The dialog isn't
      anything to write home about and the story isn't anything special but it's definitely
      a fun 10 hours of gameplay.  All-in-all, I'd recommend this one to anyone who
      has played Loren and is looking for more from the developer.  If you can get
      it on sale then more's the better.  Of all this developers RPGs I highly recommend
      Loren and I hear very good things about Planet Stronghold 2 which just released
      this year.  I'm excited to check that one out next.  Support this indie dev!!!!
