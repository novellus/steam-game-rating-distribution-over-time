The game looks really good but isn't really worth a buy at this point in time. \n\nWhile it might be fun for small children some of the organ systems aren't even detailed enough for high school classes. Also some of the information is incorrect (not a doctor but my wife is) for example the lower arm bones were labels \"right lower ulga\" when it is actually a femur and an ulga. \n\nFor now I am requesting a refund because I cant find any information about future development but with just a little more detail, like being able to break up the different parts of the brain, I think this game could be an amazing study tool and really cool to play around with. \n\n","timestamp_created":1602654146,"timestamp_updated":1602654146,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.635106027126312256","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3bHokvUCfeThpwI="}
