The only other game on their resume on this platform is Recursion Deluxe.\n\n[h1] What [/h1]\n\nYou play as a female or male cat and the purpose, according to the description, is to get back home to your loved ones. Apparently, God, life, the atmosphere, the universe are completely against this because everything and anything is trying to kill you. What did you do to tick so many off? It's an old-schooled hard as all get out RNG platformer...do what you will with that.\n\n[h1] Where [/h1]\n\ndoes this go wrong, exactly? First of all, by creating a game like this, you're alienating a very large audience. You're only hope is for the masses to love this, for some reason, or a Youtuber to play this and it seem like it's better than it actually is; causing a stampede of purchases. if you're in it to make games, then, I can't touch ya but if you're in tis to make money.....eeeeennnnnhhhh you may be going about this the wrong way. The other game on the resume, Recursion Deluxe, is exactly the same thing. The only difference here is that the main character is an anthro cat which comes off as \"baity\" rather than original. Also, some stages are a one-shot and that sucks. You'll be forced to start over due to beginner traps as well as bad RNG, the falling fireballs being hidden the scoreboard, inconsistent hit boxes on the fireballs (On the bridge stage, you can pass right through them sometimes but if you touch even a pixel behind them its instant death). \n\n[h1] Why [/h1]\n\nshould you play this? Another notch on the belt to prove how hardcore you are, I suppose. This goes to veteran masochists and people who complain about people like me but secretly play anyway just to see if they stack up...you know who you are...\n\n[h1] How [/h1]\n\ndoes it stack up? It doesn't stand out in any particular way. You move and you jump. That's it. You're opinion of how this game stacks up is completely dependent on your kaizo resume. In my opinion, it's in the middle in terms of difficulty. Replays are obviously a must for games like this but once I got the hang of it; I was able to breeze pretty quickly after about three tries or so.\n\n[h1] Is [/h1]\n\nIts a buck and it's not long. To be honest; I'm getting kinda tired of these games but it was serviceable enough. I didn't have a bad time playing; it's just becoming a bit too \"samey\" for me. \n\nYeah, thumbs up from me, here. Again, no \"meh' button but it does lean more to the positives than toward the negatives as the things that I complained about are easily worked around unless you're just poor at reaction or just plain unlucky. The only reason why I can see or understand passing this up is because you have some kind of 'standards\". I would classify this as baby's first kaizo. The presentation, controls, and music are okay enough and the price seems reasonable to me. if you're looking to try the more \"gut-punchy\" games; this might not be a bad start.","timestamp_created":1606001687,"timestamp_updated":1606001687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nZ/K9vUCe9nirwI="}
