What I got was a version of the base game that looks like the sims are rebuilding after the zombie apocalypse. Visually Evergreen Harbor is very unimpressive, especially the docks. This pack implements a few interesting concepts like: Voting for different initiatives to impact your eco footprint, changes in the environment based on what you vote for and how much power and water you use, being able to recycle stuff in order to create stuff you already have or don't need. The new careers are also fantastic and pay well, the activities also make you feel as though you are making a difference in the world. The goal of a \"green fiend\" is to contribute to a greener environment by following a strict set of rules. You may have to live without certain commodities (if you care about the environment) like TVs, computers, electronics, etc. You could also live in a crummy \"off-the-grid\" home (I definitely do not recommend) and have your power and water shut off regularly. However, you can combat your footprint by planting trees, using wind and solar power, and also conserve water. Sometimes your effect doesn't make much sense, for example, last night I was playing and a random old lady sim told me that the trees told her about my small TV and computer destroying the ecosystem. So she came over and literally destroyed both of them until I had beat her up to leave my house. It sure was interesting, but my plan is to move my sims out of the harbor ASAP. It seems as if the voting and eco footprint concepts translate to the base game and other DLC (I'm actually not 100% sure about that), but overall the DLC is meh. If you're looking to keep playing Sims 4, this is still a good pack, but get it on sale and don't pay full price.","timestamp_created":1609877055,"timestamp_updated":1609877055,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44cyJ6vYCd/LmwAI="}
