    review: 'Terrible game. The game mechanics are frustrating a feel buggy. The polish
      feels quite low but maybe that''ll translate into a longer campaign. It does
      have a low price point. I''m not really interested in playing it so I''m not
      sure how long it actually takes to complete.


      It sort of has elements of an escape room [spoiler]to unlock the actual game
      then has odd mechanics for the more actiony areas.[/spoiler] I could see it
      being useful for streamer wanting an oddball game to over react to. I could
      also see a strange demographic of people who play games for a funny bad experience
      but it was made this way on purpose.


      If you buy play within the 2 weeks so you can refund if you are not happy with
      your purchese, I did not. I did at least get on sale and isn''t that pricy to
      begin with.'
