It is similar to the games Sword of Xolan (mobile) or Devious Dungeons 1 & 2 (mobile and PC). We need a name for this sub-genre.\n\nI have completed all of the above, and this one compares favorably to them. The levels seem a bit longer to me and definitely more difficult, and the action is a bit slower. There is a good amount of jumping from moving platforms over saw blades and things like that. Those are actually more of a challenged than the enemies. The controls are fine and I really have no complaints about anything. There are checkpoints in the longer levels.\n\nI bought it on sale at release for about $2. It's now $10. I 'm not sure I would pay $10 for any game like this, including the ones mentioned above. But it is well done and fun. It's up to you if it's worth the price.","timestamp_created":1580768570,"timestamp_updated":1580768697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568204164505004883","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1580915902,"developer_response":"Thank you very much :)"}],"cursor":"AoJ4qoPKhvACetOI8AE="}
