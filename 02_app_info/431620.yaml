    review: 'Bought this just to support the devs.


      The soundtrack is great imo for being made by one person. (Daniel Brown)


      Comes with FLACs too and you can mess with the debuffs and stuff to add onto
      the songs.


      Overall worth for anyone that loves this game enough and it''s music.'
