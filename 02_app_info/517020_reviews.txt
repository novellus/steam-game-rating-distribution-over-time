Been fooling around with the possibility of making a video Review on this but this seems a bit easier to do for now.\n\nVirtual Warfighter is one of the coolest tactical shooters on the market, it's terrible! Now how does that make sense? Well it's mainly because it's dead and have no players ever as well as no bots. The devs are working on bots, but they've been working on bots for the past 3 years so you know...probably not gonna happen until i'm married or something.\n\nNow the weapon handling, gunplay, everything about how this game feels is great! The teamwork you can have with players, nades around corners, even doing simple things like planting a bomb is extreamly solid feeling. Not sure how defusing the bomb works because i've never gotten the chance to do it with the 2 times I got to play with someone else.\n\nThe maps are amazing as well, you can tell a lot of love and care went into these, with the lighting, the background noise. There is a police station that's amazing for CQC, and a desert map that can go to extream ranges, so you have something for every kind of gun build. Oh yeah the customization is also really good, you can put almost anything you want in the armory on the firearms you have as long as it has a rail. It's all great and maybe the most disheartening thing ever at the same time. I can only say good things about this game because...well yeah it's GOOD! It's really good, but it's just dead and overshadowed by other games like Pavlov or Onward. It's a real shame too, I could see this easily taking over both of them.\n\nAll in all, i'd keep my eye on it but...don't get your hopes up. Last update was in 2017, but they are active on there discord and ARE working on the game. They can just only do it part time, the game isn't profitable and they have to make a living outside of it somehow. If you have a large group of friends though, I'd pick it up 100%, pretty much it'll be you and your friends own private video game. If it's just you though....Ehhhhhhh, give it a pass unless you find it for really cheap.","timestamp_created":1509224911,"timestamp_updated":1609309748,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwsr+V2fYCeZ/WiQE="}
