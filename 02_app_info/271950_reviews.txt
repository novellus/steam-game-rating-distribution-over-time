Then got to the chapter where the boy and girl switch. Then the game launches with no sound. Tried troubleshooting all I couldf. All other games and apps work fine. Something likely corrupt with the install, so no choice but to uninstall. Not gonna bother waiting for it to download and reinstall - or play email tag with customer support. Just unistall and move on to another game.","timestamp_created":1523185750,"timestamp_updated":1523185750,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.409090906381607056","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/8G80uICfJ7jnQE="}
