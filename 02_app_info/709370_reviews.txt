I'd simply say: \n\n-Yes! For being a fast shooter game i had lots of fun with it. It's both fun and challanging (at times) \nIf you're looking for a story driven game, this is not for you. However, if you're trying to kill some time i recommend this game. If gaming alone ain't for you and gets boring, compete with your friends for the highest highscore. This is simply a download and play type of game. No real introduction is needed. \n\nI love the bullet time feature in the game. At times it gets stressful with enemies coming all around you, if you're not on high alert on your surroundings you will probably die within minutes. The bullet time helps you relax a little bit in the stressful environment. \n\nAnother reason why i like this game is the surroundings. I feel there's some variety between the diffrent stages. Wich helps keeping you intressted. However, i would like to see a more variety of weapons in a form of DLC(?) But as for now, i had a great time playing it. \n\nAs of my understanding BeBold is a fairly new game devoloper thats a little bit rough on the edges but got a really good start. I can't wait to see what you hold for other games in the future. I'm a though critic but i'd rate this game 8/10 there are room for improvement like always in newly released games. \n\nKeep up the good work.","timestamp_created":1506539835,"timestamp_updated":1506540175,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507317066192626953","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46dey4t4Cee26hgE="}
