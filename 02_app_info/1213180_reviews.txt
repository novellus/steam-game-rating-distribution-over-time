It was not worth the discounted, from $65, price of $45 that I spent on it. I get that everything is low poly and that is fine, but it is far too low poly, you loose tons of detail and there are horrible clipping issues. Also don't be fooled by the screenshots of this game, it does not include any form of hair, capes, hats, body styles, body size adjustments, or color options. \nThe posing is interesting in that it plays idle animations that you pause and then download. The downside to this is that it does not include any further posing modification abilities. \nLastly it seems that the developers put very little thought into the fact that people are actually going to be 3d printing these files, a lot of the parts are very skinny, some of the poses have 1 or both feet off the base, and the other posing options would be a nightmare to support. Most people go to low poly minis because they are easy to 3d print and require less supporting, This software however disregards that entirely. \nI would try this again in the future if the developers truly put some major effort into fixing a lot of the issues.","timestamp_created":1609559221,"timestamp_updated":1609559221,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sJTN4PYCeL7NvwI="}
