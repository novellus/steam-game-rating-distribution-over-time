    review: '[h1] Great puzzle game that deserves way more attention! [/h1]

      This is a Sokoban-style puzzle game, except that it is a side-scroller, but
      since your main characters are fish in water, you can move freely in all four
      directions just like in classic Sokoban, with the twist being that (most) blocks
      sink, and can kill (most) characters if they fall onto them. You also control
      at least two characters per level, not restricted to the two fish you start
      off with, as you encounter more playable characters as you progress, and some
      levels you can control up to four characters! You can move one character at
      a time, though, swapping between each one whenever you wish. Each character
      has their own innate abilities!


      The puzzles are all of the highest quality, albeit very challenging, with no
      two puzzles feeling the same, and there are more than 100 levels (This is from
      what I heard, as I''m not even close to half way through at the moment; this
      game is damn hard!). You also get an interesting, if a bit corny story loosely
      based on the TV show X-Files, with nice humour and decent voice-acting. There
      are also unlockable bonuses such as jigsaws, videos and bonus levels!


      The game does feel a bit dated, especially graphics-wise, and the music is forgettable,
      but in terms of quality of puzzles, I would rank this game up there with titles
      such as Baba is You, Stephen''s Sausage Roll and Snakebird. Its core mechanics
      may be simpler and perhaps less interesting compared to these games (with Baba
      is You being on a level on its own due to its ingenious concept; I may be biased
      cuz it''s my all-time favourite puzzle game!), the game manages to be as challenging,
      if not more, despite its relatively simple mechanics. On top of that, the variety
      of characters (which I love) with different abilities offers something that
      these other games lack!


      This game is a huge improvement from the first Fish Fillets, with a vastly higher
      production value, less restrictive rules and way more features. It''s a shame
      it has gotten this little publicity. If they were to make a Fish Fillets 3 with
      puzzles of equal quality while adding better, modern graphics and more polished
      presentation, characters and features, I''m sure it would get the attention
      it deserves among puzzle fans, as long as it gets marketed properly. I, for
      one, would buy it in a heartbeat, and would even fund its development if I had
      more money! I love sea creatures! XD'
