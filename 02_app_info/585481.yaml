    review: "I already reviewed Episode 1 and 2 on the Steam page of each episode,\
      \ so here, I am going to talk only about episode 3 only. \n[list][/list] I want\
      \ to mention, as I did before, some key factors that will be present throughout\
      \ the whole game, that concern graphics and soundtrack! For a 2018 game the\
      \ graphics are pretty OK, I can notice a glimpse of a very peculiar art style,\
      \ given a caricaturistic look to the characters and highlighting a lot of facial\
      \ traces and details. In regard to the soundtrack, it is quite immersive and\
      \ it fits like a glove in the game and contributes to this atmosphere of mystery,\
      \ suspense and occultism.\n[list][/list] But let's get back to the episode!\
      \ And so far so good, like the other episodes, Episode 3 did not disappoint.\
      \ My main concern is that the episode is small and like happened on Episode\
      \ 2 you are mainly revisiting the same places all over again. But luckily the\
      \ history do not disappoint and the puzzles available were fun and very challenging,\
      \ as always. The game is getting darker and strange, in a good way, and honestly\
      \ I do not know what to expect anymore.\n[list][/list] But I don\u2019t want\
      \ to get into details, the game is history driven so any detail could be a spoiler\
      \ to someone. So far I really enjoyed it! Fully recommend this game! [list][/list]\
      \ (Don't forget to check my review of the other episodes on the Steam page of\
      \ each one of them)."
