    review: Gladiator-styled mech. Similar to Contessa, but with some extra quirks
      to make her more of an aggressive rushdown-styled character. The sword flurry
      special is really strong and easy to cancel into, allowing for some easy and
      highly damaging combos. Her shield is unique in that she can shield bash and
      move while using it, but it overheats faster. The rising sword is a bit worse
      than Contessa's skeleton arm, but can be fun to catch whiffs with, and the ultimate
      can dominate in free-for-alls. Overall, very fun mech, each new release to this
      game just keeps getting better!
