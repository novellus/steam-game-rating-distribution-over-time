    review: 'Paper Beast is not quite like anything else, which I guess is why I''m
      enjoying it so much.


      The world is somewhat open (though the player is herded into a fairly narrow
      pathway through it) and feels spacious.  The low-poly graphics are almost abstract,
      yet well-lit enough and with good enough ambient sound support to feel convincing
      and provide immersion.  Lighting and sky effects are remarkably good, with dawn/sunset
      fx and thunderstorms over a vast desert landscape.  Water doesn''t really try
      to be realistic, yet is remarkably wet and believable.  Occasional "special"
      items in the landscape cause instant teleportation to nearby spots.  It''s a
      world of constant discoveries.  My initial experience was a delightful sense
      of disorientation and wonder, like walking into a strange but enjoyable dream.


      The fantastic Dada-esque animals are the essential feature though, and they''re
      simply wonderful:  clearly related to familiar creatures like wolves, horses,
      elk, jellyfish, crabs and so on, yet weirdly different and all apparently made
      of paper.  Though their forms are abstract and surreal, their body language
      and sounds are strangely lifelike and affecting.  They convey wariness, alarm,
      weariness, thirst, busy purpose, confusion, a whole spectrum of moods and emotions.


      Best of all, (so far) I have encountered no creature that can harm me or shows
      any intention of harming me.  Instead, they go about their natural business
      and my task is to help them, sometimes rescue them, other times gently manipulate
      them into modifying the environment to assist my forward progress.  This increases
      the gentle and dreamlike quality of the gameplay;  eventually I start to feel
      a kinship with these creatures large and small.  I enjoy watching them and trying
      to figure out what they''re doing.  I feel pity and sorrow and a real sense
      of urgency when they''re in distress, and genuine satisfaction when I can rescue
      them.


      I have no idea what the overall campaign is;  so far, I''ve progressed slowly,
      savouring every moment.  I know I''ll be sorry when this game is over, so I''m
      in no hurry.  The animal NPCs seem to have their own AI logic and respond interactively
      to each other and to my movements and actions;  there are no canned dialogues.  Even
      though I can''t help noticing that I''m being herded or guided on a defined
      path through the scenery, the fresh and interesting behaviours of the animals
      make each new puzzle area entertaining.


      The puzzles are not terribly difficult, at least so far.  You have to learn
      to think in the game''s logic, which is to perturb the ecosystem around you
      just enough to get the animals'' natural behaviour to work to your advantage
      (think Joel Salatin of Polyface Farm explaining the "pigness of the pig" and
      the "chicken-ness of the chicken").  I won''t say more than that because this
      game is too beautifully realised to spoil for any new player.  Like some of
      the great literature of childhood, the first "reading" (playthrough) is a truly
      magical experience that would be spoilt by foreknowledge.


      Highly recommended for animal lovers, explorers, puzzle solvers, amateur or
      professional naturalists, and those with a taste for the unusual and creative
      in game design.  So far, I would say this game is suitable for most ages, certainly
      12 and up.  It might be a little scary for very young players.  (Note:  the
      opening sequence or intro is really weird and not representative of the rest
      of the game!).  I look forward to spending a few more hours in this fantastic
      (literally) world and know it will be over too soon...  Huge props to the developers
      who have achieved something very fine here, an original work of art and not
      "just another VR game."
