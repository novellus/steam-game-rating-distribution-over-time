Good for scrubs and whips. I love it for the tighter supercross tracks. only downside is the rider hands arent on the handlebars but if you ride in third person you would never know and if you ride in first person its easy to forget about it.","timestamp_created":1543221955,"timestamp_updated":1543221955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m8nMp+cCffuvswE="}
