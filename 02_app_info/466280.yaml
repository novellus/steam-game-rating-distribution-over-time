    review: "To be fair this is one of the least buggy games I have encountered in\
      \ the under 10 dollar indie section. The only real bug is the occasional enemy\
      \ flying straight up into nothingness. It runs fine and the partial controller\
      \ support may as well be listed as full controller support since everything\
      \ functions well as far as I know of.\n\nThat said, this game just doesn't really\
      \ have anything of interest to me. The shooting is meh, your enemies are just\
      \ a bunch of cubes that zerg you while you shoot them down.  The \"puzzles\"\
      \ are more along the lines of either get through timed obstacles to reach things\
      \ to unlock doors or go across a bunch of timed platforms that lead in different\
      \ paths until you find the right path. \n\nIt all feels very lackluster, even\
      \ falling to your death is just a slow fall down and then the music does a mini\
      \ fade out and resets. I mean, at least give me some kind of sound when I fall\
      \ off.\n\nI was expecting something more musical or rhythmic like beat hazard\
      \ or crypt of the necrodancer but honestly the background sounds pretty awful\
      \ half the time and beside some obstacles that move and make a sound when they\
      \ move there isn't really much rhythm required. \"Player generated procedural\
      \ music\" hasn't really seemed to be a thing yet, especially if you consider\
      \ that the maps are all predesigned levels and you can't input music I'm not\
      \ entirely sure how \"player generated procedural music\" would even be possible\
      \ beside the sound of you shooting enemies.\n\nThe game description on steam\
      \ talks describes the setting as a place where \"the most peculiar and unfortunate\
      \ of events have occurred.\" But beside the plot actually written in the steam\
      \ description there isn't much to find. In the game itself all I could find\
      \ were these nodes in game which would open an image with some pictures and\
      \ some stuff that's supposed to be alien language or something.\n\nAll in all,\
      \ couldn't keep my attention in any way, so not recommended."
