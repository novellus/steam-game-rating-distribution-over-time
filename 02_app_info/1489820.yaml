    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">About Zombrio</h2>Zombrio is a fun game about
      supply chains and zombies. Your goal is to survive as long as possible and endure
      as many enemy waves as you can.<h2 class="bb_tag">How to Play Zombrio</h2>The
      game is divided into day and night. During the day you will be safe, so use
      this time wisely to prepare and mine resources. Start by building your base
      and placing crystal miners. If your miners are far away from you, you can buy
      workers to collect resources. To defend your base and survive the night, you
      will need defensive towers; since those require ammunition, you will have to
      build factories to produce them; these factories require resources, you will
      have to build mines to extract them.<br>At night, zombies will spawn and attack
      your buildings. Every day the zombies steadily get stronger, and every 10 waves
      a zombie boss will spawn. The game is lost when your Base is destroyed.<h2 class="bb_tag">Highly
      Replayable</h2>Each game starts with a new configuration of available resources.
      This configuration must be carefully considered when placing your base and will
      change your strategy from game to game.<h2 class="bb_tag">Unique buidings</h2>Each
      building has strengths and weaknesses. Place them carefully to make sure you
      are using them to their full potential and always make sure they have plenty
      of ammo.<h2 class="bb_tag">Enemy Abilities</h2>As the day turns into the night
      the waves of Zombies become harder. Zombies will evolve various abilities that
      will challenge even the most titanic defenses.<h2 class="bb_tag">Random word</h2>Each
      game is different, the map is randomly generated, zombies spawn at a random
      location. Resources are spawned at random locations.<h2 class="bb_tag">Research
      tree</h2>Over 30 upgrades to research and more come soon.<h2 class="bb_tag">Upgrade
      system</h2>Every building has infinite levels to upgrade. Do you want one tower
      that shoots through the whole map? No problem!<br>Do you want a miner that mine
      over 12M resources every sec? No Problem!<h2 class="bb_tag">Lots of enemies</h2>Zombrio
      handles over 50.000 zombies.<h2 class="bb_tag">Workers</h2>Workers are good
      for some basic tasks like collecting resources. They are afraid of zombies.
      So at night, they will shelter in the base.<h2 class="bb_tag">Robots</h2>In
      mid-game, you can unlock robots - They are like workers, but they work 24/7.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Army</h2>If you build barracks every minute will spawn a warrior.
      They can follow you, or protect your base.

    review: 'This game makes no sense, none of the objects have collision, the game
      doesn''t tell you how to play it and for some reason houses cost crystal. Also
      the progression seems to be slow and I don''t know whats going on. There also
      seems to be no options within the game, I was not able to turn down sound in
      the game.


      Overall, the game isn''t worth any amount of money, what is there can barely
      be considered a game.'
