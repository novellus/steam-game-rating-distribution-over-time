The only problems it suffers from are typical of these retro based new age games. WIth new age devs as much as I wish they were from the golden age they aren't so will add new age stuff to these games. The thing with this game and I bought it for IOS is that it is a clicker game. You just either tap on phone or click on screen. No control pad for phone and no aswd movement for pc. I am still playing but it was a 12/10 star game now it's about a 6/10 purely because of lack of options. I don't think I can recommend this not because  isn't amazing not because it isn't awesome but because when it was me who was being recommended instead I got super excited just to get shot down after buying the game. All over no adding controls.","timestamp_created":1609254239,"timestamp_updated":1609254239,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sd/B1/YCdN67vgI="}
