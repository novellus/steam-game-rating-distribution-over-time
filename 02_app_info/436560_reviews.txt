But at this point for early access the gameplay is a bit clunky but it works. Most of gameplay involves instanced dungeons of various types and levels that you can run solo or in groups. Decent class devlopment but it is clearly a work in progress. The itemization shows promise but needs work still. I would say the game is on its way to a solid 7 out of 10 if they can fix animations, hit boxes, and many other areas.\n\nOther cash grab from them to avoid:","timestamp_created":1483769171,"timestamp_updated":1606093478,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493227452039718628","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh7Oo+fUCdIH3bg=="}
