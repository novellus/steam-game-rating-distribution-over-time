    review: 'I''d say that this is probably my favourite of the ''Realistic'' coasters.
      Though I don''t know if some of the things in this are that realistic.


      The ride starts off quite suddenly with a plunge downwards taking you around
      and about in the darkness till you reach the house, there''s a few decent scares
      in here nothing gory but a couple of ghostly jump scares to scare your friends
      with. A very good atmosphere in this one and by the end you don''t know what''s
      going to jump out at you (well unless you''ve ridden it before)


      Overall I''d say this one is worth the price on it''s own and definitely if
      you get it as part of the bundle.

      hoping for a few extra scares in the future.'
