Just playing the default mix as ordered is a wonderful experience, with high low / intensity portions of the OST sorted almost onto a per-track basis so you can skip past 'chill' songs if you like. (I never would, since they're some of the strongest portions of the playlist)\n\nUpon download, files are dropped into (...)\\steamapps\\common\\Geo as bare .mp3s, which is all I'd ever ask for. \n(More discerning ears can find the artist's bandcamp page under the artist's name 'injekted' if they want FLAC or other formats)\n\nExcellent work, Injekted\nTry to get your buddy to plug your bandcamp on the game descriptions so I don't have to dig around to find you.","timestamp_created":1571107076,"timestamp_updated":1571107258,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6cfS5u0CcqiR1AE="}
