I'm newer to sprint car racing and wanted to try it, but thought road courses would be an interesting addition, and so I snagged this pack when I bought the game. The core oval racing in this title absolutely holds up well enough to carry the whole thing, turns out, but I still wanted to goof around on these, because I loved back in the earlier days of licensed racing games where fantasy courses would pad out the roster with inventive, challenging places. I hoped this would fill that niche.\n\nSure does!\n\nThese courses are definitely more a surreal rallycross-style experience than the minute-to-minute wheel-to-wheel action of most events in the game, but they're just straight-up fun and a wonderful change of pace. The AI is competent and tough here, but not unbeatable; usually, weirder track layouts in these sorts of games tend to come at the expense of single-player gameplay quality, but not here. And as someone not too invested in the ASCoC itself or its roster, I find myself using the custom paint schemes included here on a regular basis, as well, especially the Shadow.\n\nI wouldn't say it's a must-buy to be able to enjoy the game or anything, of course. What I can very happily say is, if you're looking at this and thinking \"hey, this seems like it'd be fun\", it is!","timestamp_created":1593992500,"timestamp_updated":1593992500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563492059707641602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsurWkPMCdpmSkwI="}
