Didnt think that was possible with pinball. :)\nThe ball drops too easy out the sides, with no insurance, (Kickback, Extra ball, shoot again) too many loops and often when you hit the center, it throws it back exactly down center, nearly impossible to counter. \nVERY frustrating. The other tables are ok though i guess. Nothing great, kinda mediocre.\n\nI give it a weak thumbs up.\n","timestamp_created":1593778292,"timestamp_updated":1593778292,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0tilivMCe7a5kgI="}
