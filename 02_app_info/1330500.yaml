    about_the_game: "Ahead is a slab based puzzle game, in which every movement is\
      \ decisive and which in you'll have to step up your logic talents to finish\
      \ the hardest levels. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlan ahead your next move to not get\
      \ stuck or get vaporized before reaching the exit of the 50 different levels\
      \ and pick enough energy prisms to bring your light back to life. Without your\
      \ full energy you can't stop moving until you hit a wall or interact with certain\
      \ slabs so you have to be careful what will be the consequences of your choices."

    short_description: Playing as a light cube, you're falling short on energy and
      you need to collect energy prisms to get your power back to escape the darkness.
      The more prisms you get, the stronger your light will become, but can you survive
      until you pick enough ?
