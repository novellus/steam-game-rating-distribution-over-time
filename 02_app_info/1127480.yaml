    review: 'This is... a surprisingly impressive feat for one guy. After the halfway-point,
      Landon (the protagonist) has many physical changes, hair cut, clothes change,
      injuries, a completely new type of primary weapon, at one point getting straight
      up covered in blood... and I appreciate that the dev took the time to show all
      this in the pixel art. There''s WAY too much detail in the smaller areas here,
      for a game that''s been out for this long and received on the verge of literally
      no attention.


      I have so many thoughts floating in my head about this game now that I''ve completed
      it, what made the story so baffling and what made the gameplay so... everywhere
      but here''s what I can really grasp:


      This game is a mixed bag, a true hodgepodge of locations, gameplay elements,
      and whatever else. Several times, I quit out of the game after dying again and
      not having any soul for my necklace to revive with so I got booted back to a
      frustratingly long title screen. And yet...

      I kept coming back to it, more often than I have other games I''d throw down
      in annoyance. Visually, it has a fantastic charm to it with subtle touches that
      are just really nice, and coding-wise, it''s shockingly sound for how many elements
      are introduced and then abandoned not long after, save for the bank because
      I ended up with... some 60,000 silver and NOTHING to use it on. (My guess is
      that it was that Tiki I bought but IDK honestly.)

      The biggest problem I have with the game is that Picaro could be written out
      of the story entirely and the only thing it would ultimately change is the very
      ending. You don''t learn of why he''s helping Landon until the very, very end,
      and they straight up get separated for a third of the game or so, and then the
      ending chapters are played with him nowhere in sight either, again, until the
      very end. And it sucks because I adore his cat and fox forms and I just like
      the idea of him in general so for him to be there for so little of the actual
      game, really, is just kinda sad.


      Overall? Go play the dang thing. It''s flawed and its story struggles to hold
      up under too many questions (in my eyes), but it''s got a lot of heart, and
      the dev deserves to see some praise for what has been accomplished here.'
