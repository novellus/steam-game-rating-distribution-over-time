The controls are not overtly-complicated yet the game remains very challenging (I've yet to get even a single win, for example). I always play this as a Human Warrior, because I am masochistic, and god damnit I WILL win as a Human Warrior haha.\n\nGood points: \n[list]\n[*]A great dev who routinely updates his game, perhaps a bit TOO much (more on this later) \n[*]Controls that don't require a membership to MENSA to figure out\n[*]Good graphics, especially for a genre that usually has either poor ones or none at all / ASCII\n[*]An interesting array of different items, wands, armor, and weapons to find. Finding a special piece of gear off some named enemy is very satisfying!\n[*]Even though I use only 1 class and race there are a ton of different ones from which to choose. Mummies don't need to eat, Ogres are really strong but can't move diagonally, etc. I appreciate that they're in there, even if I'll never play them.\n[*]Cool little 'side events' are littered throughout: Timed gates for bonus treasure, Crystal chests that give you a choice between different rewards, named monsters in special little rooms, etc. It really helps break things up a lot.\n[/list]\n\nNot-so-good points:\n[list]\n[*]Updates SOMETIMES make things a bit worse than before. By this I mean the UI is contantly changing, not always for the better. I do realize that perfecting your game's UI is difficult and it can never seem \"quite right\" but IMO the UI looked its best maybe 2 or 3 updates ago. \n[*]I wish there were more merchants to find. Dont' get me wrong- they're in there, but I never seem to find many at all. I've had runs where my guy has traversed 10 floors or so and never saw anyplace to spend my hard-earned money. And I explore basically 100% of every floor too. That's RNG for ya!\n[*]Eventually projectile-shooting enemies will gang bang you to death. If you happen upon the lava levels for example there are many enemies you live in the lava you can't really get at and they'll shoot you all the live long day.\n[*]I realize it's probably just a drawback for the entire genre but I really notice having to click, click, click, click in this to move around. This is mostly because your guy will auto-stop whenever danger is spotted, which is nice, however it will keep happening even after your guy has spotted trouble and you're moving to intercept the threat. I don't know how else this could be programmed though.\n\n--\n\nBut overall, this is a big YES. My favorite roguelikes lately would be both this and another (free) game called The Ground Gives Way (TGGW for short). That one is colored ASCII art but very well-worth a try. I just got my first win with that one this past week. Maybe I'll get my RF3 win this week too!","timestamp_created":1609952150,"timestamp_updated":1609952150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566929101943969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwn4io7PYCdLeGwQI="}
