    review: 'Clean up clyde is a great NES like game that harkens back to the classics
      single screen arcade games like Donkey Kong or Space invaders, despite its simplicity
      there''s a fair amount of content here with different game styles and a different
      game mode entirely.


      If you want some bite sized fun to kill some time, I recommend the Clean up
      Clyde Collection.'
