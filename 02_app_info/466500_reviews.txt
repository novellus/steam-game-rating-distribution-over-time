The story did not make much sense to me since the translation was not 100% accurate.\n\nThe game looks dated(but hey it's from 2016). Also there is alot of tedious walking around and just following your \"friend\", there are some minor puzzles that most people will easily solve. Also, you can take photo's. WHY? I have no idea.\n\nThe few FPS sections in this game are really bad, the controls are so clunky it's just boring to play.\n\nMaybe play it for the story, but in it's current state it will be a neutral for me.\n","timestamp_created":1610051125,"timestamp_updated":1610051125,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48M+h7/YCfIGvwQI="}
