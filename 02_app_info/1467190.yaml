      Ah, who turned of the light?! Well, me! <br />\r\nPlushie Dungeon is game with\
      \ the dungeons, obviously. So be prepared for darkness and things that crawling\
      \ in it. You can put the fire on, but even fire is not going to last forever.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nGet control of Plushie, who is trying to find a friend in\
      \ his lonely existence. Of course, his boss doesn't make it easy for him, and\
      \ Plushie has to feed him regularly. During the search, you will find obstacles\
      \ such as a locked door, which can only be opened with a key found or manufactured.\
      \ The fire goes out and Plushie has to light it himself. Life is not easy in\
      \ the dungeon and money you collect can help you lately. But you need to find\
      \ out on your own!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the end, you will probably be: hungry,\
      \ sleepy, scary, thirsty, coldy, angry and so on. Yeah, some of these thing\
      \ you will also be possesed in the game."
