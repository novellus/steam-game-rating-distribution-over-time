But it does not! I simply cannot stop playing - the vibrant world, colorful graphics, cheerful music, funny characters, and the neat attention to details keeps me glued to the screen. I must pick the all the fruits, feed all the dogs, recycle (who leaves trash near the beach, really!), make all the juices, catch all the fish, learn to craft new things, and Oh its a lot to do when you have a tiny island in Mara! \n\nSummer in Mara is a very cute, super optimistic and pleasant game and I suspect it will keep my attention for quite a while. After 2 hours of trying to stop playing but being unable to, I was not asked to slay anything, nor go explore any dark dungeon, nor become some obscure and mighty hero. This game is a breath of fresh air in a time when we all could use some cheerful optimism on a sunny island with golden beaches. Now please y'all, wish me luck that I can get some sleep - it's 2am!","timestamp_created":1609805259,"timestamp_updated":1609805259,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j9z35/YCcL3GwAI="}
