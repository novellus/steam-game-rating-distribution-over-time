    review: So, Frog-san goes through a series of deadly shinobi training rooms to
      give himself a fighting chance in the snake-eat-frog "real world?"  After beating
      the game with all talismans and flies, seems to me that will be a nice little
      vacation for him.  This [b]is not[/b] another throwaway indie platformer; [i]Dojoran[/i]
      is easily on the top of the heap when it comes to its subgenre, with some of
      the most intelligent and varied level design you'll ever see -- not to mention
      a responsiveness of control that sets it far apart from the rest.  But prepare
      for rage no matter what ending you go for, and for extra-hateful meme-difficulty
      (*wink* *wink*), save [i]all[/i] the flies.
