Tried to find a menu to turn the game volume down, there was none. When I tried to play with a friend, I accidentally chose \"Host Game\" instead of join, and found there was no way back to the main menu that I could find, had to close the game and restart to get to the menu again.\n\nOnce actually in the game it was alright, but nothing special. It was very obscure what to do half the time, no indication of what objects are interactable and which are not. The area in which your hands have to be with an object to interact with it is extremely small. The ropes you climb were very inconsistent to grab because of it. Once you get into the main room it gets a little better, though the last room is really obscure and cluttered to the point that it's distracting and we spent over 10 minutes before we happened onto the mechanic the game was trying to have us perform.\n\nThere was also a lack of rotation options, snap rotation is something that should really be in any game where you're expected to rotate around consistently.\n\nThe lack of a real menu to adjust options, the lack of ability to go back to the starting screens, the lack of feedback from the game (pressing buttons doesn't make and visual or auditory effect to signal that it did something), lack of snap rotation, just made for a generally irritating experience.\n\nOverall the game could use a lot of polish and better game design choices. The puzzles were simple and short, the game has little replayability other than trying to get the lowest score. It's not a bad game, I did get some fun out of it, just not enough for me to recommend, there were more painful moments in the game than enjoyable ones.\n\nThis being said, there weren't that many bugs, even if many mechanics felt stiff, unintuitive, or finicky. The game is only $3 at this point, so expectations weren't that high, so it was a closer call on whether to recommend or not. In the end, after playing it, I felt no desire to replay, thus my decision is not recommended.","timestamp_created":1597287837,"timestamp_updated":1597288499,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ484j08vMCcuSPmwI="}
