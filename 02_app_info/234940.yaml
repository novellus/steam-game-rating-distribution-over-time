    review: "This is an entertaining way to experience John Buchan's 1915 novel The\
      \ 39 Steps (there is also a 1935 Hitchcock film and several other adaptations).\
      \ It is enjoyable, but be aware that it is primarily a visual novel with lots\
      \ of narration and voice acting (although there are still blocks of text that\
      \ are not voiced). There are some stylized animated segments, but most of the\
      \ graphics are stills (usually with a digitally painted style) that fade, pan,\
      \ and zoom in sequence. \n\nThe player has a lot of control over the the pace\
      \ of the story sequences, but there is no fast forward button or rewind button\
      \ for some sequences. There are limited elements of a hidden object type game\
      \ that is usually easy, but on occasion the player might click on the object\
      \ that triggers a change in scene before everything was fully explored. It is\
      \ easy to get all of the achievements though. \n\nI did find a few voice acted\
      \ sequences in the middle chapters that had voice sequences initiating twice,\
      \ making a slightly annoying echo effect, in what must have been an unintentional\
      \ bug (at least on my install). I cannot fault the presentation as a whole -\
      \ the voice acting is superb, the visuals / music / sound create an aura of\
      \ suspense, and the fluff text of newspapers draw the reader into a sense of\
      \ belonging to the period. Overall good, atmospheric, exciting."
