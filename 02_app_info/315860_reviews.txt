Can't wait to play it again with a different character!\nSome reviews criticize that the game is too short, but I prefer shorter games, so it fits my taste perfectly! As a working adult I can't do a zillion of sub quests and finding people's lost dogs as you have to do in most RPGs. This one is simple and straight to the point. \n\nThe battles are a little easy, but still fun and well balanced. I really like that characters heal automatically after a battle. It make the game play so hassle free (but it's still challenging, since characters who fell in battle will receive a HP \"penality\" for the next battle until healed at a church).\n\nThe design team was obviously strongly influenced by Valkyrie Profile and since I loved that game too, I'm happy to see the resemblence. \n\nI also really enjoyed the story! It starts a little slow (but not in a bad way, it gives you time to warm up to the characters before the real story starts) and gets better and better towards the end. \n\nI'm really looking forward to the contuniation of this game! \n","timestamp_created":1609251633,"timestamp_updated":1609251633,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49ua31/YCepq6vgI="}
