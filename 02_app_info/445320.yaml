    review: 'The starter pack is great for beginning players because it gives them
      10 days of Patron Status plus the items you start out with are very useful like
      the backpack/bank expanders.


      Don''t forget that when you buy this DLC you have to use the given code on  Trion
      Worlds website then you choose what character to use it on.'
