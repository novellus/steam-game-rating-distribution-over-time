    review: This game was one of those really pleasant surprises for me. I enjoyed
      playing each and every mission because none of them gave me the feeling that
      i can't wait for it to be over so i can move on to the next. I really liked
      the idea behind the Story and the voice actors were amazing at helping telling
      it (almost gave me goosebumps). I found a few minor glitches here and there
      but none of them broke the immersion that his game manages to pull the player
      into. I recommend this game to anyone that is a simulation / Sci-Fi / strategy
      fan.
