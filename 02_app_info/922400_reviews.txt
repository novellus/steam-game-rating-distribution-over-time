The gameplay, soundtracks, all feels early 32-bit retro. It's very basic but very good game for that era, around when Windows 98 was latest.\nThe 20th edition is half-remastered that supports mouse for game menu interface, session save, somewhat remastered textures, and some rebuilt power-ups that is slightly different than original version.  \nDue to change of power-ups, it is not exactly the same experience of the old game. Also, some textures, especially paddle, does not look like high resolution. But, it's still good port, and just enough for recalling memories when you played breakout clones with your ball mouse, and/or early optical mouse.\n\nAnd that soundtracks are still great. You got only one normal ball and that invincible bricks are blocking laser and also ball access? That soundtrack got you covered until the game decides to thunder that uncomfortable bricks to oblivion.","timestamp_created":1609493293,"timestamp_updated":1609518825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44oez3/YCetasvwI="}
