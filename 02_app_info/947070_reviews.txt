This training takes you 5 weeks and after 5 weeks you perform your play in front of an audience... afterwards criticians will review your play.\n\nThere are many choices how to design the play and so this game has a high replay value. Also these decisions are bound to archeivements so if you´re into archeivements you can get some archeivements here by re playing the game.\n\nAside from being a director there is some background story happening. There are two families not really happy about each other (to speak friendly about the situation). It is intended to make such an incredible good performance in your play - the play is shown to members of these families - that they settle down whatever they do not like about each other.\n\nFamily members will talk to the protagonist to play... and other things happen in the background as it is said in the short store-page description.\n\nFor some reason the decision has been made to make this game Furry... Scalie and other Creatures so I´m now going to review this part.\n\nI´ve had played the game from beginning to finish 3 times now and doing so I´ve dated different characters and made different decisions. There are various creatures from the Furry / Scalie and even Mythological universe that you will meet during a play through.\n\nAs I´ve previously written you can date these creatures, the game even gives you a tutorial after some progression and it tells you that ... and how you can date others you might be interested in. With this information I´ve dated a few creatures and I found out that there seem to be two dates during the game. The dates happen between the breaks from the rehersal / training for the play.\n\nThe dates I have had were in a restaurant, being kinda short since the dialouge that was there to read was read in less than one minute. It usually goes like this: You eat and drink together and do some chit-chat... ... the so-called chit-chat is not really described or it´s very short just giving some random background information about the character you are dating. Also the date is not interactive so you just sit there and click through text without the possibility to ask out your date or make suggestions.\n\nI have not dated all of the characters  that you can date but a few, and the one´s I´ve dated were rather silent about themself like they give you a few lines of their background story like \"I did this in the past\" or \"I´m here because...\" ... I think it was something like that but over all the date is over in less than one minute, depending on your reading speed. That´s for the first date.\n\nThe second date happens very late... I think it was before the final play. Aggain you go to the restaurant and talk to each other (Text that is read in 30 seconds) then... I´ve always have it happen that one of the characters comes in and tells you that \"something has happened, you need to come\" - ending the 2nd date.\n\nOther than that I´ve not had any more dating yet. My character neither did kiss his / her (You can play as male or female) Date... nor I´ve had more dates like a 3rd date. Maybe the dates for the other characters are different, but the one´s I´ve had could be sumarized like this: Meet your date in a restaurant, and share a few words...\n\n\nThe characters themself as creatures seem to play a double role. Yes, they are here on screen and occasionly they even show emotions (face and body expressions change) but over all they feel like that they´ve just been put there... to... be there. They show emotions,  but over all their bodies are quite \"stiff\" and if they would be replaced with a stick figure during the game you wouldn´t even notice it ... probably... as you´re busy telling one of the actors how to act in a specific situation. There are hints in the game about the characters as it is stated for example: \"A horseman is a heavy person\" or \"The Dragon´s Scales are really hard\"  but apart from that\nthe characters there seem to be just here... like they are saying \"ignore what I am... what species I am or how I look - we are here to perform a play... I as creature do not matter\". I think I´ve\nalso read that a character says something about him or her being human ( I don´t recall it exactly) that was either a joke or um... it was a reference to the original play being written by a human? I don´t know but it was an odd read. \n\nFrom the technical side the game is quite solid. As it´s a new game and new games occasionly contain bugs, this game is quite clear. Playing through it I´ve only had one ren-py error... and only read like 3-4 typos so far (the typos are like \"Wy\" instead of \"Why\" but you get what is meant to be said even of this) ... apart from that nothing bad has happened with the game.\n\n\nThere are sounds... at least there is an volume adjustment for them in the menu, still ... having sound level all the way up all I could hear sound-wise during my play sessions was a sound when my status with someone had improoved. No open-door ... telephone ring... or other typical sounds were noticeable when I played the game.\n\nMusic is different. Altough there´s the typical visual novel music you´d expect in such a game it´s mixed with suprisingly fresh vocal / guitar music. The songs are used various time during the game and the music also tells you about the over all emotion.\n\nThere are lot of choices to be made, and as the choices you make for designing the play change the play in a strong way... choices outside the play seem to not matter that much. What I want to say is that I´ve had it that often what I did say to a character did not matter at all because it neither gave me stat points... nor changed what followed... so for example if the character says \"This is good\" ... it doesn´t matter if I said the 1st... 2nd... 3rd... or 4th choice before to a situation, he or she will say \"this is good\" - making the fact to have 4 choice options kinda pointless... You won´t notice this on your first play through but you will notice it on your 2nd or 3rd. Also the sentence I wrote was just an example but I remember when you had a dance and you could pick different people, and it didn´t matter who I pick, I ended up with the same situations.\n\nA single play through takes between 90 and 120 minutes depending on your reading speed.\n\nSo... what is it now with this game? Buy or not? Well as I´ve reviewed it positive... since I´m reviewing the create a play part of the game I´d say it depends on what you expect. If you are into Romeo and Juliet and a game that likes humor and has some jokes in it I´m sure you will spend a good time in this game. If you are into these creatures I would say it depends on what you want. Hanging around with them ... just to see a picture of let´s say an antrophomorph Owl... it sure is good for you. If you´re known to other creature related games where the creatures themself are more in the focus you might have a second thought about this specific game.","timestamp_created":1567786361,"timestamp_updated":1567789546,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwob/ig+0CcbHi0QE="}
