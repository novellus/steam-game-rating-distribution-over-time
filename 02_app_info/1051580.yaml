      through a vast and whimsical world with nothing but a magical shield at your

      /><br><br>Your only weapon is your shield.  Blocking enemy projectiles and abilities
      with it allows you to temporarily use them to your advantage.  Pay attention
      to your surroundings as various obstacles can be overcome by using the right
      ones!<h2 class="bb_tag">A NON-LINEAR WORLD</h2><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1051580/extras/teleport.gif?t=1607440320"
      /><br><br>Skjoldur Story has a strong emphasis on non-linearity.  Play at your
      own pace and wander a handcrafted overworld in whichever direction you choose.  Dungeons
      you find can be opened in any order using power stones that are scattered across
      the overworld.  The only exception is the final tower, which remains locked
      until everything else is completed.<h2 class="bb_tag">DISCOVER HIDDEN AREAS</h2><img

      /><br><br>Stumble across secret rooms with hidden treasure or minigame-like
      areas that further you along your adventure in a fun rhythm-breaking way.  Use
      any loot you find to purchase upgrades at various shops to help further you
      along your journey.
