    review: 'A Full Disaster Game for me, because of these reasons:

      - only one level of difficulty and the creatures can take a lot of bullets from
      our weapon.

      - ammunition is unfortunately also in short supply in this game.

      - often you can''t hear or see the creatures just in time coming to hunt you
      down.

      - ridiculous running back and forth to find the next signal on our map.

      - unfortunately, the mouse speed cannot be changed and is much too fast for
      me.
