    about_the_game: "Have you ever wanted to write a song like a pro? Well, you're\
      \ one button click away from writing tunes! And best of all, you own all the\
      \ copyrights to all of your creations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;I can't Believe\
      \ It's Not Music&quot; is your one-stop shop to music creation. It can output\
      \ MIDI files with songs that have from 16 bars up to 11,000 bars. Wow! That's\
      \ enough bars to write a symphony. Wrong! That's plenty of hours to write 35\
      \ symphonies! Double wow! This app supports between 20 and 300 beats per minute.\
      \ So what does that mean in terms of play time? Well, it means your creation\
      \ can last from 12.8 seconds up to 36 hours and 40 minutes. File sizes: 1kB\
      \ ~ 1MB.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf Mozart spent years to write over 200 hours of\
      \ music, you can easily surpass the all-time master with a mere six clicks of\
      \ a button. Now, if that's not good value for money then I don't know what it\
      \ is!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor those who can't live without a spiffy walking bass\
      \ line, you're in for a treat! But if you prefer to play more conservatively,\
      \ you can always fall back to randomly generated bass lines.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThis program is powered by a proprietary algorithm that writes music in an\
      \ instant. Regardless of how you feel about technology and the limits of automation\
      \ in art, you'll definitely be thinking to yourself: &quot;Wow, I can't believe\
      \ it's not music!&quot;"
