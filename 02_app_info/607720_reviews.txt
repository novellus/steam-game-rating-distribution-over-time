The menus are too hard to use. I still can't figure out how to move the sliders without totally screwing up all the settings.\n2.) Darts is a very technical game. You bring the dart to your eye to get a proper aim. But to do that, you'll end up hitting your headset with your controller. Not good.\n3.) The game is so old the developer won't respond to any issues. Understandable, but contributing to the negative review.","timestamp_created":1609711457,"timestamp_updated":1609711457,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rvKR5fYCePaawAI="}
