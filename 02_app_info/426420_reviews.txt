The depravity of the mega-cities, the mundane and yet terrifying setting, serves as the backdrop for the one-man-army Dredd. Hardened, unwavering, decisive, the movie follows what could ultimately just be called \"another day on the job\" for the cop/soldier/judge/jury/executioner. Well acted and cast, the iconic imagery of the comics makes a much better conversion to the \"big screen\" this time around, and what's left is a gem of a film well worth the watch.","timestamp_created":1594005176,"timestamp_updated":1594005176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7JeHkfMCcbuWkwI="}
