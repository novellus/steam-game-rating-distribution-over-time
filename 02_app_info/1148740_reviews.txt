Each boss has a unique look and design with new behaviours and powers. I really enjoyed the difference and stages and levels in this game. \n\nThe lack of sound effects isn't ideal and the music seems a bit repetitive after time. I would recommend this game, however, I would get it on sale. 9/10","timestamp_created":1571261384,"timestamp_updated":1571261447,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4td+e6+0CfPSc1AE="}
