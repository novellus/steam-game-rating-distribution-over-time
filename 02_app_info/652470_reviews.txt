This one has ice, fire, air, water, wind and then two mixed modes of greater difficulty. The arcade ice level is the only one that is easy. I beat it on my second attempt. Unfortunately, the second level fire is much more difficult as the fire color scheme makes things harder to see and objects move much faster. Touch any corner of the hex tunnel or any object and it's restart the level. \n\nGeneric EDM / techno music plays as you move along. Even though the levels have different color schemes and even different geometric shapes, none of them standout and they are all generic and ugly to look at. The best thing about this game is the gaze control is tight, so you do move where you want when you want with no delay. The levels are not long but they are challenging. Unfortunately, they were not fun.\n\nI paid .99 cents USD for this during the Steam Summer Sale 2018. If you like a challenge and like this type of music, then go for it. Otherwise, stay away ... I wish I had done the same.\n\nNormal Price Rating 3/10. Sale Price Rating 4/10.\n\n** [i] you only use the gamepad to press A to start, everything else is done by gaze navigation [/i]","timestamp_created":1540501069,"timestamp_updated":1540501138,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562903821468353271","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpb3B1uYCefaqrQE="}
