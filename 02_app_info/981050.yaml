    review: 'Vast improvement over the last game.


      Sprites are a little smaller so your field of view is increased which is great.
      Levels are more open so it''s fun blasting around. Tons of stars to collect.
      Added in tiny story bits which are fine. This game is lot more fun than part
      3.


      However, there''s still the issue of having to collect 5 red stars in a level
      to get to the bonus stage, and if you die you have to recollect them again.
      Also when I made it to the bonus stage I encountered a big problem twice where
      I collected the giant blue star but the game said I failed to collect it. I
      also collected lots of red stars but achievements didn''t pop up for them either
      so I don''t know what''s going on with that.


      Still a fun game nonetheless.'
