    legal_notice: "ORANGE SEASON END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn\
      \ order to protect Orange Season (our \"Game\") and the members of our community,\
      \ we need these end user license terms to set out some rules for downloading\
      \ and using our Game. This license is a legal agreement between you and us (Hudell\
      \ Tales) and describes the terms and conditions for using the Game. <br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nPublished by SOEDESCO, Koddeweg 13, 3194 DH, Hoogvliet. All rights\
      \ reserved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you buy, download, use or play our Game, you\
      \ are agreeing to stick to the rules of these end user license agreement (\"\
      EULA\") terms. If you dont want to or cant agree to these rules, then you must\
      \ not buy, download, use or play our Game. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nONE MAJOR RULE<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can't distribute anything we have made, unless we specifically\
      \ agree to it. By \"distribute anything weve made\" what we mean is:<br />\r\
      \n - Give copies of our Game to anyone else;<br />\r\n - Make commercial use\
      \ of anything we have made;<br />\r\n - Try to make money from anything we have\
      \ made; or<br />\r\n - Let other people get access to anything we have made\
      \ in a way that is unfair or unreasonable;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nunless we specifically\
      \ agree to it. And so that we are crystal clear, \"the Game\" or \"what we have\
      \ made\" includes, but is not limited to, the software for our Game on all platforms.\
      \ It also includes updates, patches, downloadable content, add-ons, or modified\
      \ versions of a Game, parts of those things, or anything else weve made.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nUSING OUR GAME<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou have been granted a\
      \ license to the Game so you can play and use it, yourself, on your devices.<br\
      \ />\r\nYou can modify the Game files, but you can't distribute those files\
      \ (original or modified).<br />\r\nYou can create new files that modify the\
      \ game (called \"Mods\"). Those new files can be distributed only with the purpose\
      \ of letting other people get access to your modifications.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nThe license and permission we give you to use and play our Game\
      \ can be revoked if you break any of the terms of this EULA.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nWhen you buy our Game, you receive a license that gives you permission to\
      \ install the Game on your own personal device and use and play it on that device\
      \ as set out in this EULA. This permission is personal to you, so you are not\
      \ allowed to distribute the Game (or any part of it) to anyone else. This also\
      \ means you cannot sell or rent the Game, or make it available for access to\
      \ other people and you cannot pass on or resell any license keys. You may however\
      \ give gift codes that have been bought from us. This is important to help us\
      \ stop piracy and fraud and to protect our Game. It is also important to prevent\
      \ members of our community from buying pirated versions of our Game or fraudulent\
      \ license keys - which we may cancel, such as in the case of fraud.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nIf you have bought the Game, you may play around with it and modify\
      \ it by adding modifications, tools, or plugins, which we will refer to collectively\
      \ as \"Mods.\" By \"Mods,\" we mean something original that you or someone else\
      \ created that doesnt contain a substantial part of our copyrightable code or\
      \ content. When you combine your Mod with the Orange Season software, we will\
      \ call that combination a \"Modded Version\" of the Game. We have the final\
      \ say on what constitutes a Mod and what doesnt. You may not distribute any\
      \ Modded Versions of our Game or software, and wed appreciate it if you didnt\
      \ use Mods for griefing. Basically, Mods are okay to distribute; hacked versions\
      \ or Modded Versions of the Game software are not okay to distribute.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nWithin reason youre free to do whatever you want with screenshots\
      \ and videos of the Game. By \"within reason\" we mean that you cant make any\
      \ commercial use of them or do things that are unfair or adversely affect our\
      \ rights. If you upload videos of the game to video sharing and streaming sites\
      \ you are however allowed to put ads on them. Also, dont just rip art resources\
      \ and pass them around.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEssentially the simple rule is do\
      \ not make commercial use of anything we haveve made unless we hveve specifically\
      \ said its okay. Oh and if the law expressly allows it, such as under a \"fair\
      \ use\" or fair dealing\" doctrine then thats ok too - but only to the extent\
      \ that the law applicable to you says so.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn order to ensure\
      \ the integrity of the Game, we need all Game downloads and updates to come\
      \ from an authorized source. Its also important for us that 3rd party tools/services\
      \ dont seem \"official\" as we cant guarantee their quality. Its part of the\
      \ responsibility we have to the customers of Orange Season.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nOWNERSHIP OF OUR GAME AND OTHER THINGS<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough we license\
      \ you permission to install on your device and play our Game, we are still the\
      \ owners of it. We are also the owners of our brands and any content contained\
      \ in the Game that isn't specifically attributed to someone else. Therefore,\
      \ when you pay for our Game, you are buying a license to play / use our Game\
      \ in accordance with this EULA - you are not buying the Game itself. The only\
      \ permissions you have in connection with the Game and your installation of\
      \ it are the permissions set out in this EULA.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAny Mods you\
      \ create for the Game from scratch belong to you and you can do whatever you\
      \ want with them, as long as you dont sell them for money / try to make money\
      \ from them and so long as you dont distribute Modded Versions of the Game.\
      \ Remember that a Mod means something that is your original work and that does\
      \ not contain a substantial part of our code or content. You only own what you\
      \ created; you do not own our code or content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCONTENT<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you make any content available on or through our Game,\
      \ you agree to give us permission to use, copy, modify, adapt, distribute, and\
      \ publicly display that content. This permission is irrevocable, and you also\
      \ agree to let us permit other people to use, copy, modify, adapt, distribute,\
      \ and publicly display your content. You are not giving up your ownership rights\
      \ in your content, you are just giving us and other users permission to use\
      \ it. For example, we may need to copy, reformat, and distribute content that\
      \ you post on our website so others can read it. If you dont want to give us\
      \ these permissions, do not make content available on or through our Game. Please\
      \ think carefully before you make any content available, because it may be made\
      \ public and might even be used by other people in a way you dont like.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nIf you are going to make something available on or through our Game,\
      \ it must not be offensive to people or illegal, it must be honest, and it must\
      \ be your own creation. Some examples of the types of things you must not make\
      \ available using our Game include: posts that include racist or homophobic\
      \ language; posts that are bullying or trolling; posts that are offensive or\
      \ that damage our or another persons reputation; posts that include porn or\
      \ someone elses creation or image; or posts that impersonate someone or try\
      \ to trick or exploit people.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAny content you make available\
      \ on our Game must also be your creation or you must have permission or the\
      \ legal right to do it. You must not and you agree that you will not make any\
      \ content available, using the Game that infringes the rights of others.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nWe reserve the right to take down any content in our discretion.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUPDATES<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Game is being distributed\
      \ while it's still being developed. The game may (and probably do) contain errors\
      \ and bugs in it's current state.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe might make upgrades,\
      \ updates or patches (we call them all \"updates\") available from time to time\
      \ while the game is being distributed as Early Access. We can continue to do\
      \ so after the game is considered finished, but we dont have to. We are also\
      \ not obliged to provide ongoing support or maintenance of any Game. Of course,\
      \ we hope to continue to release new updates for our Game, we just cant guarantee\
      \ that we will do so. With updates come changes that might not work well with\
      \ other software, such as Mods. This is unfortunate, but it is something we\
      \ dont take responsibility for. If that is the case, try running an older version.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nLIABILITY AND GOVERNING LAW<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe terms of\
      \ this EULA do not affect any legal (statutory) rights that you may have under\
      \ the law that applies to you for the Game. You might have certain rights which\
      \ the law that applies to you says cannot be excluded. Nothing we say in these\
      \ terms will affect those legal rights, even if we say something which sounds\
      \ like it contradicts your legal rights. Thats what we mean when we say \"subject\
      \ to applicable law\".<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSUBJECT TO APPLICABLE LAW, WHEN YOU\
      \ GET A COPY OF OUR GAME, WE PROVIDE IT \"AS IS\". UPDATES ARE ALSO PROVIDED\
      \ \"AS IS\". THIS MEANS THAT WE ARE NOT MAKING ANY PROMISES TO YOU ABOUT THE\
      \ STANDARD OR QUALITY OF OUR GAME, OR THAT OUR GAME WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR\
      \ ERROR FREE. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IT MAY CAUSE.\
      \ YOU BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO ITS QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE. YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT\
      \ THAT WE MAY RELEASE GAMES WELL BEFORE THEY ARE COMPLETE AND SO THEY MAY (AND\
      \ OFTEN WILL) HAVE BUGS -BUT WE PREFER TO RELEASE THESE FEATURES EARLY THAN\
      \ MAKE YOU WAIT FOR PERFECTION. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO NOTIFY US ABOUT A POTENTIAL\
      \ BUG, WE HAVE A SITE FOR THAT HERE.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe laws of the country\
      \ where you have your habitual residence govern this EULA and all disputes,\
      \ including disputes relating to it, our Game, or our Website, regardless of\
      \ conflict of laws principles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTERMINATION<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nIf we want we can terminate this EULA if you breach any of the terms. You\
      \ can terminate it too, at any time; all you have to do is uninstall the Game\
      \ from your device and the EULA will be terminated. If the EULA is terminated,\
      \ you will no longer have any of the rights to the Game given in this license.\
      \ You do still have the right to things you have created yourself with the game\
      \ of course. The paragraphs about \"Ownership of Our Game\", \"Our Liability\"\
      \ and \"General Stuff\" will continue to apply even after the EULA is terminated.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nGENERAL STUFF<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour local law may give you\
      \ rights that this EULA cannot change; if so, this EULA applies as far as the\
      \ law allows. Nothing in this license limits our liability for death or bodily\
      \ injury resulting from our negligence or fraudulent misrepresentations.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nWe may change this EULA from time to time, if we have reason\
      \ to, such as changes to our games, our practices, or our legal obligation.\
      \ But those changes will be effective only to the extent that they can legally\
      \ apply. For example if you use the Game without the updates we make available\
      \ then the old EULA applies but if you do use the updates then the new EULA\
      \ will apply. In that case we willll inform you of the change before it takes\
      \ effect, either by posting a notice on our Website or by other reasonable means.\
      \ Were not going to be unfair about this though - but sometimes the law changes\
      \ or someone does something that affects other users of the Game and we therefore\
      \ need to put a lid on it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you come to us with a suggestion\
      \ for any one of our Websites or Games, that suggestion is made for free and\
      \ we have no obligation to accept or consider it. This means we can use or not\
      \ use your suggestion in any way we want and we dont have to pay you for it.\
      \ If you think you have a suggestion that we would be willing to pay you for,\
      \ please do not submit your suggestion unless you have first told us you expect\
      \ to be paid and we have responded in writing by asking you to submit the suggestion."
