I like getting into games early and seeing how they progress, but c'mon guys. I can't believe you released this game in this state. It's simply unplayable right now. You can only pick up things after you moving them, most things that tell you to press E on do not work. There's literally nothing to do. The mechanic to open doors \"hold left click then swipe your mouse\" is atrocious. I don't think I'd play this game simply for that. CLOSE this game until it's a bit more ready. It gives zero value at the moment.","timestamp_created":1609690503,"timestamp_updated":1609690503,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.462962955236434937","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ49frB5PYCfMeOwAI="}
