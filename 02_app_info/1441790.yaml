    developer_response: Great to hear that you're enjoying the game, and thanks for
      the feedback! The WASD issue has been fixed, and the team is still working on
      what happens to the grab hook.

    review: "A quick update:\n\nSince posting this review both issues I mention below\
      \ have been fixed. Thanks devs!\n-----------------------\n\nClassic game from\
      \ XBLA. Still fun like the old days, however some things need to be addressed:\n\
      \n-Digging while using the grappling hook needs to come back. \n-Rebinding the\
      \ controls to WASD doesn't also change the menu controls to WASD. Switching\
      \ from WASD to the arrow keys to navigate the menus is a little annoying.\n\n\
      It seems like the dev(s?) has been reading these reviews and updating the game,\
      \ so I hope these changes are implemented! Really happy this game has returned!"
