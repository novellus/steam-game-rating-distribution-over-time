This is a great game. needs a map though.\n\n\nedit after finishing the game:\nHOLY SHIT FUCK BALLS the story is fucking killer overall and the absolute CLIFF HANGER they leave you on. I am SO SAD that this game didn't get enough support and thus will most likely never be completed. I just have to thank the devs for being able to put this great game together. This is a revolutionary game that should have changed the industry. I would gladly pay another 5-10 bucks for this game. Once again, I am legit sad that this game will most likely never see it's conclusion (AND ILL NEVER FUCKING GET TO LEVEL 10), but that does not impact my recommendation. This game is well worth the price.
