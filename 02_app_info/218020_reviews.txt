Obviously I always play as the Celts - magic and prowess with a spear as well as being friendlier with animals are advantages to being Irish. As well, the holy Roman empire can lick lick lick lick my balls. I only had the free version growing up so being able to explore the map is a real treat. The cheats are great craic to apply as well but they make the game very easy. Nethergate - that's a buy :D","timestamp_created":1604687506,"timestamp_updated":1604687506,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpYW1z/UCdezdrAI="}
