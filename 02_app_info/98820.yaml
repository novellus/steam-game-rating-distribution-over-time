    review: 'There''s a lot of greatness in this good game.

      A ton of customization and a ton of content.

      Especially if you get the three available DLC''s.

      The base game deserves the positive reviews.

      It''s a bit hard at first, but quite easy to learn.

      Winning for the first time feels simply great.

      There''s a lot of achievement stuff to unlock.

      And if you want, you can milk a lot of hours.

      The playtime value of this game is very high.

      Overall: I just have to recommend the game.

      And this good DLC is also really nice to have.

      It actually gives you a lot of additional stuff.

      The price of this cool DLC is simply very low.

      And it will also increase the overall playtime.

      That''s exactly what I like to see in the DLC''s.

      I simply have to give it this a positive review.'
