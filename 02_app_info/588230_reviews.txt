While certainly a short and rather linear game, it uses the medium of gaming to tell a story in a unique way, you could not simply replicate this experience in any other form. It's a grim fantasy that carries with it a breadth of commentary on modern society and manages to keep it interesting with a constant change in the gameplay. \n\nAbsolutely worth picking up purely for the way it breaks the mold of gaming.","timestamp_created":1608601993,"timestamp_updated":1608601993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48s+JxPYCf7+JvAI="}
