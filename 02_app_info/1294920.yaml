    about_the_game: Another FPS Game is an FPS parody. Our goal is to kill the enemies
      and find the end of the game throughout the episode based game. Another FPS
      Game, which criticizes many video games, approaches other action games through
      the eyes of an independent producer. We try to survive, fight zombies, fear
      and end the game by fighting zombies again. It has a structure that blends humor
      with its unique graphic style, simple and understandable gameplay mechanics.<br><br>     <strong>Don't
      remember, this game will make you a maid!</strong><br><br>     After millions
      of billions of dollars and decades of development, we have accomplished everything
      that can happen in a game. Another FPS Game has opened a new era to the game
      history, not a new breath.

    review: "Kinda bad  gameplay is good but just for first 20 mins\nGraphics: Bad\n\
      Save:No\nworth it:No it doesnt worth  even 89 cents\nhow much MB it takes:4.3\
      \ GB\nGame Looks Like Pretty Much Made By  People Who have broken hands or something\n\
      How Long You Can Play: Probably you'll Delete in first 30 mins \nYou should\
      \ play this if you dont have an braincell\nLike How I Waste My 300 points for\
      \ an award but next day there was new items R.I.P your 0.89 cents i may just\
      \ buy another game do not waste your cash\n\nThanks for steam. I got my refund"
