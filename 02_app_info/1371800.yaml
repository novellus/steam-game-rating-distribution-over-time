      Due to a lot of flashing lights, this game is NOT recommended for folks with
      any photosensitive medical conditions.<br><br>Walking into an amusement arcade
      during the 1980''s overwhelmed your senses. The audio from every arcade machine
      screamed out for attention, each one fighting to grab the passer by, begging

      happened had I been born a few years earlier and landed a job designing arcade
      games in 1984. It''s loud, it''s simple to pick up and it''s tough as old badgers.
      The graphics are crunchy old sprites, something you might see in an old Commodore

      simple - you play for a few minutes, you get as far as you can, the game ends.
      Next time, you play again and try to beat your score. Somewhere along the way,
      the rest of the world disappears and you find yourself one with the Octopus,

    review: 'My Nuclear Octopus takes the nostalgia of a Commodore 64 shooter, amplifies
      it with Super Hexagon speed, and drizzles it all with brain melting sound and
      color.
