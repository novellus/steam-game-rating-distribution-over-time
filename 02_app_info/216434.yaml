    review: If you want to skip ahead of the competition and get these support items
      early then this is the downloadable content to get. It gives you 5 new support
      items to defeat your online enemies with. My favorite item from this pack is
      the Impact grenade because you through it and it blows up fast instead of a
      small wait time which can give the enemy time to move away. Everything else
      is useful but needs some time to get used to their different function.  This
      content just speed things up for customizing things with your character. You
      can skip buying this and buy these items with in-game money. This just gives
      it to you early, I recommend it if you want to speed things up.
