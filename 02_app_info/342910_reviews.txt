It's not hard really, it just takes abit of work setting everything up, learning skills and raising stats. Played 9 hours and I've just completed my first gear - a grass belt. \n\nAnd I'm very proud of that grass belt.","timestamp_created":1605988276,"timestamp_updated":1605988276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw8oqX9vUCdp/erwI="}
