You can do this is many ways.\nThe game has a skill tree for more towers (cats) and a large amount of gameplay. However, it is not worth the cost. It boils down to place towers, eventually die, upgrade, rinse, repeat.\nTherefore, I recommend it, but only if they reduce the price.","timestamp_created":1580836317,"timestamp_updated":1580836317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49PzLiPACd4+b8AE="}
