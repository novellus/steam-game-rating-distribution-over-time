It was half-off during the Halloween sale, and even at full-price it is much less than the original game. It is a great introduction to the unique gameplay. As my friend said, explaining the gameplay makes it sound boring, so suffice to say, it is a fairly relaxed experience, with the simple controls, simple objectives, and observation of the camera angles and maps. It is not exactly easy, with different resources to manage, but it is a slow paced game that gives you time to ponder the nature of transportation by rails.\n\nI played this game on Ubuntu Linux with the Steam Play tools. With the advice from ProtonDB, I manually unpacked some data-files, so that the game could load the levels correctly. The game ran fine, with great framerates, afterward. The game uses mouse-only or keyboard controls, and it includes a lengthy PDF manual. Even while this DLC is a fun-hearted theme, the gameplay is still serious, which gives a good idea for the full game (I suppose). This DLC has many scenarios to play, which range from very easy to very difficult. I highly recommend this game; I think there are many hours of fun to be had here, for train enthusiasts, simulation gamers, or gamers looking for a chillaxed experience.","timestamp_created":1572651747,"timestamp_updated":1572651747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.662613630294799805","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ466jWlO4Cep621gE="}
