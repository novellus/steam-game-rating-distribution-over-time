    short_description: In order to try to get Aki to promise to go on a date with
      him, Masamune teams up with Kojuurou and challenges Aki and Yoshino to see who
      can get a better score on a test. If he wins, he gets a date with Aki. If he
      loses, he'll have to live with the nickname Aki gave him until he graduates.
