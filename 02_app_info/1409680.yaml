    review: 1Day is an artistic story more than a game itself, but I found myself
      enjoying it, nonetheless.  I was trying to find something to play and came across
      this one, and since it was so cheap I decided to give it a try.  There is not
      much to the game but I found the story to be quite nice.  I finished it in about
      half an hour, but during that time it did allow me to think back on some of
      the fun memories I had with old childhood friends of mine who are sadly just
      not around anymore.  A sweet game for what it is and if you are looking for
      something nostalgic to reflect on, then I would recommend it.  I am glad that
      I gave it a try!
