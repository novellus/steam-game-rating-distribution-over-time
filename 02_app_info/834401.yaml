    about_the_game: "Amtrak\u2019s Electro-Motive SDP40F \u2013 a memorable, historic,\
      \ yet star-crossed diesel locomotive of the 1970s and early 1980s \u2013 now\
      \ comes to Train Simulator!<br><br>On May 1, 1971, Amtrak took over most passenger-train\
      \ operations in the United States and faced an immediate need for diesel motive\
      \ power. Amtrak contracted with Electro-Motive for a new model \u2013 to be\
      \ designated SDP40F \u2013 and soon ordered 150 of the husky diesels.<br><br>The\
      \ SDP40F utilized many of the components of EMD\u2019s successful freight-service\
      \ SD40-2. Like the SD40-2, the SDP40F was rated at 3,000 horsepower and powered\
      \ by an EMD 645-series, turbocharged, two-cycle V-16 power plant. The big six-axle\
      \ passenger diesel was wrapped in EMD\u2019s distinctive \u201Ccowl\u201D carbody\
      \ and, with steam generator and water tank, weighed in at nearly 400,000 pounds.<br><br>Amtrak\u2019\
      s 150 SDP40Fs (Amtrak 500-649) rolled out of EMD\u2019s plant between June 1973\
      \ and August 1974, but the tenure of the big diesel was tarnished by problems\
      \ including derailments at speed and Amtrak soon chose to build its diesel fleet\
      \ of the future around the more versatile and nimble EMD F40PH. Amtrak would\
      \ retire its last SDP40Fs in the early 1980s, but while the service careers\
      \ of the SDP40Fs on Amtrak were relatively short, the big diesel nonetheless\
      \ served a historic role for the passenger carrier and endured long enough to\
      \ wear three Amtrak liveries (Phase I, II, and III), each of which are included\
      \ in this DLC. As an extraordinary bonus, the Amtrak SDP40F pack, masterfully\
      \ created by DTM, also include a complete set of Amtrak\u2019s ex-Santa Fe high-level\
      \ cars as made famous in Santa Fe service on the El Capitan/Super Chief and\
      \ Texas Chief, and which served Amtrak for decades. Four scenarios for the Donner\

    review: 'This is a nice train I love the looks, the feel, and everything else...

      Now I''ve only found 1 mistake! or one thing that could be fixed or adjusted...
      If possible

      Its the horn on the has chirping sounds from sounds what to be a bird at the
      end of the horn end sound.

      It''s only noticeable when the world is quite and when the train engine is shut
      down...

      You can hear the chirping sound from the ending of the horn sound. from outside
      the vehicle and within the cab you can still hear the chirping sound...

      Can that be fixed please? And maybe a more realistic horn by any chance? or
      just a quick fix of the horn? I would be happy if you devs of this game can
      fix that weird sound issue... ( It only needs a quick adjustment in the audio
      )

      Anyways this is a nice train and love using this vehicle but has a strange issue
      with the train horn. mainly a audio issue that needs to be readjusted... If
      possible.

      Anyways love this train and would recommend this to other people looking for
      a Amtrak train to drive or any other train.

      It just has a minor issue with the train horn with hearing birds chirping in
      the end of the horn... Good train just needs some horn adjustment in the horn
      audio!'
