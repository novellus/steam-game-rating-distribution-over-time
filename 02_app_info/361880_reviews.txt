Please remember you need to surface in order to breathe. This gets pretty hard at times but adds to the realism of the scuba diving experience of the game. Try this game out and I think you will enjoy it.","timestamp_created":1546460386,"timestamp_updated":1546460386,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrZqOiOgCdrmmtwE="}
