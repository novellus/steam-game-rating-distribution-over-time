This is the only game in the series I plan on buying. It took me a little while to get used to playing the game, and I spent the first few hours just learning alchemy recipes, gathering materials, leveling up a little bit, making some useful items like bombs, making money, and filling requests from the cafe. I purchased several RPG games this year, and I like this game more than all of the other RPGs I tried to play this year. So far, I have been  able to play this game pretty easily without looking at the walkthrus, but had to look online to figure out how to make better weapons and armor become available.","timestamp_created":1608948124,"timestamp_updated":1609706722,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrer/5PYCdc6evQI="}
