Sadly it shows its age with many broken videos and other Internet related content aswell as the interactive camera to look around in a 360° picture (whoever made the controls so bad on it should shame him/herself).\n\nThe videos can be found on YouTube though and are even uploaded by the official Tomb Raider channel. I'm not sure why they didn't just include the videos in this download since it will still be a really small download but it is what it is.\n\nIf you've got 0,50€ to spend on this in some parts broken \"interactive\" book then go ahead, you probably won't regret it but expect that it may fall further apart over time.","timestamp_created":1609796694,"timestamp_updated":1609796694,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514285683631896973","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/4XX5/YCdLfCwAI="}
