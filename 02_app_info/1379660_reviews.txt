The game has amazing, fairly simple gameplay. The graphics are simple but decent and the sounds is alright. Overall, it's an 8/10, would recommend.\n\nDetailed:\n\nGraphics: 8/10\n\nThe graphics on this game are not mindbreaking and very simple. However, they are nice and with enough detail to be interesting and good enough.\n\nSound: 5.5/10\n\nThe sound effects are alright. A bit misplaced but good. The volume of the sound is low and that is annoying but this is alright.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\n\nThe gameplay is amazing! If you like things like Software Inc, Game Dev Tycoon and City Game Studio you will love this. The game is great to play, very user-friendly and has many modes. The easy mode is maybe a bit too easy but the rest of this stuff is great.","timestamp_created":1609510492,"timestamp_updated":1609897921,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4npnZ6vYCfKu0vwI="}
