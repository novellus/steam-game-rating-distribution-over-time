Interesting world. Feels like an Anime fantasy series.\n\nCONS:\nThe english localization is awful and the skill variety feels ridiculously complex for the simplicity of the battles.\nI mean, you got like 985679 skills for each character but you won't ever need them. Just use \"the one that kills stuff\" with any character and win the game. Also, many of the battle conditions are either not shown or explained correctly so the \"kill stuff \" is always a valid path.\n\n\nOverall the story and art outweighs, in my humble opinion, everything else. It feels a little \"early accessy\", but fun.","timestamp_created":1551583060,"timestamp_updated":1603902695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.68197333812713623","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45ZyDuPUCdOKVvAE="}
