    review: I bought this ages ago, but only with Covid happening did I finally play
      it. I was not sure what to expect, so discovering it was pretty much Taratinoesque
      and reminiscent of Pulp Fiction except with cast of lesbians. It was strangely
      compelling despite slurs and racial epithets. It really is a dark comedy of
      errors and the fact the story takes places mostly in two days just adds to it.
      The cast are even fun and though definitely not the greatest people - none of
      them are good people, some are just better than others, it still kept me engrossed.
      Would I recommend it? Yeah definitely worth one play through.
