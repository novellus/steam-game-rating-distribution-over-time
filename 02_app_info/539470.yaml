      /><br><br>Inspired by SWAT 4 and gritty police TV shows, Police Stories is a
      fresh take on top-down shooters with an emphasis on tactics that forces you
      to make split second decisions. Neutralize criminals, rescue civilians and defuse
      bombs in Single Player mode or Online Co-op. And remember - shooting first is
      not an option!<br><br>Unforgiving and tense, each mission tells a story of two
      police operatives - John Rimes and Rick Jones, filled with infiltrating gang
      hideouts, rescuing hostages, making arrests and other life-threatening situations.<br><br><img

      you to apprehend the suspects without resorting to violence. Fire a warning
      shot near them or engage them in melee combat - those are just some of the ways
      you can make them submit.<br></li><li><strong>Issue commands</strong> to your
      fellow cop Rick Jones. Make sure to use him wisely - and who knows, he might
      save your life in return. <br></li><li><strong>Randomly placed criminals, hostages
      and evidence</strong> make every level run unique. The placement changes every
      time you restart, leading to new interesting situations and opportunities.<br></li><li>As
      a law enforcement officer, you will have access to <strong>end-of-the-line police
      equipment</strong>, such as under-the-door cameras, door blast charges and many
      others.<br></li><li><strong>Various types of lawbreakers</strong>, from small
      petty criminals to well organised gangs and terrorists. Each type has not only
      unique weapons, but different behaviour and shooting skill.<br></li><li><strong>Complex
      Tactical Gameplay:</strong> Try not to get spotted, don't waste bullets, regularly
      check your surroundings and make sure to take criminals down quietly.<br></li><li>All
      your actions are <strong>scored in real time</strong>. Playing aggressively
      won't get you a high enough result to start the next mission - so keep that

    short_description: A fresh take on top-down shooters with an emphasis on tactics
      that forces you to make split second decisions. Neutralize criminals, rescue
      civilians and defuse bombs in Single Player mode or Co-op. And remember - shooting
      first is not an option!
