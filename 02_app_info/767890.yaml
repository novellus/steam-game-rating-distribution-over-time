    review: 'This review is specifically for the Favourite Songs DLC and not the game
      itself.

      The music is an interesting mix across a broad range of styles. This is a pick
      of what seems to be fan made music that pay tribute to the game in some way,
      all songs have vocals and range from synths, rock, rap, and are all very in
      your face kind of tracks. If you''re looking for the music from the trailers,
      involving nice calm guitar, then don''t get this DLC as you''ll be disappointed.
      They did state it was a specially made selection in the description, so I guess
      I should''ve seen it coming, but I was hoping at least a few of the games tracks
      in there. Though technically my fault for not reading it properly, it does deviate
      from the usual, as I do not see a seperate entry anywhere for the games music,
      just this selection, which is not great.


      By the way, all the people who state they have to go the the game directories
      to play the music apparently never discovered the Music Player that has been
      integrated into steam for years and years (Well before this games release in
      2018), and has recently been updated so you can now install OSTs seperately
      and choose where to put them on install (But you have to buy the OST outside
      of a bundle to do so, otherwise you''ll either need to buy it again outside
      of the bundle you just got, or you''ll need to install the bundle that it was
      included with and use the music player in steam to play the music (Or you can
      do what the complaints mentioned which is to go to the games directory and move
      the music yourself, though not necessary with the steam music player)). To install
      soundtracks seperately if you''ve added the OST to your basket and checked out,
      then go to your library home and you''ll see an entry for the game, select it
      and on the main screen to the right under DLC you''ll see the ability to install
      the soundtrack seperately, it''ll ask where as you install it.'
