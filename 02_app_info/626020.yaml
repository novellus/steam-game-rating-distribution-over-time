    about_the_game: <strong>Shadows in the Darkness</strong> is an intense, cooperative
      roguelite, letting players venture down into the depths of mysterious dungeons
      to eradicate the darkness beneath. Play alone or with your friends to explore
      random dungeons, collect unique loot, and fight dangerous enemies.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Vast randomly generated dungeons<br>-Everytime a new game
      begins, a massive system of 21 floors is generated. Huge libraries, small hallways,
      and open spaces await in this underground network.<br></li><li>Fully functional
      4 player co-op or singleplayer<br>-Explore the dungeons with friends! Create
      tactics to distract enemies, manage the various loot found, and dominate the
      final boss together.<br>-This doesn't mean you can't play alone, however. The
      dungeon difficulty is fully adjustable.<br></li><li>4 intense boss fights<br>-As
      you descend into the dungeons, tough bosses await to stop you in your tracks.
      Create a plan and figure out how to kill them before they kill you.<br></li><li>Dangerous,
      wandering enemies<br>-Fight orcs, goblins, slimes, spiders, and much more in
      the deeper floors. Enemies wander about, allowing for you to coordinate attacks
      and ambush to increase your likelihood of survival.<br></li><li>Easy to learn,
      difficult to master<br>-There are very few controls to learn throughout the
      game, but in order to be able to defeat the dungeon, you must learn the enemies,
      manage your resources, and fight your way to victory.<br></li><li>Full physics-based
      item system<br>-Physics-based items allow for a fighting system based on skill.<br></li><li>Unique
      inventory system<br>-Inventory does not go by slots, rather it is managed solely
      on space. Open up your pack, and place items in a fashion that allow for the
      maximum amount of space to be filled.<br>-You have a single holster on your
      back for weapons allowing for quick access.<br></li><li>Lots of loot<br>-Find
      various swords, wands, potions, and scrolls scattered in chests and rooms. There
      are a wide variety of items to fight with or use but look carefully, as the
      best might be hidden somewhere in the darkest corners...</li></ul><br><strong>Shadows
      in the Darkness</strong> is in Early Access, so please be mindful of all bugs
      or issues, and leave suggestions in the Steam forums or on the r/scornz subreddit.
      I'll work my hardest to remove and fix found bugs as soon as possible. Thank
      you!

    review: The Multyplayer dosen't work for shit . the game seems decent but it gived
      to me and my gf a little nausea whitout changing the setting (whould be better
      if the setting will be put on before the games start ) . the game seems decent
      but alone is very boring  I HOPE THAT IT GETS UPPDATED because could be a really
      good game .
