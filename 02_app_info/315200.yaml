    review: 'I''m going to tell you straight up, if you buy this, you got suckered.
      The licensing terms are crap and they have abandoned FaceRig for their new fav
      Animaze. Run. Run as far and fast as you can. They took the support the community
      gave them, squandered it, declared you couldn''t make videos with this "pro"
      version to place behind a pay wall, then proceeded to create the next software
      package and put all the features behind a pay wall. I regret buying this and
      supporting their efforts over the years. DON''T DO IT.


      Edit: Also, the hours listed for me are inaccurate. I have 90 hours in facerig,
      and that should be visible in my stats. This is counting hours for hitting play
      while in the pro licensing store page. You don''t count hours using a licensing
      agreement. How stupid.'
