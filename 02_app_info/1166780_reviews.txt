For the price, it's still worth getting and encouraging development of these sorts of games.\n\nYes it has a bit of Stanley Parable/Portal to it. But it is largely one level done five times with minor variations. It doesn't really evolve and I never felt that compelled to move on. There are a couple of small puzzles, but largely it's a walking simulator. (I love walking simulators, so that's a good thing.)\n\nBut it's so cheap... I found it quite interesting and I want more of this sort of experience. So that's why I put it in the recommended column and would be interested in more from this developer in the future.\n\n","timestamp_created":1606552248,"timestamp_updated":1606552248,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7Lv+hvYCe92itAI="}
