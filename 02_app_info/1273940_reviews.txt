Constructing sentences is meaningless as it's better to put out complete gibberish that results in better effects.   Multiple times in the short time I played the battles would just freeze up cause suddenly I have no cards.  Battles are virtually impossible to lose unless actively attempting to do so.  Finishing a game I thought there was going to be some type of cutscene given how it started but it just pulled up an incredibly generic results screen.  Too much of a mess to recommend to anyone other than the most curious","timestamp_created":1608012661,"timestamp_updated":1608012661,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4kMDBsvYCcfGtugI="}
