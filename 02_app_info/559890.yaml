    review: "Not that long ago, I wrote a very naughty review for the game which this\
      \ soundtrack accompanies. It was such a naughty review, with such scandalous\
      \ content, that my review got \"banned\" (though you can still view it via my\
      \ Truly Horrible Horror Games curator page for some strange reason). The time\
      \ has finally come to make good my penance.\n\n   The soundtrack for this game,\
      \ while nothing remotely special, is certainly competent; though I wouldn't\
      \ go recommending it to anyone who doesn't dig low-fi synths and fake timpanis\
      \ as much as I do, even at the cost of 99 cents. But credit where credit's due:\
      \ it's a fairly nifty little horror soundtrack, especially if you're not lactose\
      \ intolerant ('cause it IS kinda cheesy, albeit in a good way, unlike the game\
      \ itself).\n\n   See, devs, it was simple. All you had to do was take away the\
      \ \"vision\" part, and your game ain't so bad after all. \n\n   Verdict: 7.5/10.\n\
      \n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages:\
