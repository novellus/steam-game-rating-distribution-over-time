    about_the_game: 'The classic snake game is back merged with the Jankenpon game!
      A relaxing casual game where you eat the fruits and needs be aware of the symbols:
      if you are rock, paper will make you grow 3 times longer the default, scissors
      will not change your size and rock will produce the classic behavior.<br><br><img

      /><br><br>Who does not know this game? Move the snake around the board, eat
      the fruits, avoid the walls and the snake tail. That''s all... not really...<br><br><img

      /><br><br>The Rock, Paper and Scissors logic exists in the game. The snake have
      a symbol on it''s head. So does the fruits. When you eat a fruit representing
      the opposite symbol (the one you have advantage on) the snake size does not
      change. The same symbol will make it grow by 1 piece. The disadvantage one will
      make the snake grow by 3 pieces instead. So you need to proper calculate your
      moves!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1452300/extras/title-just-relax.png?t=1609125524"
      /><br><br>Minimalist visuals, multiple beautiful backgrounds, uplifting music
      will make you calm. A game to make you feel good and nostalgic.'
