Is it a good game? Well, partially. I had fun finishing it with my SO, but\n\nit is buggy (but comes with lots of savepoints)\nit is short (it still took us some days to finish)\nit is rather easy (don't expect a real platforming or puzzle challenge, but we still managed to get stuck at one puzzle)\nit is abandoned (at least I could not find the programmers to ask for help with abovementioned puzzle)\n\nStill, we enjoyed the game!\n\nYou play a sweet young couple trying to climb the trees of an ancient forest in order to break through the canopy to find a new home for your poor people (in the clouds?). The game is strictly co-op. While you can officially play both characters with one gamepad, this is simply not as much fun as playing together. \n\nYou will encounter easy platforming and mostly easy puzzles, often using some of the special abilities your characters will learn during their journey. There are enemies, but not many. Perfect for a stress-free gaming session with your SO!\n\nWorks fine with XBox 360 gamepads.\n\n[u][b] Conclusion:[/b][/u]\nNice (and affordable) co-op game for couples, despite all its shortcomings.","timestamp_created":1558000032,"timestamp_updated":1558000032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.729384720325469971","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkLuC4OoCeMKkwQE="}
