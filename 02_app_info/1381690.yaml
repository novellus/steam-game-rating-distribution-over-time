    review: "https://youtu.be/-cGs3KlEJ6w\n\nI can honestly see this game having a\
      \ lot of potential if it was polished but in its current state I cant recommend\
      \ it. The game starts in what I am assuming is Chinese but there isn't a whole\
      \ lot of options so its not hard to figure out how to switch it too English.\
      \ Middle button on the home screen brings up options, button on the left in\
      \ the options menu switches the game to English. \n\nThe controls are really\
      \ hard to get a feel for. Jumping is incredibly delayed by about a second after\
      \ pressing the spacebar which makes it very difficult to try to jump on anything.\
      \ Running is slow and you can watch your character take 3 or 4 steps in place\
      \ before moving forward so it always feels like you are walking through sand.\
      \ The camera angle  will sometimes bounce off of objects and other times it\
      \ will clip through them so you are always dealing with a shaky camera. You\
      \ cant fire your gun from the hip you always have to be zoomed in and while\
      \ zoomed you not only move slower but you can no longer strafe. The biggest\
      \ annoyance is the sound you make when you run which in my opinion is way to\
      \ loud and repetitive and doesn't sound like foot steps but more like someone\
      \ knocking on wood.\n\nCombat is lacking. Aside from not being able to strafe\
      \ or fire from the hip the zombies aren't able to understand pathing very well.\
      \ You can hide behind an open gate or some sandbags and pick zombies off one\
      \ at a time and they don't pose much of a threat unless you get more then one\
      \ on you at a time then all of them can hit you all at once. Until you reach\
      \ the first boss that is. Not only does the first boss throw projectiles at\
      \ you they can pass through walls, lock on to you, and deal aoe damage. The\
      \ only way I could figure out to avoid this is by getting lucky and having his\
      \ attacks clipped through the floor. After watching the store page video I see\
      \ that's as far as the dev got too."
