    review: 'Have only achieved one ending so far and i''m already excited to see
      the rest of them, the visual style is unique and the dialogue/options you''re
      presented are aplenty.


      If you like VN''s please do yourself a favor and pick this one up, the asking
      price is that of a cheeseburger and it is 100% worth your time.'
