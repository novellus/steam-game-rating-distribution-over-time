    review: 'Ohhh this games takes me back to the time of Motherload. (the flash version,
      not the steam version)

      I just love the ambiance and the music is very good!

      Every time you go down it is the question of will I be back before my fuel runs
      out? Every dive is a hunt for riches that you don''t want to interrupt to get
      fuel, but you have to. And in time as well because else your haul will be lost
      forever!

      Upgrading this makes it easier to get huge hauls. Content wise I think the price
      is a bit steep but the game is very fun to play nontheless.'
