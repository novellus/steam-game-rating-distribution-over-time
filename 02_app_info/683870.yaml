    review: A fun, new and refreshing addition to this well proven and enjoyable genre..
      Addictively difficult and carefully designed levels make multiple playthroughs
      just as fun and awesome as the first.. They went for the good old, "Easy to
      pick up, hard to master" design and I should add, they go it so well.. I very
      much recommend this game to anyone who is a Platformer fan, a Casual game fan,
      a side-scroller fan.. Pretty much any gamer who likes games..
