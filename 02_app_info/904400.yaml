    review: 'This is a very fun game with an entertaining story that really makes
      you feel like you''re back to playing card games in elementary school, with
      the addition of supernatural monsters that want to consume you and your friends.  The
      gameplay is very smooth and reminiscent of other games like Hearthstone.  The
      characters are entertaining and the sidequests are interesting and offer multiple
      completion options.


      However, there are a number of flaws.  There is no ability to run, you can''t
      skip cutscenes and there is no new game plus.  So when they say you can''t collect
      them all, they''re not kidding.  There''s a good chance you''ll never get to
      play with a good portion of the cards, unless you fool around in gauntlet mode
      or restart the story fresh.  But I enjoyed it enough to play it all the way
      through and give it a good rating here, so if those flaws don''t bother you,
      then I absolutely recommend you pick it up.'
