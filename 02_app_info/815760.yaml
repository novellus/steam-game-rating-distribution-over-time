      \ one of the deadliest sharks. Feeding frenzies against shipwrecked sailors\
      \ became such a problem that a special unit of the Navy was formed and headed\
      \ by ace diver Wilhelm. With cooperation from the Russians, Wilhelm's team was\
      \ armed with experimental hardware and then tasked to help shipwrecked sailors\
      \ across the Pacific Ocean. Although they did not reach every disaster in time,\
      \ their success in driving back opportunistic sharks is remembered to this day.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nWilhelm is a famous American diver who assisted in countless\
      \ open sea search and rescue operations throughout WWII. With international\
      \ help from the Russians, his team was armed with modified Russian hardware\
      \ to help stave off sharks and enemy frogmen."
