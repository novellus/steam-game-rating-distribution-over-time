    review: "If you enjoy classic turn based RPGs, then games by this developer definitely\
      \ fit the bill. Wormskull is actually a prequel to Ashes of the Night, and while\
      \ it's nice to have that familiarity with the story and characters, in no way\
      \ do you need to play AotN in order to play Wormskull. \n\nThe battle mechanics\
      \ are sound, and with 14 different playable characters (4 at a time), there\
      \ are a lot of different classes/attributes to satisfy anyone.  Tons of crafting,\
      \ mining, fishing to do, which is actually pretty important (and I didn't realize\
      \ that until a little too late).  By far the best parts of this game are the\
      \ story and the individual characters, which are very engaging, interesting,\
      \ and entertaining. It took me 40 hrs to finish, and unfortunately I couldn't\
      \ beat the final secret boss, b/c I would've had to level up an awful lot first.\n\
      \n The only con for me, I would say, is that I felt like there was a fair amount\
      \ of grinding necessary, whether just not to get killed, or to get whatever\
      \ materials you needed etc. Also, I didn't realize that you can't backtrack,\
      \ so for example, when a NPC wanted an item, I thought \"Oh, I'll bring it back\
      \ once I'm at a level where I'll have that.\" Nope. Once you move ahead, there's\
      \ revisiting towns. \n\nOverall, I think this is a great turn based RPG, just\
      \ like the classics we all love. Definitely recommend it!"
