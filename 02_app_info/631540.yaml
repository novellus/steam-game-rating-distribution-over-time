      /><br><br>As a new Manager, build a happy community and trade with other races...
      for profit. Yes, that's right, we need their happiness so we can power up our
      portals. The Lings, your workers, will obey you and help you with your village.
      But beware, they can cause a lot of problems too. If this is not enough, there
      are other creatures that will try to do the same, they can trade, fight or help
      you. Oh, don't forget about the weather and some unexpected events.<br><br><img

      /><br><br><strong>Village building</strong><br>Build your own village with many
      types of buildings, you need to decide what kind of objects, items or workbench
      you want inside. There are more than 150 items to craft. Every item and object
      has a reason. For example, craft a Wood Cabinet and put it inside the houses
      to increase your storage space. Roads can make them walk faster... and more.<br><br><img

      to provide basic salary, food, clothes and a &quot;healthy&quot; environment.
      It's up to you to decide how they work and where. Beware, they can start conflicts
      with each other and even set your village on fire. Watch them talk and keep
      your eyes open for their stats. Each one has unique traits and also attributes
      that you can control.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/631540/extras/tree.png?t=1588204345"

      your community. Random events that can turn your whole village into a nightmare
      from day to night. See how weather impacts your food and workers.<br><br><strong>And
      More!</strong><br>Rain and snow will change not only the visuals, but how you
      will handle your village. Craft better clothes or they can get sick. Craft better
      weapons and armors to face evil creatures or random thieves. Accept contracts
