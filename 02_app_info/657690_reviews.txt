Alright look, one thing in particular is driving me up the wall about this game and it's not just me, a significant ratio of the negative reviews mention the dreaded [b][i]fishing minigame.[/i][/b] I was annoyed so much, so quickly, as to spend a good 20-30 minutes of my ~1-hour playtime gathering stats to give this a proper evaluation. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT FOOD AND FISHING IN THIS GAME.\n\nYour crew are industrial strength garburators when it comes to food. Time passes in this game at a rate of about 1 hour to 1 second realtime, and food is deducted every 12 ingame hours. Each crewmate somehow goes through 10kg of food per deduction. Which means that, assuming you've still got a full crew, you go through [b]100kg of food per day,[/b] or every 24 seconds real-time. The only real starter ship you have, the sloop, has a maximum capacity of 600kg of food. Generally speaking, you won't have the money to afford more than 50-200kg of food when starting a fresh run. It's beyond ridiculous. You'll have gone through your food stores pretty much by the time you're out of sight of port. Hell, even on the rare occasion that you CAN load your stores up to full before departing, they don't exactly last much longer.\n\nSo, naturally, you need to fish for food en route. There are two ways of doing this: the fishing minigame, which uses dirt-cheap harpoons, or the rather expensive fishing net, which will inevitably be caught by a wave and torn from your grip after ~3-5 uses.\n\nA quick breakdown of the various means of obtaining food:\n\n[h1]Just Buy It[/h1]\nFood costs ~£10 per 25kg. This varies from port to port and when trading with other ships, but it's relatively expensive, and unreliable considering its limited availability.\n\n[h1]Fishing Net[/h1]\nA fishing net costs £120. One scoop with it is quick and painless, and usually nets from 30 to 90 kg of fish, seeming to reliably average at ~60. You'll lose it after ~4 uses, so, let's say you can generally expect to get 240-250kg of food for your £120. Compared to £100/250kg as a baseline price from port, not a great deal, but not terrible. You'd still be better off buying food outright in most cases, assuming you're skint and can only choose one or the other. Port inventories are also completely randomized, so there's a good chance you won't even be given this option to begin with.\n\n[h1]The Fishing Minigame[/h1]\nOh boy, what an option! Much like with the net, you can fish pretty much anywhere, even in a snowstorm. You need harpoons to fish, harpoons cost £1-2 apiece, you can hold 20 in a sloop, they're [i]only expended if you miss your target,[/i] and generally speaking the minigame is well balanced. Fish aren't too hard to hit. Borderline infinite food from the cheapest item in the game! What's the catch?\n\nThe minigame itself, and your patience with it. First, there's the music loop. I'm not up on my sea shanties, but it's a 14-second loop with the same chord progression as \"Blow the Man Down\", so, get used to hearing that ad nauseam. Second, you only get 10kg per fish speared, [b]and that's assuming you're playing as the fisherman. God save your miserable soul if you play as anyone else, because then fish are worth half that amount instead.[/b] Over the course of a dozen or so iterations of the minigame, I came out at 30-40 seconds to get 100kg of fish. If you've been paying attention, you may already notice the problem.\n\n[b]IT TAKES LONGER TO CATCH FISH IN THE MINIGAME THAN IT DOES TO EAT THEM.[/b] 30-40 seconds in the minigame (assuming you're playing the fisherman, if not, then double that!!) is enough to feed your crew for 24 seconds of travel time. This also means that that singular, monotone 14-second loop of that one sea shanty is officially half of this game's soundtrack. \n\nI don't know what wonders are hidden behind the veil of Fishing Minigame: The Game, and I no longer care. I really hate saying this, given its status as a one-man indie project, when it runs well, has a decent aesthetic, everything seems to work as intended, there's even a Linux port, and it has a 94% approval rating! But I would surmise that the people who DO enjoy the game enjoy it [i]in spite of[/i] this accursed minigame, as opposed to [i]because of[/i] it. I haven't been put off by an otherwise enjoyable game's repetition this badly since Sigma Star Saga decided that procedurally generated 1-2 minute shmup stages were the perfect substitute for already repetitive random-encounter RPG battles.\n\nPS: The game doesn't save if you're not at port. It just deletes your save whenever you happen to die (unless you're playing on easy mode). Pretty awkward and inconvenient system.","timestamp_created":1610101429,"timestamp_updated":1610102602,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkf/l8PYCf8/AwQI="}
