The variety of instruments is good and the very careful balance between synth and regular instruments pays off. The tracks also, despite often using the same instruments, never sound too similar to each other to the point that the tracks feel samey. I would definitely recommend buying this to support the composer! He worked hard to inject as much life into Visage as he could and it shows!","timestamp_created":1605205974,"timestamp_updated":1605205974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv+vu3vUCc4j9rQI="}
