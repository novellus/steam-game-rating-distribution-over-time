      >Backstory</h2></strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Somewhere on Fuzz Island\u2026\
      </h2>Frizzy was minding his own business.  He worked in the fuzzball factory\
      \ on Fuzz Island.  One day he noticed something in the clouds, something he\
      \ had never seen before.  It was a ball of static energy, and he could tell\
      \ from it\u2019s magnificence that only he could see it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Forlorn, he thought of how he would never reach those clouds.  They\u2019re\
      \ so high!  And he is so small.</h2>.<br>For years Frizzy\u2019s Village on\
      \ Fuzz Island had been tortured by an Evil Dragon.  His name was Doof, and once\
      \ a year he would come to the island and attempt to blow all the pretty Fuzzballs\
      \ away.  This day was known as the \u201CGreat Green Sneeze\u201D on Fuzz Island,\
      \ and every year all the fuzzy families would hide out and latch on for safety,\
      \ or be gusted into eternity.<br><br>But one year something glorious happened.\
      \  Frizzy was dutifully working in the fuzz factory when he saw a bunny playing\
      \ outside his window.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hop.</h2>Hop.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Hop Hop.</h2><br>So he followed it.  But he had forgotten that today was the\
      \ day of the great sneeze!  By the time he had remembered, it was too late.\
      \  He saw the green fog coming in and was swept away.<br><br>The Great Green\
      \ Sneeze came and with its mighty wind Frizzy was blown high into the air. \
      \ From up in the air he could see further and clearer than any Fuzzball before\
      \ him could.   Then he remembered!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u201CI must fuzzyfloat\
      \ my way towards the ball of static energy!\u201D</h2><br>Like any other ball\
      \ of dirt and hair, Frizzy is fully in control of how he maneuvers through the\
      \ air.  He floated and spun and twisted and paddled.  Through the air he went,\
      \ and he floated his way towards the ball.  Finally he reached it, and he found\
      \ something amazing!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Frizzy could magically attach to the\
      \ ball!</h2><br>He looked down and gazed upon Fuzzy Island.  He wondered if\
      \ any of the other fuzzballs had forgotten to hide indoors during the Great\
      \ Green Sneeze.  For a moment he pictured his fuzzy family, and his little brother\
      \ Lint.<br><br>The moment was interrupted by the foulest of laughter.<br><br>\u201C\
      Heauheauheuaheuhaeuau\u201D yelled Doof the Dragon.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u201C\
      You have discovered your power, but I have discovered you!\u201D howled Doof.</h2><br>\u201C\
      Who\u2026 who are you??\u201D Frizzy whimpered.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u201CI\
      \ am Doof. And you\u2026 ARE MINE!\u201D</h2><br>Frizzy felt the second sneeze\
      \ only for an instant, and blacked out. It blew him further from his family\
      \ than he could ever possibly have imagined.  He woke up on a platform covered\
      \ in grass.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u201CThis is the furthest from home I\u2019\
      ve ever been.\u201D Frizzy said.</h2><br>Press start."
