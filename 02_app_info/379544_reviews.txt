This is the reason that I purchased this plane version from Steam, as I had already purchased the basic plane version from Virtavia.\n\nThe promotional information for this plane needs to be revised by Steam.  Apparently it has been in place for four years.  The perception that some have that the versions with pods under the wings are fuel tanks is also mistaken; they are baggage pods.\n\nAgain, it might be a great and interesting plane (I will still explore it, and hope to be able to recommend it later in other ways)  but the basic motivation that I had for purchasing from Steam was the extended range claim.  No such luck.\n\nI hope to help others avoid this confusion and disappointment and wasteful expense in the future.
