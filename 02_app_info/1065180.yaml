    review: "Why is this game such a huge step back from traditional megaman X games?\
      \ I get that this isn't the same franchise, but it shares a lot of the same\
      \ flaws that only barely started rearing their heads at the cusp of megaman\
      \ zero. \n\nCrafting has and will always be the absolute weakest garbage in\
      \ any game.  From classic games, finding Light Capsules ensures you only get\
      \ meaningful upgrades and only have to revisit a level at most once to get the\
      \ new thing, offering you a new route to access it. As it is now though you\
      \ have to revisit levels a ton to grind random drops from level completion.\
      \ It's unwieldy gristle.\n\nOutside of falling in a pit or one (nearly) scripted\
      \ death, you are invincible in this game and will not die. It takes sixty seconds\
      \ of running into the same spike to die, and you can regenerate your hp any\
      \ time, there are no stakes. Many boss attacks are undodgable the first time\
      \ through, and one of the playable characters is enormously challenging to control.\
      \ Good thing you'll never die, you can soak up all the damage with impunity.\
      \ \n\nIf you want to squeeze all the content out of this game you -will- be\
      \ FORCED to replay each level four or more times each. What a waste. Once is\
      \ ideal, two is tolerable but any more is going too far. I have a life and a\
      \ library full of other games to play . The riddler trophies from Arkham Knight\
      \ can kiss my ass, and so can the \"challenges\" in this game.  What a tedious\
      \ grind, and you lock the secret ending and achievements behind doing almost\
      \ all of it? You rude little mongrel.  \n\nAlso I really hate that they localized\
      \ the word \"Diva\" into \"Muse.\" Every time they use that word (often) I feel\
      \ another piece of myself cringe to death. \n\nSpoiler: I beat this game with\
      \ every achievement. I'm not a paid games journo who hates games and sucks at\
      \ them, I just don't like the solid inches of fat I have to chew in this steak\
      \ before getting to the meat."
