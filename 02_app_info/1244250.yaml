    review: 'It''s the best paddle your balls simulator.

      I really enjoyed this game in its entirety.

      Almost 7 hours of wonderful gameplay.

      Also: It even gave me a lot of nostalgia.

      The music is awesome, visuals are neat.

      Voice acting was very enjoyable as well.

      It''s the greatest pong ripoff ever made.

      And it''s also extremely cheap, amazing.

      You should definitely just simply it out.

      It''s not expensive and it''s very fun too.

      Even the soundtrack is very enjoyable.'
