    review: '5/10. Above average art, an okay premise, and some interesting character
      interactions are marred by poor UX and a pretty bad story. This barely skirts
      the edge of acceptability.


      Invisible apartment is technically one (prohibitively short) VN, but is also
      the name of the series, with a prologue and two sequels being folded in as DLC
      to the original. It''s recommended by the devs to buy the other games as DLC,
      so that''s what I did, and I''ll be reviewing all of them here together because
      of that.


      The "presentation" or UX of this VN immediately stands out as...atrocious. It
      was made using a custom-designed engine for some unknown reason (Ren''py has
      been free and widely available for years, first created nearly 15 years ago
      according to Wikipedia), and lacks some really, [i]really[/i] basic features
      that I could put together in a freaking WinForm application in less than a day.
      These features include things like a "backlog," configuration settings (text
      speed, audio levels), skip/auto functionality...these are all extremely, extremely
      basic things that even other VNs using really rudimentary engines (like Himawari)
      support. About 10 minutes into the first story (IA 0) the game crashed on me
      repeatably, and I found through the forums that this was because of the music
      being on. I turned it off and never decided to turn it back on. You get a set
      of saves per game, but it''s only six each--not enough to cover all of the choices
      available for the last two stories.


      The art''s a bit better than the standard for OELVNs. As you can see from the
      main page it''s set in a futuristic world, so the clothing designs are usually
      interesting. The artist also clearly has a penchant for hair, because the main
      character goes through like 5 different styles (usually at least 2 (sometimes
      3) during a story). It''s a nice touch in a medium where a character frequently
      has one outfit, two if they have a route.


      "Gameplay mechanics" are standard VN fare--you pick choices. It treats "wrong"
      choices very strangely however: during the earlier VNs (and possibly during
      the later ones, I didn''t go through every permutation), when you pick a wrong
      choice you travel down that path for a little bit, then when it ends poorly
      you''re immediately booted back to the point of the original choice, with the
      "right" choice already chosen for you. It''s very disorienting. The story has
      a habit of disorienting scene shifts during the regular story as well. Speaking
      of which...


      There are a few different elements to the story that are worth separating: the
      writing quality itself (things like grammar and syntax), the plot (or the sequence/design/logic
      of events that you go through), and then the "execution" of story elements or
      a character''s portrayal.


      The first is substandard ESL, and I apologize if that sounds harsh, but as a
      writer it''s always been very obvious. It makes the experience feel stilted
      and a little unemotional. After a scene shift, frequently a character will painstakingly
      describe the process that brought them to their new location in a manner that
      doesn''t at all fit an "internal monologue" a person might have.


      The second is mediocre to poor. If you look at the entire plot across the series,
      it''s made up of a bunch of actors putting each other into situations and then
      doing nothing when they''re there. Entire swaths of time where a character has
      the ability to act, but does nothing. Their actions belie their motivations.
      The main character comes off as...I can''t think of the word right now, but
      several times she takes an action and then, 5 minutes in real-world time, she
      goes back and does what she was avoiding with her first action. One character
      is said to have been "building a personal army," but they do absolutely nothing
      with this so-called army so this (also) feels half-baked. Spoilers here, but
      the entire "conflict" is resolved by a third party with no interaction with
      any of the "main" characters until the last 5 minutes or so of the final VN--he''s
      acting largely of his own volition, and he has no reason whatsoever to resolve
      the conflict.


      The final aspect, the portrayal of these events or characters, was okay. At
      one point a character spends a bit of time interacting with a surveillance AI
      in the shape of a parrot, and for some reason I found these sections pretty
      funny. Most character interactions feel okay, though a couple times they''re
      deliberately molded to fit a plot contrivance and feel bad. The specifics of
      certain scenes also work okay-to-well, tying back to things (characters or events)
      across each VN.


      All in all this was a very weak experience.


      I don''t always do this, but considering the play time and the price for everything,
      I feel compelled to caution against getting this at full price. It''s not worth
      it. I would say 50% off at max, personally. Even though this is incredibly short,
      for the majority of the experience I really was not interested. A few moments
      during IA 2 produced some intrigue that engaged me, but even that fell away
      with the lackluster ending.'
