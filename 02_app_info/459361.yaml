    review: Ordered yesterday, got it in my library, but never recieved the goods
      in-game. And Steam ofc wont refund because of their 2-hour stupid policy (how
      could i "try it" when i never recieved it in the first place?). R.I.P my moneys,
      gj NCSoft, Steam be damned. Dont buy this crap guys, they will take your money
      but wont give items
