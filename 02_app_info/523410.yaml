    review: 'PLEASE NOTE: Originally, Ozapell Basic was advertised as a beginner''s
      language. Since then the description has shifted to describing it a retro hobbyist
      language. I welcome this change and feel it is more appropriate.


      --------


      Ozapell Basic is a retro-styled programming language. It is advertised as both
      an educational tool to learn the basics of programming and a game development
      tool for simple retro games.


      I was really, really torn on the final verdict of this review. I''ve actually
      enjoyed playing with Ozapell Basic quite a bit. It''s fairly simple to pick
      up and play with. It took me back to my youth for a few hours and that was worth
      the money to me. But it''s also flawed. So would I recommend it? Not to the
      audience it seems to be aimed at...


      Using this as an educational tool seems a bit like teaching someone to drive
      in Ford Model T. The principles may still apply, but it lacks so many modern
      conveniences that I''m not sure if it''s a worthwhile task. There''s no IDE
      here and therefore no syntax highlighting, GUI, contextual help etc. This isn''t
      a complaint as such - it is what appealed to me in the first place. I just take
      issue with inflicting these archaic limitations on a beginner. Something like
      Mu ( https://codewith.mu/ ) would seem to be a much better choice. It still
      has much of the simplicity and immediacy of Ozapell Basic, but lacks the artificial
      outmoded limitations. As an additional bonus, since it is python-based, much
      more help is available.


      The syntax is "inspired by JavaScript, with BASIC keywords." And it''s certainly
      unusual. For example, this if-then construct:


      [code]

      A = 5

      A < 10

      IF RESULT

      PRINTLINE "A IS LESS THAN 10"

      ENDIF

      [/code]


      I would have thought the need for the RESULT keyword was a odd limitation of
      the interpretor. Others might call it horrific. But it''s apparently an intentional
      design choice:

      [quote=Ozapell]PRINT 1+1 won''t work because it combines a subroutine call with
      a mathematical operation. To keep Ozapell Basic as simple to read as possible,
      they must be separated

      In [other] languages, you''re allowed (encouraged?) to crunch as many operations
      together as possible on a single line of code. While it can be convenient for
      veteran programmers, it results in nearly unreadable code. Ozapell Basic was
      designed with simplicity as a primary goal.[/quote]

      I''m not an educator. This may well be a good way to learn. But I remain unconvinced
      it should be enforced by the language. If I''m honest, I have to wonder if this
      is in fact less of a design choice and more a limitation of the way Ozapell
      Basic is implemented.


      So what about as a game development tool? Ozapell says "It could be fun for
      someone who wants to program or make retro style games but doesn''t want to
      learn a complicated modern language." You certainly could develop complete games
      with Ozapell Basic and it could be fun, but I think only in a ''what can I do
      with limitations'' kind of way. If you want to develop something without learning
      a complicated language. I''d recommend Game Maker Studio instead. Anything you
      wanted to make with Ozapell Basic, you could make with Game Maker in a fraction
      of the time. It would be much easier to pick up and learn too. Plus you can
      delve deeper in to code if you wish. Game Maker is also great for children.


      [b]So, how [i]would[/i] I recommend it? If you''re an oddball who can see past
      it''s eccentricities, I say go for it. Ozapell Basic is quirky, sometimes esoteric
      and feels very hobbyist. It can successfully transport you back in time three
      decades and is charming and unique as it does it. Maybe it shouldn''t try to
      be more than that.[/b]


      I''ll finish with the classic "99 bottles" example in Ozapell Basic.

      [code]
