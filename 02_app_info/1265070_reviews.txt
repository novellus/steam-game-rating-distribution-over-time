The 2D section felt quite like aimless wandering, and it was difficult to establish any sense of direction due to the similarity of every environment. The platforming mechanics were fairly rough on top of that.\n\nI got bored before I even reached one of the 3D bits, and I think the disclaimer about the game's difficulty is a bit of a cop-out to make the poor mechanics seem deliberate. It just wasn't fun.","timestamp_created":1590273964,"timestamp_updated":1590273964,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458333343267440796","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1591199239,"developer_response":"Hey, thanks for the feedback!\nI've looked at what you've said and done a complete redesign on the 2D portion of the game.
