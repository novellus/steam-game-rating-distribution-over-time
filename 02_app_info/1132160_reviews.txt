I was excited when I started it because I love genetics-based games like Niche. I could not make sense of the Mendelian aspect of this game. Crossing plants did not produce the Mendelian ratios you'd expect in nature. That's fine if the creators didn't want the breeding to work out that way. But calling the game \"Mendel's Garden\" is misleading. \nI understand that the game is still in early-access, but the buggy-ness of it made it really frustrating to just play the game. Moving around through the different parts of the garden is cumbersome and the the quick travel is not as useful as it could be. \nI do like the story though and the plants have really neat designs.","timestamp_created":1608262775,"timestamp_updated":1608262775,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550172984600067139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4jc77ufYCdYuMuwI="}
