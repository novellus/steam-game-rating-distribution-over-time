You would instinctivly think that with that many heroes some or most of them would feel quite alike. Not so in this game. \n\nWith 40 heroes released as of writing this review all of them feel unique and it is quite interesting to figure ou how to best utilize a different hero.\n\nThe gamplay loop of Time Break Chronicles is very simple you choose a party of 6 heroes and battle through sets of up to 6 monsters until you finally meet the midboss and finally the endboss. During this Journy you might find loot that will help you on this run or find meta currency and items which are used to upgarde your heroes after the run.\n\nThese heroe upgrades are the part where the game truly shines and are split into two parts. \nSkill upgardes and Relics. \nThose upgrades range from boring like increased dmg to exiting like my hero can to that now?\nWith both of themhowever you have to choose which of you heroes gets this valubale item which then can no longer be used. And so the tinkering which heroes gets what item and which skill should be improved is quite interesting.\n\nOverall i would recommend this game to anyone that likes the leveling and battling aspect of Jrpgs, and likes discovering new and intersting heroes.\n\n","timestamp_created":1609360439,"timestamp_updated":1609360439,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ47e7W2vYCcevxvgI="}
