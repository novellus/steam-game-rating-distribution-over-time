I really hope the devs advertise this game more and add bots or single player mode but until then I wouldn't try it. I wish I could have had a chance to play, I wanted to do a video on it but sometimes things don't go as plan. inXile entertainment I am sure you can make this game work and don't take this review as a really bad review, think of it as a suggestion/opinion. The graphics are nice and I am sure if you manage to find a lobby maybe it'll be fun.","timestamp_created":1609668647,"timestamp_updated":1609668647,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hcvu4/YCf/yCwAI="}
