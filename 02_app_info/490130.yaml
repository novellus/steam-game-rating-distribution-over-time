    review: "Ok, here is my legit first review. I will pretty much explain what happens\
      \ in this \"movie\", which it hardly is, really, it is just a super long documentary\
      \ of some old guys desperately trying to get funding to complete the airplane\
      \ scene for their decades old recreation of RoTLA. They get into arguments and\
      \ find out new problems about shooting the scene for minutes on end, and then\
      \ you see clips of the film, just short clips, not the whole thing. Yeah, maybe\
      \ they should retitle it to \"Raiders! : Just Another Documentary...\" and if\
      \ some of you are thinking that this is the full film, it is not. I mean, criticism\
      \ all aside, I guess it is fun to watch a bunch of old people speak about their\
      \ crazy past and where they are now, and if you have time to rent it, I guess\
      \ I would recommend it, even though it's not worth the 10 dollars I paid, or\
      \ the 7 dollars to rent it. You have to be a hardcore fan of Indiana Jones to\
      \ really appreciate this movie.\n\nEDIT: AUGUST 27TH 2016 \n\nNow, the movie\
      \ is going to be on Netflix by September 15th. What a waste of money this movie\
      \ truely was. I paid 11 dollars for this movie, which is the same damn price\
      \ for a month of HD Netflix!!!"
