    review: "Very low resolution experience. \n\nThis won't run in 4k 3d. It is telling\
      \ me I need some gibberish I don't understand. If this (gibberish) is software,\
      \ why isn't it included with the game?\n\nIf it is hardware, why isn't it listed\
      \ as a requirement on the store page?\n\n(I have: Reverb G2, 3090, 10900k 64gb\
      \ ram)\n\nEdit: googled the gibberish, downloaded it from microsoft store (cost\
      \ me \xA31), restarted, ran the game. Still doesn't work. Refunded. Can't refund\
      \ the \xA31 from microsoft though."
