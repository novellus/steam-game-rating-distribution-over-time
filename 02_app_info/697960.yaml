    review: "Welcome to a bad mobile port where they has removed the in-game cash\
      \ shop\nthat you used to spend real money on. So now you are forced to wait\
      \ for 24 hours to refill half of your stamina bar so that you can play more\
      \ = very bad move\n\nThis game was first free2play here on Steam and then they\
      \ changed it so it did cost 7\u20AC\nand now again they made it free2play \"\
      with no information given to why they did make the change in payment.\n\nNote:\
      \ There are no way to play this game in windowed mode or turn on / off sound\
      \ or music\n\"There are still many things to add and tweak in this game, so\
      \ there are no way i can give this game a positive review\n\nWorth to play?\
      \ not really unless they put more work into it :P"
