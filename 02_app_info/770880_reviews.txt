Fun HO scenes, intriguing minigames, and a decent plot. The protagonist is a woman whose father passes away, asking her to check out their beach house as one last favor to him, before she sells it. Years earlier, a tragedy had happened out on the waves, which she has been avoiding facing fully. The loss of her first love. Once there, though, she begins to sense that things may not be soâ€¦ finished.\n\nGet on discount or in the bundle, but still a decent read.","timestamp_created":1540774521,"timestamp_updated":1540774521,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.564176261425018311","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iq3U3uYCeJXFrQE="}
