    review: Not very good. The 133 included monsters are just around 20 actual models
      that have been slightly tweaked and coloured differently as if just done through
      the game's hue slider. The faces are also awful, and very low detailed. The
      monsters themselves are generally very creative and cool, but not cool enough
      that a copy pasted version of one in every colour is to my liking. Not recommended,
      not worth the price
