    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A NOT TOO CASUAL BIKE GAME</h2><br>Elasto\
      \ Mania (commonly known as Elma) is an indie motorbike simulation game, a colorful\
      \ 2D racing experience released in 2000 as a successor to Action SuperCross.\
      \ The full version of the original edition contains 54 levels and a level editor.\
      \ This gem of a retro arcade game is a blast to play and challenging to master,\
      \ you will quickly get the hang of it, once you start playing!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >A NEVERENDING EXPERIENCE</h2><br>There is always something new to discover\
      \ when it comes to this beloved enduro platformer. When you think you have completed\
      \ all the levels and collected all the goodies, it\u2019s time to open the level\
      \ editor and create your own challenge. Discover the thousands of fan creations,\
      \ gameplay content, levels, graphics, tools and even multiplayer modes right\
      \ in the Steam Workshop and on the community websites.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">A\
      \ CULT CLASSIC</h2><br>The days of floppy disks, CRT monitors and dial-up internet\
      \ are long gone, but our old school favorite outlived them all. 2020 marks the\
      \ 20th anniversary of the game and it\u2019s still going strong. A lot has happened\
      \ in the past two decades, Elasto Mania has been upgraded for modern machines,\
      \ but in spite of the small tweaks and updates this fully formed cult classic\
      \ is still the same \u201Chard, but casual, but hard\u201D retro PC game we\
      \ all love. Here\u2019s to the next 20!"
