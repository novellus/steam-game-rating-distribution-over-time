    review: 'Pros:

      -Very well written

      -Very intriguing and unique premise


      Cons:

      -Short. I beat it in 2.4 hours reading at a medium/fast pace

      -Very few skill checks, literally maybe one or two for some

      -Middling replayability. Could probably enjoy one two more runs


      Would recommend for the price but there is better out there.'
