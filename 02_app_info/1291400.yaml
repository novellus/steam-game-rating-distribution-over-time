    review: Amazing stuff. Game is fantastic. Music is fantastic. The visuals and
      story are fantastic. I love this game. Man do I love this game. From time to
      time the soundtrack gives me a hint of the old eve soundtrack/jukebox from back
      in the day. Good times. Thank you for making this game.
