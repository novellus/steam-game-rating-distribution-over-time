Although I'm quite confused as to how any of it makes sense at times.\n\nRight, so it's about a group of prisoners that are cutting short their sentences by going to a hotel to \"help out\" around the place but just end up messing about, f**king eachother and smoking weed? Seems very realistic... I guess the logic guy was out of the room when Vince McMahon was yelling at the script writer. Their are so many plot holes.\n\nVince: \"THEY SHOULD BE PRISONERS, HOT PRISONERS, YEAH! BUT THEY'RE ALSO COLLEGE GIRLS, HOT COLLEGE GIRLS DAMN IT! AND WHEN KANE GRABS HOLD OF ONE OF 'EM, I WANNA SEE HIM SNIFFING HER, GROPING HER, THAT'LL GET THE FAMILY JEWELS GOING! OH AND LOT'S OF GORE, DON'T FORGET THE GORE, STUPID AMOUNTS OF BLOOD AND GORE AND PUPPIES! IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH ANY OF THAT? NO? WELL GOOD, GOD DAMN IT, BECAUSE IF THEIR WAS... YOUUUUUUU'RRRRRRREEEEEE FIRRRRRRREEDDDDDDD!\"\n\nScript Writer: \"But Mr. McMahon, Sir, none of that makes any sense.\"\n\nVince: \"WHO GIVES A CRAP? THESE IDIOTS WILL BUY AND WATCH ANYTHING!\"\n\nThat's my general thought on how this movie was made. All in all though, it's not the worst thing I've ever watched but it's nothing to go and spend your money on.","timestamp_created":1534095838,"timestamp_updated":1534095838,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.599548220634460449","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws5nPl+UCetOdqAE="}
