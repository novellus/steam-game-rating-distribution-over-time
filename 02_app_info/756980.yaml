    review: 'First


      But to be serious, this a simple and fun platforming game. The objective is
      simple, get from point A to point B. The difficulty gets more challenging as
      you advance, just like any other game. The answers aren''t always clear and
      have a lot of trial and error. Graphics are simple, nothing to fancy. The soundtrack
      isn''t made by John Williams, but it sets the environment for you.


      Make sure you select a mouse sensitivity. It''s simple, press ESC button in
      game and type in a number.


      7/10 would Johnny Guitar again.'
