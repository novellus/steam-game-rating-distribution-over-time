    review: 'Hexagroove is probably the most interesting and exciting music game I''ve
      ever played.  It''s a rhythm game made by people with a deep and obvious love
      of electronic music and the culture around it.  It plays in a unique and intuitive
      way that makes it simple to make some kick ass music.  Honestly, I never knew
      how much I needed something like this in my life.


      Unlike other rhythm games which rely on quick reflexes and tapping along to
      the beat, most of Hexagroove''s gameplay centers around layering different instrumental
      loops.  If you''re the kind of person who likes to play a game for the challenge,
      then it might not be for you.  Most of the fun comes from putting together the
      different pieces and finding a solid groove, then adjusting it and playing with
      it on the fly.  There''s room for a lot more experimentation and playfulness
      than in games that emphasize skill mastery, like Beatmania or Audiosurf.  It
      offers some mini-games and an obligatory campaign, but you won''t find anything
      too taxing except on the highest difficulty.  I''ve made my way through the
      whole game on each difficulty level, but most of my time is spent in free mode
      just jamming out.  I''d hesitate to even call Hexagroove a game.  It controls
      like a game, and it''s got levels, achievements and tricks to perform for style
      points, but it plays more like an instrument, something you can play to make
      cool music, without any of the hassle of having to learn to beatmatch or how
      to use an MPC.


      If you''re one of the people who it appeals to, it''ll leaving you wanting a
      whole lot more.  There are 13 tracks to play with, and while that''s not too
      terribly many, every single one is an absolute banger that is a pitch-perfect
      representation of a wide range of genres.  If you enjoy electronic music, you
      will find some really legitimate tunes ranging from liquid drum & bass, psytrance,
      minimal techno and nu garage.  Seriously, the only thing I can really find to
      criticize about the game is that I simply want more.  More genres more producers
      more samples more more more.  I can''t even imagine what could happen if Workshop
      support opened up.


      If you like music games, just go ahead and give the demo a try.  If it hooks
      you the same way, then I guarantee that it''s worth the price tag for how much
      you can get out of it.  You will get lost in making dope beats for hours.  There''s
      nothing quite like it out there.'
