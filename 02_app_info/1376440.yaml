    about_the_game: "War of Velana is a single player 16-bit RPG that combines world\
      \ exploration and interaction with an orthographic grid-based tactical battle\
      \ system. In many ways, War of Velana is in many ways a spiritual successor\
      \ to the Shining Force series on the Sega Genesis. Elements of those games are\
      \ the core, and combine with some design ideas from Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy\
      \ Tactics to create a new tactical experience. In War of Velana, your characters\
      \ have static classes and gain a variety of skills and equipment upgrades as\
      \ you progress through the game. In between combat, you\u2019ll be able to explore\
      \ and interact with the world around you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis demo covers\
      \ the first chapter of the game and is about 90% content complete. There will\
      \ be additional bug fixes, side content, and other improvements added as we\
      \ have them ready. If you play the demo, we'd love to know your thoughts or\
      \ any issues you encountered along the way!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSetting:<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nThe world of Velana, in its current state, has four nations:<br\
      \ />\r\nAlta, a royal kingdom of sprawling green fields, meadows, and riverlands.<br\
      \ />\r\nKovell, a nation with a wide plain of autumn-gold, a dark forest, and\
      \ a northern tundra.<br />\r\nIshdar, a small desert island nation of artisans\
      \ and warriors to the far east.<br />\r\nJakka, a jungle archipelago with towering\
      \ mountains and devout monasteries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStory:<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nOur story starts in Alta near the foothills of the Goravia Ridge, outside\
      \ the small village of Pell. A pair of hunters close in on their mark. As they\
      \ make their way back to the village, they run into Jon, a trader who frequents\
      \ the northern roads. They help him repair his cart, but quickly realize that\
      \ bandits have taken over their home. Events continue to unfold, the party bears\
      \ witness to a mysterious encounter and potential sparks of a new war.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nCharacters:<br />\r\nArnen, a hunter from Pell Village. He is skilled\
      \ with a bow and keen to help people. Arnen lives with his sister, Karissa.<br\

      \ magic spells and weapon skills to learn. Though you may find two allies of\

      \ ranges.<br />\r\nWhen a unit levels up, their HP, SP, and stats increase based\
      \ on growth ranges for their class. Melee units will focus on Attack, Defense,\
      \ or Speed growth whereas casters will focus on Magic and Resistance, in most\
      \ cases.<br />\r\nThere are many allies, items, and secrets to uncover all over\
      \ the country of Alta. As you adventure around, you\u2019ll be able to interact\

      \ />\r\nIn battle, you\u2019ll have an active party of 8 units to face off against\
