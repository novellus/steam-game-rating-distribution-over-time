Your power is mine!\" - Ororo Munroe (Storm), X-Men Animated Series[/h1]\n\nThunder Gun: Revenge of the Mutants is a fun shoot'em up where you utilise a lightning gun for many uses such as traversing through the map, activating tesla coils, activating tesla turrets, and of course. Raining lightning through the hordes of enemies. You can use lightning to charge up and \"Thunder Jump\" across ledges as well as put the gun into \"Overcharge\" mode which essentially obliterates everything on screen. There is alot of fun to be had with this game as you level up your character for more weapons, costumes, and perks.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n- Shocking Gameplay\n- Fun leveling and perks\n- Unique and creative ways of using a Lightning Gun\n- Retro Graphics\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n- It is a paid sequel to a flash game. However this game is fun as well and doesn't hurt donating money.\n- The price maybe a bit much and rarely goes on sale, if at all.\n\n[h1]My Rating: 8/10[/h1]","timestamp_created":1514301039,"timestamp_updated":1514301039,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mYTYyeACccnQkwE="}
