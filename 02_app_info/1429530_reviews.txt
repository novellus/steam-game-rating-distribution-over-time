This game is bad, but asking 20 dollars for it is just insane.\nif you want a game like this in VR, i can give you many better, cheaper options.\ndefense grid 2, aria vr, automota break (this one is a great alternative) last day defense, toy clash, miniture tower defense, hex defense, in your face tower defense, djinn and taco, cosmic trip (cosmic trip is a superb first person rts/tower defense) out of ammo and out of ammo death drive (both are amazing tower defense games with blended first person shooting and light base building. Death drive has been recently updated too so its got all the bells and whistles.\n\nsee, there even more out there for VR, but those mentioned i either own and love or are just well made.\nthis is neither, i cannot recomend this at all, in fact i would reccommend you steer clear of it in its current condition.","timestamp_created":1608105497,"timestamp_updated":1608105497,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520547926425933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4mtKjtfYCcJPSugI="}
