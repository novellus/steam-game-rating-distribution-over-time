The problem that makes what should be fun to be annoying is that you die simply by the enemy getting close to you. And you just have one life. So all it takes is one zombie coming at you to just get close to you, and bam, you have to start all the way at the begining. I don't recomend buying they change this. We all know that VR cannot be exact sometimes, as camera placement, and calibration can be different. My advice is not to buy this until they fix this and make the game more flexibile.","timestamp_created":1503274558,"timestamp_updated":1503274558,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo6yJgd4CdsOVgwE="}
