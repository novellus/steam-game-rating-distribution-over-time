    short_description: Fight and drink for the glory of Odin in Bierzerkers, a multiplayer
      melee arena combat game. While quick to pick up and get in some killing, the

    review: the game is dead, I don't know why it is still on steam. Don't buy it
      unless you can have fun playing monopoly alone in the darkness because there
      is no single player.
