    review: 'Again huge pity that the development team or author didn''t think and
      consult better when creating the game. It is bit difficult to understand why
      such mistakes must happen, but I guess it is human nature to be blind, overconfident
      and fail.


      This game, on side, is a dream come true for all match-3-type games players.
      All the freedom you ever wanted is here and it is done with good programming
      and nice graphics. You can move tiles and create whatever shapes and big combinations
      and then with complete freedom choose when to "pulse" them away. But at the
      same time the freedom, given from beginning, is even killing the game. There
      is fun in being limited and having to fight something. I was even lost my first
      game, not knowing what to do. No no no, the tutorial IS there and teaches you
      what is different about the game. Perfect, simple, easily understandable. But
      it forgot to tell or emphasize, that the goal is to fill the scale in the bottom
      of the screen. Ans since the beginning levels are so easy, so I was even thinking
      what the hell is the goal I am to fulfill here! I didn''t see where it tells
      the task and how much of what to shoot off to succeed.


      I can''t mourn enough for the loss that happened with this game - the programming
      is clear and the game is very quick, perfectly working! The graphics are nice,
      the author did understand that attractive colors and pictures are key for succesful
      match-3 type game. Or he didn''t undestand that nad was just lucky to choose
      such graphics, because it is very hard to understand that someone would know
      that graphics are important and not know that music is as well! What the hell
      who is this weirdo to put in the game so negative disharmonical and stressing
      music!!? Yes, sure, you can switch off th music and play some your favourite
      music on computer in background. But that still doesn''t excuse the mistake
      and there comes another mistake: The hell why this game lacks the option to
      switch off only music and leave sounds??! With switching off music you switch
      off the sounds too! And to play without sound completely feels like to walk
      and not feel your feet stepping on floor! So with sound on or off, both options
      feel bad. Also the background pictures are nice, but they are too quickly switching
      so that you cannot really enjoy them. The game is or can be peaceful and has
      even zen mode, but the music is so stressing and rushing that it takes away
      all the peace!! Even the movement is so nicely quick, but it lacks some feeling
      of the movement, is bit like too easy and not truly comfy, doesn''t give you
      the feel of moving something preset - this detail is hard to describe and I
      am sure the author if reading doesn''t understand what I mean, but the sensitive
      player surely knows that it doesn''t feel so good. There should be some bounce-back,
      some friction, sound etc. encompanied with it.


      This game is horrible mistake. It could easily be the best match-3 type game
      but is just another unsuccesful crap thanks to its trivial mistakes. Such a
      pity! So good and so bad at the same time.

      Dear creator, if you are accidently kissed by a muse and understand that you
      must consult with someone sensitive and understanding, then don''t hesitate
      to contact me so that we can recreate this game into a new and really succesful
      and fabulous one, one that will touch heart and create addiction, not one that
      is weird, with wasted efforts and gets lost after release.'
