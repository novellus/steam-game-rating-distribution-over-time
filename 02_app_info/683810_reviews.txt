I'm not kidding, you can't believe how terrible this is until you try playing it.\n\nThe game is so poorly designed it's shocking, even the main menu is beyond terrible. Massive empty space everywhere with tiny clickable play or exit buttons in the lower left, just looking at the main menu is a red flag that you're in for a bad time with this game. \n\nAbsolutely no tutorial or instructions on how to play I had to try and figure out the buttons myself. You use the arrow keys to \"fly\" your plane and press spacebar to drop missiles as bombs on other planes. Not only does this not make sense, it doesn't even work properly. Your plane is all over the place because of the terrible controls and is so hard to control. The game randomly ends for no reason when playing and You'll just blow up and die after 10 seconds.\n\n[b][url=store.steampowered.com/curator/18710490/] --> Follow My Steam Curator Here <--[/url][/b]\n\nNo reason for doing anything, no explanation of anything. No reason to play, no reason to even launch this. I actually wonder if the so-called \"developer\" of this has ever even played video games before. If this is what they call a game then I would assume they haven't.","timestamp_created":1520348289,"timestamp_updated":1520348333,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.582399427890777588","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vND0/eECc7r0mgE="}
