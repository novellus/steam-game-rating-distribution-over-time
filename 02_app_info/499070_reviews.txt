I'm admitting that I totally missed this ones objective. The Play calling choices are alittle confusing but then again take into account players error and it almost adds up. The penalties like in real life are unpredictable and frustrating-no theyre not picking on your Team. As far as ediability this game is Great Your in Charge of The play options totally. If your looking for Great Music or Sound effects not so much. I had stated this game isn't realistic when in reality it is totally for statistics. I dont get somethings though like for one you dont see a moving Time Clock-it moves randomly at the end of each play. I'd like to see an option for a visiable ticking clock so you can Time Out when needed. The Game is a Coaches BlackBoard and a Statistical Machine. Yes I Recommend this for the Editability if nothing else-Like Tech-no Bowl but more Numbers. Good Job.","timestamp_created":1515545341,"timestamp_updated":1528032532,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4sL14uMCe8rOlQE="}
