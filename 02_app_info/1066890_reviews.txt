Some newer cars are nice but overal its all over the place, GT3 changed from nice  on to realy weird and overreactive. Tracks are good for the most part, AMS2 has some realy nice tracks that no one else has. Graphics are up there with the best but thats not on the number 1 reason to go simracing, thats the physics. the physics are not yet good enough and sometimes just bad. This game still needs a lot of work to make it good and final release worthy. A lot of changes are still being made too the cars so your setups will have to be reset on a regular base. For now (dec. 12 2020) I will remove the game from my machine and will give it some time before I reinstall it again.","timestamp_created":1607786295,"timestamp_updated":1610188826,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2fSu8/YCeJHCuQI="}
