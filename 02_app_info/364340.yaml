    about_the_game: "Active Sky Next, the most widely used weather engine for PC flight\
      \ simulation, provides an entirely new level of realism to your FSX: Steam Edition\
      \ experience! Advanced technologies enable incredible levels of accuracy and\
      \ smoothness. Realistic radar simulation, cloud position awareness and synchronized\
      \ ambient effects, brand new air effects, brand new thunderstorm depictions,\
      \ microbursts, thick overcast, smooth cloud transitions, variable cloud areas,\
      \ voice weather briefings and forecast data integration are just some of the\
      \ features that await you!<br><br>With ASN, your skies will be accurate, smooth,\
      \ visually stunning and uncompressed. No longer must you configure complicated\
      \ settings to achieve accuracy in certain areas while compromising others. You\
      \ can have it all, all the time.<br><br>ASN also introduces, for the first time\
      \ ever in a weather engine: Complete cloud position awareness, synchronized\
      \ cloud-based ambient weather effects and an integrated accurate radar simulation.\
      \ Precipitation is accurately depicted in the proper locations within and below\
      \ appropriate cloud structures. Entering or exiting a cloud brings an appropriate\
      \ change in precipitation, visibility and turbulence. The exact position of\
      \ clouds and precipitation cells are always synchronized between the simulator\
      \ depiction and the radar display.<br><br>Thunderstorms have been given great\
      \ attention, utilizing a new depiction system, ambient effects, radar and cloud\
      \ position synchronization. Completely new microburst, updraft and downdraft,\
      \ enhanced turbulence and wind-shear effects combine to make thunderstorms beautiful\
      \ yet dangerous. Using the new radar system will be key to safe piloting in\
      \ the vicinity of these storms.<br><br>Full International Airmet/Sigmet simulation\
      \ is now provided in real time weather mode, with airmet/sigmet areas shown\
      \ visually on the map and/or gauge. These areas are now also synthesized, influencing\
      \ weather depiction appropriately. If a Sigmet warns against severe turbulence,\
      \ convective activity, or icing, you can expect to encounter this appropriately\
      \ during your flight.<br><br>New voice weather briefings, a new intuitive user\
      \ interface with resizable/undockable and multi-window support, redesigned high-resolution\
      \ wake turbulence simulation, and enhanced air effects are just a few of the\
      \ other new features in ASN.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"\
