    review: "If I didn't know any better, I would say this game is vapor-ware. This\
      \ seems to have the absolute minimum amount of playability to be on Steam Early\
      \ Access. Nearly no key does anything, and everything is put together by 4 toddlers.\
      \ It takes literal seconds for the game to process that all of 5 words have\
      \ appeared on screen, and until it is done processing such a heavy load, the\
      \ player is asked to sit and look at all the visuals on screen. All that eye\
      \ candy bouncing about, giving us players a visual experience like no other.\
      \ \n\n      This company has experience in making an inferior product with their\
      \ last Steam game. This game has similar issues, as the menu/game stop working\
      \ for a second or two when clicking something. I don't mean for a moment or\
      \ two, I mean a literal 2 seconds of sitting there with twiddling my thumbs\
      \ because a game with worse graphics than 8-bit NES. Don't waste your money\
      \ on this EA title, it is NOWHERE near being in a position to be test in the\
      \ Early Access program, let alone anywhere near being even a little bit fun.\n\
      \nTL:DR    Do not buy this, this game is WORSE than most vapor-ware titles.\
      \ The game barely loads, and when it does, it is NOT an action RPG as the store\
      \ says, as everything is so clunky the last word anyone should associate with\
      \ this title is \"action.\" In reality, this is just crap with no reason to\
      \ be in Early Access, and I would question whether Steam's vetting process for\
      \ weeding out  scams and vapor-ware is actually working or not."
