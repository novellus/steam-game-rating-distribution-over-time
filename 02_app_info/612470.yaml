      /><br><br><br>Bio Inc.: Redemption is a complex biomedical simulator in which
      you make life or death decisions. Create the ultimate illness to infect and
      torment your victim or play as the head of a medical team and hopefully find
      a cure to save your patient. Will you be the plague or preserve humanity?<br><br>Including
      over 600 actual diseases, virus, symptoms, diagnostic tests, treatments and
      other medical conditions, Bio Inc.: Redemption is frighteningly realistic. It
      will captivate you for hours, bringing you into a microscopic world of epic
      plague proportions!<br><br>As the sequel to the worldwide mobile hit Bio Inc.
      (enjoyed by over 15 million players), Bio Inc.: Redemption was rebuilt from
      the ground up to make it the most realistic and visually stunning medical condition
      simulator available.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/612470/extras/Banner2.jpg?t=1605797735"

    review: Way too expensive for what is basically an improved free mobile game.
      A lot of waiting for points, hoping to get a decent amount in time to have a
      chance. Also you do not really have a choice in difficulty because you have
      to do higher ones, and heads up for death, if you try to build up points you
      lose, the patient will evolve all the good things and then recovery will be
      instant once you start trying to kill
