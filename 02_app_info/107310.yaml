    reviews: "\u201CSo when I say Cthulhu Saves The World is already one of my favourite\
      \ games of 2011 you can be sure I've not been swayed by its astonishingly precise\
      \ pastiche of early 1990s JRPG cliches, strident synth music, chunky menus and\
      \ all. It's simply a really clever, hugely enjoyable game, and it's as much\
      \ honest tribute as cheeky spoof.\u201D<br>\u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-01-11-cthulhu-saves-the-world-review\"\

      It's rare to find a game that is both entertaining and genuinely funny, and\
      \ so far Cthulhu Saves the World is both.\u201D<br>\u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/01/06/xbox-live-indie-gems-cthulhu-saves-the-world/\"\
