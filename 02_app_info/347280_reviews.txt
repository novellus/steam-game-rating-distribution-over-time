I didn't enjoy itâ€¦but it was challenging and I felt compelled to continue. Until the 2nd arena battle, where I hit a wall.\n\nIf I had one serious complaint to make to the developer, it's that making the weapons powerups slooowly follow you once you get close is just really a bad idea, because when you're kiteing enemies around the arena, the powerup is stuck in a blob of enemies and you can't get it it, and without powered up weapons you can't destroy the blob. So. Infuriating. That, and weapons powerups often spawn off-screen in the arena. You hear the sound, but it's not in your field of view. Also not fun.\n\nMaybe this game would be more fun co-op.","timestamp_created":1594525036,"timestamp_updated":1594525036,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3qXGoPMCfaDblAI="}
