    review: Much better than I thought it would be! Whether you never got to dissect
      a frog, you're in school now, or just curious, I highly recommend. You have
      a hologram doctor and guides bringing you through the whole lab. While the dissection
      itself is just following lines and plucking organs the entire application is
      very thoughtful. They include a human anatomy chart on the wall for you to refrence,
      as well as many pop up charts with extra details. The setting itself is also
      very nice, feeling like a real lab, with the added addition of a jukebox and
      some good tunes! Very very happy with this.
