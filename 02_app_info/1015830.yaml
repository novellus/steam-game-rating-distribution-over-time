    review: "A example that a good Game dosent Need a Big Dev. Team & Buget... AFAIK\
      \ - This Game is made by 2 People.\n\n-Important Note- You must Install the\
      \ (free) \"R18-DLC\" to get a version with animated \"Private\" scenes.\n\n\
      -About the Game- \n(BTW - To call it \"Game\" is maybe a little missleading\
      \ - It's a Story with a Fix Play throught)\n\n1. Nice Graphics, Meshes (Models)\
      \ and Textures are Nice and in good Quality.\n2. Animations are all very nice\
      \ and proper. Excellent Face impressions. Body movements etc.\n3. Performance,\
      \ It runs smooth and dosent need much resources (as far i can say - check the\
      \ system spec's)\n4. Translation to English isnt flawless but good.\n5. The\
      \ Game is only 1 Chapter of a Story... so it's Short. (5 \"Private\"Scenes)\
      \ But a nice Storyline. \n(It's allredy noted on the Shop page by the Dev. that\
      \ it is Short)\n6. Nice Sound that dosent bore after a few Minutes of Play.\
      \ (The \"Lewd\" Sound of the DLC is a little strange but - sexy?!)\n\nSo is\
      \ it worth to buy? 100% Yes! - at the moment it's Sold for 5$ and that is Cheap\
      \ for what you get... I did buy much worse ones for more Money. This one is\
      \ really good made and i will sure Buy the next Chapter if they ever will release\
      \ one... (Big respect to the Dev's of that Game. THX a lot for your Work.)"
