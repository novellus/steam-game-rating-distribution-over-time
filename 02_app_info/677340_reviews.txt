Theres plenty to build, the economy becomes more complex the more you research, theres a good portion of gameplay to be found with enough depth to pose a challenge to a seasoned strategy player.\nIts all about creating efficient cities too, so when you like efficiency puzzles, you might like it as well.\n\nRegarding scope it falls a bit too short. Theres a lot to do, but not a lot to achieve or head to.\nThe campaign is super short (i havent counted them, but roughly 12 missions including the introduction levels), random maps might give you variety in environment, but nothing to thrive for.\nThere is no meta goal or super difficult challenge to achieve.\nMilitary also seems to be limited to community made maps and the campaign.\nSadly the community maps are not that inspired and even if they were, there is a really limited amount anyway.\n\nI personally wished that there was some overarching goal you could go for. A gigantic monument that takes a lot of effort to complete, a solid AI you can play against on maps for up to 4 players at least (=1v3 AI, deathmatch or 2v2 (player and 3 AIs), multiplayer or some sort of meta game (see Mindustry and its planetary campaign with sectors or \"Before We Leave\" with its solar system where you can connect several planets together).\n\nBut there isnt.\nIn that way its more limited than Settlers 2.\n\n\nThis game leaves me with a feeling that it does a lot much better than the classical Settlers Games and brings in some fresh wind while keeping a similar style, while at the same time falling short in providing scope and scale.\nIn that sense it feels like a really well done first game to prove that it works. \nAnd if i could voice a wish to the developer, then it would be to take this game as a basis for the next one and create a sequel with bigger scope and scale.\n\n\nI recommend it. Its a really good and fun game. \nIt looks fine and the universe is explained fine enough to make it feel ok that there are robots that need food and water and not some sort of biological species.\nAlthough i would prefer the latter.\nThe strategic gameplay is deep and complex enough and it provides enough to play around with for a few dozen hours.\nMore if you create your own maps with the map editor or love to challenge people in Frontier Mode with \"speedrunning\".\n","timestamp_created":1610055412,"timestamp_updated":1610055412,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkv2x7/YCdYSxwQI="}
