      \ Swedish countryside. A month has passed since the population vanished overnight,\
      \ and you have spent this time exploring the grim open world alone and with\
      \ friends, sticking to the shadows to scavenge for equipment and weapons in\
      \ your attempt to stay alive. All the while, you\u2019ve identified the mastermind\

      \ /><br>Dusted from coast to coast in snow, this formerly popular ski resort\
