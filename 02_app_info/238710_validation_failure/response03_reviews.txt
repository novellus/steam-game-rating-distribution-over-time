Its not their fault 3d0 is just as boring. However Designer crashes much much less. In my case... never crashes. I love nodes however there are some things that have irked me for years. \n\nmy only complaints -\nGrey inputs and yellow inputs and gradient masks - can this be more automatic? No big deal but still.\nI wish i could drag a node near another node and the connections are made..... like blender.\nVray support for substances would be illa. But blender support would be even more awesome. \n\nBut thats just picking for things to complain about. \n\nThe truth is you need this for painter and it makes the experience so much deeper. Being able to create a material with a soul and levers is the ($*@#ing @(@*! When I'm in marmoset pulling sliders that bring about wear and tear the dogs quit barking and stare in awe. I love this feature. But when people ask me whats the difference between Painter and Designer I usually say \"they are like a scientist and a renissance artist\". One is very technical and powerful but the other is more artistic and free. Needless to say you need them both but you can live with only one depending on the level of control you want and how much... fun you want texturing to be. \n\nI must also ask. Whats the deal with Maya 2014 / 2015 and Substances? I cant get them to load.... get off of autodesk and get with the times guys. Your modo support is awesome but the other apps are more lacking. Marmoset is where its at for showing substances.","timestamp_created":1421517734,"timestamp_updated":1421517734,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57021409273147583","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh+jD/MoCd+PENQ=="}
