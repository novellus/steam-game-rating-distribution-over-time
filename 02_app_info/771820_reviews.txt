Unfortunately, it turned out to be a buggy mess with horrible controls. Purchased on launch date, a week, I was hoping the developers would have fixed the bugs by now. Joystick controllers will launch your character sideways, frequent stuck in the walls and there isnt even a QUIT game option on the main menu!\n\nInteresting concept if it was executed properly, but at this state, it's shovelware at it's finest. \n\nSteam refund requested.","timestamp_created":1528560589,"timestamp_updated":1528560589,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532277941703796387","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jPPT8uMCe8/DogE="}
