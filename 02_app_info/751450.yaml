    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2>Kagami Makoto is in his 3rd year
      of college when he inherits the estate of his late grandfather and starts planning
      out what he's going to do with his newfound home. However, his plans are foiled
      when his childhood friend Iyo, who turns out to be a zashiki-warashi, introduces
      herself, looking exactly the same as he remembers her from over a decade ago.
      Then, a woman named Kikyou, who claims to be a demon, also appears before him.
      <br><br>After that, it isn't long before a pretty detective at the police department
      comes knocking on his door, imploring him to take up his family's duty of helping
      wandering spirits pass on to the afterlife and assist the police with any and
      all supernatural crimes reported in town. But when a case that's bigger than
      any of them ever imagined comes his way, will he be able to handle it? With
      the power of clairvoyance, an ability passed down through his family that allows
      him to see spirits, maybe he and his demon familiars can pull through, and he
      can be a proper successor to his family's legacy.<h2 class="bb_tag">Characters</h2><br><img
