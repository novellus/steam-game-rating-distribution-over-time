And I'm sure there are more, if you care about replayability.\n\nThe achievements add replay value as well.\n\nAlso, I really liked the magic tower mode. That one is less roguelike and more platforming. There is one bad game design where basically if you die, you always end up at 1 hp for boss fights and that can quickly get hard when you are fighting end game bosses with 1 hit. It is also possible to trap yourself in magic tower because part of the mode is a bit of puzzle and going in the right direction / using the key in the right place at the right time. For the most part, honestly fairly well designed mode. You can reason your decisions out by checking to see where else you can go and also make backup saves. Tho I had to reload the entire mode a few times, but luckily that was early game. There is also some gems at the end I missed bc I used the wrong key / wrong path, so basically you can complete magic tower 2-3 times depending on how many achievements you are trying to go for.\n\nThe bosses are pretty meh except for some bosses in magic tower. The only noteworthy bosses is the last boss for hard/impossible mode, and there are several nice bosses on magic tower mode, though as the creator as also mentioned, can get a bit unfair with the RNG attacks. Usually I don't rly have an issue with \"RNG\" attacks, but legitimately in this game that can be an issue with some bosses late game in magic tower.  It just forces you to try a few times but nothing too crazy\n\nOverall, nice platforming game for the cost.","timestamp_created":1606456618,"timestamp_updated":1606456618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwdWRhPYCfdedswI="}
