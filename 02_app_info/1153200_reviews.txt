Wormskull is actually a prequel to Ashes of the Night, and while it's nice to have that familiarity with the story and characters, in no way do you need to play AotN in order to play Wormskull. \n\nThe battle mechanics are sound, and with 14 different playable characters (4 at a time), there are a lot of different classes/attributes to satisfy anyone.  Tons of crafting, mining, fishing to do, which is actually pretty important (and I didn't realize that until a little too late).  By far the best parts of this game are the story and the individual characters, which are very engaging, interesting, and entertaining. It took me 40 hrs to finish, and unfortunately I couldn't beat the final secret boss, b/c I would've had to level up an awful lot first.\n\n The only con for me, I would say, is that I felt like there was a fair amount of grinding necessary, whether just not to get killed, or to get whatever materials you needed etc. Also, I didn't realize that you can't backtrack, so for example, when a NPC wanted an item, I thought \"Oh, I'll bring it back once I'm at a level where I'll have that.\" Nope. Once you move ahead, there's revisiting towns. \n\nOverall, I think this is a great turn based RPG, just like the classics we all love. Definitely recommend it!","timestamp_created":1608592355,"timestamp_updated":1608594981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iPDuw/YCdreGvAI="}
