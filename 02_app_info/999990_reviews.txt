And visually never changes at all really.\nThere is no way to exit the game outside of alt f4\nThere is a \"bug\" with the challenge mode where if you last played story mode in \"perfect\" mode and then switch to challenge mode, you will still only have 1 life.\nAnd the final stage almost made me refund the game out of rage.","timestamp_created":1594575890,"timestamp_updated":1595699739,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l7fHw/MCccvtlAI="}
