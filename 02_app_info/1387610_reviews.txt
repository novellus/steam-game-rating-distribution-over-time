The game resets the resolution when you go to certain areas of the game, the UI is way too big almost like it was made for mobile, the mouse feels like it has a slight input delay/lag, the volume sliders don't scale across the slider properly, some things in the game completely ignore whatever you set the volume slider to and i experienced all of these issues from playing the first 6 levels. The first 6 levels have the same music as the main music which makes the game quite annoying to listen to especially when the game is quite slow and some sound effects are just not nice to listen to. All of this wouldn't matter if the game was in early access with the promise of future updates but this game has come out as a full release and therefore I must see this game as complete and one the developer was happy with. Cowboys n' Stuff seems like it'll give a lot of the  same things with the later levels since levels are defined by the colour of the background and some new enemy's which undoubtedly will get repetitive quick. A few tweaks to the game play like making it faster, some variety in objectives, some polish to the UI and some new music could make this game genuinely enjoyable but right now it's just not worth it, wait for updates and it could be a cool little game.\n---EDIT---\nSo I returned to this game after the christmas update and have had not much of a better experience, the new christmas levels were fun but glitches still run rampant. The volume sliders still dont work, the game forces me into windowed after changing menus and theres only 1 resolution at 50hz (my monitor is 75hz). As i said back in the original part of my review this game would've much suited being a early access review since this is the developers first ever game, fixing glitches and adjusting gameplay is probably hard without the experience. As an early access game these issues would be a lot more forgivable than it is now since the game is released as finished. Once again, not recommended in its current state espicically with the new christmas and halloween content which has been released since my last part of the review.","timestamp_created":1599939689,"timestamp_updated":1609358662,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525547444820404053","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1599996778,"developer_response":"Hello, the SFX issues you were encountering have now been fixed and will be introduced in the next patch.
