Key bindings\n seem almost intentionally terrible, and can't be changed.\n\nI bought it on sale, and you should too, but definite thumbs up.","timestamp_created":1562265070,"timestamp_updated":1562265070,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm6WQ3+sCfc+mzAE="}
