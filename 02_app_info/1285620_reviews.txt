Also levels have nor eal end. At a specific level position without any information or viewable goal the level ends and you get directly spawned to to next level. \nLook the video to see how bad it is.","timestamp_created":1606667582,"timestamp_updated":1606667808,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.58223259449005127","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0KW3ivYCf+uotQI="}
