Most of the dialogue is either generic or downright sloppy. 9 hours in I don't think it's going to turn into anything particularly interesting. I think that someone who is okay with slogging through tons of fights might find this enjoyable. It's a bit too much for me though but I don't play these kinds of games on the regular anyway.\n\nThe difficulty was fairly tough (remember to always buy all the new gear that's available) but I think if I had been using the optimal party composition, it could have made it too easy on the other hand. Instead I was leveling up all the seven party members evenly. There is at least a good deal of variety between their attacks. Also the world is painstakingly populated with what may or may not be stock assets. Like I said I don't play these kinds of games often and I don't exactly know what comes with the program (RPG Maker). It uses several useful plug-ins such as the ability to fast forward in battles but I wouldn't call its UI quite perfectâ€”it's tough to make really good JRPG, as it turns out!\n\nI think there's currently a bug that prevents the shock condition (and another one) from ever ending in fights, and I think that's what keeps stopping various attacks from going off, which is really annoying. Anyway, this could be better... or worse.","timestamp_created":1571338978,"timestamp_updated":1571338978,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrcDG7e0CeL+i1AE="}
