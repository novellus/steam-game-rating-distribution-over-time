    review: 'OK so it''s low budget, and some of it is supposed to re-work the Apartment.  It''s
      supposed to be a Rom-Com because it''s about relationships and there''s a certain
      amount of comedy.  In the end it''s an observation of human character.  Will
      might just as well have been Bill Clinton, and the never seen Sarah might just
      as well have been Hilary.


      This film observes, and gives voice to the words that people don''t usually
      find "in the moment".  It alternates this with some humour.


      Roza Salazar and the script was very close to capturing the train wreck / hot
      mess.

      Adam Pally''s delivery of lines and more were fine so it seems cruel to criticize,
      but I''m not sure he "has it in himself" to be the beta male that the character
      is written as.


      If you "imagine" that the film continues after the ending, Kevin, maybe dumped
      soon after by Madeline, unemployable, with nothing and no-one left to believe
      in, eventually kills himself.  Maybe he finds a new career as a priest.  Perhaps
      you''d prefer to believe they lived happily ever after - but I don''t think
      so.  Madeline, hot mess, maybe drifts into alcoholism and sad middle age, maybe
      kills herself, or maybe loses the spark but finds some kind of equilibrium.


      Will and Peter.... you never can tell.  Bill Clinton or Harvey Weinstein.  Their
      ending is unknown and somewhat  unknowable.  Life  is complicated.  Get over
      it.


      This film is not a Rom-Com, it is a tragedy, - and if not perfect a pretty good
      one at that.'
