    review: It's one of those games where you have to combine three objects into one
      object, and do the same thing over and over and over to upgrade the crypto currency.
      It's very grindy and there's no save feature, so if your game crashes, or if
      something happens, all of that progress you made is gone. It's a game, for sure,
      but it's not worth your time and money.
