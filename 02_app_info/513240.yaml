    review: Now I gotta say... this game must be the DANKEST game I've ever played!  I
      mean, it's downright DANK AF!  If you like to fly, then F**K yeah you gonna
      wanna play this game!  The maps?  Sick.  The wings?  Sick.  The races?  Sick.  The
      concept?  Sick.  The graphics?  Sick.  THERE IS NO BETTER GAME OUT THERE!  This
      game is SO F**K'N DANK I had to buy a towel for it.  Seriously, it's a F**K'N
      STEAL at this price!  I'd pay $420 dollas for this game!  F**K!  It just doesn't
      get DANKER THAN THIS.  Buy this game, it's so dank.  Don't buy this game if
      you hate yourself and want to self-deprive out of some sick form of masochism.  I
      give this game, TEN OUTTA TEN.  So dank.
