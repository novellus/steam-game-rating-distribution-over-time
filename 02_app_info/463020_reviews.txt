Kinetic, takes ~2hrs with a somewhat slow reading speed.\n\nStory -- some elements surprising to me, otherwise predictable\n\nCharacters -- I felt like this was ruined a bit by the deuteragonist being tsundere, with only an offhand justification. Maybe some inconsistence for plot convenience too?\n\nVisual & sound -- Fair enough. I liked hair shading, which many anime-style pieces omit. More even distribution of CGs would be more interesting maybe?\n\n68/100, eh","timestamp_created":1487804455,"timestamp_updated":1492804610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491344064474105835","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/dSFydsCfMTtcg=="}
