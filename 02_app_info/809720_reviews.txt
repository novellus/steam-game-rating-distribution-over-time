The additional content/Campaign is laughable small.\n\nPlaying outside of the Campaign is severely unbalanced and no fun at all. \n\nWithout a few updates I wouldn recommend it at this point.","timestamp_created":1610036673,"timestamp_updated":1610036673,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nr/q7vYCceOnwQI="}
