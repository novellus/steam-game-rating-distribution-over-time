    review: "This is a cool little airplane. Straight up stick and rudder. No A/P\
      \ but easily trimmed to maintain stable flight in good weather. There\u2019\
      s not much to this plane, and it\u2019s very simple. That makes for for nice\
      \ VFR flying, especially sightseeing. Great plane, and such a classic."
