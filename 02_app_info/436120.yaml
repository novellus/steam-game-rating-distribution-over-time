    short_description: Mare Nostrum introduces new systems connected to naval warfare
      and control of trade. The power of your fleets will depend on the number of
      sailors your nation can gather, and your ships can now be given missions and
      areas to patrol. There are also new options for creating trade leagues, and
      a host of other improvements.

    review: "These features should be in a patch not a full priced DLC:\n-Barbary\
      \ nations raiding is yet another annoying popup, but overall doesn't do much.\
      \  \n-naval missions, allowing you to avoid some micromanagement.  \n-espionage\
      \ actions that don't really do much.\n-spy network gives +20% siege ability\
      \ and -10% aggressive expansion impact. \n-Your diplomat can make it harder\
      \ for enemies to establish a spy network in your nation. \n-Spend diplomatic\
      \ power to strengthen your mercantilism.\n-Timeline feature that allows players\
      \ to observe how the world has changed throughout the game.\n\nCondottieri:\n\
      -I don't find the AI too effective with these.\n-As a player I find it difficult\
      \ to rent out your armies to to other nations. 1st, you have to find a nation\
      \ at war willing to accept  your army. 2nd, most nations will not be willing\
      \ to pay you. So you'll be renting out a small army or be giving them a large\
      \ one (20 units max) for free. 3rd, you must micromanage your army to linkup\
      \ with the AI army. 4th, if your army isn't effective or takes to long getting\
      \ to the battlefield that nation will break the contract. I believe it also\
      \ hurts relations, but I could be wrong about this. \n-The whole process is\
      \ just too much micromanagement and I can't be bothered with it.    \n\nTrade\
      \ Leagues:\n-Haven't tried yet and again the AI doesn't seem too effective with\
      \ them. \n\nOverall:\n-I guess it gives you a few more ways to wage war, but\
      \ all the micromanaging you have to do just isn't worth it."
