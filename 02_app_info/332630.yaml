    review: 'So, this is yet another gloomy indie game about psychological disorders.

      There''s little to say about this one. In its own genre it''s probably OK. The
      visuals are stylish and the sound design is quite awesome.

      But the story doesn''t really catch your attention. The monologues and occasional
      dialogues are quite unnatural. And the gameplay part just plainly sucks. You
      walk slowly, you need to backtrack the levels all the time, it''s surprisingly
      hard to find a proper spot to start climbing a ladder. So, all in all, as a
      game this thing kind of fails.

      Some people will like it, I''m sure. But personally I''m not a fan.'
