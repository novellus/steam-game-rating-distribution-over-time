    review: "Damn. What a shame. I was actually enjoying this series.\n\n   For the\
      \ first handful of Chapters, this was an adventure comparable in quality to\
      \ its predecessor, Trial of the Demon Hunter. Sure, there were some flaws: the\
      \ music felt a little lazier this time 'round (as if some of the weaker tracks\
      \ had been saved for a game other than the first); there were definitely more\
      \ typos than previously; and at least one minor plot-hole reared its ugly head\
      \ (in which I gained a \"Ring of Owls\" - which gave me a brief yet enigmatic\
      \ experience - then seemingly lost said Ring of Owls when I attained a Ring\
      \ of Lions...which proceeded to give me the EXACT SAME enigmatic experience)!\
      \ \n\n   There's also a totally gratuitous attempt to get some romance happenin'\
      \ in one or two parts, but in all fairness I suspect that's more of a Choice\
      \ of Games thing than the author's personal preference (one can only hope).\n\
      \n   So far, so forgivable. Then I reached what I assumed was the climax, or\
      \ darned near enough...and it was all downhill from there.\n\n   First major\
      \ problem: the save system, which kicks in when you die. Not only is it pointless\
      \ in an interactive novel to keep going back a good many passages - I just made\
      \ the same choices, over and over, with the same consequences - but I also ended\
      \ up completely restarting my game by accident three times, thanks to the default\
      \ choice on the load screen being \"Restart Completely\"! The first two times\
      \ I swallowed it, and did my best to spam my way back to where I'd left off.\
      \ The third time I threw in the towel. Not happy, Jan.\n\n   Second major problem:\
      \ there's a riddle asked by an Ogre, and I'm not sure if it's some strange RNG\
      \ thing, or failing that an incremental mechanic...but the same response will\
      \ sometimes get you killed and other times allow you to progress. Suffice it\
      \ to say, it was my frustration with this part of the game that led to two of\
      \ the aforementioned accidental restarts. Enough's enough, really.\n\n   For\
      \ now, at least, I'm going to classify this game as \"broken\". My tolerance\
      \ for imperfections is fairly high, but an almost complete lack of game-testing\
      \ is simply not acceptable, especially for a product asking cold, hard cash.\
      \ Here's hoping the developer addresses these issues in the future, as I did\
      \ think there was some potential here.\n\n   Verdict: 4.5/10.\n\n(PS If you\
      \ enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\n\

      Cheers!)"
