He no longer could carry 2 person at the same time like in the previous game Desperados Wanted Dead or Alive.\n- Developers really hate Kate O'Hara. They give Kate the weakest gun in this game.\n- Using the same shooting mechanics in both mode (isometric and third person view). \nThe reason why it's bad because in the third person view where you can aim your shot, there's no difference between shooting the head and the body. \nAnd in the easiest difficulty, Kate O'Hara still needs 2 headshots to kill an enemy with her gun o_O\n- When highlight the enemies, we can't see enemies behind a wall or inside the house.\n- John Cooper's running like a sexy girl.\n- Doc McCoy likes to growling like a dog.","timestamp_created":1610025543,"timestamp_updated":1610025543,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41YTA7vYCeMqiwQI="}
