It's fun, interesting, touching, and smart. \n\nWhile it could have used more polish and development time, I think the creator spent the resources they had really well. The story explored its core themes enough to really hit the mark emotionally, and there's just enough combat to show off the promise of the clever combat system. I'd love to live in a world where games like this were more successful.","timestamp_created":1596435720,"timestamp_updated":1596435720,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9Py+2fMCdf2MmQI="}
