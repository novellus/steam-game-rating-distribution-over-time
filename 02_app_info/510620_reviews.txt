Since I have yet to try the coop with someone, I cannot say how the coop is.  This may also be a game that can motivate Unity users to make more creative projects within a familiar genre.\n\nDisliked: Probably the levels with the dotted lines. Though I understood afterwards and adapted (plus with the extra speed noticed with tinkering with how my character moves with and without shooting), it briefly reminded me of some asymetric gameplay where I lost some of the fun (and ya....lost most of the time). Maybe change the dotted line to a similar color of the enemies when one is fully shot (the black with stars void) to signify that the player can't go in but the enemies can.\n\nThank you for THOTH. Refreshing game. Recommending game.","timestamp_created":1609477997,"timestamp_updated":1609477997,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nKiX3vYCdPqmvwI="}
