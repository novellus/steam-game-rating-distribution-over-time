She enjoys unlocking new witches the most.\n\nEnabling multiplayer took us a while to figure out. You have to select X/A on a controller before doing so on the keyboard. After that we were both able to play together.\n\nPlay consists of seeing what items are needed to brew the next potion and finding them hidden among different containers on the screen. For a given game, the items remain in a consistent spot so it becomes a memory game. The most important element of the game is cooperation; there are no individual scores so players are working together to brew each potion with appropriate items in the correct order. \n\nIt is a race against the clock but sufficient time for a 6yr old to enjoy the session without feeling frustrated.","timestamp_created":1606485144,"timestamp_updated":1606485144,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnL7+hPYCeb/JswI="}
