Bat/ball physics are good. Works ok with HMDâ€™s with inside-out tracking, but would be easier with lighthouse tracking. Only downside is the graphics and animations look like from a 5-10 year old mobile game.\n\nEDIT: I won't change my old review... but go play iB Cricket instead, it is miles better than this in all aspects.","timestamp_created":1593361630,"timestamp_updated":1603037668,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqrSfnvUCcN+JkQI="}
