    review: 'Well I am glad I was patient, the tutorial was not very fun and it was
      long.  I almost quit the game for good and was going to give it a thumbs down,
      but I decided to keep going to see if it got better and it sure did.  I have
      to admit that the contols are a little strange and take some time getting use
      to, but it is turning out to be a fun and addictive game.  I have been waiting
      for a good pirate game for a very long time and never found one meeting my expectation
      yet, but this is not a bad overall concept.  The game has crashed on me once
      so far, which is always disappointing.  I will update this review after I have
      completed this game.  UPDATE:  I am still giving the game a thumbs up overall,
      as I did have some fun, but I am not going to complete the game as the sea battles
      get a little boring & I just don''t like the controls.  Overall the game concept
      was not bad but a thumb down on most of the battle mechanics.'
