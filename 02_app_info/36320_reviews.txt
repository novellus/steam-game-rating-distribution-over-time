He had a sense of humour and I bugged him about tableture for one of the songs on the game. I said that I actually liked the sounndtrack but that the game was a bit... yea. He agreed.\n\nThis game is rubbish. I played it as long as I could but in the end the only positive about it is that they included music that the  devs didn't produce.","timestamp_created":1577340433,"timestamp_updated":1577340433,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pp60oO8CcMWJ5wE="}
