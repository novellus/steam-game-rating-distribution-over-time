It plays fast, shooting is easy(if maybe a bit mindless), ball saves are handed out like candy, and the nudge is juiced to make the ball go where you want without trying. There are bosses and occasional bonus modes to break things up, but for the most part you are challenged by semi-random moving targets. Definitely not a sim game, but a great example of what pin physics can do if the rules are bent.","timestamp_created":1595751575,"timestamp_updated":1595751575,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43ZWNxfMCdvnOlwI="}
