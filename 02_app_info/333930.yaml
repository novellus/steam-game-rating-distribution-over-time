    detailed_description: "<h1>Update Notes</h1><p>Welcome to another Dirty Bomb update.\
      \ In this one we're making a number of big changes and it's time for another\
      \ make-over for Proxy.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FRAGMENT CASE UPDATE</h2><br>Long\
      \ story short, Fragment Cases will no longer drop after you complete matches.<br><br>Short\
      \ story long, we know that many of you find the Fragment cases a little underwhelming\
      \ when you earn them and they're added to your inventory, so we thought of a\
      \ better way for you to earn Fragments in a bit of a more interesting way (Read\
      \ the next section to find out what)<br><br>Psst. If you have any Fragment Cases\
      \ in your inventory, don't worry! Those won't be going anywhere, so you can\
      \ save them for the memories or open them at your leisure.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >INCREASED LOADOUT CASE DROP RATES</h2><br>Enter the replacement for Fragment\
      \ Cases! We've more than DOUBLED the drop rate of Loadout Cases at the end of\
      \ matches so your Loadout Card earn rate will increase significantly. But how\
      \ does this give you more Fragments? Well, if you decide to Recycle the cards\
      \ you get from these cases you'll be earning a little more Fragments on average\
      \ over time than you were before.<br><br>With this update we've also added your\
      \ Fragment balance to the front-end menu so you always know how many you have.\
      \ This should also help new and existing players get to know the Crafting system\
      \ a bit more, making it easier to interact with and giving it more visibility.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">OBSIDIAN OPERATIVE PROXY</h2><br>Skydaddy brought home the\
      \ bacon in the last update with his epic Obsidian overhaul, but now it's Proxy's\
      \ turn to bring home a bigger piece of bacon (and hopefully a better metaphor).<br><br>When\
      \ trying to describe this Obsidian it's difficult to not use words like &quot;f*****g\
      \ awesome&quot;, &quot;holy s**t&quot; and &quot;very nice&quot;. But don't\
      \ take it from me, check it out in game!<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/333930/extras/Proxy-OBOPs-Social_800x450.jpg?t=1591272761\"\

    review: 'Hi This is my review on Dirty bomb!


      This game is nice.. Ive recently found out how to play with the configuration
      files of the game and now im sorta better! 60-70 avg frames min frames: 40 max
      frames: 200


      Gameplay is good quick and responsive!


      Ive bearly seen any cheaters!


      the only thing that i sorta dont like.. is that the characters need grinding..
      not too much grinding. but enough to make your mom say ima beat your ass because
      you said you said 10 min ago 1 sec to your mom when she asked u to come to eat..
      (you said it 5000 times before that)


      otherwize good game !


      i recomend it!'
