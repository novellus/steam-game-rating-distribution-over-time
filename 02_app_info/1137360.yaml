    review: This is an extremely challenging platformer. Every gameplay element dev
      has designed is developed to offer the player the hardest challenges possible.
      Jumping, grabbing a coin, changing gravity - they all demand you to act in a
      very short reaction time and ridiculously precisely manner. It has 50 levels,
      and I only made it to level 32 and that was my limit there. If you enjoy games
      like Jump King I'm sure you will like this game too. It is a short game but
      it has a fair price. Reward you get for beating each level is one achievement
      and one famous quote.
