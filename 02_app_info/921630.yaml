    review: "campaign forces you to play certain modes (like 8-key mode) to unlock\
      \ cool new songs, which is really annoying. Besides that, maybe it lacks some\
      \ more variety in difficulty. \n\nAside from those, the game is fucking amazing,\
      \ cool tracks, some options to customise, it's fun. one of the most fun rhythm\
      \ games I've played, it just lacks some more freedom in the way you interact\
      \ with content in some ways."
