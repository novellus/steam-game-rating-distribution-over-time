      a member of a bold party of adventurers, you and your associates have trekked
      far into what seems to be a whole underworld of subterranean tunnels -- arteries
      connecting endless caves and caverns which honeycomb the foundations of the
      lands beneath the sun. Your expedition has dogged the heels of the Dark Elves
      who caused great woe and then fled underground.</i><br>This adventure provides
      a complete setting for play using the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules.
      Contained herein is background information, a large-scale referee''s map with
      a matching partial map for players, referee''s notes, special exploration and
      encounter pieces, a hex map detailing an enormous cavern area, a special temple
      map, encounter and map matrix keys, and additional sections pertaining to unique
      new creatures for use with this module and with the game as a whole.<br>This
      module can be played alone, as the conclusion to module D1 &amp; D2: &quot;Descent
      into the Depths of the Earth,&quot; or as the third module in a series that
      forms a special extended adventure (G1-G3: &quot;Against the Giants&quot;; D1-D2:
      &quot;Descent into the Depths&quot;; and Q1: &quot;Queen of the Demonweb Pits&quot;).<br>For
      characters levels 10 to 14.<br><strong> Product History</strong><br>D3: &quot;Vault
      of the Drow&quot; (1978), by Gary Gygax, was the sixth adventure released by
      TSR. Like its two predecessors in the D-series, it was originally published
      with a monochrome cover (purple). It was later revamped with a full-color cover
      in a second edition (1981) at the same time that TSR released the collected
      G1-2-3: &quot;Against the Giants&quot; (1981) and D1-2: &quot;Descent into the
      Depths of the Earth&quot; (1981).<br><strong> <i>Another Tournament Release.</i>
      </strong> &quot;Vault of the Drow&quot; shares much of its heritage with the
      two other adventures in the Descent (D-)series, D1: &quot;Descent into the Depths
      of the Earth&quot; (1978) and D2: &quot;Shrine of the Kuo-Toa.&quot; Like D2,
      it was first run as a tournament for GenCon XI (1978). The tournament actually
      resulted in TPKs for everyone but the winning team, due to &quot;a horrible
      encounter with a demon.&quot; Like both of the other D-series adventures, &quot;Vault&quot;
      was released at GenCon XI immediately following the tournament.<br><strong>
      <i>New Settings.</i> </strong> The GDQ adventures generally did a great job
      of introducing historically new settings for D&amp;D adventures. Besides being
      set in the Underdark, D3 also presents the idea of a monstrous city; in fact,
      in many ways, the module is actually more of a city description than an adventure.
      It''s the sort of thing you might find in Judges Guild''s <i>City State of the
      Invincible Overlord</i> (1976+), but which otherwise wasn''t really a part of
      the roleplaying field in 1978.<br><strong> <i>New Monsters.</i> </strong> The
      drow have been making appearances since G3: &quot;Hall of the Fire Giant King&quot;
      (1978), but they get their full detailing here, including a description of one
      of their cities and details on their competing noble families. It also reveals
      how the worship of the Elder Elemental God may be threatening the drows'' matriarchal
      goddess, Lolth.<br>During his lifetime, Gygax offered a few different sources
      for his drow. Ultimately, they''re probably derived from the Svart?lfaheimr
      -- the dark elves of Norse mythology. Ironically, when the drow were printed
      up in the <i>Fiend Folio</i> (1980), that book also contained the &quot;xvart,&quot;
      which had been called the &quot;svart&quot; when published in <i>White Dwarf
      #9</i> (October/November 1978) and which were thus another Svart?lfaheimr derivative.<br><strong>
      <i>The Adventure Continues.</i> </strong> Fans would have to wait two full years
      for the conclusion of the GDQ series in Q1: &quot;Queen of the Demonweb Pits&quot;
      (1980).<br><strong> <i>Future History.</i> </strong> TSR rereleased the entire
      GDQ sequence a few years later in <i>GDQ1-7: Queen of the Spiders</i> (1987),
      a 128-page supermodule. The drow were also revisited in the <i>Chainmail Miniatures
      Game</i> (2001). Thanks to story work by Chris Pramas, the drow of the new game''s
      setting - which was in western Greyhawk - had connections to those herein. The
      idea of drow cities has of course been revisited in the Forgotten Realms, most
      memorably in the second edition boxed set, <i>Menzoberranzan</i> (1992) and
      the final (?) 4e book, <i>Menzoberranzan: City of Intrigue</i> (2012).<br><strong>
      <i>About the Creators.</i> </strong> Like the other &quot;Descent&quot; adventures,
      this last was written while Gygax was working on AD&amp;D as a bit of relaxation
      after completing the <i>Player''s Handbook</i> (1978).<br> <i>Adapted for Fantasy
      Grounds by:</i> <strong>Terry Buckingham</strong> <br> <br><strong>Requires:</strong>

      license and a one time purchase of the D&amp;D Classics - AD&amp;D 1E/2E ruleset.
