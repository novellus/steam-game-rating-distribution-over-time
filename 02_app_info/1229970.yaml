    review: "[b]DLC verdict: Get it on sale[/b]\n\n[b]Comment:[/b]\nThis soundtrack\
      \ contains the listed 20 songs in both mp3 and wav file quality. I really liked\
      \ the Rogue Legacy songs and their 8-bit vibe. Basically, if you were fond of\
      \ how the game sounds and/or like the sound of old-school platformers then this\
      \ is a DLC for you. Not a bad deal full price but definitely a must-have on\
      \ sale if you enjoy this type of music. \n\n[b]P.S.:[/b] Soundtrack can be found\
      \ in \"..\\Steam\\steamapps\\music\\Rogue Legacy Soundtrack\". This DLC does\
      \ not appear on the store page of the game, only [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229970/Rogue_Legacy_Soundtrack/]HERE[/url].\
      \ It also does NOT download when you install the game. You need to Download\
      \ Album in the Soundtracks section of the library filter.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
      [b]If you liked this DLC review you can find more in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review\
