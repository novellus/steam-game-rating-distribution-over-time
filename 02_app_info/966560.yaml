    review: The controls are clunky at best, but best described as God awful. The
      game is one big tedious room after another looking for trinkets that don't progress
      the story at all. Eventually, I stopped caring at all about finding any of the
      loot and just tried to finish the story as fast as possible. I would not recommend
      this game at all it pretty much sucks.
