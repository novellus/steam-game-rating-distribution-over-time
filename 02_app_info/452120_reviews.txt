If you are into scandinavian folklore and music you are going to love this! The downside of the game, except for being insanely short and extremely easy, is the voice acting (Sorry!). Almost made me wish the dialogue was read-only.\n____________________________________\n\nPlay this game if:\n- You love scandinavian folklore\n- You love traditional scandinavian folk music, I loooved it!\n- You are a busy bee and need something easy and quick to play\n\nDo Not play this game if:\n- You are looking for a challenge\n- You want games with depper story and more content\n\n\nVerdict: 7/10 (due to shortness and voice acting I cannot give it more)","timestamp_created":1600791698,"timestamp_updated":1600791698,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpdun2/QCetWxowI="}
