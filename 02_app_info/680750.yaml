    review: 'TL;DR: buyer beware, it''s unfinished, abandoned, apparently rushed and
      posing for something it is not in large parts. But if you like puzzlers take
      it for granted there''s aplenty and I am not judging its quality in that regard
      as I am not into that sort of pastime.


      This game reminds me of "Elea" that I finished some months ago and that is the
      first and foremost difference: I managed to finish "Elea" despite its convoluted
      nature and unfinished state unlikely to be ever  completed whereas I almost
      rage quit that one. "Almost" meaning I did quit, but with a sigh of relief rather
      than anything else in the end.


      After a brief close encounter with a dev I tried to approach whtat''s left of
      the game with an open mind, but in the end I had neither  patience to carry
      on nor was interested to see what next trick does this puzzler have to throw
      at me to knock me off-balance. Since it is a puzzler with a very shallow and
      absurd story behind posing as science-fiction whereas any scientific knowledge
      we happen to have now - without referring to future possibilities - renders
      the story basis as purely nonsensical fantasy and not a sci-fi. That was the
      first factor that put me off quite strongly, the rest just followed. Let''s
      remember what S. King wrote in "Danse Macabre" - let me paraphrase that: to
      have good fiction there must be something allowing us to suspend disbelief.  Poor
      writing here only did strengthen that in me and now I believe that lack of good
      script for a credible story is one of a few major problems here - like, for
      instance, that horrible fetch quest with nine pieces of scrap, just to name
      another. What fun is to be had in that?


      This is "The Anatomy of a Disaster part II", but I loved "The Fall of Lazarus",
      mind you, and really disliked this one from the get-go when I only read those
      ridiculos premises for the story.'
