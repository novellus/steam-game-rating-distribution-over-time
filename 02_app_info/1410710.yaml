    about_the_game: Democracy 4 lets you take the role of President / Prime minister,
      govern the country (choosing its policies, laws and other actions), and both
      transform the country as you see fit, while trying to retain enough popularity
      to get re-elected...<br><br>Built on a custom-built neural network designed
      to model the opinions, beliefs, thoughts and biases of thousands of virtual
      citizens, Democracy 4 is the state-of-the-art in political simulation games.
      A whole new vector-graphics engine gives the game a more adaptable, cleaner
      user interface, and the fourth in the series builds on the past while adding
      a host of new features such as media reports, coalition governments, emergency
      powers, three-party systems and a more sophisticated simulation that handles
      inflation, corruption and modern policy ideas such as quantitative easing, helicopter
      money, universal basic income and policies to cover current political topics
      such as police body cameras, transgender rights and tons more.<br><br>Democracy
      4 is the ultimate sandbox for testing out your political ideas. We all think
      our politicians are useless and that we could do a better job ourselves, but
      is that really true? With one eye on the budget, one-eye on the polls, and somehow
      finding time to watch out for terrorist attacks at the same time, you will find
      that staying in power while changing society for the better is a tougher job
      than you ever imagined.<br><br>Would it really be a good idea to legalize all
      drugs? to give the police machineguns? to ban abortion? to invest heavily in
      green energy? would UBI really work? can you stay elected after cutting pensions
      in half to pay for your science budget? There is only one game that lets you
      find out!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1410710/extras/character_heads.png?t=1609327440"
      /><br><br>The intention in designing this game is to have no implied bias whatsoever
      (tricky, but we try!) so this is NOT a game that is going to lecture you about
      politics, or tell you that your beliefs are wrong. This is a strategy game,
      not a political protest :D. If you want to turn your country into ayn rand's
      fantasy, abolish all public spending and all taxes, you can do that. it might
      work, it might not! depending on how you handle it. On the other hand if you
      want to nationalise the railways, the energy companies, the water companies,
      cap CEO pay, ban second-home ownership and put universal income in place, you
      can do that too. All the game tries to do is model the *likely* effects, short
      and long term of any action you take.<br><br>Because modders have so enthusiastically
      supported earlier games in the series, we are doing our bet to make Democracy
      4 as mod-friendly as possible too, and steam workshop support will make choosing
      and installing mods easy. Ultimately all our data is in text files that you
      can edit yourself, so if you think our analysis of the link between car tax
      and car usage is wrong (for example), its trivial to edit it, and share your
      changes with other players.<br><br>Ultimately Democracy 4 is not a game about
      simply winning an election, but about running the country. Losing an election
      is just  the end-game (unless you get assassinated), the real challenge to the
      game is whether or not you can create a country you are honestly proud of. I
      hope you enjoy trying :D

    review: The game seems very good. However,  it is very difficult to increase conservative
      membership and happiness without harming your country extensively. A couple
      more policies should be added in that increase conservative membership. Another
      thing is that when i tried to play a conservative Canada play-through, there
      were no cabinet officials that were sympathetic to conservatives and the majority
      were for liberals. This ended up killing my PP as i was forced to take officials
      that were unsympathetic to my play-through. This has also probably been stated
      before, but imigration needs to be nerfed drastically. It rises too fast and
      doesnt give any warning until the point you realize that you are at 80% unemployment.
      However, other than those small problems, the game is amazing! I love playing
      it and i love the progressive form of increasing and decreasing policies. I
      also love that it shows exactly what "Urgent Events" effects are after you click
      on them. The game has seen much improvements and i cant wait to see what else
      is added further on
