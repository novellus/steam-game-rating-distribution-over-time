    review: 'So here''s the low down on this as I bought it and what not. There''s
      something you should know about it.


      The fake goddesses you need to kill are really high level. I''m not sure how
      high level you gotta be to kill them but it has to be at minimum level 100 or
      even 200?


      That causes an issue. If you are on your first playthrough and not doing a newgame+
      you might want to grab the conquest ending or any of the individual nation share
      endings.


      Well you will need to grind to level 200ish to just to do these quests which
      is something not a lot of people want to do unless it''s in newgame+.


      So if you are on your first playthrough this is probably not helpful. If you
      are in a newgame+ with things unlocked to help you grind, it''s decent enough.'
