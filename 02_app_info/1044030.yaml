      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nNiHonGoToKi will help you learn Japanese the fun way! The\

      \ a fun puzzle game that takes the boring away from studying the tough Japanese\
      \ language. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCurrently, the game contains the entire Hiragana\
      \ and Katakana alphabets as well as the combination of characters, called Y\u014D\
      -on. You\u2019ll be taught both character sets in the Learn Mode, along with\
      \ their Romaji (English character versions) counterpoint and then tested on\
      \ your progress through Test Mode, where you can gain points (and combo points!)\
      \ and become fluent as you have fun.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEverything you do in\
      \ the game is tracked through the database, which learns your strengths and\
      \ weaknesses and tailors the game to you, giving priority to characters you\u2019\
      re having trouble with. The database kicks in after you\u2019ve been through\
      \ both alphabets once. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you score highly in Test Mode,\
      \ you can unlock the special Advanced Mode which strips away the Romaji and\
      \ lets you learn Hiragana and Katakana like a native."
