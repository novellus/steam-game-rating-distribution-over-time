    short_description: An unfortunate Imperial world has been overrun by Chaos Daemons.
      Exterminatus is not yet possible, so selfless sacrifice is needed to keep the
      tide from spiraling out of control. Are you willing to descend amidst the Daemonic
      hordes and call orbital strikes while you are fighting down there - for the
      sake of the Imperium of Man?

    review: "Greetings Again!  Today we\u2019ll be looking at the DLC \u201CMaelstrom\
      \ of Carnage\u201D which retails for $3 currently and brings a single new mission\
      \ type and doesn\u2019t seem to be much else.  So, is it worth the cost?\n\n\
      Sisters of Bombardment:  This DLC seems to only provide one single mission but\
      \ at least is is repeatable.  Well, I say that but I\u2019ve little desire to\
      \ repeat it beyond the few times I\u2019ve done it as of yet.  Simply put you\
      \ wade through hordes of daemons and mutants and every several seconds a bombardment\
      \ is launched centered on you.  This does a lot of damage to the horde and you\
      \ get more points for killing stuff.  After the final bombardment you are teleported\
      \ out and get a final score\u2026that\u2019s it.\n\nSo, worth it?  At full price,\
      \ no.  Even at discount I\u2019d really only grab it for completion sake or\
      \ in a bundle but it really doesn\u2019t seem to provide much else.  Am I missing\
      \ something?  Please let me know.  As always, enjoy!\n"
