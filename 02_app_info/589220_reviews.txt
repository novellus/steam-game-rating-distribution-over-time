But all these problems and criticism go down the drain once you understand that this whole open-world / FPS / adventure / puzzle game with RPG and survival elements, every bit in it (except for voiceovers) was created by a single person, Francis Courchinoux, without any real financial backing. And it's fully playable, as well as interesting and fun. If I understood correctly even the soundtrack was composed and recorded by Francis and his band (he's a very skilled player!). And all of this was all done in just 3 to 4 years! Mind-blowing...\n\nThe game itself revolves around the protagonist (Uayeb) and his adventures collecting Mayan artifacts. You wake up in a post-apocalyptic cryogenic chamber with no memory, but with the help of voice messages left by a friend you slowly begin to make sense of the situation and plan your escape away from the desolate place. The story makes very little sense, to be honest, and the totally cringeworthy voice act doesn't help it either, but if you try to disregard those flaws it becomes somewhat passable. Instead, UAYEB concentrates on raiding tombs left untouched for hundreds of years. They are difficult, full of traps, require decent navigation skills, but they're also a lot of fun to figure out! Just remember to quick-save often. The only thing I never understood was how it was possible for bandits to be already inside when you set foot in a time-forgotten tomb. They must've worked out the same deadly puzzles then? As I said, don't try to make sense of this game too much and simply enjoy the adventure. The whole gameplay may become repetitive around halfway through, so UAYEB is best consumed in smaller bits so as to keep the interest in the game. Or you can just drive around collecting achievements and gazing upon the desert and the city, since the CryEngine-powered visuals are stunning as always.\n\nAt the end of the day I still can't wrap my head around how a single person could manage to deliver a great open-world game. It makes me wonder what a masterpiece it could have been had there been a bigger team helping Francis. But even as is, it's incredible and I recommend UAYEB for everyone to try out, especially aspiring game creators. I've heard Francis is working on episode 2, again in his free time and on his own. It must be difficult but I wish him the best of luck! I'll be sure to buy it once it hits the shelves.","timestamp_created":1593993443,"timestamp_updated":1593993492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525139689445495605","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4s7akPMCd8aSkwI="}
