VR opens up so many more possibilities for immersion and music. There are music driven games out there that can really pull you in, and VR has the capability of taking that and pushing it to the next level.\n\nThis game is okay. It's not the best, I wouldn't say it's next level material but I did get that hyped-up and happy feeling from playing a few of my favourite songs. Your surroundings are bright, colourful and it dances with your music. I found it fun to even stand and look around, let alone bust out some drum moves.\n\nI won't lie to you, I held back a bit seeing as I was banging  imaginary drums like a moron to no music in the family dining area. If I would have been alone I think I would of gone in on this a lot more enthusiastically and gotten my rave on. With that said though I still found this to be a very enjoyable game.\n\nWhen I booted up the game I was a little concerned that I would have to download some music for it to go from or be forced to use some lame sample music that music driven games tend to provide. The fun in these games for me comes from being able to put my own music tastes into the game. I was pleasantly surprised to find that you can actually pick some music from the SoundCloud top 50 (so of course I had to get on that Despacito bandwagon).\n\nThe only thing I thought might make this game better was if hitting the drum actually did something. I mean, it does something, it determines your score and all. I just thought that it would feel a lot better if when you hit it, it actually made a sound. \nIf you loosely compare it to guitar hero, in guitar hero the music will play as long as you're playing it properly. Hitting the notes will continue to play the song and if you miss it you get that horrid noise that breaks the flow and makes you feel like the worst musician ever. Then when you actually hit the notes correctly you feel a lot more accomplished and it gets you more hyped up during the song. \n\nThat was my only fault on it, besides that I enjoyed it and would recommend it for someone that might just want a chill jam on the virtual reality drums.\n\n\nTL;DR : Not the best music driven game ever, it might not take advantage of the new possibilities VR provides, but it's still an all around sound game to jam out on.\n\n[quote][b]Controller support:[/b] Not included (VR only)\n[b]Local music files:[/b] Included\n[b]Online streaming:[/b] Included, SoundCloud browsing[/quote]\n[quote]For more reviews of this genre, check out my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/29402802-The-Best-Music-Driven-Games-%25E2%2599%25AB/] The Best: Music Driven Games â™«[/url]\nWhere we review games able to be driven by your own music.
