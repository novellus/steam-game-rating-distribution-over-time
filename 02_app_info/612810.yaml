    review: "Picture this, your phone is broken so you spend some extra time playing\
      \ Steam games. You scroll through your library looking for a game that's a bit\
      \ more on the easy side since it's getting fairly late at night. After scrolling\
      \ through your library you come across a game that you haven't played in years.\
      \ You remember it being easy, but for some reason you never got all of the achievements\
      \ for it. Deciding to go back to it, you realize why you never finished.\n\n\
      ~~~~~~~~\n\nYes, I know you can [b]no longer purchase this game on Steam[/b]\
      \ however, I still felt the need to review it for some unknown reason.\n\n[b]Spoiler-free[/b]\
      \ review I guess? There really isn't a story to begin with.\n\nHonestly I don't\
      \ know what possessed me to purchase this game in the first place. It's basically\
      \ just a typing game with the [b]illusion of needing to type quickly[/b] to\
      \ get far, however you can go too fast and not get a word prompt which will\
      \ cause your rhythm to falter. Sure, if you aren't able to type fast enough\
      \ for that to happen then it's not really an issue, however I found myself starting\
      \ off fine but as I kept going I would hit this issue more and more frequently.\n\
      \n[b]The graphics of the game look fine.[/b] The game itself looks like it should\
      \ belong to a visual novel rather than a typing game. If that were the case,\
      \ then it might've done better since it would [i]hopefully[/i] have a story,\
      \ or at least [i]something[/i] to keep your attention. I found myself zoning\
      \ out in the small break between stages and then realizing that I am, in fact,\
      \ still playing a game. Even the graphics stop looking that great after you\
      \ see the same monster or teammate 100+ times.\n\nI had [b]deleted my game when\
      \ I stopped playing years ago, so I had to start from level and stage 0.[/b]\
      \ According to Steam, I had played this game for [b]2.7 hours[/b] tonight. In\
      \ that time I had done: [b]3 runs (deaths),[/b] gotten to [b]level 153,[/b]\
      \ and gotten to [b]stage 375.[/b] I only kept playing for so long since my third\
      \ run took ages for me to finally die. [b]I wanted to try until the very end\
      \ despite my fingers hurting.[/b] I thought that it would help me when I [i]unfortunately[/i]\
      \ return to the game tomorrow to finish the achievements. Yes, the achievements\
      \ are the only reason why I have gone back to this game. I simply want to complete\
      \ yet another game, even if I'm in physical pain by it. Am I a masochist? Perhaps.\
      \ [b]Do I regret returning to this game? Definitely.[/b] If I had just chosen\
      \ a different game then I wouldn't feel the need to finish it, hell I probably\
      \ wouldn't have even regarded it. \n\nHonestly this game is just bad all around,\
      \ the only exception being it's art looks fine. [b]If you have this game from\
      \ a previous purchase don't return to it unless you're like me.[/b] It's really\
      \ not worth it. "
