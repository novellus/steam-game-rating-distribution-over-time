But this game will test your patience. The slippery controls will undoubtedly give you the authentic feeling of riding a Back-to-the-Future-style hoverboard with no contact to the ground, which is, however, exactly what I found so frustrating. Buy TrickStyle if you like this kind of challenge and are a glutton for punishment like me.","timestamp_created":1604237826,"timestamp_updated":1604237826,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/dKBwvUCfIjHqwI="}
