    about_the_game: The Lost Cube is a challenging platformer which takes inspiration
      from classic titles such as Super Meat Boy and Celeste.  The story unravels
      in a small village nestled somewhere in northern Europe. Each day, a special
      melody is played upon a magical guitar bringing prosperity upon the land. <br><br>One
      day the magical red cube that holds its power goes missing and it is the quest
      of one brave adventurer to retrieve it and restore life to his village. You
      play as Ulrik, a somewhat ordinary hero on a mission. You have no weapons, so
      you must jump or dodge your way out of trouble. Your agility will be tested
      to the limit as you face a barrage of enemies over 60 levels and 2 boss fights
      all the while constantly avoiding unforgiving traps. <br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1399280/extras/TLC_Creatures_Steam.png?t=1609850515"
      /><br><br><strong>Features</strong><br>The Lost cube will test your patience
      as you navigate 60 handcrafted levels spread through a variety of seasons. Each

      attacks and reclaim your village from its dismal state.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Experience
