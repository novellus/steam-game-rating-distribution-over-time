Clever gameplay mechanic. It's one of those \"one more run\" games where you open it up expecting to spend five minutes but can easily sink half an hour. Deceptively tough. Took me a while to figure out when playing as the starting brontosaurus, if you have to make a split-second choice to move closer to an asteroid hitting in front of you or behind you, always protect your tail, and run toward the one ahead. The one behind will always get you if you're too close!","timestamp_created":1600611190,"timestamp_updated":1600611190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz5D31fQCcPj+ogI="}
