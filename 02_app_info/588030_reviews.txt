There is a station map, but i have not found a map indicating where this actual platform is.\nThe world map is very very unclear to me, zooming in does not reveal more details on destinations. \nThe harbor is such a destination, i often have to walk around for minutes on end to see where i need to be. This costs valuable time which can cost you ingame money.\n\nThe game's stuttering has decreased after latest updates. Graphics are also improving.\nIt is visible that people are working on it and it is positive in my opinion.","timestamp_created":1594474125,"timestamp_updated":1609857354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwkbm+6fYCcK7IlAI="}
