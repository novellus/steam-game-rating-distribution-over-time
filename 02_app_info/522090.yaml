    review: 'Money cow game. Limited times to play levels; you gotta wait till the
      timer runs down or you can buy defense attempts. Just for $99! Towers can be
      upgraded for elixir, which you get by playing levels. Or you can buy elixir!
      Just for $99! Really don''t buy this shit, not even on sale. As a TD game it
      is not even that good and with the ridiculous pricing scheme on top, this is
      a no-brainer: POS. Big time.'
