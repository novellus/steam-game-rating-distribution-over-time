    about_the_game: Finding the perfect look for your game's heroes can be challenging,
      especially when you've got several classes and roles to worry about.<br><br>Created
      by Katakura Hibiki, this character pack is a compilation of matching resources
      for 16 brand new heroes. Inspired by classic JRPG traditions, the characters
      are clothed and styled in costumes that promote their class and party role.
      Though all characters look powerful and worthy of a hero title, a little bit
      of imagination could easily turn them into double-crossing villains. What will
      these heroes inspire you to create?<br><br>This pack contains:<br>Resources
      formatted for use in RPG Maker VX and VX-Ace.<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Male
      and Female version for each of the 8 Jobs/classes (archer, paladin, spell-singer,
      cleric, sage, thief, warrior and wizzard).<br></li><li>16 character sprites
      in RTP style.<br></li><li>40 hero battlers (at least 2 battler versions of each
      character).<br></li><li>11 Facesets with basic expressions (neutral, happy,
      sad, angry, and smiling) for each character.<br></li><li>90 right-facing bust
