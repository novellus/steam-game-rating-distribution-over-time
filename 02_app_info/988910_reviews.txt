I was initially put off by the lack of licensed teams and the cartoonish art style. I went with a custom league, with custom teams, and I've been playing for over 200 hours and loving it. The back end team management is a bit too simple, and in my opinion would benefit by being fleshed out, but the gameplay is very slick, responsive, and rewarding. I don't play online, so I can't comment on that. but if you are a fan of baseball, I think there's something here to enjoy. It's a great game for quick pop ins without a lot of time commitment.","timestamp_created":1610082752,"timestamp_updated":1610082752,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4KKa8PYCevO6wQI="}
