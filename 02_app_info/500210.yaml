    review: "For the people who cannot obtain the gas turbine and the SD60M:\n\nMost\
      \ people know that you can no longer buy both the SD60M and the gas turbine.\
      \ It now comes with the Sherman Hill Route, but if you own it and you did not\
      \ get it, write a ticket to dovetail games at their website and they will help\
      \ you out. They will send you a few codes with the Gas Turbine, the SD60M, an\
      \ army flat car, a box car, and a scenario. For this Add-on, you only need the\
      \ SD60M and the Gas Turbine.\nBesides the needs for this add-on, here is what\
      \ I think about it:\nThe scenarios are great, they have many CPU's which work\
      \ well, no bugs, and etc. If you have all the assets, then I would recommend\
      \ getting it. \n\nIn all, if you have all of the assets and need more scenarios\
      \ to play, I would recommend this scenario pack."
