And reduced quality videos. \n.\nThere is guide for 60FPS and better cutscenes quality in community.\nOverall, aside from the negative point of bad port, the game is really great for:\n- Sailor Moon fanbase: I feel like those heroines are Sailor Moon characters inspired.\n- Persona feeling\n- Nice art\n- Nice curves.\n- Rich story\n- Combat is nice and challenging sometimes.","timestamp_created":1609483117,"timestamp_updated":1609483117,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nOyq3vYCc/qovwI="}
