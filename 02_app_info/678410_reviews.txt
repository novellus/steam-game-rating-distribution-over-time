I liked pretty much everything. I often times found myself thinking out loud \"Hey, this Wanderer looks like Raziel from Legacy of Kain!\" and sometimes I found answers (the lens capturing energy, transforming it into crystals) to the game I love the most, that is True Fear: Forsaken Souls Part 2. (Can't wait for Part 3!) Okay, here is a list of what I've found interesting in Chimera: The Signs of Prophecy.\n\nPROS:\n- Journal entries;\n- Beautiful scenes;\n- Good music;\n- Well-worked voice-overs (especially the Drunkard XD);\n- Fast-travelling map;\n- Interesting HO minigames;\n- Story revolving around super-naturally gifted children and chimeras;\n- Three-set collectibles (The Tarot Cards are interesting);\n- Main Game + Bonus Game + Secret Room (just like Chimera: Cherished Serpent and Haunted Hotel: Room 18).\n\nCONS:\n- No other disadvantage comes to mind.\n\nIf you're looking for a HOPA game with a good story and interesting puzzles, I think you hit the jackpot with this one.","timestamp_created":1609885776,"timestamp_updated":1609885776,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiO+q6vYCca/rwAI="}
