    about_the_game: "Marbleous Blocks is a point &amp; click, physics based, 3D-puzzle\
      \ game where you guide a marble named Max through a set of challenges. Your\
      \ goal is to help Max retrieve the missing energy orbs in order to restore the\
      \ colors of the rainbow.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne key game mechanic is to carefully\
      \ position and rotate 3D-tetrominoes to create paths for Max. However, creating\
      \ those paths requires energy cubes so you need to carefully plan the paths\
      \ so you and Max do not run out of energy. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother key game\
      \ mechanic is that Max may put on different suits and each suit has its own\
      \ set of abilities. In order to pick up some orbs Max will need to switch between\
      \ different suits in a single challenge. So again, planning is key, but you\
      \ can easily explore different strategies since you may rewind your actions.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you are into puzzles that challenges your spatial thinking,\
      \ have a soft spot for retro sound and, not to forget, likes colors and rainbows\
      \ this is the game for you."
