    review: '[i] My Experience [/i]


      Zombo Buster Advance is very much a "what you see is what you get affair." There''s
      very little I could tell you that isn''t already covered sufficiently in the
      game''s trailer. You''re defending multiple floors simultaneously within a zombie-infested
      building. Using "energy" that is slowly accumulated over time, you deploy up
      to three troops per floor in an "elevator" on the left side, and you can swap
      one elevator with another to relocate your sets of three. Although there is
      a cooldown associated with the swap, you''ll be able to switch and send your
      firepower where and when it is needed.


      Each of the troops you can deploy can be upgraded through the application of
      five "badges," that improve things like damage, fire rate, deployment cost,
      etc. Three badges of the same type and level can be combined to create a badge
      of a higher level. I liked this system, although there were a few times when
      you''d merge badges and put yourself in a disadvantageous position - there were
      times when I merged three level eight badges to create a level nine, but then
      the next-highest badge I had would be a level two. You can spread the three
      level eight badges across three characters, whereas this isn''t the case with
      the single level nine badge. One annoyance here is that you need to unequip
      badges to combine them between levels. I''d much rather the game just automatically
      unequip any badges that were used to fuse a higher level one. I spent a lot
      of time equipping and unequipping badges while playing.


      The other gameplay aspects are the gadgets and items. You can equip up to three
      gadgets, and each recharges slowly after use. I stuck with the snap (kills a
      certain % of zombies on screen), the adrenaline shot (makes a set of three zombies
      shoot more quickly for a time), and a spike trap (that damages enemies that
      cross it). Outside of the spike trap, I mostly just used the gadgets during
      final waves or boss fights. Although you''re given a few starter items (one-time-use
      consumables), items are so incredibly expensive that I wouldn''t be surprised
      if you never bought any more. I don''t even think I obtained the medal for using
      10 items, and the game gives you 5 for free. The game also contains an upgrade
      system that you can use to increase your overall health, energy gain, gadget
      recharge, soldier damage, etc. This is well implemented and easy to use.


      I enjoyed my time with the game - I''d often put on music and just watch my
      soldiers go to work. At the beginning of the game I mostly used the rocket launcher
      and SMG soldier, but by the end I was entirely reliant upon the sniper and a
      green, space marine-looking fellow who could remove all armor with a single
      shot. I also liked the creative enemy design, and the way that each set of levels
      introduces a new mechanic to shake things up (escalators, walkways, teleporters,
      healing modules, etc.).'
