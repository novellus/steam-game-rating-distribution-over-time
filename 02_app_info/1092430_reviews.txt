I felt so cool landing a throw from across another building. However, it progressively got worse as the game went on. \n\nI felt like it was going in a new and original direction, with a new environment when you go from a train to rooftops. But pretty soon you are right smack back into offices. Some new things they added like pneumatic tubes and the bow just break quite often. The gate on the tubes can dislocate and become near impossible to open, leaving you exposed when you may need to get back.\n\nThe bow sucks, hard.  It feels like something that was slapped together last minute when they wanted to add another new thing before launch. You cant shoot through vents without the arrow hitting random hitboxes. You cant aim for shit because the devs decided the crosshair should consist of 2 vertical lines. \n\nSPOILERS:\n[spoiler] In the final level you really feel the effects of the shitty bow design. In the level you are facing a horde of robots with shields and heat-seeking grenade launchers. When you have the bow out, it takes up one hand, but to use it you need the grab tool on the other. So you are completely out of movement when you use the bow. When you \"nock\" the grenade, a good portion of the time it will just not allow you to pull the string and you are just stuck with a grenade on a stick. The enemies you face arent exactly the hardest. The tactic I learned while playing was to just teleport right onto them and stab them as they bled out very fast. But when your only weapons are grenades it gets kind of difficult. The level with the map and fuses was just stupid to play in general.[/spoiler]\n\n","timestamp_created":1609864261,"timestamp_updated":1609864261,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42OXY6fYCfMrfwAI="}
