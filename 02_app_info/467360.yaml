    review: 'Off Peak is an amazing experience, exploring the station in all of it''s
      artistic beauty and hearing the in some cases quite relatable concerns and conversations
      that the people in the station have is quite engaging.


      It''s a free experience that you can have in 30 minutes or so, and if you like
      it I would also heavily encourage you to buy and play it''s follow up game "The
      Norwood Suite" as it continues on in the same universe, you''ll not regret it.'
