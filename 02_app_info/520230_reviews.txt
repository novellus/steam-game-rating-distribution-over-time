The two levels and 3D in Vr are a nice dynamic twist on this retro game.\n\nI bought this because I have a lazy eye I am getting treatment for.  I have very limited stereo vision, and I could see this game in VR in 3D.  It feels like it has given my eyes a workout too.  Not sure the game is helpful, but to see in 3d my eyes must be working together and to play the game I am staying focused and following an object.  One of the games I play as part of my treatment with VIvid Vision is a game popping bubbles in VR based on which ones appear closest.  So this game stands a good chance of being beneficial to my treatment.  This definitely adds to my enthusiasm on two fronts.   Stereoscopic 3D is a novelty to me to experience at all ever and 2nd because of the possibility of it helping my effort to gain stereoscopic vision.\n\n","timestamp_created":1572322820,"timestamp_updated":1572322820,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw+sfviu4Cfv2Q1QE="}
