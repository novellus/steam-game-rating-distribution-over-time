These can be heavy and upsetting topics, but the game is never unkind, it doesn't revel in oppression like a lot of other games that try to approach the same topic. Most of the people living in this world aren't overtly bigoted, they aren't trying to hurt other people, they just make mistakes. This seems to be the main problem for a lot of readers who didn't enjoy the game, they want to play as the overt bigot, but that is not what the game is about.\n\nThe world building is another strong point, it's an interesting and honestly horrifying setting, and another example of how careful the writing can be.\n\nThe stat system, however, can feel kind of finicky at times, but I do appreciate some of the ideas behind it. Alot of the options that require you to have a certain number are usually pretty lenient, but even with that it can be hard to go for what you want. Maybe that's a more a reflection of my personal choices in game however.\n\nSpeaking personally most depictions of trans people in games only manages to remind me of the general background anxiety that is almost always there, but this game actually felt very reassuring. I think that's worth celebrating on it's own, even if you don't believe that this is particularly special writing otherwise.\n\nClosing thoughts: The game is very sweet. It does what it tries to do well, and if that's a serious problem for you, it's not the fault of the author.","timestamp_created":1605706264,"timestamp_updated":1605706264,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3KXj7fUCfoCPrwI="}
