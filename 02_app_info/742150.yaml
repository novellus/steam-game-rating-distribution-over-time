    review: "I really enjoyed the characters; though few, they all had a lot of backstory\
      \ and character development and it was a delight getting to know them (especially\
      \ Loren!). I also quite liked the diversity of it all, and unlike other CoG\
      \ games where your choice of sexuality/gender identity is more cosmetic, it\
      \ is actually explored a little bit in the story.\n\nHowever, the plot itself\
      \ was very confusing. I got the achievement where your character apparently\
      \ has \"learned all the secrets of the house\" but I could not tell you what\
      \ was going on at all, and the ending left me scratching my head. The choices\
      \ along the way seemed to be pretty important, though, so maybe it was just\
      \ the path I chose, and all the weird stuff going on with the house and the\
      \ antagonists is explained in another branch. \n\nIt certainly seems like it\
      \ has a lot of replay value, though I wish CoG made it easier to explore other\
      \ choices by allowing you to save and reload. But that's more of a general issue\
      \ than one particular to this game."
