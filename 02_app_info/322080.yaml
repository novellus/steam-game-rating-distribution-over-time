    short_description: 'A psychological 2D puzzle platformer. You must switch between
      two versions of the past: dark &amp; light, positive &amp; negative, hope &amp;
      despair. Every action is innately tied to this dualistic battle. Traverse a
      surreal landscape of memory to try and mend a fragile mind.'

    review: A serious / sad theme paired with puzzle platforming. Controls are fine,
      mechanics are good. I didn't like the combination of the theme and the platforming,
      but it's made well enough if you like that part of it.
