Score 10/10.  !!\n\n","timestamp_created":1604080978,"timestamp_updated":1604080978,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540069699287414551","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhamrvfUCed+OqwI="}
