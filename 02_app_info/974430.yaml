    review: 'I really like this game and I enjoy the concept of the game. Though i
      was very reserved with my money in the game you really gotta play around your
      money and how you handle questions. The graphics are not the greatest, but I
      guess that is not what is expected from such a game. The colors match well with
      the the theme and the sound effects are great. I know I will be playing more
      of this game, even though I will become last in this political race! A+
