The only thing that I might change is that you have to restart the whole story if you want to chose something else (Its isn't very convenient when you chose something you didn't want by mistake hahah). There is also no way to reread the previous pages. Also, it would be awesome if you put some other languages too, like spanish. Anyways, It's a beautiful game that I really recommend. I'll look forward to the second book! \nEs un excelente juego, con una muy buena toma de decisiones que hace que te adueñes de su historia. Lo único que quizás cambiaría seria que una vez lo juegas y decides algo, tienes que reiniciar la historia completa para decidir otra cosa, no se puede volver pagina atrás para releer lo que elegiste. Esperare con ansias el segundo libro!","timestamp_created":1584296170,"timestamp_updated":1606689356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjr+Ji/YCcdqs+AE="}
