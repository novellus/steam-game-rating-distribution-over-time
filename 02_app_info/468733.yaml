    review: 'This mod is alright. The biggest issue we ran in to was the money would
      fall through the table, so we ended up spawning counters for every player to
      keep track of their money. We also ran into some frustrations with the vine
      cards snapping into place onto of each other when placed on the field cards;
      you can avoid this by turning off ''sticky'' for all the cards before they''re
      placed onto the field.


      Otherwise, this was a solid mod. It includes expansions and rulebooks for everything,
      plus there is some decent scripting for the setup. I would recommend if you
      like worker placement games with a moderate level of complexity.'
