    review: "SPOILERS AHEAD!\n\nI don't think I have ever played a turn-based rogue-like\
      \ quite like this one.\n\nThe Door in the Woods is one of the most thought provoking\
      \ games I have ever played. In a nutshell, the game is about the end of the\
      \ world. Multiple extinction level events have taken place, including the raising\
      \ of the dead, an alien invasion, and the awakening of an Eldritch God.\n\n\
      The Door in the Woods is a nihilistic reminder of the inevitability of death.\
      \ The earth is left in pieces, and there is no hope for the recovery of mankind.\
      \ The writer actively mocks you as he flaunts the idea of hope right in front\
      \ of you, and then proceeds to destroy any semblance of it. The ASCII graphics\
      \ only adds to this unnatural atmosphere of hopelessness, it's simplicity simply\
      \ allows your mind to fill in the blanks. Although I do prefer to be shown rather\
      \ than told, the writing is sublime and is genuinely poetic at times, and I\
      \ do believe that plenty is hinted at throughout the game world. \n\nI cannot\
      \ recommend this game enough, even if rogue-likes aren't your thing.\n\nI would\
      \ highly recommend you play this game knowing as little about the story as possible\
      \ (even if I had just spoiled the basic premise in this review.) I would honestly\
      \ say this is a must play title in the current year. The Door in the Woods should\
      \ not go unnoticed.\n\n        [i]\"Has something essential been stolen, to\
      \ raise edifices that we cannot understand?\"[/i]"
