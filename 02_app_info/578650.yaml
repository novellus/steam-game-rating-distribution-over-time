      \ Taking the Raptiphobia flaw gives you a debuff when confronting the vicious\

    review: Still torn between yes and no, Feels like it's trying to be fallout and
      succeeds somewhat. I am feeling it needs more - most especially multiple quest
      tracking.  I would also really like a mini-map.  I also want to add map notes/markers
      to things I find and want to come back to.   I also feel the side quests offered
      so far are skewed mostly to evil with occasional good alternate turn in popping
      up.  [spoiler] First side quest offered was to strong arm people to paying for
      family graves - ugh no thanks. [/spoiler] I set my character up as a science/eng
      not 'paladin' who enforces laws good or bad.  I knew the second the main quest
      said [spoiler] to steal the power core from the protesters and force em back
      to company slavery [/spoiler] that I would not do that - sheesh.
