Right now I can see a lot of potential for various strategies to work to defeat others / the computer so that is exciting.  You gotta die a few times to understand exactly how it works (at least I do because I dont absorb directions as well as others till I put them to use).  Overall I really enjoyed it and am excited about future changes as they develope the game!","timestamp_created":1605389517,"timestamp_updated":1605389517,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4jICr5PUCf9OzrgI="}
