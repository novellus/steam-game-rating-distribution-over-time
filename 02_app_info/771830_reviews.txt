The two Orbx DLCs that I already have (Innsbruck and Eagle Country) are both too mountainous, and Palm Springs does not have an ILS. Monterey fit the bill perfectly. The airport and its immediate surrounds are exquisitely detailed and beautifully lit at night. It has an ILS approach to 10R, a LOC approach to 28R, and working MALSR and PAPI lights from both directions. Taxiway edge lights make it possible to taxi at night but it is not easy, as there are no taxiway centre-line lights and the aircraft landing lights do not illuminate the taxiway (an Aerofly limitation). Performance is good - even my puny MX150_0 2GB graphics card is getting 30+ fps on high graphics quality.  \n\nOn the downside, the DLC does not cover nearly the same area as Innsbruck, Eagle County or Palm Springs - just the airport and the small town around it (less than 400 sq. km compared to 1500-2500 sq. km for the others), and has less animation than other Orbx offerings (some animated people, but no vehicles).  \n\nIf you are looking for a region to fly around in fair weather, then Innsbruck, Eagle County or Palm Springs may be better choices. However, Monterey is an excellent destination for instrument and night flying. It's a pleasure to break through the cloud on the precision approach to 10R and see the Old Fisherman's Wharf come to life before you.","timestamp_created":1590075507,"timestamp_updated":1590161401,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yqzAnvICcNqniQI="}
