    about_the_game: <strong>Terra Lander II - Rockslide Resuce</strong> is a sequel
      to <strong>Terra Lander</strong>, a homage to the classic early days of arcade
      retro, but this time you will need to rescue the humanoids of the landing pads
      from the planet through ten levels of increasing difficulty.<br><br>Navigate
      the player to the landing pad through increasingly difficult levels within the
      time limit and with enough fuel. Movement or firing uses up fuel, though levels
      can be replenished by shooting the fuel dumps. Running out of fuel means you
      loose control and can't fire. If all fuel dumps are destroyed on any given level
      the player's fuel tank capacity is doubled for the next level (this does not
      apply to starting from the highest level reached).<br><br>Avoid obstacles or
      lift them out of the way with the tractor beam. Avoid the obstacles and enemy
      fire while navigating the terrain. Don't land too fast...make sure it's a soft
      landing.<br><br>When all the humanoids are collected, fly high above the planet
      to escape, making sure you have enough fuel. Keep an eye on fuel levels and
      destroy fuel dumps to replenish.<br><br>When all levels are complete, they repeat
      with a slightly higher difficulty setting.<br><br>When a life is lost the player
      is temporarily shielded against enemy fire, this is represented by an electrical
      circular field around the lander just after it is respawned.<br><br>In Terra
      Lander II your ship has been upgraded with a force field.  Therefore, you have
