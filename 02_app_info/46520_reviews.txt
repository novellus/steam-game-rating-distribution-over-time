You play as Angel, or more precisely her truck Gypsy in the vast wastelands, defending civilians and taking on multiple waves of bandits as they try to kidnap those civilians and kill you at the same time. The story doesn't make much sense, as it starts off with Angel looking for her ex boyfriend just so she can get a sense of direction and once that is past you, you'll just move to the next location because apparently that's where you're needed. \n\nThe main problem with the game's flow is that it never changes its objective and direction; the game is undoubtedly fun to play for the first 15 minutes, but after that you'll just realize that the things you have to do and follow will never change: you will always fight the same enemies, in the same looking wastelands while defending the same cities in the same way you did in the previous level. There are the occasional bonus levels and boss battles that will change things a bit for a minute or two, but just as the normal levels, those require the same manoeuvre performed a couple of times in a row, which really isn't hard to do once you figured it out.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe first time you start playing Wasteland Angel it will definitely seem like a fun experience, with promising upgrades, scores to beat and waves of enemies that at a first glance would seem to keep you busy for a long time, but shortly after that the first impression will be shattered once you realize that the enemies will never change, your objective stays the same no matter what and mechanics that sounded promising in the beginning aren't even implemented properly. \n\nThe upgrade mechanic for instance only works on your weapons, making them slightly more powerful, but not only do they disappear once you move on to the next level, they sometimes make things even worse as some upgrade stages will sometimes trigger a bug that won't damage the incoming vehicles and techniques such as precise aiming and the use of special weapons are left behind once you realize the best way to deal with anything coming your way is to never let go of the right trigger. Special weapons will probably end up being used only during the boss battles where they are mandatory, but even so leaving some mines behind you just so the giant tank following you will hit them isn't fun at all especially since that's the only thing you'll have to do for the entire level.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\nWasteland Angel doesn't necessarily look bad, cause even if it does, the top down camera will hide most of it, but the overall design decisions and repetitions make it feel like a lazy attempt at a long lasting game that just isn't made to be played for more than a couple of minutes. The enemies you'll face not only act the same, but they look the same as well and the stages look way too similar and not in the same wasteland themed kind of way. The visual effects are anywhere from incredibly useless to completely missing, making the entire stage truly feel like a wasteland even in the heat of the battle.\n\n[b]Audio[/b]\nThe sound effects are even worse than the visuals, sometimes missing and sometimes so irritating that you'd wish those were missing too; on the soundtrack side, it's pretty much the same track repeated over and over again with the bullets that you shoot adding to the noise of it. Since there is nothing interesting to hear around here and the story doesn't make sense enough to be worth hearing, probably the best way to go with this one is to just leave your own music playing in the background and mute everything inside the game.\n\n[b]Extras[/b]\nIt takes around 3 hours to complete the campaign, maybe add a couple more if you're going for all the achievements since they are an easy grab if you replay some stages, but after that there isn't anything else to do; maybe a Co-op mode would've saved the repetitive gameplay and add a few more hours of value to this, but there is none.\n\n[b]Verdict[/b]\nWasteland Angel is fun, for 15 minutes, and it can take up to five hours more to finish if you want the achievements, but as for anything else and especially anything enjoyable you should probably look somewhere else, as Wasteland Angel has problems in way too many areas to even list them all.\n\n[u]Rating: 3.4[/u]","timestamp_created":1515595897,"timestamp_updated":1594393234,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548500239849090576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpcHPnPMCd9nUlQE="}
