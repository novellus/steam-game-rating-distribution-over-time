    review: in game content is never ok to pay for when its taken out of the game
      just to be added as a "dlc" in these days and made to be bought for even more
      money on top of the game price. anyone remember expansions and when a game/season
      pass got you the expansions for free when you spent that extra money on a useless
      video game that does nothing to increasing the worlds effectiveness as a planet...
      games are pretty useless these days with the ignorant humans who destroy them
      just wanting money and nothing else. if i didnt get this in a bundle and on
      75% off i would have never spent money on in game fake animals when i have real
      ones that could get a toy or something real........i dont recommend supporting
      any kind of entertainment company these days as everything is pay to pay to
      pay to watch/play. pay for in game radio that plays the same 4 songs on each
      station again worthless and not worth any kind of extra money for in game digital
      content that is realistically 100% unlimited and free to mass produce. dont
      forget the people who actually design and come up with this stuff probably doesnt
      get paid the amount they should but it all goes to a single corp...fixed income
      employees for unlimited sale digital items lol.... gaming is so trash in 2020
