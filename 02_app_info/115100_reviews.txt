A challenging yet fun story driven turn based style game.  You get to explore the world and enjoy a fun Halloween story that brings someone like me back to the days of making your own costumes.  Challenging, but not in a frustrating way so it can be enjoyable for the whole family.  Great graphics and fight sequences.  It is a re-playable game but mainly for the achievements.","timestamp_created":1609647575,"timestamp_updated":1609647575,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/Zme4/YCdqv6vwI="}
