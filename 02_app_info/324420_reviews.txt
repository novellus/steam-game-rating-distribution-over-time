But it's a very difficult game to review. Variety is both this game's greatest strength and weakness. The art style is this absurd, ultra fantasy thing and all the units have unique or interesting attacks. Like the dragon who can damage two enemies in a line. It's fun but I can't keep the units straight most of the time. Maybe other people will have better luck with this but with every unit having slightly different range, attack style and, attack type while also being wacky, mega fantasy just makes planning my strategy damned near impossible.\n\nI don't like doing this but, because it's so tough to review, I decided to just make the rest of this in list format. The good and the bad. Things I loved about the game and things I hated. I hope this helps someone.\n\nThe Good\n - Over the top fantasy art. Like if Tim Burton and Jim Henson made all the art.\n - Fun and unique units that all look and play differently.\n - Interesting mechanics like bodies of water that freeze allowing ground units to pass.\n - Decently crafted single player campaign that eases you into the game.\n - Very clear info boxes telling you exactly what you need to know at a glance.\n - Excellent controller support.\n - Great price! Only $5 average. (I got it for $1.50 during a sale)\n - Small download\n - Works great on any system. Even tablets since it has touch screen support.\n\nThe Bad\n - Confusing units make it difficult to plan effective strategies... in a strategy game.\n - Lack of color coding makes things confusing sometimes and severely limits multiplayer.\n - Multiplayer requires account creation. Meh.\n - 1v1 only even in single player skirmishes.\n - No making your own maps so the only skirmish maps are the campaign missions. Lame.\n - Menus are designed for touch screen and/or controller which makes using a mouse frustrating at times.\n - No cloud support although, this could be good or bad depending on how you feel.\n - Depressing music and visuals. *see below*\n\nDesert Ashes takes the Advance Wars formula and turns it on its head. It has a deliberately ugly art style and gameplay that is unique and can even surprise you at times. It won't last long but is well worth the asking price for what it gives you and frequently goes on sale for a lot less.\n\nIf you love Advance Wars and are looking for something different, absolutely give this a try.\n\n\n\n*Below*\nSpecial Note: The music and art style, while unassuming, provide an exceptionally depressing atmosphere. If you have serious depression (like me) then chances are you won't be able to play for very long. I know it sounds silly but because of how light the game is it can actually sneak up on you. I personally was only able to play for about 45 minutes to an hour at a time. Not a deal breaker by any means but, just something to consider.","timestamp_created":1599024378,"timestamp_updated":1599024378,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwifbRpvQCdeeknwI="}
