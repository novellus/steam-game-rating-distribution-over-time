I love the typing angle, but more often than not - I don't care how fast you type - it is impossible to avoid obstacles for very long seamlessly. Why is this? Because you cannot spell RICOCHET and then ASCEND fast enough to jump over a pit and then the spider that comes RIGHT after. \n\nThey honestly should've programmed it so that the obstacles and enemies HAVE to stay a decent distance apart so you actually have a chance to avoid EVERY obstacle or enemy that shows up. You will fail multiple times in this game and it will often not even be your fault. This alone might not seem like the worst thing in the world on its own, but when so many runs end with you being eliminated because of an impossible challenge rather than human error, then the satisfaction that comes with making a decent distance is very rare and you are left with gameplay that predominantly frustrates and disappoints. :(\n\nThe way they switch up the trigger words with alternate ones that often barely even pass for synonyms can also add to your confusion while playing, even if the JUMP, SHOOT, ATTACK, and ROLL displays DO always stay in the same spots. \n\nOverall, my point is that this game is based on a good concept, has decent aspects, but is ultimately lacking and flawed. I may end up playing it some more in the future, but I wouldn't say it deserves a seal of recommendation when it is this underdeveloped and prone to frustrate. Sad, really.","timestamp_created":1586669749,"timestamp_updated":1586669906,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwha25tvECeLePgAI="}
