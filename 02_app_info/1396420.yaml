    developer_response: 'The international options aren''t shown in the main menu,
      when you first start the game.

      It is on the first day of the season that you will be invited to select your
      international club, and  then you will be able to manage it, alongside your
      chosen domestic club.

      I hope this is helpful and that you enjoy the game.

    review: I've paid for this, downloaded it, installed it following the instructions
      given and there's no indication whatsoever within the game whether this has
      installed or whether it's operating properly as there is no reference to any
      international teams or competitions within the game, no options to take control
      of an international team, nothing! therefore I can't recommend it.
