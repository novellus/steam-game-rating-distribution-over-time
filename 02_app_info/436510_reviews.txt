Melee weapons will make your characters go into melee, but bows and staves will keep them in the back. Staves are by far the best weapons for magicians. If you used staves already, then it's definitely a bug and not supposed to happen, please tell me if it's the case. \n\nThanks to your input, in party creation, I'll make it clear that the weapon of choice for any mage is a staff, and tell it's a ranged weapon in it's description. It's my bad for not making it clear.\n\nAlso, the game saves every 15 seconds (out of combat), and when you die you resurrect with a small fee and lose nothing else, which I think is not too punishing. I suggest you create a new party and reload every one of your characters (it automatically saves them) but give your magic users staves... or just continue your game and make it to the first village and buy them."}],"cursor":"AoJwjJ7gh/ICeIvDhwI="}
