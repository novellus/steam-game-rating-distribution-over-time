The story is based on the player's choice's and its intresting really(+). not much more than a sword enemies and allies, but i suppose is a good thing because its more a story based game, and the gameplay is eazy and simple (+) \n\nthe only flaw that i have found is that the dialogue is vague (-) and its confusing at first. There are wierd result from an certain action. \n\nThe game is overall intresting and fun it earns and 3/4 from me.\n\nIf the developer is still alive, please give us a guide, because it's a bit confusing.","timestamp_created":1487948707,"timestamp_updated":1536950332,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.460849523544311523","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpp3Y7OUCdp3+cg=="}
