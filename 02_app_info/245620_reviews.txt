When i play multiplayer my progress was delayed while the others have normal progression. For example when my friends was attacked by The Allies, i cant see the attack until 10 minutes later. And also sometimes the military can curl into one place and forming somekind of ritual, and they were inactive even tho there was an attack. Although, i have an opposite opinion for the singleplayer.","timestamp_created":1610097152,"timestamp_updated":1610097152,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgJrR8PYCcZa/wQI="}
