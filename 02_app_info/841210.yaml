      Fantasy&quot;In this work, players must return to headquarters to perform tasks.
      They must be separated from their present friends. We must find friends and
      say goodbye. Of course,we can also take pictures for memorial.<h2 class="bb_tag">Game
      background:</h2><br>The &quot;WW Fantasy&quot; selled now is my personal development
      of the magic war commemorative edition, that is, look at the scenery, to commemorate
      the players who are waiting for it.<br>&quot;WW Fantasy&quot;this game was developed
      in 2014 by individuals, and began testing in 2016, when the test perfected 26
      roles and opened more than 100 levels to support matching and beating.The first
      test was in January and February 2016. The second test was May 2016. The third
      test was in August, and had five or six thousand people played in one year.But
      at that time, art resources were not well enough to go online, so we began to
      look for art. Later,we were short of funds and had to stop developing. We also
      want to restore the development, but can not solve the problem of personnel
      funds and financial matter.Because the pressure of work in the game industry
      is huge, and the development of this project is even more intense. So some of
      the team members choose to give up the project. And we are not able to achieve
      full time development,the game has been developed without money.So it will drag
      all the time and eventually lead to a stagnation of the game.
