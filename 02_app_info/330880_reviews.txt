Buy this game! Not because it's a good game... the game itself is totally broken and abandoned by it's developers (literally). But I say buy it while you still can... for another reason. Crafting the cards! \nThis game is worth it just for the emoticons / Backgrounds / and primarily the steam profile badges. If you own it you can make booster packs.\nEvery Christian wants these amazing crosses. True that I am only talking about crafting this games trading cards only here... not game play(!) (Once again; [u]the game is BROKEN[/u]) , but because the cards are limited this stuff is soooooooo expensive in the steam market. \n\nI've been trying to complete the foil set for a year now and I just can't find the Anais Biren foil though.\n\nI find that the profit from crafting this set on several steam accounts will pay for the game or cards many times.","timestamp_created":1546022840,"timestamp_updated":1548100772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.415264636278152466","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwiuT/uOgCd5netgE="}
