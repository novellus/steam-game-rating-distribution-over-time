      \ />\r\nSponsor-A-Planet provides you a planet with life. It will try to survive,\
      \ build and thrive, whether or not you decide to intervene.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nGameplay:<br />\r\nThe core gameplay involves observing the AI characters\
      \ as they go about their day doing what they do, and watching as they turn the\
      \ somewhat sparse and barren landscape into a more lively and developed environment.\
      \ The player has the option to spawn more AI (gold dependent) to increase development\
      \ speed. There is only one way to spawn gold resources, a gold platform underneath\
      \ the gazebo. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures: <br />\r\nCurrently implemented\
      \ features include first-person movement using the WASD keys, Spacebar for jump,\
      \ F key to fly, LeftShift to sprint, LeftCtrl to crouch, and E key to spawn\
      \ AI characters. The AI characters will walk around and look for gold resources\
      \ to purchases houses. AI characters have different modes and glowing eyes corresponding\
      \ to the mode they are in. For instance, yellow eyes represents random wander\
      \ mode, bright blue for gold pickup mode, dark blue for resting mode."

    review: I mean you don't got tons to do in here at the moment but its kinda funny
      seeing so many little meeps just wandering. The only thing I didn't liked is
      how when you have massive amounts of meeps they just like clog together. I reached
      like 505 meeps before my pc almost exploded haha, It has potential for the future
      but not really the best if you trying to find content as of right now. I'll
      be checking it in a few months.
