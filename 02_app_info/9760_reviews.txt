Even letting you set the resolution for 2560x1440, something I uncommonly find on older games.\n\nIt also plays well, a little clunky here and there, mainly with unit pathing, but that can be forgiven due to aged game reasons. In fact it felt not too dissimilar to Act of War: Act of Aggression, which is to be expected, same series. That to me says it's a good system, just in need of refinement. Hence if you've played then you can effectively jump into this, no tutorial needed, just tips due to aged game reasons.\n\nFavorite thing: Vehicles can run over enemy troops. Something sorely lacking or little used in RTS games these days (too my knowledge).\n\nLeast favorite thing: A lot of spelling errors. There's two game breaking bugs involving the Arleigh Burke Class ship and Tarawa Class where they might bug out from anything, moving, firing, causing a one and a half second long sound loop of whatevers on at that moment. The result is that it will stick like that, even in the menu, and worst of all it's gamebreaking, you can't progress when this happens and you will know when it does.\n\nThe good thing is this bug is only in two levels, and the second level is easily fixed by the simple move of just not using the Arleigh Burke ship at all, just ignore it.\n\nSo to emphasize, aged game that runs great on modern systems. If you want a classic RTS this would be one of them, and it's frequently on sale, of course. Grab it with Act of Aggression if you want!","timestamp_created":1609726966,"timestamp_updated":1609726966,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj4fN5fYCe5CiwAI="}
