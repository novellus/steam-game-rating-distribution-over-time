    review: "This table-top fantasy game simulator is pretty serious. \nPlay as human,\
      \ forget to take a torch or lantern with you, you won't see a thing. Nothing.\
      \ Pure blackness everywhere. Ok, let's hire a dwarf into our party... he can\
      \ see now, but the other party members will still have trouble.\nOk, hire a\
      \ cleric or wizard or sorcerer with LIGHT spell. Great...but the spell will\
      \ wear off in few turns and back to darkness.\nCleave also works only when enemies\
      \ are lined up next to each other.\nSkills, Feats and abilities must be combined\
      \ with extreme effort and focus on detail. \nCompared to common PC games, this\
      \ is table-top simulator, hence I had to cope with the differences first: even\
      \ when outside of combat, one has to move each character individually. Luckily,\
      \ the dungeons (pre-made or generated) are not huge, so what you actually get\
      \ is the option of setting up your party before anticipated assault carefully,\
      \ maximizing efficiency and minimizing loses. \nI was also surprise that huge\
      \ enemies can use SQUEZE skill and push themselves through narrow corridors.\
      \ (While I was hoping I can keep the huge dire ape away from my party and handle\
      \ the minions first, I was shocked seeing the huge enemy squeezing through 5-foot\
      \ corridor, just next to my sorcerer...) \nI also had to figure out what means\
      \ \"move to the back\" and \"move in the front\", as soon more enemies started\
      \ to overlap themselves. Huge dying dire boar did 'overlap' 2 of my still kicking\
      \ enemies and I was wondering how to attack those cowards hiding under the beast's\
      \ soon-to-be corpse...and then I realized what the 'move to the back' button\
      \ does :) \nDespite the game being in \"early access\", one can have a lot of\
      \ fun. \nAs soon it will have properly all aspects implemented, this could be\
      \ nice option to many other RPG games, possibly offering multiplayer, where\
      \ one is the Dungeon Master and others play as adventurers?\nBTW, if you encounter\
      \ problems, like I did, visit the discord, that devs created. They respond pretty\
      \ fast."
