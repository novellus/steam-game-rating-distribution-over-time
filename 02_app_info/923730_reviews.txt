It uses a very interesting set of game mechanics, & I would say revolutionizes the Mix genre of games. I think that as far as games on my steam account go, Monster Mix might be one of the most well made, as it is simply has an incredibly high quality of production. It impresses me, honestly, that the developers of Monster Mix put so much time into a game, made it so good, put so much into it, & ultimately decided to only sell it for a measly dollar. That the developers would be so gracious to us is honestly amazing, & it baffles me that they decided to grace our lives with this magnum opus of gaming for such an impressively low price.\n    I would argue that this game alone is more worth buying than likely any other game, including games on other services beside steam. I genuinely suggest this game if you're looking for a game with a heavy story & immersive content, & even if you're a more casual player, just looking for some fun, I would nonetheless suggest this masterpiece for its incredibly intense & riveting game play loop.\n    One might pass by this game when scrolling & think of it merely as a shameless cash grab from the developers, to capitalize on the recent rush of players into the world of Mix games. I wholeheartedly suggest this game to any player looking for a high quality & possibly eye-opening experience.","timestamp_created":1578698134,"timestamp_updated":1578698134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn7rvyO8CcNaW6wE="}
