    review: "Watch my video here https://youtu.be/VqJ816jWqoQ\nPlayed on the Rift\
      \ S. \n\nGraphically is nice and decent. I felt on the Rift S I could do with\
      \ a little supper sampling to sharp it out. The game runs very well. Lighting\
      \ is nice and so is the textures. The maps designs are vivid and different in\
      \ design. (3 levels to play)\n\nAudio is really funny when a Goblin dies or\
      \ gets hit by an arrow. It had my making noises in laughter that I have heard\
      \ come from me before. Overral the audio is fine. No 3D audio and the music\
      \ is louder than the SFX.\n\nGameplay is really fun and addictive. Not a surprise\
      \ for a wave game as they can be. This game has power ups and many types of\
      \ monsters to killer. You can teleport to different platforms to get better\
      \ angles of shot. It like a tower defence game were you're the towers.\n10 waves\
      \ to get through the best you can to climb the global leaderboards.\n\nThe game\
      \ cost is very cheap. \xA35.19 about $6.49 somewhere in-between for Euros.\n\
      I personally enjoyed this early access game and found zero bugs. I would recommend\
      \ it."
