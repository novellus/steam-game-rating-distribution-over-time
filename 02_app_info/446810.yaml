    review: 'This game is decent, but not phenomenal.

      Blossom Tales is a Zelda-like and it wears it on its sleeve.

      The game does not really try to do anything new for the genre, but sticks to
      standard Zelda-like gameplay.


      Overall, the story is very basic and the main drive for this game is the gameplay.
      Most of the time, the gameplay is satisfying, but other times it can feel tiresome.
      The game is very linear to the point that the "dungeons" are mostly just long
      gauntlet corridors with only a few branching rooms. It''s not like in Zelda
      games where the dungeons are vast, interconnected, and require going between
      rooms to solve puzzles. In Blossom Tales, its basically a straight shot from
      the beginning of a dungeon to the end.


      One negative I have with this game is its lack of puzzle variety and the fact
      that the puzzles that do exist are straight forward. As previously mentioned,
      dungeons are mostly just big hallways full of enemies. There are six types of
      puzzles you will encounter:

      1) kill all the enemies in a room

      2) a path puzzle (touch all the tiles)

      3) a block pushing puzzle (push the blocks onto the tiles)

      4) hit a switch and move on.

      5) Memorization puzzle (hit stones in the correct pattern)

      6) code puzzle (correct symbols on blocks)


      Occasionally you will find a locked door in a dungeon, but you always just have
      to go into a single room to the side to get the key. There isn''t any path-finding
      logic that you would expect from a Zelda-like. I think that is the biggest negative
      overall for me - the game tries to be Zelda, but ends up coming short.


      Also, the game is NOT open world - it is very linear.


      That being said, the game is not terrible. I recommend this game to people who
      enjoy action-adventure games,  but do not have a history of playing a lot of
      Zelda games. If a veteran Zelda player plays this game, it will probably end
      up feeling a bit mediocre.'
