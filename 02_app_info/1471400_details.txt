There's also a scene towards the beginning where someone, for comedic purposes, takes off their clothes so their underwear is showing. Then at some point they take their underwear off but there's a black box covering that part of their body. That's as bad as it gets in this as far as I know.\r\n\r\nAlso there's mention of violence and a sound effect for it, but blood isn't shown.\r\n\r\nBut yeah the \"nudity\" label is there cause a guy takes his clothes off down to his underwear since that's shown, then takes that off but that area where the underwear was is covered by a black box, and this is all done for comedic purposes.
