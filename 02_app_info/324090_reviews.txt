First season I played, I had to restart like 10 times, because the game just froze or crashed to desktop.\n\nIf you can live with crashes and freezes and a messy UI, there's still one point which makes this a \"not recommend\" for me. The game forces you to make a tactic / formation which uses a left and right midfielder, while there are almost no left and right midfielders in the database. Most wingers are left / right forwards but you can't use them without a big penalty on the left/right midfield positions. You can change your formation, but whatever you do, the game won't allow to create a tactic without left/right midfield, so if you want to use left / right forwards, you still need a left / right midfield as well which is totally bollox.","timestamp_created":1610029736,"timestamp_updated":1610029736,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhITQ7vYCdMGkwQI="}
