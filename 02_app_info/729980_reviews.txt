This was the perfect level for a relaxing casual game with a cuppa.  By medium level (people and houses) most were at the level of taking anywhere from 10 -20 mins each to solve/plant fences, not hair pulling but not 'this is so boring as I don't have to work it out as its so easy'.  I did get stuck at a couple for about 45 mins each but I never felt that I was never going to get it.  \n\nGameplay - divide the squares equally between the neighbours, by adding fences, making sure each has a person, house and eventually fruit in their area.  I really like that it has a level map so if you get stuck in a puzzle there are usually 2 other puzzles you can play.  There also is a change the view button,  you can turn and tilt it by moving it with mouse, even playing top down. You can zoom in and out using the scroll button on mouse.\n\nApart from fruit being added later to make it a bit harder, there are no new game mechanics introduced so it is a bit 'one note'. \n\n It's fun, cute and there are 101 levels.  There are fun sayings on the loading scenes between the puzzles (one of them had a typo on it).  If you are looking for a hard puzzle game this isn't for you but for the rest of us who want to relax, take our time and get a few hours out of a casual game, this ticks all the boxes.","timestamp_created":1510346820,"timestamp_updated":1562016105,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.724991440773010254","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4osja1+sCdtj6igE="}
