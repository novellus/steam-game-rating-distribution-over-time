Agents in these two DLCs are quite overpowered. Like all at once while the base game lacks characters with such traits. Only Slayer is a quite weak agent in the pack, the other three turn the game into peasey mode.\n\nBut the only  part I don't really like is the limitation of nations. Not all show up - I guess ten is the limit. Shouldn't be limited like that. :(","timestamp_created":1610019426,"timestamp_updated":1610019521,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4noip7vYCepWgwQI="}
