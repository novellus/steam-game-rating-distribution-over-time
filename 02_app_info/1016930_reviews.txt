The story certainly builds up an interesting world that our survivor is now exploring in the past and present however it feels a little convoluted that he just happens to land around 90 minutes away from the same place where I assume everything went wrong.\n\nThe controls feel a little janky at times but I think it was just me not realising I couldn't teleport into the present as it was no longer solid, however there are parts where it does let you teleport in and then kills you after the jump. Because of this you have an expectation about how the lantern acts and it makes it a bit annoying trying to work out why it's not activating.\n\nThe voice acting wasn't great tbh, and some of the sound mixing was a little off, some voices were really quiet, some were normal.\n\nThe way it's drawn is really nice, though the animation feels a bit jank, like I'm playing a more grimdark drawn to life. \n\nIf they make a second one it could definitely go for some other mechanics to make it more interesting. Story line wise, I feel like they've sort of given themselves a dead end though I guess you could write the astronaut back in. Some more solid interactions/reactions with the NPCs of the past would be nice too.\n\nI recommend it if you can get it for cheap and you just want a small adventure game to pass the time.","timestamp_created":1609848406,"timestamp_updated":1609848406,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/6ec6fYCf4DXwAI="}
