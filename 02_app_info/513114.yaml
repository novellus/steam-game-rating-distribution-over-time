    about_the_game: The LMS Period 1 coaches were wooden framed and panelled with
      beading. These coaches also utilised the British Standard corridor connector
      as opposed to the Pullman gangway which was later adopted as the standard for
      rolling stock on many other regions. The Period 2 by comparison had a much more
      modern feel with larger windows and less panelling.<br><br>The LMS P1&amp;P2

    review: 'they look great, but they don''t go very well at all. the drag is set
      way too high. so if you like short trains and or going slow there. fine. However,
      if you are like me this will drive you nuts


      MT, I am disappointed. You are better than this, I know you are.'
