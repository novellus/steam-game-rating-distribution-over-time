      \ different to the fun to be had with the serious challenges after beating the\
      \ game. Underneath its simple surface there is a second, and then a third layer\
      \ of gameplay that leaves you feeling satisfied.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.forest.impress.co.jp/docs/serial/shumatsu/20150724_713053.html\"\

      \ selection of resources' and 'a relaxed rate of growth' are the two main components\
      \ of this game's design. It's easy to pick up, and with its gratifying sound\
      \ effects it lends itself to short bursts of play; for 5, 10... 15 minutes...\u201D\
