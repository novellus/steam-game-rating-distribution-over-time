      /><br><br>Against her father's wishes, Sachi took up her sword and went on a
      quest to prove herself as a capable swordswoman. However, her journey quickly
      came to an end as she was ambushed by a group of kidnappers on the way back,
      who swiftly captured and took her to a mysterious colosseum hidden within the
      city. With a red collar placed around her neck, she was declared a slave fighter
      by her captors and thrown into the fighter pits, where she must fight and win
      against 7 other fighters in the same situation to earn her freedom.<br><br><strong><h2
