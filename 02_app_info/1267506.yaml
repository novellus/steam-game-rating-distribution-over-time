    review: "I wish I could recommend this addon but I feel that it was not ready\
      \ for release onto the store yet.\nIt will be ready for release once some things\
      \ are fixed.\n\nPros-\nEngine sounds are great\nOutside details are perfect\n\
      RP-M4C rolling sounds are great, sounds exactly like rolling down the rails\
      \ in a slug\n\nCons-\nBell on/off is a big problem. Also the bell does need\
      \ changed to an E-Bell sound\nControl stand gauges are not correct, in the real\
      \ life counterparts they are not digital gauges\nYou can see through the nose\
      \ camera, almost like its a ghost\nTrain and Independent braking need tweaked,\
      \ they are very weak in game; The brakes in real life are very responsive\n\
      Strobe lights on top of the GP33 need to flash, they are not supposed to be\
      \ constantly lit\n\nIf you are looking to get this just for the look and coolness,\
      \ go ahead buy it\nIf you are expecting high accuracy, I would not pick it up\
      \ in its current state, but I would if it is updated\n\nOverall it's cool seeing\
      \ these finally make it to train sim, but they need fixed to be close to 100%\
      \ accurate. \nThis rating is based on my opinion, which the opinion being from\
      \ a real NS Conductor in Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n\n"
