Nice atmosphere and overall feel too.\nGame is still in Early Access, but has quite a potential. Waiting for the full campaign and the multiplayer.","timestamp_created":1604271855,"timestamp_updated":1604271855,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503882706165313721","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ42bqDw/UCcs/WqwI="}
