What brought me in was the humorous take on H.P. Lovecraft, but the voices were just too amateurish, if I had to point out one very specific problem. If a visual novel is just going to be something that you sit there and watch and listen to... it's also got to be something you'd actually want to listen to. Unfortunately, many of these voices just sounded way, way, off (not in a good way).","timestamp_created":1600547955,"timestamp_updated":1600547955,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k/SF1PQCe7bsogI="}
