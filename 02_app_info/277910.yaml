    about_the_game: 'Mars Colony: Challenger is a 3D first / third person game that
      offers you the challenge of setting up a remote base on the surface of Mars.
      At its core, the game was derived from a simulator where everything is interactively
      tied together. You will have to setup and maintain the equipment that supplies
      pressure and a breathable atmosphere to the base. You are also tasked with growing
      food, setting up communications and extracting resources in order to make the
      base self-sufficient. The game offers three zones, each with their unique challenges.
      There are 7 phases to each mission. Each of the phases expands the base and
      offers a new set of orders for you to complete. You advance through the ranks
      as you score points for your performance.'
