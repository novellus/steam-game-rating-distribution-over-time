The game is basically of the spaceship joystick/mouse fly around and shoot other spaceships game. The graphics are just ok and the music kind of a scifi-trip theme, but nothing really really to blow you away. You get to choose a spaceship based on what you like, speed, fire power, health with names like Rio, Volga, Potomac and Euphrates and protect the Blue Shield Alliance's power generators on colonized planets. Such and Mars, Pluto and the Moon. The character roster is short with Admiral Herman, engineer Dana, a robot named B-177e  and a frigate pilot named Valgard. The bad guys are just easily named Cons and well that's about it. There is a single / co op story mode and you have a survival mode. Go back and beat top scores with free play mode also. The game is fun and you can kill a hour or so but, with-out a team or co op friends you get stuck/can't really progress in story mode. This game is almost  like you do need the team/friends to beat it. It'll be lots of fun with them, but it puts a damper on beating the actual story mode and playing as a single player.  Buy if you have lined up friends to get it too or its on sale like when I did and have a few hours to kill.","timestamp_created":1431825813,"timestamp_updated":1602518704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542483627796173096","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+NvjjvUCdfPBPA=="}
