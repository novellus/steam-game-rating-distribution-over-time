    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How to Play</h2>Each adventure in this game\
      \ will start from a camp, with the camp as the starting point. Each time you\
      \ start the adventure, you can choose three of your more than ten controllable\
      \ characters, equipped with their equipment and Skills, explore around the camp,\
      \ eliminate the threats in those places and ensure the safety of the camp. After\
      \ that, your team will return to the camp, supplies will be replenished, various\
      \ states will be restored, and the next adventure will be prepared.<br>In the\
      \ camp, players can prepare potions, cook food, build equipment, and trade with\
      \ merchants in the camp. Different camps are composed of different merchants.\
      \ For example, there may be merchants selling rare ores in mining camps, and\
      \ camps around handicraft towns are likely to sell necklaces and other decorations.\
      \ In addition to using various convenient rights in the camp, you control The\
      \ squad also needs to assume the responsibility of protecting the camp. When\
      \ the threat around a camp is too large, they may form a small military force\
      \ to attack the camp. At this time, the defense force placed by the player at\
      \ the camp can be useful. .<br>In the adventure, the team will encounter a variety\
      \ of different creatures, some can help the adventure, and some will hinder\
      \ the adventure. After defeating them, the team may get the equipment they use,\
      \ or the valuable parts of their limbs. After a certain adventure, players will\
      \ accumulate a lot of unique equipment, skills, etc., so they can go to more\
      \ difficult areas to help the camps in those places resist attacks.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\"> Equipment system </h2>There will be a lot of equipment in the game.\
      \ In addition to specific types of equipment, all equipment can enhance a wearer's\
      \ ability or a few abilities. Some of the equipment can also give the wearer\
      \ unique skills. When not equipped, these skills become Not available; the combination\
      \ of specific equipment will make the wearer's ability show a certain tendency,\
      \ which may make the wearer very suitable for a certain situation, on the other\
      \ hand, unreasonable equipment skills may also be greatly weakened The wearer's\
      \ ability to adapt to a specific environment.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Talent system\
      \ </h2>Each character has its own unique talent system. The character's talent\
      \ system consists of three groups each with the ability to enhance the route.\
      \ Players can use a limited number of talent points to activate a part of the\
      \ talent. They can focus on selecting one of the promotion routes to obtain\
      \ the end of the route Huge advantages can also be freely allocated to each\
      \ route to achieve a balanced ability to improve. There are many kinds of talents\
      \ in the talent system, some of them are brand new skills, and some are the\
      \ improvement of a certain ability.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Skill system </h2>From\
      \ the various creatures encountered in the adventure to the roles players can\
      \ play, they all have skills. There is no limit to the number of skills that\
      \ each character can have, but each character has only three active skill fields,\
      \ so it is necessary to skillfully arrange which skills are critical to this\
      \ adventure and which are less core. For the characters that players can control,\
      \ they all have the skills they have mastered at the beginning. These skills\
      \ often meet my assumptions about the role of the character, but if they are\
      \ not matched with other talents or equipment, they may not be able to play\
      \ a huge role in the adventure. ; There are two ways to get more skills, 1 talent\
      \ system, select some talents will give the character additional skills, equipped\
      \ with certain equipment can also give players additional skills, but please\
      \ note that when choosing other talents or uninstall When equipped with skills,\
      \ these skills will also be unavailable.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Team cooperation\
      \ </h2>In a three-person team, players can only play one role at a time, and\
      \ the behavior logic of the other two characters that are not controlled by\
      \ the player requires the player to specify when they start an adventure, such\
      \ as a more aggressive attack strategy, more inclined To maintain the team \u2019\
      s protection strategy, etc .; more specifically, players need to specify behavior\
      \ logic for all three roles, because you can choose which role to control at\
      \ any time during the battle. When you control a character, his behavior logic\
      \ will be temporarily suppressed, and the control is completely given to the\
      \ player. If the player leaves the control of the character, the character will\
      \ be controlled by his own behavior logic.<br>In addition to assigning behavior\
      \ logic to characters, there is a way to have weaker control over a character\
      \ without switching to it. This method is called team instruction; when controlling\
      \ any character, players can control by issuing team instructions For the other\
      \ two teammates, team instructions are often very simple and limited in number,\
      \ such as gathering, dispersing, charging, etc .; team instructions have the\
      \ highest priority, which means that no matter what actions these teammates\
      \ are taking, they will immediately change their own team instructions behavior.<h2\
