    review: "[b]7.5/10[/b]\n\nI found Superstatic looking through games on Steam with\
      \ the \"Top-Down Shooter\" tag. Although it didn't have a tremendous number\
      \ of reviews, the premise and mechanics seemed interesting, so I decided to\
      \ give it a shot. It doesn't hurt that it often goes on sale for a dollar, either.\n\
      \nDespite a few irritations, I ended up enjoying my time with the game quite\
      \ a bit. I found it to be engaging and tense, with an awesome soundtrack.\n\n\
      Although you technically \"could\" play the game as a twitchy quick kill/quick\
      \ death shooter, you'll likely spend most of your time sending out \"clones\"\
      \ and controlling possessed enemies. The distance that you are able to send\
      \ out your clone and the duration of possession are both determined by your\
      \ \"energy.\" This energy can be recharged at electrical boxes in the levels,\
      \ but I found it much more effective and rewarding to refill my energy through\
      \ killing multiple enemies as a clone. \n\nAfter your possessed enemy is killed,\
      \ the game typically rewards your efforts with a partial refill of your energy\
      \ bar. The more effective your stint as the possessed enemy, the more energy\
      \ you are rewarded with. Therefore, I found it exhilarating to frantically move\
      \ my possessed enemy around, looking for enemies to dispatch and weapons to\
      \ equip. I was personally a fan of shotguns, although they typically dropped\
      \ with only 2-3 shells.\n\nIn this way, the game allows players to feel the\
      \ tension of a Hotline Miami-style game without the painful level-restart failures.\
      \ If your possessed enemy dies, you may be out some energy, but you generally\
      \ won't need to start the level over again (unless you left your body out in\
      \ the open). There were certainly times where the game got difficult and I had\
      \ to take matters into my own hands, but this wasn't tremendously common.\n\n\
      In addition to the loop of possessing enemies, you're given a few abilities\
      \ to play with. One allows you to detonate your clone, one allows your clone\
      \ to walk through walls, and one allows you to teleport to your clone. Outside\
      \ of using the detonate once when I acquired the ability and walking through\
      \ walls in one level that seemed to demand it, I used none of these abilities.\
      \ However, I did try and use the \"chain kill\" ability (a fourth ability) as\
      \ often as possible. I never really understood exactly how this ability worked,\
      \ but it seemed to somehow kill enemies that were close in proximity to each\
      \ other whenever I activated it.\n\nMy issues with the game included the lack\
      \ of a finisher, some issues with multiple actions being linked to the same\
      \ button, and the size of the levels. \n\nYou can punch enemies to knock them\
      \ on the ground and pick up their weapon, but there is no way (that I found)\
      \ to finish them off while they're on the ground. Therefore, they will get up\
      \ again soon, run to the closest weapon, and re-engage. The only way I found\
      \ to deal with this was to grab the enemy weapon and stand there, waiting for\
      \ them to get up. Once the enemy was back on his feet, I put him back down permanently\
      \ with bullets. However, it feels REALLY bad to just stand there waiting for\
      \ an enemy to get up while your energy constantly drains due to the possession.\n\
      \nAnother issue, though not as irritating as the previous one I mentioned, is\
      \ that (at least using keyboard and mouse) the same button (right click) is\
      \ used to pick up weapons and refill my energy at an electrical box. Therefore,\
      \ I had to do this dance to move guns away from the box before I could refill\
      \ my energy.\n\nThe last issue is that the maps are perhaps a bit too large.\
      \ Developer Sleepy Studios notes that this allows the player a lot of freedom,\
      \ but I also found that the open space increased the chances that I'd get shot\
      \ from off-screen (Superstatic doesn't have a \"look\" command like Hotline\
      \ Miami) and made it difficult to locate the exit in each map.\n\nIf you generally\
      \ like these quick kill/quick death shooters, Superstatic adds an interesting\
      \ twist to the mix that's worth checking out. However, I'd recommend playing\
      \ only a level or two at a time due to the tension inherent in the experience."
