Features lovely artwork, soft music, and light puzzles.\n\nI did run into crash-to-desktop issues when starting the game on my install, but was able to bypass them via tweaking compatibility settings and repeatedly opening the game after it crashed. Mostly the latter.\n\nRecommended. Just be aware that there's a possibility of a CTD issue.","timestamp_created":1607742248,"timestamp_updated":1607742248,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxPq5qvYCeZ+puQI="}
