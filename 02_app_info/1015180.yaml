    developer_response: "Thank you for detailed review. First of all Tutorial robots\
      \ was intented to be have insulting character. Depend on the backstory of this\
      \ game he knows you are go\u0131ing to be destroy thousens of them and yet he\
      \ have to teach you how to kill them. Anyway thats just a story direction I\
      \ choose.\n\nThere was 3 HP stations exits in that map. But yes you have to\
      \ play to learn where they are. Guns are overheating if you shoot rapidly but\
      \ in your case you have to escape the fight to make them cooldown a bit. That\
      \ mechanic was fine with teleporting play mode but locomotion just added recently.\
      \ So I wouldn't recomment to play in locomotion mode.\n\n We aware the issue\
      \ with grenades its only happens on OpenVR mode but Oculus mode just works fine.\
      \ As you said there will be story mode as free update. Also more guns to play\
      \ with. Have a nice day."

      \ amazing. Colourful and some decent particle physics. Guns look good.\nAudio\
      \ isn't the best. The robot tutorial narrator sounds like a younger brother\
      \ putting on a robot voice while hating on everything you do. The guns sounds\
      \ are lacking and could do with beefing up. Directional audio is just not great.\
      \ At time I'm not sure where I'm getting shot from. \nGameplay is fun as a wave\
      \ survival shooter can get. It looks easy, but it does get hard and more fun.\
      \ There are weapon buys through the survival mode to grab and health.  At the\
      \ moment survival mode is the only mode with story coming later on. I'm not\
      \ sure have to work out of much health I had in game. It might of been there,\
      \ but I couldn't find it. Shot the robot in the face and the drones in their\
      \ jetpacks. The pistol guns over heats, this isn't fun and a little frustrating.\
      \ I guess this was added to make the game a little more challenging. \nThe game\
      \ is very cheap and in early access so really it isn't as bad as it sound due\
      \ to the fact it can change and grow. \nAs it stands right now though I can't\
      \ recommend this game."
