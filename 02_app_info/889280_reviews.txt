At no time did I sense any danger, just became absorbed in the story.  You would think, given the open-world kind of view that one would get lost in this walking adventure, wandering in the darkness, but I felt compelled to move in one sort of direction or another, losing the trail at several points, easily picking it back up again.  My only downside was it wasn't quite long enough and do look forward to further adventures from this developer.","timestamp_created":1602609200,"timestamp_updated":1602609200,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuPe8kfUCerDVpwI="}
