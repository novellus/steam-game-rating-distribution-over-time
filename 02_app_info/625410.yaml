    review: "In a world doomed by individualism, a young man is sent to live in a\
      \ state-run commune with equal number of men and women. Now that doesn't sound\
      \ like a typical love story, and it isn't\u2014from the get go, it's obvious\
      \ that [i]Anomie[/i] has greater ambitions than just telling a story of what\
      \ happened to Quentin after he arrived at the camp.\n\nOn his way to the camp,\
      \ Quentin meets a girl who is quite distressed about being taken from her family\
      \ and her previous life, having to take part in the experiment. Later they talk\
      \ though a ventilation shaft, with Quentin hesitant to support her over fear\
      \ of being watched. Soon enough, Quentin is assigned to a group of four\u2014\
      two boys and two girls\u2014with whom he shares assigned duties. Two of them\
      \ are content or even happy with the situation, while one of the girls, Lorelei,\
      \ is keen to get to the bottom of things. Though they don't like each other\
      \ much, Quentin and Lorelei team up to investigate the premises.\n\nWith the\
      \ pacing being just right, you're always wondering what will happen next. For\
      \ the studio's first work, [i]Anomie[/i] gets a lot of things right\u2014the\
      \ characters are well-written and believable, Quentin and Lorelei slowly growing\
      \ closer is nicely done, presentation is minimalistic but on-point, making good\
      \ use of the soundtrack.\n\nDespite having this amazing Orwell-meets-Golding\
      \ premise, [i]Anomie[/i] gradually neglects its plot in favour of its characters\
      \ and themes, burying the latter half of its dramatic arc in narrative smoke\
      \ and mirrors. While this is obviously the writer's choice, and the bittersweet\
      \ ending we get is not bad in itself, being the pedestrian reader I am I would\
      \ rather see the premise and setting fully fleshed out in a traditional story.\
      \ (It worked well enough for [i]Swan Song[/i].)\n\nOverall, I enjoyed reading\
      \ [i]Anomie[/i] and would recommend it, especially if you're interested in psychology\
      \ or philosophy\u2014if you're in for the dystopian plot, you might not get\
      \ out of it as much. In any case, I'm looking forward to more games from the\
      \ studio, it looks promising!\n\n[i]For more EVN reviews, feel free to look\
      \ at my curator page: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34616763-Azar-Reviews/]Azar\
