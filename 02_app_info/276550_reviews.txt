I did actually like the game for its slow pace turn base system where every move counts, if you like that kind of a game. Its also a great history lesson and the ability to change the course of history, I purchase the whole game including the DLC . I have no regrets got it on sale, so its a good deal. I also heard that part 2 of panzer corps is coming out. Looking forward to it.","timestamp_created":1578143123,"timestamp_updated":1578143123,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ446CquO8Cc5nj6QE="}
