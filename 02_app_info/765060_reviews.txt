There are multiple challenges that the game presents you with at the same time:\n- color-coded bullets that can destroy the corresponding color-coded enemies\n- \"flappy bird\" like gravity / jump mechanic\n- moving obstacles with spikes and other mean traps\n\nDespite the fact that the game is really hard, there are lots of checkpoints in each level and you literally continue from that point on immediately if you die. \n\nHowever, the real kicker is the multiplayer: Multiple players work together to overcome the challenges in each level. The color-coded bullets are split up between the players, making it necessary to work together but also making it easier to obliterate all enemies that block your path.\n\nThis is truly a hidden gem ;)","timestamp_created":1606845326,"timestamp_updated":1606917469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tNbvkfYCd7LGtgI="}
