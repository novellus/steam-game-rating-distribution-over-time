    review: 'Straight up classic TD with endless waves only - in a "make it as far
      as you can" high score attack style.


      It was a disappointingly dull experience. You always fill all available spots
      on a map with towers and get to max them out without any challenge. Which leaves
      your strategic choices to be your tower composition and perhaps when to sell
      your gold towers. Huge tower ranges makes positioning almost irrelevant. And
      towers with smaller ranges have mechanics like "deal more damage to monsters
      with HP>50%" (and the opposite), making position choices very obvious and/or
      uninteresting.


      Then the game plays out way too slow, even at 3 x speed. You have nothing to
      do except spamming upgrades until all towers are 100% upgraded, and then you
      just endure until you are dead. I would be surprised if *any* players can sit
      through more than 3 maps of this.


      Other than that the game looks alright and there are no obvious bugs, so it''s
      not a complete train wreck. It''s just tedious. :('
