      \ you dream, any time you envision - it can get you there. <br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nHave you ever wondered what the Handley-Page 42 looked like in real life?\
      \ Or what size was a Messerschmitt Me-323 Gigant? Or Nina, Pinta and Santa Maria?\
      \ All of them are long since gone, but with the incredible power of virtual\
      \ reality they can be brought back to life. And this is what the VR Museum was\
      \ created for. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are many great inventions that are\
      \ only known from drawings and blurry photos. And many of them are already 3D-modelled\
      \ and scattered around the net. The idea behind the VR Museum is to locate them,\
      \ refurb if necessery, and show here for everyone to see. Starting from airplanes,\
      \ the Museum's collection will grow to become more interdisciplinary in the\
      \ future. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is going to be exciting!<br />\r\n<br />\r\
