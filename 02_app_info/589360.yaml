    review: 'NON SPOILER FEEDBACK: I can''t quite say if I like it better than the
      first game, but I do like the combat and crafting better, the writing is slightly
      upped in terms of how seriously the story takes itself, the tactical mode is
      a nice touch that also makes sense though at times feels one sided, over all
      I like it, and if you liked the first game you''ll probably like it too.


      SPOILER FEEDBACK: It deffinitly gets points for weidness having a character
      from modern Earth who is perhaps the literal incarnation of an isekai protagonist
      including being younger for no good reason.

      The tactical battles while a nice addition feel badly placed at times, such
      as having ones pop up that you''d

      have no hope of doing until near the end of the game (and I''m Normal difficulty!)
      as well not fully explained at times, like a planning screen that says the enemy
      force is have your strength, but then they keep getting reinforcements out thin
      air until they''re equal or greater than yours. The writing while feeling somewhat
      better than the first game also feels somewhat lazier at times, example being
      how you keep recruiting these incredible people that should probably be staying
      in their home country to help... Also using the oldest villain cliche in the
      book of wanting to end the world to bring back their dead lover? The first game
      had a much better sense of whimsy, but I did like the tributes and references
      to the first game''s events.

      I really liked the addition of building up your kingdom, felt kind of like "My
      Life as King" but better.

      I was going to wait to write this until I finished the game, but I''m 72 hours
      in and still not done, so

      I''ll just have to edit this later with my final thoughts assuming it lets me
      (doesn''t always), it certainly

      has enough padding that''s for sure, aside from mandatory grinding to not be
      murdered in battle

      I''ve mostly been doing recruitment side quests only!'
