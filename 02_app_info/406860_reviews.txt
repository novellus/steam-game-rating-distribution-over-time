Also felt like story aspects kind of happened for no reason, as a good amount of things is not really explained and is left to interpretation. A good 3-4 hours is needed to beat the game and I do have to mention that the premise of you being blind, using echo location is quite original and well made, so if you're into vr puzzle games and/or story driven games with interesting mechanics, I think this is a good pick, especially on sale.\n7/10","timestamp_created":1609840767,"timestamp_updated":1609840767,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gZb/6PYCc+DTwAI="}
