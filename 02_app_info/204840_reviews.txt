The objective is simple: prevent the mortal humans from building a tower to the heavens. Your weapons vary such as lightning zaps, floods, falling meteors, etc. While simple, Babel Rising presents a fun challenge for casual players who enjoy variety and a change of pace.","timestamp_created":1365986518,"timestamp_updated":1605148623,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.487859964370727539","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iYiU3fUCcPafDA=="}
