    review: ' Where do I start is the Question at hand,I guess i''ll say this Locomotive
      is pretty awesome looking and that would be all i would say besides a nice different
      change of horn sound.I have learned a lot from my dad which at one point in
      his career as a railroader that drove these units before i was born that these
      Locomotives weren''t liked by working crews for there horrible in cab features.This
      DLC locomotive honestly makes this Locomotive in real life look and feel horrible,what
      i mean is it has next to know pulling power bad brakes meaning all 3 types &
      the Goldish yellow headlights make you want to throw up.Couple up to 20 cars
      and trying to pull them on flat track means you''ll be in Notch 5 or 6 to even
      get the train moving No Joke when railroad cars in real life are meant to roll
      easy moving on rails & braking 30% with 20 cars and then releasing brakes you''ll
      sit there for 1 min 20 secs before you can even move even if your at Notch 8.Honestly
      this DLC is the WORSE NS dlc ever made "WARNING PLEASE DON''T LISTEN TO THE
      FANBOYS THAT KNOW NOTHING ABOUT RAILROADING"this is a Horrible coded nightmare
      Dlc locomotive your being Warned !!'
