    about_the_game: "Rosemary left her family's farm a year ago to become a Knight\
      \ in Shining Armor! ... but being a knight is harder than she thought, and she's\
      \ looking for work at the foot of the perilous Mount Needle. Thankfully, there\
      \ are four handsome princes here who need an escort through the mountain pass,\
      \ and Rosemary is just the knight for the job! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs Rosemary,\
      \ you'll brave fierce beasts and difficult terrain, not to mention the fact\
      \ that your traveling companion can be a royal pain. But that's okay! Because\
      \ you're brave and noble and not-at-all distracted by the handsome guy you're\
      \ bound to protect. You've got the armor, you've got the sword, and you're all\
      \ ready for a fairytale romance: if the snowstorms and bone-chilling winds don't\
      \ get in the way. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd maybe these princes aren't quite as\
      \ charming as you expected... <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRose of Winter is a charming\
      \ visual novel with adventure, romance, and heartbreak. Choose one of four princes\
      \ to take on your adventure, and make decisions to unlock multiple endings.\
      \ Featuring an adorable story and art by Magnolia Pearl, Aatmaja Pandya, and\
      \ Victoria Grace Elliot, plus music by Toby Fox, Rose of Winter is ready to\
      \ sweep you off your feet!"
