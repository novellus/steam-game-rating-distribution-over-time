    review: "A really relaxing type of music.\nWell suited for those who want to feel\
      \ like they're on a tropical island.\n\nThe blend of jazz and bossanova sounds\
      \ soothing, and the faint singing in some of the tracks just gives that warmth\
      \ you just don't get with some soundtracks.\n\n(On a side note, I've had a few\
      \ games that I've had this playing in the background. It does tend to fit in\
      \ well with game you want to relax in)\n------\n\nSongs in this collection I\
      \ especially enjoyed were \"Sereng!\" (a fiesty beat, good for a battle theme);\
      \ \"Terlahir Dari Lautan ~ Night\" (that singing was so relaxing and soothing);\
      \ and \"Nyanian Pulau\" (the sounds of water crashing make that tune work so\
      \ well).\n\n(Some of the songs are named in English, and some are named in Indonesian.\
      \ \n(The three I named above translate as \"Attack!\", \"Born from the ocean\"\
      , and \"Island Song\", respectively)"
