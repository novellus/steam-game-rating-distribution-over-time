    review: 'Warehouse box stacking bunny themed game, with a twist

      Easier on multiplayer than solo and quite a bit more fun


      Cars randomly drive through the field, AI bunnies help each other learn to stack
      boxes

      Bunny football seems to have some bizarre rules involving low gravity & space
      tackling

      There are no rules here and even kicking your opponent into the net counts as
      a goal!


      Quite a few easter eggs and secrets for those who explore

      There''s even a secret currency for additional buffs and benefits

      Varied sizes and layouts keep it fresh as you improve


      Plenty enough levels to be good value, but not too many as to feel grindy

      Tip: If you get stuck, use the forklifts to climb the walls


      8/10 - Had a lot of laughs, will be back to 100% the achieves ^^'
