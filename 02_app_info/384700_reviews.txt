WOW (yeah, I'm looking at you, field 42, 58 and that awful door to 41)\n\nWell, It's a good game but really not for newcomers, better playing the first one before it. Here you'll need EVERYTHING to beat the game 100%, every technique. I dunno if I can complete this one.\n\nIt has everything good from the first game but with more deadly stages, you'll rage haha. Good luck.","timestamp_created":1608657000,"timestamp_updated":1608657000,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5LrbxfYCcOKbvAI="}
