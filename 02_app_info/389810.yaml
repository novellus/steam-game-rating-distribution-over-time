    review: "(Note: I've actually played more than the Steam time shows, but Steam\
      \ doesn't seem to count offline mode hours.) \n\nI'm a huge fan of Autoduel\
      \ so I was super hyped at the idea of a game paying homage to it. Sadly, this\
      \ looks similar but it's real time and the combat does not translate at all.\
      \ The combat is fast and frantic, but the controls are meh and the weapon and\
      \ vehicle variety is very limited. The car customization feels a lot like Autoduel,\
      \ but the combat has a very GTA1 feel to it. Unfortunately, unlike GTA1 you\
      \ can't zoom out, so it's hard to drive and gun at the same time since you can't\
      \ see what's ahead. Missions are an interesting idea, but the maps are boring\
      \ and repetitive (as are the arenas). If this were turn based I'd give this\
      \ a 'maybe', but as a car based top down shooter I didn't like this at all.\
      \ It feels like a free flash game more than a finished product."
