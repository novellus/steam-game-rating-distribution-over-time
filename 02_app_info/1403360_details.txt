You take on the mantle of completing a ritual that had been abandoned. Only the first step is clear of this ritual which is to collect all the cars. During this journey of collecting cars on levels you come across horrific entities roaming around trying to prevent you from completing the ritual. You cannot fight back or engage into combat. Best you can do is use your abilities to escape from the entities or calm the Shrimp from gaining too much anxiety. Will you be able to complete the ritual? Are you brave enough to persevere till the end in this forsaken world?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>demo:<\/strong> <\/h2>The demo contains level one, level four, and level seven. Each level offers something different for you to endure. The demo even includes difficulties to choose from, cosmetics to unlock and a few secrets. There are bugs within this demo. The demo is a cloned version of the original project. Cloning the project created weird errors that took weeks for me to fix up. I made specific changes to the demo project that aren’t in the final. To my dismay the contrast\/gamma sliders do not work despite the work arounds I have done. In the OG version this works just fine. Hopefully you’ll enjoy the demo!","about_the_game":"S H R i M P is a third person platformer where you play as a Shrimp set in a world of abstract darkness.
