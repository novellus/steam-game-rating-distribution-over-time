The mechanics of the game are very well planned, especially when farming and fighting wild animals. The 2D theme brings back the nostalgia of the old days! As I said, this game is very well structured and planned, and for 1 Dollar, it is absolutely worth it.","timestamp_created":1567937657,"timestamp_updated":1567937657,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ir+XiO0CfrDv0QE="}
