    review: 'Since i saw a hovercraft in a movie, i thought, wow, what a cool vehicle.
      Drifting with such a thing must be really cool. When i found this game in the
      last sale, i needed to buy it. Full of excitement, i startet one of the three
      stages, called hills. From the screenshots and the trailer i was aware, that
      the game had not the best graphics, and my first impressions were, that the
      game looks ok, nothing special but ok. This level has lots of water and ground,
      some objects, like boats, houses and ramps. Driving around was fun for a few
      minutes, but i noticed, that there are no tasks. I just moved the hovercraft
      around, jumped over a few ramps and got bored very quickly. I can not understand,
      why the developer did not add some racing elements in there like checkpoints.
      It is just mindless, driving around with no aims. But if there are no goals
      in the game, then the driving had to be great fun. But in this category, the
      Hovercraft Drive fails completely. The physics are horrible. You need to check
      this in my videos, especially part 2 and 3, at the end of this review. I was
      able to fly around with my hovercraft and that was just silly. Ok, but maybe
      the other stages brings more fun, i thought. But no, the desert level is only
      a loveless landscape with sand, hills (which all brings you to fly) and two
      pyramids. The ice level is just a boring emptiness with nothing to do in it.
      I am really sad, that the dev did nothing to put any kind of fun into the game.
      All in all, it is just boring and i can not recommend it.
