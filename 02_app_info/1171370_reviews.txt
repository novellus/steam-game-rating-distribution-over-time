Great visual style and great story line. Love the style and the puzzles aren't bad, The game a lot shorter than I wanted. I wanted to keep playing but it was done. I have bought all of Octavi Navarro's games and I've loved them all.  Should buy! Won't be let down.","timestamp_created":1607117235,"timestamp_updated":1607117235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s9zpl/YCc4SstwI="}
