    review: "I don't often give my opinion on a game (and I've played a lot...), but\
      \ I was shocked to see the low number of reviews. This game deserves way more\
      \ recognition.\n\nAfter the first hour of the game, here's how I would have\
      \ summed up the game : a more accessible version of La Mulana, with the same\
      \ kind of humour as The Messenger, but with interesting light-based mechanics.\n\
      \nNow, I have finished the game (99,5%, missing one chest that is nowhere to\
      \ be found) and here's what I have to say :\n\n+ : the music is really good,\
      \ as in \"I will listen to it even after I finish the game\" good.\n+ : the\
      \ art is great but I was hoping we would see more \"highly detailed sprites\"\
      \ as we see at some occasions, they look really good.\n+ : the design of the\
      \ puzzles is on point, nothing too easy, nothing impossible. \n+ : I like this\
      \ kind of humour, it's not often a game makes me laugh but this one made me\
      \ laugh OUT LOUD a few times\n\nAside from that, the movements of the character\
      \ are not often as precise as we'd expect, it can be hard to jump on a platform\
      \ above you if it means going to the side then back again for example. \nI did\
      \ not feel the need to read the papers and notes scattered around the game,\
      \ but I did feel compelled to read all the dialog (but it should be noted that\
      \ following the story is important). \nThe combat system is pretty basic, and\
      \ a few extra attacks would have been welcome.\nThe power ups gained during\
      \ level-ups don't seem to have a lot of impact (I couldn't see any difference\
      \ probably because the enemies' strength would scale up as well).\nSince our\
