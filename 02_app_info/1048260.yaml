    review: "It's not the worst platformer I ever played, but it needs a lot of small\
      \ updates to be an average game. I would much prefer to play this game on a\
      \ controller, at least a partial support would be nice. Some of the actions\
      \ like jump might need a sound effect. Also, you can't jump down through the\
      \ platform which is a bit annoying. I will say that I enjoyed the story cutscenes,\
      \ there are many cute pictures, and the animation in general is not too bad.\
      \ However, all of the 3 worlds in the game look very similar; the stages have\
      \ a metallic landscape with a few changing backgrounds. While you don't get\
      \ any special moves (just a regular jump), the game has 3 different powers-ups\
      \ that will interact with environment. You can find a metal suit that protects\
      \ you from damage, jetpack that allows you to fly, and a plasma cannon for fighting\
      \ enemies. If you collect enough points you can buy a few different upgrades\
      \ like maximum life, power-up duration and ability modifiers. \n\n[h1] Pros:\
      \ [/h1]\n\n+ decent animation & cute story\n+ several upgrades\n+ nice soundtrack\
      \ \n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\n- needs controller support\n- needs more sound effects\n\
      - can't jump down through platforms \n- the stages are kinda repetitive \n-\
      \ could use achievements \n\n[b] Overall Thought: 5/10 [/b]\n\nIt might be okey\
      \ if you don't mind a casual game, it just feels somewhat underdeveloped.\n\n\
      [code]If the game shows some improvements, I will consider removing this review.\
      \ Please contact me if you have updated your game and want a revision.[/code]"
