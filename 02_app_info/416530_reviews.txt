It's like a bunch of different games I played in my formative years all got together for a psychedelic orgy and this is the resultant two-headed crack-baby. (I mean this in a good way, if you'll believe that...)\n\nOut of the gate, there was a weird issue with the screen fading to black, which I fixed fairly easily by changing the game's resolution to my monitor's native one (1920x1080). Once that minor struggle was out of the way, I went on to have a great time playing.\n\nOn the surface, it looks like a simple game--and I do only have 3.5 hours of playtime into it at the time of this writing, with all achievements unlocked. However, when I ponder it further, it seems like the bulk of the thought has gone into designing the environment, rather than coming up with an arbitrary storyline, and progression is left open. This allows you to do lots of creative shit. A couple of my favourites:\n\n- Using \"boost\" midair to achieve a \"rocket thruster\" effect\n- Driving up the sides of buildings\n\nMy intuition tells me that my lack of imagination is the current limit here, and this is merely the tip of the iceberg. It also tells me that I'll probably be coming back to this game from time to time, just to watch airborne economy cars flail about randomly.\n\nSo yeah, long-winded way of saying: well done, Cherry Pie Games! I hope you make more games in the future!","timestamp_created":1584755990,"timestamp_updated":1584756422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1/61/fACfebQ+QE="}
