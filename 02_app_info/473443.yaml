    about_the_game: This scoped device launches a human-shaped balloon, delivered
      via a special bullet. Suggested uses include installing it on a vehicle as a
      decoy, using it to distract the enemy in an area being bombed, etc. Equipped
      with a scope to confirm its efficacy upon discharge. The balloon produces heat,
      makes a slight noise, and projects an overall air of purity and confidence,
      attracting nearby enemies with these human-like traits. After a set time or
      after taking enough damage, the balloon self-destructs so as not to fall into
      enemy hands. It is said that only the pure of heart can use this device properly.

    review: 'I''m writing this mostly to draw attention to the fact this Pack A DLC
      is for the Ranger. The Store page doesn''t really mention it other than imply
      it somewhat through screenshots. I ended up having to buy Pack B too which gives
      the same weapon but for the Air Raider instead.


      The weapon itself like other reviews say is probably the only useful DLC weapon
      as being a utility item it stays useful on higher difficulties. It dies easily
      but can be shot long distance, and attach to any surface.'
