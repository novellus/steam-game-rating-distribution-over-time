Very whimsical and amusing. \nIt should be clearer that this is part one of three, but even so it is a very well written story with great timings. While it does end on a cliffhanger, it does tie up enough threads that it still feels like a complete experience. I look forward to the rest of the series.","timestamp_created":1608923699,"timestamp_updated":1608923699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48+rUzfYCeImSvQI="}
