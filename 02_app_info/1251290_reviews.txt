If someone offers you $20 to play this, tell them \"NO!\" because not only is it a terrible game but it also will cause your computer to suffer severe memory leaks long after you quit and uninstall it.  (Obviously a computer reboot will fix it but why pay any amount of money for crap this bad?)","timestamp_created":1584395732,"timestamp_updated":1585845463,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535464465618133545","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/azwnfECcKXO+AE="}
