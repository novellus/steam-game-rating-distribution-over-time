The art design of the game is definitely the best part about it and you can see that every scene and character has been done with care.\n\nStorywise... a bit confused. You play as a young lady who has forgotten her name, from there it spreads out a bit and you never really come to a full conclusion on anything. It's mostly odd, you meet a lot of people and explore but that's about it. The puzzles are definitely the weakest point of the game. Some of them makes sense but a majority does not.\n\nWith that said, still a good-looking and interesting game with big potential; hopefully the devs makes more games in the future! I recommend this one to fans of the genre, it's definitely worth a playthrough.","timestamp_created":1609084990,"timestamp_updated":1609084990,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547218620777130127","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo4680vYCfYvmvQI="}
