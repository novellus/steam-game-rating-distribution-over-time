However, Whisper of a Machine's premise interested me enough to get it (that and the fact that I wanted a simple game with a nice story). It did not disappoint. What started as a simple detective case eventually unfolded to greater schemes at large. Some of the puzzles needed to continue were really confusing and vague, but being able to solve them feels gratifying. There's also the option of searching up walkthroughs for certain parts that you really can't figure out. \n\nNow for a review of the thematic discussions touched on by the narrative and story. If you want to play the game completely blind, you need not read further. \n\nIn a genre that has an extreme variety of stories, the sci-fi title Whispers of a Machine manages to still find a unique angle with which to explore its themes. The story takes place somewhere in the future, in a post-war, anti-AI world. This in itself was already interesting in that the plot transpires in a setting where AI had once been ubiquitous but is now all but forbidden. Thus, most of the narrative themes revolve around this idea of whether an AI singularity would bring more harm than good to humanity. \n\nThe Conduit is a group introduced in the game of members who zealously wish to bring AI back into the world. More than that, they wish to achieve a singularity and believe that this superintelligence will save the world.\n\nThe game repeatedly likens their ideology to the concept of creating a child that surpasses them, or to create a God that lives on after them. Moreover, it posits the argument that humans that are diametrically opposed to the idea of an AI singularity are simply afraid of that which becomes greater than them. If people were to let go of this fear, the world could potentially improve in unprecedented ways, or it could be disastrous for mankind. It is an unknown venture, but one that some argue to be worth it regardless of what happens. \n\nWhispers of a Machine also touches a bit on the counter-ideology to what could be the cyberculture of the future; when the world becomes overrun with AI, technology, and hedonism arising from complacency, it is likely that traditionalists will rise to meet this change. After all, any sort of change major is bound to be met with strong pushback with ideals of what was perceived as good in the past. \n[i] It was better before [/i] \n\nIn the game this was represented by one of the most traditionalist organizations you can think of: a religious church. An apt contrast to AI zealots. \n\n\nThe story also touches more on themes of observer bias on the perception of reality, the subjectivity of meaning, and self-preservation. \n\nTakes a little of reading in between the lines, but all in all, this is a simple self-contained story that bears some very interesting ideas.","timestamp_created":1609776525,"timestamp_updated":1609835778,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/ZHs6PYCe423wAI="}
