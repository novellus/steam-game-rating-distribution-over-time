    about_the_game: "Electro-Motive\u2019s F40PH line of diesel locomotives represented\
      \ the face of North American passenger railroading for more than a generation.\
      \ Between 1976 and the early 1990s, more than 400 of the highly successful 3,000-\
      \ and 3,200-horsepower diesel locomotives were constructed and served in intercity\
      \ and commuter service, across the continent.<br><br>In 1981, NJ TRANSIT purchased\
      \ 17 EMD F40PHs and a decade-and-a-half later, extended the units\u2019 careers\
      \ through a rebuilding process that included installation of auxiliary Caterpiller\
      \ diesel head-end-power (HEP). Following this rebuilding process, which was\
      \ performed by Conrail at its famed Juniata (Altoona, Pennsylvania) shops, the\
      \ NJ TRANSIT locomotives were classified as F40PH-2CATs and went on to provide\
      \ another decade-and-a-half of capable duty on NJ TRANSIT\u2019s sprawling commuter\
      \ rail system.  <br><br>Throughout their long careers, the stylish F40PH-2CATs\
      \ were regularly employed on NJ TRANSIT\u2019s North Jersey Coast Line, operating\
      \ to and from Hoboken Terminal, as well as powering the \u201Cshuttles\u201D\
      \ between Long Branch and Bay Head, New Jersey. Thus, the veteran F40PH-2CAT\
      \ is an ideal and highly authentic locomotive for service on Train Simulator\u2019\
      s NJCL route.  The NJ TRANSIT F40PH-2CAT includes a range of advanced features\
      \ including NJ TRANSIT\u2019s in-cab signal system and HEP start-up and shutdown.<br><br>The\
      \ F40PH-2CAT is accompanied by NJ TRANSIT\u2019s Comet IV commuter coach and\
      \ a drivable Comet V cab-car for push-pull operations, and comes with three\
      \ career scenario for the North Jersey Coast Line route.<br><br>The locomotive\
      \ is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive the NJ TRANSIT\
      \ F40PH-2CAT on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator. Also included\

    review: It is a very good addon. The only issue that I find is there is no way
      to turn on the push pull service marker lights like you would see on most locomotives.
