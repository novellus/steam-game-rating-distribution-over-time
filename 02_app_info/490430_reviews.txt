I've only played it for 10 minutes and I've probably seen just about everything it has to offer. \n\nStill, for what it is, it is quite well-made. It's bright, it's colorful, the blocks make adorable sounds when they're matched, and if you need something mindless to occupy your hand while you're busy watching something else, it's not a bad option.\n\n[h1]What it is[/h1]\nBasically, it's a Match-3, where you just need to click on any one of a group of three or more same-color blocks to match them. And since it takes place on a cube, every so often it rotates and you'll work on one of the other surfaces. (When it decides to do this appears to be random.) Match enough blocks in a row and you'll enter some sort of bonus... point... thing. \n\n[h1]Recommended?[/h1]\nIt's so small and so short, you'll probably spend more time mulling over whether to try it than it'd take to install and play it two or three times. I daresay this serves a small, but definitive 'positive' in the bundle's overall value.","timestamp_created":1589057513,"timestamp_updated":1589057513,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44qzN/fECf9XahgI="}
