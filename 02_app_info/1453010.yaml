    review: "Like the aesthetic of this game a lot. Has late 2000's flash game vibes\
      \ in the best way. Gameplay can get kind of repetitive though. Might want to\
      \ think of adding a horde mode where you defeat waves of enemies with increasing\
      \ difficulty. Music choice is really good as well. I like Alex Lisi's stuff\
      \ a lot. Might want to add some sort of feedback when receiving damage so the\
      \ player knows when their health is getting low. Felt like my runs ended abruptly\
      \ a lot when I wasn't paying attention to the health bar and focusing on enemies.\
      \ Just adding a simple pulse or faint red screen filter would do, or both. Would\
      \ also love if enemies dropped weapons on occasion. Maybe also add an auto-pickup\
      \ toggle option for weapons. \n\nOverall, very solid 2D shooter. Look forward\
      \ to full release and climbing the leaderboard. Number 5 right now :)"
