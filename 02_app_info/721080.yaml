    about_the_game: "Bounce Ball is a physics based puzzle game. The objective is\
      \ to get the Ball through the finish opening. The finish is usually not that\
      \ easy to get to, so you have to place blocks with angled faces to deflect your\
      \ Ball. When your Ball impacts the face of a Block, it will ricochet at an angle.\
      \ You can use this to your advantage to help guide the Ball through the level.\
      \ To make it more challenging, the color of the Ball must match the color of\
      \ the level when you pass through the finish. The Ball will always start in\
      \ white color, to change its color you must collect color orbs that are present\
      \ on each level. The color orbs come in three primary colors of Red, Blue, and\
      \ Yellow. When your white Ball collects a primary color, it will become that\
      \ color. If your ball is already of a primary color, and picks up another primary\
      \ color, it will mix to form a secondary color. You must be careful to collect\
      \ only the color orbs that you need, otherwise the color of the Ball won't be\
      \ correct.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are 40 challenging missions and a tutorial\
      \ that introduces you to the game mechanics and controls. There are two difficulties;\
      \ easy and hard. On hard difficulty you have a bounce limit, you must beat the\
      \ levels within the allowable number of bounces."
