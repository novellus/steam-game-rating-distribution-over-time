It's actually... fun.  I like finding the right places to stick puzzle pieces into.  There are different images, coupled with a theme and even music/SFX to give you something else to enjoy.  Puzzles are not just all the same and the time limit is more than fair for a challenge.  There is a hint button, which recharges or you can pay for it to hurry up and also if you need extra +30 Seconds?  You get that as well... but only once.\n\nSo is the game perfect?  Is anything ever is?  The game... Let's just say you CAN'T play the last level.  At all.  I got stuck on my \"Magician\" title for 300 out of 200.  So no last level... Unless you grind nearly 200K coins.  So it is doable, but if you tried hard to earn three keys per level, the title should be just given to you.  Oh and at times... One of the keys disappeared and it says you made a mistake, even though you never did.  That error is especially big around level 98... But after a few tries, you can actually get it complete.\n\nShould you play it?  Well, why not?  I got 11+ Hours out of it, even though I never saw the last few levels.  That's still pretty good!  So if ya like it, you can try it... Your choice.\n\nThank you for the fun puzzle game!  Hopefully one day the title for \"Magister\" bug will be fixed and I can come back and finish the game.  Thank you! :) :> =)","timestamp_created":1608362576,"timestamp_updated":1608362576,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiKn4vPYCfMOvuwI="}
