    reviews: "\u201CShadow Ops begins roughly three-quarters of the way through the\
      \ story and then works its way backwards after letting you witness a truly horrific\
      \ moment. The story itself is pretty much standard Hollywood fluff, so expect\
      \ betrayals and some stiff banter in the cut-scenes. Shadow Ops makes use of\
      \ standard first-person shooting techniques, but offers a very helpful lean\
      \ function that actually is something other developers should rip off. Yes,\
      \ lean has been used before, but it's very effective and even vital in ShOps.\u201D\
      <br>7/10 \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/09/22/shadow-ops-red-mercury-review?page=3\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >IGN</a><br><br>\u201CGeneral movement\
      \ is easy enough, and thankfully the standard control layout you would expect\
      \ in a first person shooter is here. The action is fast paced, and you will\
      \ have to keep on your heels to succeed in completing the missions, so a simplified\
      \ control scheme is a godsend.\u201D<br>7/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamershell.com/pc/shadow_ops_red_mercury/review.html\"\

      re looking for a decent shooter you\u2019ve come to the right place. All of\
      \ the sounds are superb and the audio separation comes through very clearly.\
      \ To complement the gunfire and chaos is a heart thumping soundtrack that helps\
      \ convey the situation. It goes for a sort of middle eastern chant that was\
      \ prevalent all throughout movies like Black Hawk Down and Gladiator and it\
      \ works really well here.\u201D<br>6.4/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamingnexus.com/Article/Shadow-Ops-Red-Mercury/Item577.aspx\"\

    review: "\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 Good!\n\n[h1]Action[/h1]\n\nIn the gaming\
      \ world where first person shooter are in abundance, many people give a game\
      \ a bad review because of just a few flaws. This can be the difference of it's\
      \ success or failure.\n\nShadow Ops: Red Mercury is your basic FPS where you\
      \ must stop a backpack nuke from getting in the wrong hands and being used.\
      \ You meet with fierce aggression and many perhaps too many enemies that pop\
      \ out of nowhere at times. But this games cinematic feels keeps you immersed\
      \ in the action ducking to find cover and figure out where the hostiles are.\n\
      \nYou team does a good job of helping take out some of the enemies, but you\
      \ feel outnumbered most of times. Your firefights are immense with exploding\
      \ drums and grenades making it feel your in the middle of a real mission. The\
      \ aiming cursor feels very tight making it easy to aim in on targets. This is\
      \ not Call of Duty, but the action is intense. With details such as breakable\
      \ and movable objects thrown in the game comes alive with action.\n\nWith all\
      \ these postives there is one major drawback which is no quick saves along the\
      \ way. [b][u]So if you die during a mission you must start that level over from\
      \ the beginning.[/u][/b] This can get frustrating, but makes you proceed with\
      \ caution next time which brings me to another negative point: the enemies spawn\
      \ in exact same areas, so its not hard to know whats coming and from where next\
      \ time you play the level. There are no blood or gore, but a pretty immersive\
      \ shooter that will entertain the expirienced player for hours.\n\nAll in all\
      \ this making Shadow Ops: Red Mercury a very solid purchase."
