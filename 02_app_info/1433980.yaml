    review: '[code]

      Game features:

      - A lot of challenging levels

      - Beautiful 3d graphics

      - Great soundtrack

      [/code]

      - don''t know about that: currently level 9

      - nope, just ''okay''. Rather sub-par for Unity asset games.

      - if you have no taste in music? Also only one song, afaik.


      Levels so far, DO feel challenging (to me), especially on your first try, when
      you cannot see the all sides of the field after you start, or where you have
      to get to. But, that might be just ''me'', being dumb=bad.


      Pro Tip: Turn off the sound?! I was already willing to give this game a thumbs
      down, just because of the 1. music (you hear the same utterly annoying song
      opening again and again and 2. Coin drops (everytime you finish a level, you
      are ''rewarded'' coins: ''pling pling pling''). What do you do with those coins?
      On PC: nothing.


      This looks and feels like an App-Store ... app. There is no menu or settings
      UI. You quit via "alt+F4" (you turn off the sound via Windows volume control).


      Aside from that, it''s okay, for the brain-exercise.'
