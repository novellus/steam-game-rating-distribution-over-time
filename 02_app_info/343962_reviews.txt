For starters it malfunctions all the time and often I can't even start the engine of the plane or helicopter. In addition the woman's voice for the dispatch sounds like a Kindergarden  teacher reading a story to her class instead of a real life dispatcher.  It's obvious the people who designed this game never even thought about listening to recordings of real life emergency dispatch operators. Save your money. There's non way in Hell the ratings for this game are accurate .","timestamp_created":1590120644,"timestamp_updated":1590120644,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2u+knfICdcy3iQI="}
