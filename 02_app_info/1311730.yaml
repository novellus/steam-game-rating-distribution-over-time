    short_description: The game uses the experience of a cube to enter an unknown
      space and escape to illustrate the relationship between matter and consciousness.
      When the consciousness is stronger, it can break through the bondage of material
      and become a God.

    review: 'This game is a weird physics-based puzzle shooter wherein you assume
      control of a die that has different bullet patterns depending on which side
      it''s landed on. However there''s limited ammo (severely) and instead of having
      a function to roll yourself there are pillars that set you to a specific value
      (though you can roll if you fall off of something).


      This game is not very good. However, if you want to get ideas for making your
      own game, being inspired by how you could probably make something better than
      this yourself is good.


      I jokingly nominated this game for ''best story'' because Steam wanted me to
      nominate something but I haven''t played a game with an amazing story in ages.'
