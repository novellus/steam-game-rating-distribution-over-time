      \nstory background<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVlog author Xiao Li is an urban white-collar\
      \ worker engaged in financial work. He usually likes to collect various video\
      \ materials, often visiting unfinished construction sites, abandoned hospitals,\
      \ unknown caves, etc. in the middle of the night. His &quot;Zishan Huomu Vlog&quot;\
      \ has more than 200,000 fans. This also makes him more and more obsessed. From\
      \ the beginning, I occasionally explored some urban \u201Cforbidden places\u201D\
      \ and went to the middle of the night to shoot some strange places.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nHis friend said that he often talks to himself and recites words that\
      \ others can't understand. Recently, there are strange moves. The most serious\
      \ one almost dug his eyes with his own hands. Friends who used to be together\
      \ often gradually stopped contacting. Xiao Li also rented from others to rent\
      \ an apartment on his own, rarely dealing with people. During the day, the company\u2019\
      s people saw him as a black-eyed look.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nIn the winter of 2018, Xiao Li mysteriously disappeared. According to his\
      \ friend, the last time he contacted him was to go to the abandoned haunted\
      \ construction site that night. After 48 hours, the unit reported that the person\
      \ was missing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat day the police came\
      \ to his one-bedroom apartment rented in Financial Street. The small room about\
      \ 20 square meters was very messy. The wall was covered with large-format white\
      \ paper. The paper was filled with strange symbols with red paint. The investigating\
      \ police officers were also shocked at first, and the on-site investigation\
      \ report once described everything that was seen as \u201Cthis is a neuropathy\u201D\
      . The bed was full of strange books, some were torn and shattered, and some\
      \ pages were obviously pressed for long periods of time when reading, and the\
      \ paper had been squashed. There is no other clue in the entire apartment except\
      \ for the &quot;neuropathy&quot; expressed by the police.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\n<br />\r\nA week later, Xiao Li still had no news, and the police\
      \ could only file a case for investigation until he found a person or a body.\
      \ On this day, the landlord came to collect the house and cleaned up the &quot;garbage&quot;\
      \ left by Xiao Li.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe landlord is a\
      \ girl, the house is left to her by her father. She usually works in the north,\
      \ and the house is rented to Xiao Li. On this day, the girl went to work and\
      \ then cleaned up the room. It was already 11 o'clock in the evening. When the\
      \ girl finished the room and was about to leave, she suddenly felt that everything\
      \ in front of her eyes was exceptionally bright. The wooden tables and chairs\
      \ were all swaying. All the light was as dazzling as the sun. After about 3\
      \ seconds, everything returned to normal. The girl felt that it must be I was\
      \ too tired to go to work during the day, and worked overtime until late, locked\
      \ the door and went home. At this moment, the girl habitually looked back into\
      \ the house. The strange thing made the girl return to God for a long time,\
      \ just in that On the desk commonly used by Xiao Li, there is a diary. The girl\

      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCuriosity prompted the girl to sit at\
