I have to grip hard in order to pick up and hold a weapon and it hurts my hand after a while. I also don't really like the reloading mechanics they seem a little easy but other then that this is a good thought out game and I would recommend.","timestamp_created":1609895114,"timestamp_updated":1609895114,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0b7O6vYCfKzvwAI="}
