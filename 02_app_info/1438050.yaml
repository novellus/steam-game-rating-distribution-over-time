    review: 'This scenario had a few nice/tense moments, but overall I think it''s
      not very well balanced, China/Sudan didn''t pose any serious air threat for
      most of the time. With almost 1,5d still to go I reached Triumph score already
      but the scenario dragged on with zero enemy activity for the rest of the game
      and I just finished it using maximum playing speed for most of the remaining
      time (waiting for something to happen, or for scenario conlusion), did a few
      extra inland strikes once my aircraft were rearmed every few hours (lost a few
      aircraft along the way due to SAMs, but that didn''t affect Triumph score at
      that point).

      If steam allowed more granular scores I''d give it 5/10. I''m recommending it
      on a basis that 1 - it had a few twists that kept me on my toes for a while,
      2 - it''s cheap, I love CMO and LIVE and want to support the devs;  overall
      this scenario was too easy and too long.'
