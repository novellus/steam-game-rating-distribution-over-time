However, after reaching about ~5000 points, the game starts slowly grinding down to a halt, and becomes very unresponsive and borderline unplayable after 15000 points. There is also no way to save a game, and upon rebooting the game, it is reset.\n\nThis poor design unfortunately turns a simple, fun puzzle game slowly into a lethargic, frustrating experience, every time. Quite a shame really. Caveat emptor.","timestamp_created":1580111606,"timestamp_updated":1580111812,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553191483020782471","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2pqA8+8CdoC17gE="}
