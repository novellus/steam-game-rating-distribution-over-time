      \  The Cat Banny! It means a lot to us.\n\nI am glad you took the time to play\
      \ all the levels and give us such detailed explanations of your point of view.\n\
      \nWe are a small indie studio starting in game development.\n\nWe\u2019re sorry\
      \ that the gaming experience didn\u2019t meet your expectations, we\u2019ll\
      \ work to improve it, thanks for the feedback.\n\n"

    review: "This game's protagonist looks like BnL took a different design and turned\
      \ Wall-E into a Cat bot... \n\nThe whole game is pretty boring all the way to\
      \ the end, it's just easy and repetitive tasks of getting the box and put it\
      \ on the lever..\n\nAfter Lv10 the game finally changes and you get invisible\
      \ floor as a new mechanism, but not much a challenge, after Lv15 you get a very\
      \ badly coded enemy that fail your stage as soon as you are caught... Should've\
      \ been interesting if the AI isn't so bad and mindless that you, the player,\
      \ have to guide the enemy out of your way before you can continue...\n\nThe\
      \ mysterious style music and the cute look design of the game doesn't match\
      \ at all, very bad combination. And there's only ONE combined music track that\
      \ plays on a loop throughout the whole game.\nIf the dev at least use some cute\
      \ and light spirited background music to match the look, this game might be\
      \ more bearable... \n\nAnd being unable to change control mapping makes it worse...\
      \ the whole game is near torture of boredom while struggling with the controls.\
      \ Not recommended."
