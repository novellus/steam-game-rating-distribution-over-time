    review: I had a bit more fun with this chapter. There was more time to develop
      the story, more cutscenes and a slightly longer game in general. I didn't like
      the final puzzle (I just don't like that type of puzzle), but I'm sure there
      are hardcore og adventure game fans out there who loved it. The final shot of
      the game was a bit underwhelming for all the buildup. I am def playing the final
      chapter, though. There are a couple plot threads I feel really invested in.
      I hope they pay off.
