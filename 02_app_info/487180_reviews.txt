The writing is amateurish and reads like a student project rather than a polished, professional work. There is really only one true path through the story; all of the other routes lead quickly to disaster and death within a few pages. Even the true path can be completed in 15 minutes or less if you make the right choices. The only way I could possibly recommend this is if you want some really easy achievements, and even then you should not pay more than 50 cents for it. If you want to play a game book, any of the ones produced by Tin Man Games would be a far better choice.","timestamp_created":1606510172,"timestamp_updated":1606510172,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9vrdhfYCdI/2swI="}
