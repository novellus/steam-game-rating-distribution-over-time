    review: Ok the focus in the name of the expansion is "Battle Rally", and the battle
      rally intense and cool and all, but there are really two gamnes in this expansion,
      "Battle Rally" and "Bailu Chan Hunt". The hunt game is basically just like hunting
      for the chobu-chans in Niaowu. I NEED more of hunting for Bailu Chan.  I will
      buy more of these if they release them.
