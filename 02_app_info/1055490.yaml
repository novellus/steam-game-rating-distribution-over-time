      notes: "The game displays regular use of marijuana, smoking and selling marijuana\
        \ which is considered a drug.\r\nThe player can roll a joint and smoke it,\
        \ this changes the way the game looks depending on the type of marijuana used\
        \ imitating real-world drug use."

    review: "Note: Saves are a thing now, I saw reviews saying they don't exist but\
      \ indeed, they do. \n\nI am embarrassed to admit that I put 10 hours into this\
      \ game on the day I downloaded it, but it was more of a mental test to see how\
      \ long I could last the repetitive clicking. LOL the only way to make real money\
      \ in this game right now is by rolling joints, which seems fun and fine when\
      \ you're buying low-price items. You want a tractor? That's going to be 1,000\
      \ times you're placing bud, tobacco, and papers into their boxes, then 200 more\
      \ clicks to make the joint roll itself. After, you'll have to click each individual\
      \ joint into the selling page, and you're capped at 30 items. Want to buy more\
      \ papers? My bug says that's not possible without saving and quitting the game,\
      \ then reopneing it and trying again. In my 10 hours playing, I had to do this\
      \ about every half hour. Maaaybe they didn't expect someone to play longer than\
      \ 30 minutes.. lol \nThis game is fun, there's interesting electrical equipment\
      \ that is fun to use, cool decorations, a vast open space to grow in, pretty\
      \ visuals, but it's painstakingly hard to play again because the game has turned\
      \ from growing the weed, to rolling it for hours to get money. To be fair, I\
      \ bought a tractor and irrigation attachment, some lights and heaters, but I\
      \ can't go on like this. Please for the love of god, update this with a joint\
      \ rolling machine that I can buy from the store, and I'll be back here playing\
      \ again. I'm not returning it cause I can't wait for the updates! There's going\
      \ to be Multiplayer later on, per the Discord, and it sounds like the devs are\
      \ understaffed/ there's a lot still to do, but I can't wait to see what this\
      \ game becomes!! \n\nI would recommend buying it for a very casual game that\
      \ will bring you novelty enjoyment (for right now), and I would say buy it now\
      \ before it gets more expensive (after all the updates, probably, idk)!!  This\
      \ game will be fantastical and unique once it's later on in its life. Keep in\
      \ mind this is EARLY ACCESS, so your patronage is helping develop the game,\
      \ and it's clearly stated it's not finished."
