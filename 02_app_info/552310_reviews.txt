You must navigate your way through a labyrinth of hallways which you can barely see, while a monster is chasing you. If you pause for even a split second, the monster will catch and kill you. If you don't take exactly the right path (which you have to memorize by trial and error), the monster will get you. There are rumors that the game is pretty good once you get past this first phase, but after 12-15 attempts, I still can't vouch for that.","timestamp_created":1493126358,"timestamp_updated":1493126358,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513157904148101807","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv4TR0tsCe4XPdw=="}
