Some very, very cool tracks, and some a bit more in-one-ear-and-out-the-other-ish.\n\n   It's a heck of a lot of tracks for the price, though, so I'd happily recommend it to anyone who enjoys a bit of lo-fi, synthy instrumental goodness that spans a whopping variety of moods (including Zappa-esque freak-outs, heartfelt laments, and a smattering of metallic riffage for the cranium-bangers out there). Even [i]better[/i] value, suffice it to say, at a decent sale price.\n\nVerdict: 8/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/​\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210​\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1551942866,"timestamp_updated":1551944605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570722222328186035","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41OvGq+kCftK8vAE="}
