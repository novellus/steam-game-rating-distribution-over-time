It really lacks the polish of other entries in the series (especially the later Assault Squad games but even the original Men of War was a vastly better product). There are a number of bugs in almost every mission, many of which are not actually very difficult fixes within the GEM editor. For instance in some missions the devs have allowed you to control soldiers that aren't actually supposed to be assigned to you, so they are invincible and also cannot kill anyone... rather frustrating.\n\nIn terms of the content, the missions are all very much the same. You have to clear rows of enemy defences with a small number of troops and then defend against a counterattack. If I'm honest the bonus missions were not even really that fun compared to other entries in the series. It's a time sink, but not necessarily a good one.\n\nMy genuine recommendation would be to buy either Men of War, Assault Squad 1 or 2, Vietnam or even Red Tide as they are usually the same sort of price but are just much more polished products. It's a shame really that they didn't release any patches to fix the game because I imagine with a little bit more it could've been way more enjoyable.","timestamp_created":1610056090,"timestamp_updated":1610056090,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmci07/YCeqqxwQI="}
