    review: "First off I would like to say: Massive thumbs up for providing a demo\
      \ for the game this is something that doesn\u2019t happen much anymore and really\
      \ needs too. \nTL;DR could be a good game with more development, seems very\
      \ rushed and half baked. \nPros:  \tThe ships AI is very comical \n \t\nCons:\t\
      Poor Inventory management:  there is no sorting or anything of the sort you\
      \ have zero control over anything in your inventory outside of being able to\
      \ move it from one side to the other. This makes it very hard and time consuming\
      \ to find things. \n\tGeneral lack of mouse control in the UI:  You basically\
      \ right clicking to open something then using the scroll wheel to find what\
      \ you\u2019re after and clicking either right of left click to get it. No reason\
      \ here why a pointer couldn\u2019t have been used other than being lazy. \n\t\
      UI is lacking key information:  such as Food, Water, Oxygen, and poison levels\
      \ displayed instead they post these thing down in a chat box. If not a fan of\
      \ this could have been easily and clearly posted in the top of the screen.\n\
      \tUI is hard to see due to its color matching most of the textures: I didn\u2019\
      t look to see if there was any way to change this or not but the UI is insanely\
      \ hard to see at times. The text is very small and the color of the text placed\
      \ on the back ground environment makes it very, very hard to read at time. \n\
      \tVery redundant game play: Ever room looks the same and you basically get the\
      \ same items from each room, with little to no verity at all. \n\tThe rate at\
      \ which you loss Hunger and thirst is insane. I don\u2019t know what it is with\
      \ survival games thinking you should starve in 15 mins and die of thirst in\
      \ 10. Only game I have played that has even come close to getting it right is\
      \ \u201CThe Long Dark\u201D and even then I used chat engine to go in and change\
      \ some of the values.\n\tFOV no field of view slider = fail.\n\tI really wanted\
      \ to like this game the idea behind it really intrigued me. I love a good problem\
      \ solving game. I have played through Myst and its sequels back in the day as\
      \ well as currently in Obduction(Cyans newest Myst like game) I have played\
      \ many critical thinking games over the years but I just couldn\u2019t get past\
      \ the UI and the Inventory and everything looking the same in this game. \n"
