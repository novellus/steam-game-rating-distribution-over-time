The cyberpunk theme is great and the well-written story really brings the world to life.  There are plenty of different deck types that can be designed from the good variety of cards.  Earning credits and using them to buy new cards to strengthen your deck is very satisfying and it is pretty cool adding cards of the characters you meet as well.  I did occasionally have an annoying issue where the battle would get stuck, but overall it was a very enjoyable experience.","timestamp_created":1608814613,"timestamp_updated":1608814613,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.507698535919189453","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oNq0yvYCf+jhvAI="}
