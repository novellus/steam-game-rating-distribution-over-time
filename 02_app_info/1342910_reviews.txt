It takes place in the same world as [i]Asher[/i] and [i]Tell a Demon[/i], and players who love these games have absolutely nothing to lose by giving it a go: in fact, the events of [i]Winter's Trumpet[/i] take place before those depicted in [i]Asher[/i], and the former gives us an interesting look at the motivations of several key characters of the series. For people who haven't played the dev's other games, beginning with [i]Winter's Trumpet[/i] isn't the best way to go, in my opinion, since it's short and the story is a bit vague if you're not already aware of what the main plotlines are.\nApart from the writing, which is excellent as expected from Sun Labyrinth, I really enjoyed the character portraits and the soundtrack, which has some great moments: I would definitely buy it if the developer released it separately.","timestamp_created":1606844979,"timestamp_updated":1606844979,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.567967891693115234","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ485Lbj/YCdfjFtgI="}
