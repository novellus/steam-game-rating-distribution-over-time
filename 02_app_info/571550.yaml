    review: 'Hawks Tactical is not a typical RPG Maker game. It is more a tactical
      strategy game. Battles are played on a map full of enemies, where each turn,
      each of your units may move, attack, and use one or two skills, the goal being
      to wipe out all the opponent''s units. The game lasts about seven hours total.


      There is a storyline, but beyond the initial premise, it mostly serves to lead
      in to the next battle. There are decisions to be made at some points, which
      lead the story along multiple paths, with multiple endings possible, but these
      are few in number.


      There is very little exploration, and the tactical battles are the primary focus.
      These battles can last anywhere from ten minutes to an hour. They may look difficult,
      but if you know what you''re doing at all, they are easy to beat.


      Battles provide you with money, which can be spent in stores to buy weapons,
      armour, and skill enhancements. These stores, however, appear at unpredictable
      points in the game, and may not be there when needed. Occasional treasure chests
      provide items which are useless, as far as I could tell.


      Overall, this game is best recommended to those who enjoy the tactical strategy
      gameplay. The story is fine, but if you don''t like the battles, it will become
      tedious very quickly.'
