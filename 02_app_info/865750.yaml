      Thank you for your review and your suggestion! I will definitely try to improve

      WHY I RECOMMEND IT


      Great RPG with a very entertaining and modern class system. The most notable
      feature of the game is its class system that makes each character unique and
      very versatile. Each character has five unique classes for each one, that is,
      there are a total of twenty classes, and each class has unique abilities that
      make you have a wide variety of play styles at all times. Also the classes level
      up with the character, and you get all the classes almost at the beginning of
      the game, so you don''t need to grind like crazy because you want to play with
      a class but it has very little level, nor do you have to wait until more than
      half of the game to unlock a certain class, everything is in your power of decision
      and how you want to play from the beginning. You can change classes at any time
      outside of battle. There is also an option, in case the game is very difficult
      or very easy, to adjust the level of difficulty that can be modified at any
      time.


      WHAT WOULD IMPROVE


      Random encounters with visible monsters. Improve the English translation.'
