    about_the_game: On Ludus, ancient terror beasts and humans somehow coexist in
      perfect harmony. Yet once every few hundred years or so, a predictably unpredictable
      astrological phenomenon occurs wherein some angry people from the sky arrive
      from their dimension, &quot;Terra&quot;. Whenever they arrive, a fleet of floating
      islands are brought along and make up the battlefields where the humans and
      the beasts battle for the amusement of the angry Skygods.<br><br>Welcome to
      Monstro. A <strong>fully deterministic logic game</strong> which plays like
      a tactical RPG but without RP, character growth or randomness. Fight the opposing
      army on the battlefield, which just so happens to be made up of conveniently
      perfect squares. Survive the onslaught and strike back to be the last one standing.
      Or, occasionally, do something else the evil Skygods want to be done for their
      own amusement.<br><br>This game takes the traditional tRPG gameplay and reconstructs
      it into a completely deterministic, logical experience with a twist of tactics.
      All of this is spiced up with ridiculous, tongue-in-cheek lore and approachable
      difficulty.<br><br>List of features:<br> - A puzzle game with completely deterministic
      and repeatable set of rules which still feels like playing a tRPG.<br> - And
      even though it plays like a tRPG there are no RPG elements, so it feels more
      like a t.<br> - A tongue-in-cheek plot, much better than the previous bullet
      point!<br> - No need to tediously repeat the same sequence of moves over and
      over if you lose, because undo is here! Undo a single move, undo all moves back
      to the beginning of the mission, undo if you fail the mission and even undo
      if you are victorious!<br> - Learn the rules of the enemy AI and use them for

      All of this is spiced up with ridiculous, tongue-in-cheek lore and approachable

    review: "First things first: This is not a clasic turn-based rpg, let's just get\
      \ that clear (I have no idea what that other review is talking about). This\
      \ is styled very much like those games but there is no character progression,\
      \ no army/party building, no skills, etc. TBS game maybe, rpg definitely not.\
      \ \n\nThis is really a puzzle game using some mechanics from tactics style games.\
      \ Think of it like playing challenge mode in chess games. There is a board setup\
      \ and you basically have to figure out a strategy to solve it. \n\nGeneral graphics/audio:\
      \ Very barebones, you basically get to toggle fullscreen, lighting & shadows\
      \ (I have no idea why in the hell anybody would turn off lighting and shadows\
      \ unless they were trying to run this on a rig from 20 years ago), music and\
      \ sfx. The game is locked to 60fps but I'm not even sure 60 is necessary considering\
      \ what is happening. \n\nStory: Somewhat amusing story which I did not expect\
      \ at all. I don't mean an actual plot because there is barely a story, there\
      \ aren't really characters and stuff but the overarching narrative basically\
      \ makes fun of tactics style games. Every couple of centuries sky-people who\
      \ aren't really sky people go into a world where everybody is getting along\
      \ and just makes them all fight on these square floating islands for their amusement.\
      \ It's accompanied with little bits of text at the start of every level that\
      \ are somewhat amusing. \n\nGameplay: Very straightforward tactics-style mechanics\
      \ thrown into a puzzle. Units move on a grid, they have basic stats and attack\
      \ stuff, enemies have movement preferences and if you mouse over them it shows\
      \ exactly where the enemy will go. Some boards have a very specific way to beat\
      \ and is basically trial and error. Most of the time a wrong move will ruin\
      \ everything and you gotta restart or hit the turn back button. One mechanic\
      \ I'd definitely recommend turning off is the one where when enemies attack\
      \ your units it pauses the game and you have to click for the attack to go through.\
      \ Since you can't press the turn back button this serves no real purpose, units\
      \ move  quickly and there's no actual need to see when the enemy attacks, if\
      \ it does and you didn't know it was coming odds are you f*cked up. \n\nMy main\
      \ complaint would be the weird difficulty curve(?). With most puzzle games you\
      \ expect it to start easy and then slowly and consistently ramp up until it\
      \ is ridiculously hard. With Monstro the difficulty goes up and down, every\
      \ once in a while you hit a hard level but in between them are levels that are\
      \ not only much easier but also don't require a specific way to solve (a lot\
      \ of the easier ones just require you to gather your guys up and wait for the\
      \ enemy to walk in and get slaughtered). \n\nOverall: Would recommend as a casual\
      \ strategy/puzzle game. If you are looking for a new Tactics Ogre/Final Fantasy\
      \ Tactics then this is definitely not for you unfortunately. There is decent\
      \ enough value for the money, The first Human wing took me about an hour and\
      \ there is a monster wing and a ++ wing for both races."
