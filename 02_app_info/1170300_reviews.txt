The style and visuals are great, hitboxes are where they should be, and the difficulty scaling is appropriate, although I can see the first few levels being really annoying; I hope there's a Glitch to skip the first 10 levels or increase difficulty from the start. The beginning ramp-up in these games is what gets me and others to lose interest.","timestamp_created":1609605600,"timestamp_updated":1609605600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51776653528213501","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsIr+4fYCd83jvwI="}
