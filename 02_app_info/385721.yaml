    review: This game remains very faithful to the spirit of the original King's Quest
      series, but takes it in an entirely different direction. If you're looking for
      a 1:1 remake of the original series, then this game isn't for you. However,
      if you want to play an excellent adventure game based on the characters of the
      original, then I highly recommend this game. The developers have managed to
      make an excellent retelling of the original King's Quest. This game does a great
      job at adding to the series as a whole.
