    review: As of today, me and my friends played this DLC on several computers (mines
      being tired old laptops) and we did not experience any bugs which all the comments
      are about. Since they are all from 2018-2019, I guess it has been fixed. It
      is enjoyable, an original concept of planning rails beforehand. I think it is
      now totally safe to go for that DLC.
