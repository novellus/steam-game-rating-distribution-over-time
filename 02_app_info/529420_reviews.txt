In each level, you must traverse a map from the front to the back, which is full of mines, and like the original, you will hit a mine if you are wrong. There are a number of powerups to buy before your trip or collect on your way.\n\nIn campaign mode, you have a limited number of lives, but more can be earned by playing the other modes to earn money. \n\n\nCons: \n\nReplaying a campaign level does not earn you money, so you can't upgrade your 'star' performance.\n\nThere is no save button, which means that during survival mode, a game lasting several hours will have to be trashed simply because you can't play any longer. \n","timestamp_created":1492206116,"timestamp_updated":1492206116,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545094907283782959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwysuat9sCeIvndg=="}
