[i]Christmas[/i] and Halloween versions were originally DLCs of the original. Unlike [i]Halloween[/i] version, [i]Christmas[/i] version changes the gameplay in various ways.\n\nAt the core, all are very similar: Vasja is a kid who runs up the rain gutter of houses to wreck their windows and inhabitants with projectiles. Appropriately for the theme, this time it's snowballs. After a certain score, a huge creepy boss appears and needs to be shot down to complete the level.\n\nThere are 5 levels, each of which introduces new enemies that only differ in appearance and damage their projectiles do - otherwise, each enemy works similarly, throwing a single object down the building at Vasja. Vasja has to both dodge these objects (to avoid getting damage) and the obstacles on his way, as hitting them even once is an insta-death. Some power-ups, like infinite fast ammo and kill-all rockets help on the way.\n\n[h1]Twist of Christmas: What's different other than visuals?[/h1]\n\n[i]Christmas[/i] version is thankfully different from the other two games.\n\nFirst, it introduces another task for Vasja: You also have to deliver gifts to windows to save Christmas from the evil monsters who are there to ruin it. This introduces 'spacebar' as another key. You lose if you don't deliver for a set amount of time, and the boss appears after a number of presents instead of just score.\n\nSecond, windows are no longer shields nor do they need to be broken. This way, it is easier to hit the enemies as you no longer need to hit the window first nor aim below it. Neat change for a more casual game.\n\nThird, the bosses are re-designed. They tend to shoot big projectiles instead of lots of small ones, and particularly the end boss has a new attack pattern. Also, they have only one hit location but regenerate health. Personally I'm just glad it was different to the other two games.\n\n[h1]Mouse controls (+ spacebar)[/h1]\n\nVasja is controlled mostly with mouse. Cursor and mouse is used to shoot the slingshot and also control, on which side of the gutter he's running up. Keep in mind that there are no gamepad or other control options available. As such, in my opinion these controls work just fine.\n\nAdditionally, spacebar is used to throw presents at windows. This uses some sort of 2D physics, and e.g. cats (a minor enemy type) and obstacles like balconies block them, potentially ruining a nice delivery.\n\nIt takes a bit to get used to everything that's happening on the screen as well as aiming the gifts. Particularly, Vasja's vertical throws are very powerful but oddly rather weak horizontally.\n\nSwitching sides of the gutter is instantaneous but learning to dodge both the projectiles and the obstacles takes some time. After a while it becomes quite intuitive, although sometimes there are unavoidable attacks.\n\n[h1]Technically dated[/h1]\n\nFor a game from 2017 (based on 2016 game), it is perhaps surprising that [i]Hooligan Vasja: Christmas[/i] runs only in windowed mode or in low resolution in fullscreen. In fullscreen mode, there are input-less regions in the sidebars, in a widescreen monitor anyway.\n\nI played in fullscreen because I'd imagine that clicking outside the window could spell death, it is fast-paced enough for that to happen.\n\nAt least the merry music and sound can be muted from within game, and adjusted separately.\n\n[h1]Time for festivities[/h1]\n\n[i]Christmas[/i] version made [i]Hooligan Vasja[/i] feel fresh again. The addition of the gift mini-task, as well as the other tinier changes, make the game just as challenging as the first game, even though I already played it.\n\nWhile I had already well versed through the first game, I still spent 3.5 hours in the game before managing to beat the end boss.\n\nIf you enjoyed the first game, I think you'd enjoy this one as well.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9997062/]~Twistorian Curator~[/url]","timestamp_created":1608520127,"timestamp_updated":1608521156,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.572033584117889404","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2qDVwfYCc7/tuwI="}
