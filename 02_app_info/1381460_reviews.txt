The combat and skill systems have depth, and fun realtime arcade elements in some cases that keep you on your toes. Resources are plentiful for thorough explorers.\n\nThe real challenge is the puzzles. Kazuki Takamura is a clever designer when it comes to these. There are many types of puzzle, and the difficulty level is a nice balance between frustration and satisfaction.\n\nWhat kept me going most, though, was the story. Through a combination of current events and meaningful flashbacks, you experience the story of loyal retainer Saiyato and Princess Machia, and the forces of darkness and light at work in Delma across time.\n\nThis bittersweet story is also adorned with original art in Kazuki's unique style, and some original music from Naoki Takamura that fits it's feeling perfectly.","timestamp_created":1608093316,"timestamp_updated":1608103118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563758373260498047","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwy8iatfYCcb/OugI="}
