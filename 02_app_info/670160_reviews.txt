I have absolutely no idea what i am supposed to be doing, i haven't even figured out what the blue rings on the cursor are for yet, they don't seem to do anything. I almost wish this was one of those garbage games where you can just stand there and get the achievements because i don't really want to play it. I don't mind pixel games, but this makes Mario look like 4K .... or at least 720p. \nIt seems to be a good game, i just really don't want to play it anymore, mostly out of frustration because i am too lazy to look it up. So i just wander around cussing at it because something killed me, or i think something killed me, i have no idea what i am looking at. \nBut i will just keep chugging along because i want the fucking pony achievements.","timestamp_created":1609642621,"timestamp_updated":1609642621,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4hKeL4/YCfpP4vwI="}
