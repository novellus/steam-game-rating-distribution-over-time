    review: "Incredible detail in the trains and track provided with Trans-Pennine.\
      \ The amber lighting inside the drivers cockpit really makes it feel like the\
      \ 60\u2019s and the driving mechanics take some getting used as they feel old\
      \ but right for the era that it\u2019s based in, this makes me appreciate how\
      \ far technology has gone since the 60\u2019s. I would recommend this track\
      \ for people who enjoy historical experience."
