However, with each death, your character becomes stronger. So, the player who does the most poorly will eventually gain the upper hand.

Remember the good old days of huddling up on your friend's worn down couch to slap the pixels out of each other in a video game of questionable quality? Oh, you don't? Well, I do, and that's what inspired the creation of this game. It's made for anyone who enjoys playing video games, regardless of experience. It's easy to understand the objective of the game and the controls are configured to suit inexperienced (intuitively jump with the A button) and more experienced players alike (jump with a shoulder button to enable full twin-stick control).

This mode is ideal for 2 vs 2 or if you want to team up against the most confident player in your group. As a father, this is the game mode I play with my kids.
