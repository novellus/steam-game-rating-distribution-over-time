Living with that prospect as you sail around adds a nice new element to things.\n\nI already felt like I had a working little yacht full of kit - charts and fenders and pencils and winch handles, plus a hand compass added recently - and now I've got the fender and bucket, a boat hook, I can chuck that dan buoy off the back at last, and I've got more buttons to press - plus more things to tell my slow-loving crew to get on and do slowly. I do think we need a SHOUT AT THE CREW button to speed them up, especially when Bob the MOB is slowly sinking as his wellies fill with seawater, while the crew plod around, looking for a boat hook.\n\nHaving the tutorials added to everything that eSail already teaches you is also great, adding more value to everything that's packed into eSail. I'll be honest, I'd rather see more serious stuff like this, than some of the other less realistic elements (dinosaur on a beach, I'm looking at you).\n\nThis is a great add-on for eSail. I'm happy to support the devs as they keep building the base product and squashing bugs. They're communicative, supportive and approachable, so I was always going to go for this anyway. But, yes, I think that the extra depth this DLC adds to what you can do in the world is well worth the price tag.","timestamp_created":1575840372,"timestamp_updated":1575841314,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":25,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.760950803756713867","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzcbd8+4CfJKI4wE="}
