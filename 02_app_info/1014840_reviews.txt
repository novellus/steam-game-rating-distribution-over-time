It's randomly generated but everything that is generated is basic and does the same thing in each level. Every item you pick up heals you and you have one weapon. There is a projectile turnip to throw but equipping it is too annoying. i thought this would have more depth like crafting or a shop as you can chop down trees but nothing really happens. I'll give it a thumbs up as it has cute graphics and it was cheap to purchase but this is still borderline recommended.","timestamp_created":1549056966,"timestamp_updated":1549056966,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.699682533740997314","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw16+/1egCfMDiuQE="}
