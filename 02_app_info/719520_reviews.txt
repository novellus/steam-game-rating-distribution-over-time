Very simple graphics, but they look amazing.\n- It's fun.\n\nCons:\n- The only movement option I could get to work is full smooth locomotion (walking like in a regular FPS).  There is an option for dash and teleport movement in the menu, but they don't seem to work.  So, for me, this means that I get motion sick after about 10 minutes of play.","timestamp_created":1607383927,"timestamp_updated":1607383927,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jYnjn/YCdLyJuAI="}
