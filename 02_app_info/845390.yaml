    review: 'it is a nice little casual game, there are different rules on different
      levels that force you to adapt to new circumstances, but at the same time somehow
      it is not much fun to play


      I love train-themed games, but this one is just too clinical and there is only
      one best solution to the level, so just not my cup of tea I guess'
