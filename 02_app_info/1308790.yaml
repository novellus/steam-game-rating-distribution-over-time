    developer_response: 'I guess you meet difficulties in the second dream - crossing
      the river. The solution is like this: at the ''T'' river mouth, press the ''UP''
      key, then Ellie can go out of the river and continue the story.


      I was going to set up some decryption elements here, but now it looks like I
      screwed up. But thank you very much for your playing.'

    review: 'I really wish there was a neutral option, but I''d edge on not really
      for this. This game seems pretty decently long, but about 4 1/2 hours in, I
      ran into a bug in the maze dream sequence where there seems to be no option
      to go forward, the darker colored arrow is in a spot that is inaccessable.


      I initially thought it was going to be some take on whale fall communities,
      but it''s more of a RP of that. Anyways, it''s mostly cinematiic. As for the
      english, while the translation is pretty good, it''s still weird that the menu
      stuff wasn''t translated.


      Plotwise, I had some trouble following it, but it''s still pretty entertaining.'
