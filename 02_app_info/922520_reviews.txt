I thought why not and bought the Game and i would recommend it to everyone that wants Platform Fun for like an Hour.\n\n[u][h1]Good Things:[/h1][/u]\n\n- The Controls are on Point, its sad that some Games that are more expensive have worse (Played with a Xbox 360 Controller)\n- The Platforming on the last Level (7-7) is pretty Hard which is nice for an Ending.\n\n[u][h1]Bad Things:[/h1][/u]\n\n- You can Spam the Attack all the Time which makes it Overpowered and the Enemies aren't really a Problem anymore.\n- You get an Attack Upgrade every Stage which makes it way too Easy, the Attack from the beginning of the Game is good enough for at least half of the Game, there should be only one Upgrade for only 7 Stages and you shouldn't be able to Spam.\n- The Teleport/Rush Mechanic.. you can Spam that as well and its Easy to skip some Obstacles with it, which makes the Game even more Easy, i would recommend to give it a Cooldown.\n- The Difficulty overall is too Easy, it gets a good Spike in the End, but then its too Late. The bosses are no Problem most of the Time, cause you can Spam the  Attack and easily dodge their Attacks.\n\nSo overall this Game has some Problems, but they aren't that bad and if you want an Platformer to have Fun for like an Hour i would recommend buying it.","timestamp_created":1553355406,"timestamp_updated":1553355480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.657072842121124268","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvPPM1ekCe+HTvQE="}
