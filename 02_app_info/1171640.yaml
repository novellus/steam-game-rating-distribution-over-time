    review: "I had no idea wtf the game was looking at the screenshots. It's basically\
      \ a weirdly designed collection of visual novels with a crappy minigame inbetween\
      \ scenes and a terrible UI for progression since you have to pick a random dot\
      \ until you find an area with something to progress. Eventually needing to take\
      \ care of some guys in your hideout which increases your demon meter which lets\
      \ you progress further in some of the other stories. \n\nIt's not quite as frustrating\
      \ structurally as Dirty Education by the same developer. There's not as much\
      \ random factor to it. Only in this you can't skip the terrible minigame which\
      \ you could in DE [which had 3 minigames]. The minigame in this doesn't even\
      \ really make sense, it's in theory a 3x3 match game. Make matches to increase\
      \ a meter... but it increases with anyclick. You only get more meter with matches.\
      \ And given how long it takes to set up matches it's faster to just mash on\
      \ one of them. And it doesn't even work, often times the click you do will not\
      \ select the thing you clicked on. For something so simple that's a bit ridiculous\
      \ that it doesn't even work properly.\n\nI like most of the art/animation. It's\
      \ simple animation, but it's fine. The only art I didn't really like is the\
      \ stuff that lives up to the \"Wreck\" in the title. I'm pretty vanilla. I knew\
      \ going in that stuff was there. I just don't get it, and it's not in most of\
      \ the art. Though it is in a lot of text description. I actually think this\
      \ is Aaron Dodo's best art in spite of the grey tones and muddiness to the art.\
      \ In terms of proportions it's a lot better, it's still hyper masculine but\
      \ it's less goofy looking like all his other games. At first glance however\
      \ it does just look hideous beyond all words. It's a bit weird to come out of\
      \ this actually liking the art when I thought it looked really dumb and weird\
      \ from screenshots. *shrug* \n\nAnd there's some art where the entire body isn't\
      \ drawn and it's hard to understand what's being conveyed. Are they tied up?\
      \ The third screenshot is like that. One of them makes sense since he put the\
      \ character in water so the non-visible parts are submerged in water. Makes\
      \ sense in that background. Not when he uses that art in the awful minigame\
      \ though it looks goofy. But the brick one just makes no sense. And when there\
      \ are more than one full character [or 1.5 character] it's often hard to tell\
      \ what's going on because the coloring on them. \n\nThe game is quite annoying\
      \ to progress through. Most of my time felt like it was just clicking through\
      \ the dialog to setup the minigame and then playing the minigame. After every\
      \ text based mission you are forced to find wherever you go empty and then you\
      \ do the minigame after 3 dialogs that repeat [granted the last of the three\
      \ is different per each level/background, so for the first visit adds something].\
      \ However each dialog cannot be skipped quickly. It takes 3 seconds until you\
      \ can click through dialog. \n\nYou didn't have to wait that long in Dirty Education\
      \ to mash through the repetitive dialogs. And if you click an area you're done\
      \ with at that point then you have to do that entire process for no reason [rather\
      \ than just leave which makes more sense]. I just closed the game and reopened\
      \ it, it was faster and less annoying. Which is kind of sad if you think about\
      \ it.\n\nThe plot isn't very cohesive, it feels very detached. Which is why\
      \ it feels more like mini vns shoved together with a lose connection with the\
      \ demon. \n\nI want to recommend this, but it's just not a good game. It has\
      \ some solid art [that often clashes with the muddy backgrounds] and while the\
      \ writing is a bit goofy and has a lot of ~~~ in it, it's whatever it works\
      \ i guess, but it has no viewer [even if the one in DE was terrible with RNG\
      \ mechanics attached at least it had one]. And for $9CAD for 2.5h of content,\
      \ it's hard to recommend. Even for steep discounts, it's hard to recommend it\
      \ as a game because it's just so tedious to get to everything else even if 100%\
      \ of it was exactly to my tastes.\n\nI'd like to see more bara games on Steam,\
      \ and while this is somewhat improved over DE which did come out before this...\
      \ it's still a mess and in some ways is worse like the UI and the dialog progression\
      \ delay.\n\nThe soundtrack is funny though. Incorporates various moaning in\
      \ it. And there was more than one track. It's hard to really accurately describe\
      \ it. You have to hear it to understand. I'd almost recommend it just for that\
      \ if it were like a dollar, but it's not."
