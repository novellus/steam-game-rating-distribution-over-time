    about_the_game: <strong>Ede Tarsoly, composer of the Cardaclysm soundtrack:</strong><br>&quot;The
      soundtrack of Cardaclysm is meant to complement the dark fairytale-like nature
      of the game that flows along on the edge of serenity and darkness. Distant piano
      sounds mix with otherworldly, soaring female vocals to create a serene atmosphere
      broken only by the battle songs. Battles are different -- fierce, big horns
      mix with massive drums! I took inspiration from my favorite movie soundtracks
      and composers, recorded videos from the game and then just started composing...
      hopefully you'll like the result!&quot;
