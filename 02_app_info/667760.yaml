    review: "Genre:\n-2D Precision Platformer\n\nFit for me:\n-My favorite genre so\
      \ perfect fit!\n\nPros:\n-Lots of vibrant, neon colors are a treat to look at\n\
      -Upbeat tempo and soundtrack\n-Quickly introduces new mechanics in creative\
      \ ways\n-Easy to learn but tough to master = high skill ceiling\n-Challenging\
      \ platformer that continually push the player\n-Responsive controls\n-Exploring\
      \ off the beaten path is rewarded w/ collectibles and alternative levels\n\n\
      Cons:\n-The neon aesthetic in platformers is becoming a bit oversaturated\n\
      -Very slick movement can feel like you are on an ice skating rink\n-Very abrupt\
      \ difficulty spikes w/o a lot of early stage practice to learn the mechanics\
      \ and feel\n-Limited number of levels to try out new mechanics\n-A lot of small,\
      \ enclosed areas late game make for some frustrating moments due to the extremely\
      \ slick movement.\n-Very little room for error in late game.  There is usually\
      \ only one way to beat the level and it must be done exactly like that every\
      \ time.  \n-Not a ton of content compared to Celeste, Super Meat Boy, The End\
      \ is Nigh, etc.  \n\nThoughts:\n-I really enjoyed the game early on, but struggled\
      \ late game.  Normally, I see myself improving as the game progresses which\
      \ is really rewarding.  It's allows for more freedom and creativity in how I\
      \ play.  I can usually notice a clear improvement in my control of the character\
      \ over the course of the game.  I never really felt that way in this game. \
      \ I had a hard time adjusting to the movement and jumping.  I constantly slid\
      \ off platforms and so I started compensating by pulling back at the last second\
      \ which then lead to a lot of under-jumping. With saying all this, I think it's\
      \ worth a try for any fans of the genre; you may find the controls are more\
      \ intuitive than I personally did.\n\nConsensus:\n-Middle of the Road Game (Tier\
      \ 4 and make up 25% of reviewed games).  It's decent value at just $6, so I\
      \ think it's an easy purchase during a sale for any platforming fan."
