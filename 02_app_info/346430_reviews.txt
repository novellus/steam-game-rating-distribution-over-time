Instead, we get the most bare-bones version of any ideals it was supposedly reaching for, built on a foundation of awfulness. \n\nThe art was supposed to be the selling point; instead, it was just kind of meh at best. The story was abjectly boring, essentially describing situations in a simple, lifeless manner and providing no characters who were worth even a passing glance. \n\nThe actual game was the worst part. Expecting to see some sort of integration of 2/2.5D animation with some elements of 3D (with the idea being we're literally jumping in and out of comic pages for the action), we instead are handed basic and ugly 3D models for everything from the characters and enemies to the scenery. The movement is strictly rudimentary, the timing of inputs is unreliable, and that impossibly janky boss battle with Envy will make you want to toss your computer through the wall.\n\nA complete waste of time, on a game which clearly had zero love or care put into it. Any money spent on it would have been better served getting flushed down a toilet.","timestamp_created":1553490507,"timestamp_updated":1553490507,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4z/7P2ekCcJjjvQE="}
