I think the best part of the game is having 8 different characters to play.  You start with 2 and have to unlock the rest.  A lot of them are familiar archetypes but are fun to play.  For example, my favorite is Maverick, a cowboy that can use Fan the Hammer then roll to Fan the Hammer again.  Feels like McCree from Overwatch but there's also a whole RPG element to it.  You can use a Diablo-like piece to loot every game that will change your stats around but also has a negative to it.  You can tell that the developer plays a lot of games and has put their influence here.  \n\nMy biggest bummer is that honestly its a Roguelike and you lose everything when you die.  You unlock new Items and characters to try to change things up.  It sounds like there will be more permanent progression coming in a later patch so I think that will help a lot.\n\nOverall I would recommend this if you're looking for a game with a lot of depth.","timestamp_created":1592947753,"timestamp_updated":1592947753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548872172832489014","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4grjF8fICffDijwI="}
