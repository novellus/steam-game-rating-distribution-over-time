I like the trilogy of games I have from them: Far Sky, The Free Ones, and now Sky Break. \n\nThe graphics on Sky Break are very well done, and the gameplay is unique and quite different than the other two games I mentioned.  Price-point is on target for the length of game here.  \n\n","timestamp_created":1607600847,"timestamp_updated":1607600847,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542312145233154297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iceepvYCfJrXuAI="}
