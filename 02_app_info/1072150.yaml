      \ packed with lots of lore and a focus on subtle details and world building,\
      \ all doubled by a strong atmosphere inspired by titles such as Arx Fatalis,\

      \ of weapons and magic items. Combat is projectile-based, movement is essential,\

      \ and items and improve your skills to face every challenge!<br><br>\u27A3 Original\
      \ soundtrack ranging from tense to serene ambient, with occasional bursts of\
      \ metal. All spiced up with a few Alexander Brandon tracks that never released\
      \ in Unreal and Deus Ex!<br><br>\u27A3 Thousands of hours of work put into an\
      \ original concept, story, digitally hand-drawn graphics, scripting, sound effects\
      \ and level design, all by a one man dev team aiming to create a purely hand-crafted\
      \ game and experience.<br><br>\u27A3 Over eight hours of good old singleplayer\
      \ action with five difficulties including Brutalizing, which changes the gameplay\
      \ to allow interesting second playthroughs (different fights &amp; pick-ups,\
      \ companions etc.) and Bearzerk, which radically changes the combat by replacing\
      \ guns with new melee weapons.<br><br>\u27A3 Thicc orcs.<br><br>\u27A3 No DRM.\

      \ /><br>Hedon is built upon elements of classic game design, most importantly\
      \ the idea that the player needs to be treated with maturity by the game, which\
      \ should never function as an automatic gratification machine, and require a\
      \ degree of investment to be fully enjoyed. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1072150/extras/SteamCustom_Gameplay.png?t=1608725136\"\

      \ and intrigues, and you will be expected to fend for yourself. The build up\
      \ is slow and steady, the story is simple but consistent, the combat is fast\
      \ paced and ruthless. You will sometimes find yourself lost in a non linear\
      \ level design with various aesthetics (forest, caves, forge, barracks, snowy\
      \ mountain etc.) where exploration and learning by yourself is the key to improve.<br><br>You\
      \ may find that Hedon takes a certain amount of atmosphere, gameplay, color\
      \ and inspiration from games such as Unreal, Blood, Thief, Arx Fatalis, Serious\
