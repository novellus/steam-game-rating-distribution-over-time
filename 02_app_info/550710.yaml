    review: 'Solid album, well worth $3.99 USD. If you''ve played the game, you''ll
      know what to expect, and whether you do or do not want to buy is your choice.
      I reccomend this because Klepacki, once again, did a great job with the soundtrack.


      Side note by OP: It''s like dubstep, but good. Favorite Tracks are Cranioid
      Attack and Soldier Formation.'
