To many deathblocks and not a fan of Angry Video Game Nerd. However the game itself can be fun at times! Also the music is amazing!!! The best thing in this game is the music it's fuckin amazing and incredible the soundtracks in this game really pump my blood!!! Easily the greatest soundtrack I've heard in an old school platformer!!! The Dungeon and Dickholes level theme is easily my favorite in the entire game it was beyond epic!!! This is at least still way better than it's shitty horrible sequel!","timestamp_created":1598558298,"timestamp_updated":1610048793,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474999994039535522","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ485jC6vYCeZOXngI="}
