My favorites in the genre are DG1 and DG2, and while this game doesn't match those gems it's still very good! Recommended if you like TD games!\n\nP.S. Make sure you read some of the guides on steam for the game. There's no tutorial or keymapping info in game, so you need to check them out. The most important are \"E\" will upgrade your tower, WASD to move camera, spacebar to pause, and i recommend going in settings and enabling show paths of enemies, so when you hit spacebar it will show you these paths (important for flight paths).","timestamp_created":1609806244,"timestamp_updated":1609806750,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk7T95/YCefbGwAI="}
