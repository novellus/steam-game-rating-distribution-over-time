Werewolf: HotF will be the first and possibly the only one of them that I will try again. Another thing is that I was great fan of pen&paper WoD although I never touched Werewolf. It somehow didn't suit me. Then this cRPG was even nicer surprise.\nThere is character sheet that resembles pen&paper gaming which is good because long-term character development might be observed.\nStory is interesting and well written. I didn't loose focus on the text even once. Game is quite short but I doubt it took me only 3 hours as it feels like I spent much more time on it.\nChoices seem to matter and actually quite a lot. What I didn't like though is the fact that numeric effect of choice is immediately visible. I admit that I often played strategically focusing on increasing or decreasing stats. It would be nice to have option to completely hide effect from the choice text or make it blurred/fuzzy logic.\nGraphics are artistically interesting and good illustration of the story.\nSound and music are very well composed with the story, changes in the mood etc. It does not overwhelm but nicely fits with overall experience.\nI keep my fingers crossed that developers will not stop on one title and provide more WoD games on this engine and created by the same team.","timestamp_created":1609978416,"timestamp_updated":1609978416,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuKGM7fYCeOSSwQI="}
