Visually, it's great. That's it.\n\nThe \"puzzles\" are few and simple, and barely functional. The way you interact with objects leaves a lot to be desired as well. Holding the flashlight and it brushes the wall? That's dropped. You have the grip of a recently awakened comatose patient in advanced stages of atrophy. Even simple things like placing a key into a lock are done poorly. There's no animation or sound effects, you just wave the key into the lock and the door pops open. One of the puzzles requires you to strike a surface multiple times, and each time you do, the object you're striking it with falls out of your hands. Awesome.\n\nI can't recommend this game. The lack of rewarding puzzles, and short gameplay would make it a pass for free. At $3 it's not worth it. I do like the art style a lot, though, and if the developers can work on the gameplay elements, I'd be happy to check out their future stuff.","timestamp_created":1502139361,"timestamp_updated":1550388264,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50267791748046875","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxO+V/egCcqCFggE="}
