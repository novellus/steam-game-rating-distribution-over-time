    review: "Half-Life biomechanics.\nIt's a stylised shooter, containing mazelike\
      \ environments that eventually lead you out where you need to be. \n\nAside\
      \ from shooting, there's an emphasis on exploration in the action of collecting\
      \ alphabet. \nThis will allow you to read lore tablets scattered around the\
      \ environment. These tablets and the letters themselves are duplicate to find.\
      \ They're very light on lore as is the story. I, for one, couldn't tell you\
      \ coherently what transpired during my playthrough. [spoiler]It seems like you\
      \ get condemned for breaking a rule, that wasn't of your own accord, so you\
      \ end up taking down the system at your last stand. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/537430/discussions/3/1291816880501459911/]\
      \ This post is a much better alternative to interpret.[/url][/spoiler] \n\n\
      You get 3 weapons; tesla, flamer and a nail gun. Eventually finding an alternate\
      \ fire upgrade, which is some kind of AOE burst. Those are satisfactory. \n\
      Deadly fauna as well as your enemy variants will be more susceptible to certain\
      \ weapon.\nThe enemy and level/story pacing design scream half-life to me.\n\
      \nPerformance will dip at times but it's nothing major. Particularly the starting\
      \ area is the worst it was for me.\n\nOnce you embrace the [strike]initial jank[/strike]\
      \ complete experience jank it could be good. Overall I fuchs with it. \nChances\
      \ are if you enjoy a game like Agony, you might like this. It's not as good\
      \ tbh\n\n*Turn off the music, there's only one horrible combat track in there\
      \ that doesn't fit in with the atmosphere at all. It will play every time you\
      \ shoot at something and it dies."
