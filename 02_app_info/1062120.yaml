    review: 'First!


      [edited on 2019-07-13]

      ---- Mostly solid game.  Sadly Level 17 is functionally impassable, and since
      levels above that are locked until lower levels are completed, almost half of
      the 30 levels cannot be played at all. ----


      [added on 2019-07-13]

      Major issues:

      -- Level 17 is pretty much broken as a pea can easily get permanently lodged
      in the spring just by landed on the board attached to it.  It is random and
      frequent and extremely difficult to avoid for all 3 peas in that level.  In
      fact once I got 2 peas lodged there at once, and one time a pea lodged there
      disappeared and a 2nd pea took its place.

      ...on top of that, getting the peas where they need to go is quite difficult
      (I got 1 out of the 3 peas into position in 1 out of about 15 plays of the level,
      and 0 out of 3 into position in 14 out of 15 plays.), but might be doable if
      the spring capture problem is fixed.

      ...and of course I can''t speak for levels 18 through 30 since they are locked
      until finishing lower levels (including 17!).


      Nitpicks:


      It takes around 3 seconds for the game to recognize a win condition, which is
      pretty long and could be annoying if you succeeded on a level with less than
      3 seconds left but then weren''t given the win.


      The (random?) motion of peas sitting on a flat surface is hard to understand.  On
      the ground it''s not a problem, but I once shot a pea onto a small flat platform
      by itself, and it moved slightly back a forth a few times, making me think it
      would never come down...except after a while it did.


      It seems like no shot angle or amount of force can dislodge a pea once it has
      nestled into the groove above two adjacent peas.  Maybe the physics can''t be
      faulted, but this fact can make a level next to impossible to finish if a platform
      that can only be shot at from one side gets peas stacked on the side nearest
      the cannon first.'
