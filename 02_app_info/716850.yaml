    review: Sound issues, and the game will not save. Comparing with the images on
      the shop page, I realize that I don't get the "completed" screen once I finish
      a level, there's just an abrupt jump to the start of the following level. That
      must be the point where also the saving process should be taking place. Pretty
      uninteresting to play the first level over and over again, each time I restart
      the game. :(
