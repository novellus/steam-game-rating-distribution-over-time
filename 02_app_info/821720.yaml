    review: It was super fun at first with the graphics, variety of hidden object
      games, point and click puzzles with an occasional jigsaw thrown in. But once
      it became mostly completing the ink style block puzzles, I got bored. I kept
      hoping the next level would return to the point and click, hidden object style
      puzzles, but no, maybe after a few point and click steps out of the area, yet
      another block puzzle. And then another, and another. Too boring at that stage
      (early in the game), I never would've purchased a block puzzle game, ever. Very
      disappointing purchase.
