By far, the most entertaining 12 minutes of my life. The only thing I'd fix is the strength of that spring holding up his big fat head because he's all floppy when I play. \n\nDo alternate facts apply to virtual reality? Meh, who cares... the truth is that this game pretty much ends my day because whenever Kellyanne Conway opens her mouth, I just want to punch someone. This game is my therapy. Download this and play before they yank it from the store! My wife's son loves it! Terrific game, very good. Not much content though, if I had to pay for it I would have called it a tremendous disaster. Sad. While handling massive (some of them at least) rubber dongs is not something I do on a regular basis, there is an immensely satisfying noise when the synthetic gentleman's sausage makes contact with the CheetoFace. \n\nMy Vive controllers not only made high speed contact with the virtual Chump, but each other, my chair, 4K TV, my left leg (don't ask questions), and judging by the noise on one of the hits, my cat as well. (Sorry, Smokey!)\n\nMy only disappointment is that while I spent at least 4 minutes (this time around, I will continue) trying to beat him with a chair, for the life of me I couldn't hold onto the bloody thing long enough to get a well made WWE style smack out of it... I swear I felt like I was too drunk to hold the chair properly for all it got me.\n\n\n\nSeriously though. The morphs and physics on Rump's face work amazingly well with a satisfyingly proper amount of jiggle. If you hold the controllers parallel to your wrists like a claw, using either your pinky or thumb to hold the trigger, it adds some more realistic \"I punched this motherf***er in the face\" feel to it. Some of the textures could be worked on, or a skydome added, but you know what? This thing is free, and beyond satisfying, especially since it got me off of my lazy ♥♥♥♥ for a while. \n\nPlease, if you do future updates, LET ME HIT HIM WITH A CHAIR! Or let me attach the dongs to a chair and get him in true gangbang impeachment style.\n\nIf this is not in your library. Shame. It will likely be censored by the time you decide you want it.","timestamp_created":1486409404,"timestamp_updated":1486409404,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49396863579750061","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5vG5itoCf5u9cQ=="}
