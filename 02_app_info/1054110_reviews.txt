There's also a story of sorts told through pictures as you progress. There are basically three types of puzzles that must be solved throughout the game. Two types are very simple and could be done by a small child, but if it's a casual, relaxing experience you're wanting, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. The other type of puzzle is interesting and new to me, and its variations range from very simple to somewhat complicated. To be frank, doing the same types of puzzles over and over does get a little monotonous after a while, but thankfully the game ends before it gets too tedious.","timestamp_created":1609186480,"timestamp_updated":1609186480,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+KG/1fYCerybvgI="}
