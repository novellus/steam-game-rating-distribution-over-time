      /><br>Peripeteia is an upcoming first-person game mixing shooter, stealth and
      RPG mechanics, placing it within the elusive and ephemeral &quot;immersive sim&quot;
      genre, heavily inspired by the greats such as Deus Ex, expanding upon the formula
      with original ideas and an unexplored setting.<br><br>The story takes place
      in an alternate history cyberpunk Poland, in a post-soviet city full of corruption
      and opportunity, where nations, powerful factions and ideologies clash and where
      cybernetic supersoldiers look for mercenary work. You play as one of them, a
      young woman named Marie.<br><br>Within Peripeteia can be seen the dream of the
      immersive simulator genre, long laid to rest by an industry which had forgotten
      it. In this game you will be forced to use your wits, resourcefulness, and raw
      violent nature to complete tasks you may not even understand. Logic and a shrewd
      cunning mind will win you the day in this interactive and highly adaptive world.
      Well, unless you have a pistol and ammo for it.<br><br>Have you found yourself
      hungering for the raw sense of survival, accomplishment, and player choice long
      absent from this dark and belied industry? Then consider joining us in the lights
      of the Eastern Night with Peripeteia.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1437760/extras/tv3.gif?t=1606258053"
