The premise is simple enough, one stick moves, one strick aims and you have a shot, super shot(that charges pretty quickly), a dash, and a phase.  When you are phasing you are totally invincible but you cannot damage enemies so you will phase through bullets and have to phase back in in order to damage the enemies.\n\nEach level is decently long, roughly 20-25 minutes and have several bosses with an end boss consisting of several phases.  I enjoyed my short time with this game, but I cannot recommend it because of one simple fatal flaw:  no save feature.  The game has 5 levels, the 2 I played each took about 25 minutes, so assuming you don't die(and assuming all levels are roughly the same length) you could beat the game in roughly 2 hours.  I did not know there was no save feature when I started, so I played campaign, beat the first level and went off to do other things.\n\nI came back later, hit campaign and was put back to level 1, I noticed there was a level select option so I checked that out.  Level 1 and 2 were unlocked, no big deal, I figured I could start at level 2 and go from there.  So I select level 2, play through the whole thing and upon beating the level I am put back in the level select screen with nothing else unlocked.  At that point I lost all desire to play this game.\n\nThis is 2017, there is no excuse to not have a save feature in a game like this.  I played the game for about an hour, did not die once, and all of that progress just seems wasted.","timestamp_created":1510458145,"timestamp_updated":1510458211,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4q+eU198Cc8OKiwE="}
