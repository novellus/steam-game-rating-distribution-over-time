Every type of enemy must be fought differently. You can't just get away with spamming the same 2 moves all game.\nThe boss fights are the highlight for me. The boss design is inventive and each fight was really hard for me. The game will punish you for messing up in the boss fights. It has an old-school vibe this way. It can feel like they`re piling up on you when you screw up. Luckily, the reload screen is very quick . \nThere is a very easy mode for young kids who just to experience the story without dying all the time. It`s a nice addition because the art is very nice and will appeal to young kids.","timestamp_created":1604284020,"timestamp_updated":1604284020,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512385904788970947","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0u6xw/UCe67aqwI="}
