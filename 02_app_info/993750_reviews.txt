Pronouns are constantly changing for characters, even in the same sentence. Names are rarely ever accurate to what they're supposed to be. Sprites are reused for completely different characters, descriptions are inaccurate and several times it feels like what I'm reading is meant for a completely different scene and I'm just left scratching my head. There are \"4\" endings that all end exactly the same save for one line of text indicating the received ending. There also aren't any CGs. None, zip, zilch. The only positive I can see is the character art is decent.","timestamp_created":1605684350,"timestamp_updated":1605684350,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541037440299987793","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww9mP7fUCcrmJrwI="}
