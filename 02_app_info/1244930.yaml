    review: "I got sucked into this game big time- it is highly recommended! Although\
      \ the story is contained for the most part within one town, the many areas and\
      \ constant excitement make it feel like a vast world ripe for exploring. There\
      \ are constant twists and turns, and I found myself often wondering which direction\
      \ different choices would lead. I have now finished the game twice and had two\
      \ quite different experiences- they are plenty of ways to go through this game.\n\
      \nI don't have many downsides to speak of- although romance is most definitely\
      \ not the focus of this game. There are only 3 choices, romantic moments seems\
      \ few and far between, and it was surprisingly easy to jump in/out of a romantic\
      \ pairing accidentally. Sometimes comforting a friend is simply a nice gesture,\
      \ but other times it ends up in bed with one another- oops! \n\nIn the entire\
      \ game I only spotted a handful of spelling/grammatical errors- truly impressive\
      \ for a piece this size. There were a few inconsistencies where a choice or\
      \ situation I hadn't been in was referenced, but these were also few and far\
      \ between.\n\nThe main goal of saving the town is not overly easy to achieve,\
      \ and there are plenty of ways to fail. But it is also not a challenging game\
      \ that leaves the player frustrated. It is a wonderful mix of challenge and\
      \ success and leaves the player ready and excited for another play-through when\
      \ the credits roll.\n\nAll-in-all a delightful story and a highly recommended\
      \ game!"
