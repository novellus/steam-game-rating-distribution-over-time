I don't even know what it is this is supposed to be.  I mean it's okay as a VR environment.  But there's similar on STEAM VR workshop and they are free.  As far as the images on the wall ... you see simple stick figures animations that you could see by flipping pages on a notepad.  There's no story to the animations.\n\nYou also get a flashlight.  That's the whole game.  Seriously.  No joke.  The controls are wonky too.  Just stay away from this.  Maybe if it's free and you got some minutes to waste.\n\nRating 3/10.  I mean it didn't crash.  It wasn't a big download.  Definitely not worth any money though.","timestamp_created":1513566595,"timestamp_updated":1513566595,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49974215030670166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+6zms+ACcPm5kgE="}
