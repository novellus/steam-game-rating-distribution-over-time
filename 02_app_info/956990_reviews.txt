Pixelart graphics don't get old, the soundtrack is suprisingly FIRE, hitting people feels good and the abilities are nicely done. Slavistan 2 is really short, I've beaten it on normal in a single session, but you can spend some time in the bar fighting endless waves of enemies or actually beat the game in few ways. You can either beat up the boss enemies to gain their abilities or help them in order to be able to call them for help during fight. The ending is going to look different depending on if you either beat or help the bosses.\n\nSlavistan 2 is surely a game that deserves some more attention than it actually got and it's really sad Boris didn't play it.","timestamp_created":1570985015,"timestamp_updated":1602860153,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ip/6mPUCfPKG1AE="}
