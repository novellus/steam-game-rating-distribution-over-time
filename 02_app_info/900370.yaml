      \ is an economic board game that combines the traditional stockholding strategy\
      \ of buy low, sell high with several additional mechanisms to create a fast-paced,\
      \ engaging and interactive experience.<br><br>In Stockpile, players act as stock\
      \ market investors at the end of the 20th century hoping to strike it rich,\
      \ and the investor with the most money at the end of the game is the winner.\
      \ Stockpile centers on the idea that nobody knows everything about the stock\
      \ market, but everyone does know something. In the game, this philosophy manifests\
      \ in two ways: insider information and the stockpile.<br><br>Both of these mechanisms\
      \ are combined with some stock market elements to make players consider multiple\
      \ factors when selling a stock. Do you hold onto a stock in hopes of catching\
      \ a lucrative stock split or do you sell now to avoid the potential company\
      \ bankruptcy? Can you hold onto your stock until the end of the game to become\
      \ the majority shareholder, or do you need the liquidity now for future bidding?\
      \ Do you risk it all by investing heavily into one company, or do you mitigate\
      \ your risk by diversifying your portfolio?<br><br>In the end, everyone knows\
      \ something about the stock market, so it all comes down to strategy execution.\
