Every level after a certain point needs to be completed twice - once to fail and charge up all of your items, and the second for a chance to succeed.  I don't see how obtaining three stars on levels is possible.  Perhaps someone out there can figure this out and post it somewhere.\n\nStill, very enjoyable.  Rewarding after playing all of those other super easy Match 3 games.  Don't play this continuously.  Take a break and play one of the easier ones ... to preserve your sanity.","timestamp_created":1551922171,"timestamp_updated":1551922171,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x6HxqukCeo27vAE="}
