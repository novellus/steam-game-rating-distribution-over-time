I didn't learn this too much.  :D\n\nThis is a very good game include great creative originality and huge enthusiasm.\nAlthough the sound effects and art effects in this game aren't the best, (maybe because the lacking of developers and money) but the idea has potential.\nMaybe when the steam workshop open everything will be fine.\n\nI always dream about has my OWN boat or ship, like totally created by me, and modules damage too--this make my boat or ship more realistic.\nThen I found this game, that's GREAT.\n\nJust don't be nervous and try your best, don't forget one of the famous games: 《mount and blade》series are created by a Turkish couple at first too. If we(all the developers and kind players) do it together, we may made it come true.\n\nHope this game be better in the future, and all developers be healthy and happy everyday.\nBest wishes, good luck have fun! :D","timestamp_created":1604286327,"timestamp_updated":1604286327,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4jdW6w/UCfIPbqwI="}
