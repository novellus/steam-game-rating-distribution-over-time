    review: 'In this episode, you control Lent and Tao.


      There''s not much to do. You can gather but cannot use any of it so you''re
      stuck with the equipement provided. You have acces to a couple of regions and
      the regular monsters are there, but they don''t give much experience and with
      the gear you have, it is difficult for no reward. It is pretty much run to the
      boss at the end, kill it and that''s it.


      Not much of a story and it is too short.'
