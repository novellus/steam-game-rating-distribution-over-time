    review: "In its current state I would NOT reccomend it.\n\n\nI have had my fair\
      \ share of vr games and this gets most of it wrong.Here are my complaints.\n\
      \n1. On the steam store the game looks really fun and enjoyable and it is designed\
      \ to not show any of the flaws. While that is fine I dont like the case that\
      \ a have spent my hard earned money on a game that looks fun on paper but in\
      \ the end is just plain bad.\n\n2. While the levels I have played are different\
      \ from eachother. alot of them you can just win by holding your uizuno blade\
      \ (lightsaber) in a fixed location.\n\n3. the aiming of blaster weapons is horrendous.\
      \ I have an oculus rift and the aiming might be better with other headsets but\
      \ for rift users it will be incredibly hard to aim.\n\n4. the game has been\
      \ in early acces for 3 years and no one knows when it is accually going to be\
      \ released.\n\nIn conclusion the game is shallow (at best) with bad controls\
      \ and not enough variation between levels.\nIf you are a rift user do NOT get\
      \ this game as the controls are most likely even worse. If they at some point\
      \ release a full version of this game i hope these things can be fixed. because\
      \ at the core. This game has the potential to be really good.\n\n\nIN IT\xB4\
      S CURRENT STATE NOT WORTH THE 5 BUCKS"
