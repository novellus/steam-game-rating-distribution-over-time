This game is one of the roughest I've ever played and needs years of polish to be where it need to. The UI is an absolute nightmare to the point where I suspect this started as a mobile game but is so bad that I honestly can't tell. The music is blaringly loud and the sound effects feature voice clips that aren't even funny bad. Some sound effects ignore settings and blare out at full volume. There is some interesting nuggest of a game here, but the presentation is so aweful I'm not sure it's worth trying to find it. Stay away folks, this isn't worth your time.","timestamp_created":1543203041,"timestamp_updated":1543203041,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47rWEp+cCetinswE="}
