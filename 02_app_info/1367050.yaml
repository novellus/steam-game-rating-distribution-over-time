      /><br>On October 10th, 2062, Ben Campbell woke up into a very strange and uncommon
      day in the zombie apocalypse.<br>Unravel the dark truth behind the origin of
      the virus as you venture deep into the bloody and gruesome narrative of Down
      Below.<br><br>Down below is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi hack and slash cinematic
      platformer.<br>Our story takes place two years into a zombie apocalypse caused
      by an unknown virus.<br>You play as Ben Campbell, a former marine biologist,
      now a survivor.<br>As if things weren't fucked up enough, the day awaiting Ben
      is going to be one crazy ride.<h2 class="bb_tag">Combat System:</h2>You start
      the game without any weapons, but you will get some as you progress. <br>The
      majority of the combat in Down Below is based on close ranged fighting with
      melee weapons, that being said, you will eventually get some ranged weapons.<br>Each
      melee weapon has two fast weak attacks, one strong attack, one finishing attack
      and one charged attack.<br>One handed weapons can also be used when crouching,
      climbing or swimming.<br>Some weapons can be used as tools or to clear new paths.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Combo System:</h2>Down below features a unique combo system,
      which lets you decide which of your weapons to use on every hit of the combo.
      <br>A combo in Down Below is a set of 4 moves, two fast and weak attacks, one
      strong and slow attack and a finishing attack.<br>Combos are done by hitting
      the attack button in a specific timing, if you just mash the attack button,
      you will get up to 2 hits combo, but you'll swing faster.<h2 class="bb_tag">Player
      Mechanics:</h2>Down Below takes a page out of the old Cinematic Platformer book.
      <br>The player movement is as you expect of a normal person... well, maybe a
      really-in-shape-kick-ass person, but still a person.<br>That includes moving
      speed, inertia, fall damage, reasonable height/distance jumps, walking, running,
      rolling, swimming, hanging on ledges, climbing, swinging on ropes and more.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Special Abilities:</h2>You will unlock new abilities throughout
      the game, like wall jumping, dashing, diving and more.<h2 class="bb_tag">Story
      and Characters:</h2>Ben will meet other characters as the story unfolds, some
      of them will help you, some of them will require your help, some will join you
      fighting and many will die. <br>While Down Below is basically a dark and bloody
      story, the dialogues tend to be on the light side, with comedic reliefs that
      break down the tension.
