    review: "[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift and Windows Mixed Reality[/h1]\n\n\
      This is a 180 zombie wave shooter. I just can't recommend this game. There isn't\
      \ enough here. You can beat the game on normal in about 10 minutes. There's\
      \ also hell mode, which is just more zombies. I know it's only $1.99 USD and\
      \ I bought it on sale for only .99 cents, but Zombie Town VR is basically a\
      \ demo you're paying for. \n\nIf those were a great 10 minutes of gameplay,\
      \ I could maybe recommend it anyways, but it's more of a mixed bag. There are\
      \ a good variety of zombies; there's exploding, freezing, gas, & healing zombies,\
      \ among other enemy types. And there's also different weapons at your disposal,\
      \ including a fire & ice gun, plus a shield.\n\nHowever, it's not polished enough\
      \ for so little content. There are no settings whatsoever and the music is just\
      \ a bit too loud for my taste. Also, guns just don't feel good to shoot. It\
      \ seems like your starter gun is better than your special guns. Later on, the\
      \ only difficulty is the sheer amount of zombies on the screen and the fact\
      \ that the bigger zombies take longer to kill. There's also these little bugs\
      \ like the shield not spawning correctly on your hand or not being able to switch\
      \ weapons at times.\n\nThe game does run smoothly (I got steady 90 FPS on my\
      \ 1060 GTX). While, I had no issues on WMR, on the Oculus Rift it does automatically\
      \ shoot without any input (don't have to press trigger). You can play this game\
      \ seated. Kids might enjoy this game.\n\n[b]Rate 4.5/10. I could maybe recommend\
      \ this to families with kids, but otherwise, I would pass on this one. [/b]"
