And yes, I only played it under an hour and decided this. \n\nIt's a keyboard-only shooter (arrow keys and z/x : you can't change the controls in options) where the viewpoint is too \"zoomed-in\" so everything's too close to see bullets coming, and momentum / gravity slow you down so much that you can't get out of the way anyway. If I can describe it via another game - imagine trying to play Luftrausers with 1/8th screen size and slightly sluggish controls.\n\nAlso the only method of upgrading your ship / firepower is through a lootcrate-esque system, so you can't strategise and plan what to get, you pay your in-game currency and beg and are supposed to be happy with what you're given. Even though it's not what you need. All it does is add a layer of frustration.\n\nAwful, bad design decisions in this game.","timestamp_created":1518833028,"timestamp_updated":1518866138,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.603517889976501465","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwucDe0eECdv6QmQE="}
