It is too boring. Exploring is more fun with danger, and unique encounters but the game simply feels like and endless hallway with little to do. After clearing half a dozen floors I have yet to do anything other than cheese enemies and follow the map to the next zone. If you like looking at cool scenes and walking maybe you will like that game, but it simply isn't fast paced enough for me.","timestamp_created":1610087531,"timestamp_updated":1610087531,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4n8Cs8PYCc6a8wQI="}
