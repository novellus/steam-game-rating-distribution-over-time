    about_the_game: "<p>Let your Sims swim in the ocean on a hot summer day, bob for\
      \ apples in the autumn leaves, test their snowboarding skill on the half pipe,\
      \ or welcome spring showers with a walk in the rain and a colorful umbrella.\
      \ All-new activities, like soccer, and big seasonal festivals and celebrations\
      \ bring the spirit of each season to life. Your Sims can pucker up at the kissing\
      \ booth at the spring festival, or see what Halloween surprises await in the\
      \ haunted house. Dress for the weather with seasonal fashions from wetsuits\
      \ to raincoats and snow gear. With new foods, d\xE9cor and weather effects,\
      \ your Sims can enjoy the bounty and beauty of the ever-changing seasons and\
      \ play with life like never before!\n</p>\n\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\t\
      Delight your Sims with new activities for every season: Whether building an\
      \ intimate igloo, carving a scary Jack o\u2019 lantern, taking a plunge off\
      \ the diving board, or setting off all-new fireworks, your Sim can always find\
      \ new things to do throughout the year. \n<li>\tJoin the fun with seasonal festivals:\
      \ Sims can get in a snowball fight at the annual winter festival, get their\
      \ faces painted at the summer festival, whoop it up at the spring dance, or\
      \ bob for apples during the fall festival.\n<li>\tExperience the joy and challenge\
      \ of changing weather: New weather effects and Sim reactions capture the power\
      \ and beauty of nature! Sims can get a tan, be struck by lightning, or catch\
      \ a cold!\n<li>\tBring the outdoors inside: Your Sim can now learn the recipe\
      \ for pumpkin pie or style their home with new furniture and d\xE9cor. There\
      \ are a host of new items to ring in each season. Get a tanning booth in time\
      \ for summer, or ring in the holiday spirit with house lights and decorations.\n\

      \ snow gear, wetsuits, raincoats and umbrellas, and new Halloween costumes!\n\
