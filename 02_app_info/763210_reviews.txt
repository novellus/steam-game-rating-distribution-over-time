That's 33% of the available options. I didn't test the other 2.\n\n- The voices can't be understood in English. Their accents make them sound like parodies, but they are not. They are supposed to be a tutorial.\n\n- There are papers scattered on the ground to be read. However, their font size is 3 pixels high. Utterly illegible and pointless.\n\n- The controller has 1 stick that is functioning. Badly. Nothing else. It's useless.\n\n- Shifting to keyboard, plenty of keys randomly mapped, but you still need the mouse for some stuff.\n\n- Trying all keys systematically, I transformed into a car. It moves differently. I failed to transform back into a walker.\n\nI've seen a few other bizarre things, but I don't want to spend more time on this review that they actually spent polishing their game.","timestamp_created":1594539293,"timestamp_updated":1594539293,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535175859928131104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lNf8oPMCf9fflAI="}
