    review: 'YRek is quite the oddity, it''s heavily inspired by Turok, at least during
      the first chapter. At moments it really shines, and the price change makes it
      vastly more appealing. There are some really cool guns here too, and I love
      the environment design - i.e. Mayan Temples, Snowy castles. I think YRek is
      a game full of potential - it just falls a little short due to a couple of things
      - instant death-traps, an a checkpoint system that prohibits you from save-scumming
      your way past said instant death-traps. I recommend the first chapter to those
      of you looking for a slightly janky take on Turok - but beyond that the game
      has a few too many pitfalls to really make it worth investing your time into.
      The developer is fantastic, and is listening (and acting on) feedback from the
      players - so if you can think of ways to better the experience, make your voice
      heard.


      I initially didn''t recommend this game, but it''s getting there. My recommendation
      is purely based on Chapter 1 and the developers willingness to listen to feedback.
      With time, this could be a solid little gem - just needs some more polish.'
