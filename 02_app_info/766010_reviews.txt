This is a free update for the original game, but I still bought because I want to try the game on Steam instead of only on Switch. I have no regrets. It's a good add-on that's only a bit buggy or annoying to control in some places. The game's levels shine in terms of good design and being fun to speedrun.","timestamp_created":1531533531,"timestamp_updated":1531533531,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566274821758270264","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49+Kgy+QCdNj/pQE="}
