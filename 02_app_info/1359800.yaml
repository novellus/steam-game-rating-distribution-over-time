    about_the_game: "The Soldiers Factory is a top-down stealth game and the start\
      \ of a trilogy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGo undetected and sneak past enemy soldiers\

      \ Use the room scanner, the taser pistol and many other weapons. But remember,\

      \ time on the NORMAL level of difficulty is approximately 12 hours. Of course,\
      \ it depends on the player. The story takes you to several locations, which\
      \ is divided into over 60 levels.<br />\r\nThe game offers 4 levels of difficulty.\
