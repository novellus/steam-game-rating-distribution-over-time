I recommend buying it as its a quite nice small game and it will keep u occupied for a while. i'm planning on finishing the story soon.","timestamp_created":1584479453,"timestamp_updated":1584479453,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48703494668006897","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49LeV9fACfOrq+AE="}
