The game was developed and published by Notus Games.\n\n\"Trip to France\" is the fourth episode of \"Travel Riddles.\" Previous episodes: \"Trip to India;\" \"Trip to Greece\" and \"Trip to Italy.\"\n\n[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]\n\nGame Visuals\n\nI want to mention that the visuals in the game are well done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGame Audio\n\nI want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are no difficulty game modes to choose from. All levels have their own difficulty,\n\nIn the match 3 genre, there are three different types of matching style: Swap; Chain and Group, the matching style in this game is swap.\n\nThere are nine chapters in the game and it has twenty-eight levels. All together there is the total of two hundred thirty levels.\n\nThere are some jigsaw puzzle levels even though the game is heavily match 3 oriented.\n\nThere are three different special power ups in the game. These special power ups help completing the match 3 levels much quicker.\n\nThere are thirty-two different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need to be completed before they can be unlocked.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nFinal thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.","timestamp_created":1521254552,"timestamp_updated":1600546529,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566420435905456543","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47ruA1PQCeqnwmwE="}
