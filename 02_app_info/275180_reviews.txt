Double Fine brings their signature brand of game play and graphics to another fantastic game.  For anyone who adores Halloween along with a fun but challenging turn based game, this is for you.  The story is enjoyable and quirky to make any age laugh and gasp.  Played through the game twice for the achievements.","timestamp_created":1609647733,"timestamp_updated":1609647733,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kOee4/YCcLT6vwI="}
