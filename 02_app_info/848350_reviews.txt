This low budget effort is a big reason why Japan finally gained the faith to regularly release their more marginal and experimental titles to the rest of the world. The simple, if bizarre concept of frenetically rolling up junk and magically turning it into stars is a joy to play. It was good then, and it's better now.  Easy to pick up, hard to fully conquer, and backed up with a legendary soundtrack.  It's a must play with genuine historical significance.","timestamp_created":1610014773,"timestamp_updated":1610014773,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48PmW7vYCe76ewQI="}
