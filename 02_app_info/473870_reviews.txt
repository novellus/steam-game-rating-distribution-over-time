Only better value atm is Martyr's Bounty DLC.\n\n[b]Highly recommend buying this as a new player.[/b] [i]You may choose to play this game for free as it has a fantastic free-to-play mode that won't take you long to acquire a decent deck, but nothing compares to this grand offer.[/i]\n\nIf you are new, I will help you understand what value this has.\n\n1 Booster Pack = 150 LP (purchasable ingame currency) or 3000 IP (grindable ingame currency)\n$1 = ~200 LP\n\n[olist]\n[*]You get 23 Booster packs total (faction specific packs = 300 LP). That means you get a total LP value of 4650 LP (~$23). \n[*]You get 15 Rift Run Tokens (draft mode). Each Drafted Mode Run costs 75 LP or 1 Rift Run Token. 15 Tokens = 1125 LP (~$6)\n[*]You get Calamity (alt art). This card is the most valuable epic card in the game. It has no fix value but people often sell it for around $6. Alt Art is probably 1.5-2x as much (~$10)\n[*]You get Lots of cosmetics and 10x 24-hour 50% XP/IP Boosters. Hard to value, so lets say it's free ontop.\n[*]You get 2150 LP ontop (~$11)\n[/olist]\n\nLet's do maths: $23 + $6 + $10 +$11 = $50 + Freebies!!!\n\n[b]Conclusion: You Pay ~$28 (~25â‚¬) and get value worth ~$50 + a bunch of Freebies.[/b]\n\nDownside: You can only buy it once. :(","timestamp_created":1466761099,"timestamp_updated":1466764058,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.720963954925537109","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2ev8wNUCdunMWg=="}
