    review: '[i]Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love (in Several Wrong Places)[/i]
      is the second installment in the [i]Leisure Suit Larry[/i] series. Picking up
      after the events of the first game, Larry has been dumped by Eve having mistaken
      their one-night-stand for a real relationship. Now in Los Angeles, Larry heads
      off on a new adventure after some luck winning a large sum of money and a free
      cruise. Meanwhile, Larry unknowingly runs into some agents of the KGB and gets
      involved in an international evil scheme.


      As with the first game in this series, you again control Larry through a text
      parser as was common for adventure games of the day. This game was first released
      in 1988.


      The graphics are definitely a step-up from the original game and makes good
      use of the advancements available during its development to create more environments
      and more detailed characters. While obviously quite dated by today''s standards,
      it still performs its task well and is enjoyable.


      Continuing with the tradition of Sierra On-Line games, this game has some rather
      difficult and obtuse puzzles, much like the first installment. Many of the puzzles
      and experiences in this game can often only be solved using trial-and-error.
      I did find this to be a frustration during my play-through and I did have to
      resort on a few occasions to looking up hints to get through certain puzzles.
      This issue is compounded by the fact that it is possible to miss certain items
      that would render the game unwinnable. Along with the numerous possible deaths,
      this is definitely a game where saving often is a necessity.


      Of course, the reason to play any [i]Leisure Suit Larry[/i] game is more for
      the story, writing, and humor. [i]Leisure Suit Larry 2[/i] definitely has much
      less sexual content than the first game instead focusing much of the story and
      jokes on a truly absurd and unlikely series of events that Larry finds himself
      in. Unlike the more straightforward goal that Larry sets for himself in the
      first game, this game is driven more by Larry finding himself in very unexpected
      situations from being chased by KGB agents to winding up on a tropical island.
      The story and humor are actually quite enjoyable because these various events
      gave the writers many opportunities to cram in all sorts of jokes.


      Overall, even though I felt the gameplay was rather hit-and-miss with some obtuse
      puzzles, the writing made this game an enjoyable experience. I would recommend
      this game to those looking for a classic adventure game with a sense of humor.'
