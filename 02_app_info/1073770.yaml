      /><br><br>Stalwart knight, align yourself for battle! Synchronize the energetic
      patterns within XANARTHRAXIA's ancient glyphs and cleanse the land of evil in
      this bite-sized, casually competitive, RPG clicker. <br><br>XANARTHRAXIA, at
      its core, is a game about self-discovery, self-discipline. and personal accomplishment.
      Ultimately, the greatest enemy you'll face throughout the entire experience
      is yourself. At a certain point it becomes a personal challenge that you will
      want to finish simply because you believe you can. Finishing will require your
      full attention, hand-eye coordination, personal determination, timing, focus,
      quick reaction speed and maybe a cup of coffee to perk you up. The only thing
      that can hold you back are your own self-doubts, personal fears and limiting
      beliefs. Overcome yourself, overcome XANARTHRAXIA.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1073770/extras/gameplay.png?t=1600358517"

    review: "This was a chill game when i started incorporating the ability to isolate\
      \ patterns with a time goal - sometimes i had the threat of choosing to delay\
      \ myself and take hits to try and regain the upper hand. \n\nThe only negative\
      \ i could reference would be that i missed the art when i was fighting - i could\
      \ see it was great but i couldn't focus on it at times.\n\nTo conclude; this\
      \ was a fun game, it pushed my reaction speed up over time. Good fun.. im worried\
      \ about trying the unlock though."
