      target="_blank" rel="noopener"  >http://www.modboxgame.com</a><h2 class="bb_tag">Multiplayer
      Creation</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Create Multiplayer / Singleplayer / Coop
      games while switching between VR and Desktop on PC. Or create games in your
      own environment on a AR device. Everything is synced with other online players
      in real time.<br></li><li>Share Creations made on Steam Workshop, or cross-platform
      on Mod.io<br></li><li>Use any of the editor tools while playing. There are both
      Tools used for hands / while playing as a avatar, and a Desktop Editor mode<br></li><li>Play
      and edit with other players in Local Multiplayer with up to 4 players locally
      with split screen (or Keyboard or Gamepads) with another player in VR. Local
      players can also play online.<br></li><li>Prefabs can be used to create reusable
      parts out of Creations. Prefabs can then be shared online for other creators
      to use - and can include assets (3d models, visual scripting, C# projects).
      Prefabs can also include other nested prefabs, allow for easily building large
      complex worlds out of reusable parts.<br></li><li>Create a server at anytime
      (while playing or editing), and use the Servers Permissions system to control
      who can administer/ edit / play on your server.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Advanced
      Scripting</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>The ingame visual scripting system MBScript
      can be used for scripting gameplay / AI / Physics. MBScript is a drag and drop
      visual scripting system that has both a node like tool (using the Wiring tool/desktop
      window), and a Blocks/Scratch like interface for more advanced building (using
      the same type system as C#).<br></li><li>MBScript can be edited both visually
      with drag and drop, and in the ingame text editor (with autocomplete using a
      ingame VisualStudioCode Monaco editor). MBScript can be used to create complex
      AI characters and multiplayer bots.<br></li><li>The C# Compiler mod (PC platform
      only) allows for writing your own C# code to include in Creations. Can add new
      Entity Components, editor tools, or new functions and options to run in MBScript
      / Wiring. Open C# projects in VisualStudio, and write code while the game is
      running for instantly compiling and seeing changes. All the Modbox game and
      editor tool C# source is included as reference/editable ingame.</li></ul><h2
      class="bb_tag">Physics and Interaction</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Full body VR
      simulation and physics based VR locomotion. All game objects were designed first
      for VR interaction (including reloading clips into guns, pulling bows to fire
      arrows, etc), with procedural animation used for Desktop players / AI to do
      same actions.<br></li><li>Physics and Destruction - Building physics creations
      in Modbox does not use a physics hierarchy like other level editors / game creations
      tools. Instead ''Connections'' are made between physics objects when editing,
      which will join them together in play mode with physics. This allows for realistic
      destruction and dynamic environments.<br></li><li>Voxel Editing allow for destruction
      and modifying while playing.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Editing and Building</h2><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Create UI interfaces with UI Entities - using the same visual
      scripting / wiring systems as world creation to create HUDs and other in world
      UI for players (including new Tools and Menus)<br></li><li>Use the Voxel Editing
      tool and desktop window to create large voxel terrains, with caves / hills /
      buildings. Create smooth voxel worlds or switch to Cubic for Minecraft-style
      blocks.<br></li><li>Mesh Editing tools for creating meshes out of primitives
      ingame</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Moddable</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Assets
      System with Importing Assets - Import 3d models, humanoid models, textures,
      sounds. All at runtime while playing. Use the Material Editor to set material
      properties. Import 3d models from online sources including Google Poly (SketchFab
      coming soon)<br></li><li>Everything in Modbox is a mod - including default included
      mods like SteamVR / Oculus VR support, Steamworks, Mod.IO uploading, Nvidia
      Flex liquid/soft particles, and editor tools like Mesh Editing and Voxel Editing.
      It''s designed to be as extensible and configurable as possible.<br></li><li>Mods
      can contain assets and be used in creations (such as the Modern Weapons mod)
      that players will download to play the creation. Or they can be Local Mods adding
      options and features just to the local players (like VR Spectator Camera)<br></li><li>Use
      the ModboxSDK Unity package to create Modbox mods in the Unity Editor. Mods
      can include Unity scenes turned into Environments, GameObjects/Prefabs into
      Entity Assets, avatars into Humanoid Models. Mods can also include new editor
      tools built in C#.</li></ul>'

    review: "Modbox is a game i knew about since late 2017. This game blew me away\
      \ cos i could create anything i want like Vehicles, Cranes, Cannons, Houses,\
      \ Furnitures and even my own weapons in VR. You can import your own assets like\
      \ models, textures, images, videos, audio and even humanoid avatars. Game has\
      \ a workshop support where you can subscribe and download Assets and Creations\
      \ like coop/singleplayer campaign, deathmatch, VR giant VS non-VR player, Prop\
      \ hunt or some creations where you just mess around in it. \n\nOverall i really\
      \ like this game. Community in this is very nice and Developers are awesome."
