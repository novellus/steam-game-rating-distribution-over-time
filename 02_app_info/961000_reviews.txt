Your goal is to make the little pixel folk survive by pushing the right letter key, beware if you think this is a simple. \nThe game challenges you in a clear but somewhat cryptic way which tickles your brain. The difficulty goes from trivial to surprising, you'll find yourself facepalming while laughing at yourself in the best possible way whenever you make a silly mistake that you thought you wouldn't do. The game is endearing and has fun surprises every now and then, you get good feeling messages to keep you going.\n\nWho should play this? Anyone that can appreciate puzzle games or memory trainer games. \n\nWhen should this game be played? \nHonestly this is the perfect game to run while cooking or baking. Do a few levels while the food simmers or you are waiting for a  kitchen timer. Just don't burn anything! I found myself playing this the first time while baking cinnamon rolls and it was great!\n\nWhich brings me to the only thing I think could be improved with this game, search \"happy retro cooking music\" on youtube and listen to that with the game. It has the perfect tune for it in my opinion!\n\nOverall this game delivers on what it promises more than any big budget game studio does these days. It's the Dark souls of keyboard puzzle games (try to play this without ever crossing your hands). Simple yet creative and fun 10/10 looking forward to play more of this and any future games it's creator comes up with!","timestamp_created":1570369610,"timestamp_updated":1570369610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkdTU0O0CeMnR0wE="}
