    about_the_game: '<strong>Beeftacular</strong> is a <strong>fast-paced platformer</strong>
      where you play as a chunk of beef! You must clean levels by destroying all the
      rotten meat as fast as possible. To do this you can use <strong>melee slash
      attacks, ranged projectile attacks</strong>, and the environment. You only have
      a<strong> few seconds per level</strong> so you must be quick and precise. The
      restart button will be your best friend!<br><br>This game is not just for hardcore
      platformer fans but also for beginners and casual players, but don''t expect
      the later levels to be easy. This platformer still has some pretty beefy challenges.<br>Play
