Michael is able to transcend between a place of existence where there is life and an afterlife by ghostlike abilities. He is versed in matters of a spiritual nature. His task is to protect life from horrible characters that prey upon the the living from beyond this veil between life and death, by destroying these characters.\n\nTo win, the protagonist must find a way through more than a dozen different regions. These regions are connected together. Initially, many of these places are inaccessible, and require the protagonist to obtain abilities or gear, which allow him access to new regions and previously inaccessible areas. The equipment and abilities may be found in a closely-knit maze-like world that these regions form together, and the more equipment and abilities that are found, the more places become reachable. This process of exploration and collecting, requires the protagonist to revisit these areas, and explore places after obtaining new equipment and abilities.\nControlling the protagonist towards his final moment, requires making perilous leaps, running, climbing, and swimming, and a lot of shooting. He may also travel to regions instantly, and progress may be saved at any time.\nThe labyrinth contains horrible adversaries, which the protagonist should neutralize. He aims at them automatically, and the viewing-angle on the protagonist is maintained automatically as well, or may be manually adjusted, but generally this is not required. Adversaries may be neutralized in a terrible way, or by using an attack which allows the protagonist to obtain some of his adversaries' health after neutralizing them. Eventually, and after leaving a region, adversaries reappear.\n\nThe labyrinth is complex and forms the main obstacle to overcome. The further the protagonist goes into the labyrinth, the less hope there is to ever find a way out of the endurance. Finding a way through the labyrinth requires concentration, and is a daunting task that demands persistence, perseverance, and a sense of direction.\nThe abilities and gear the protagonist obtains are visible when they are equipped. Most equipment he may hold in his hands, and abilities are presented as markings that are drawn on his body, which grant him supernatural abilities. His abilities and equipment are inspired by mysticism and historical lore, and seem authentic. Some equipment consume ammunition, and may be supplemented by destroying containers, which also reappear after leaving a region.\nThe environments use architecture that is often organic or natural in design, and shows interiors of buildings as well. Most of these environments are horrible places. Navigating the labyrinth is a disorienting experience. The labyrinth has many secrets, and making progress is generally resisted by having to reveal those secrets. The environments show horrible settings with dark themes. Technically, the environments a well rendered, with various geometrical shapes, with almost no gaps in the geometry. The protagonist may carry a torch, and the environments may show dynamic lighting effects.\nVarious music plays, depending on where the protagonist is, and sounds are used to a high degree to set the atmosphere. Sound effects are appropriate. For instance, the sound footsteps generate, is based on the material the protagonist stands on. Sounds are also used in a way, where they may convey a terrible notion, a dark idea, or a horrible concept.\n\n\nThis cosy image shows the inside of a church, and shows historical and cultural references:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2334643437","timestamp_created":1609733102,"timestamp_updated":1610083867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l8Oe8PYCeMukwAI="}
