    about_the_game: You and up to three friends (or three computer controlled guys
      if you're short on friends) are in a top down maze trying to hit each other
      with your bombs, but you're going to have to control your guy and your bomb
      at the same time! It's hard. It's really hard and it's going to put your ambidexterity
      to the test. Choose from 8 characters, 8 levels, there's like 5 catchy 8-bit
      songs, I don't know, what are you waiting for? It's gonna be super fun and all
      your friends will think you're really cool when you drop Watergate trivia on
      them like how G Gordon Liddy ate a rat once.  Anyway, call your friends, invite
      them over, pour some glasses of your favorite beverages, and play some Watergate
      Xtreme.

    review: 'For those of us who enjoy throwback graphics and sound, this game captures
      the old NES style perfectly. Also, the music is way better than it needs to
      be. You''ll be humming the various songs for days.


      Perfect party game. Quietly load it up when you have some friends over and enjoy
      everyone''s "WTF?!" reactions as they start chosing their characters and try
      to figure the game out.'
