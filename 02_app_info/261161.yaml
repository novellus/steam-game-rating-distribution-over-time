    review: "If you didn't acquire that DLC when purchasing the \"Sacred Franchise\
      \ pack\", and have no desire to get as much achievements as you can, you better\
      \ don't spend money for that.\n\nAs in the original game, there is nothing really\
      \ interesing here. The first four regular playgrounds, added in DLC, don't require\
      \ players to have necessary level, so they may be used for grinding XP and gold...\
      \ But after that, there is only a little chance you will return. It's plot is\
      \ extremely cliched, we just fight agains the leader of Orcs, who pretend to\
      \ be like \"defender of grimmocks\". However, he obviously wants fame and gold\
      \ only for himself, he makes a reversation about that EVERY time he talk, and\
      \ he talks just too much. Yawn. No further descriptions are needed.\n\nThe leader\
      \ on the final level himself, however, is probably the hardest enemy in the\
      \ whole game, unless you are equipped good enough, and your level is high. His\
      \ spells literally kill you in a matter of 1-2 seconds, and if you are not prepared\
      \ for that battle, even in multiplayer mode you really have no chance to fight\
      \ him down. This, and the fact, that at least two levels contan very horrible\
      \ parts where you should be extremely fast and accurate, otherwise easily losing\
      \ your life, probably are the reasons why even in parties players ofter avoid\
      \ entering levels added by this DLC.\n\nLevel design is also extremely boring.\
      \ There are only a few developers who can make desert levels look attracting.\
      \ Keen Games does not belong to that league at all. Even the low price of this\
      \ chapter is a little excuse of total lameness developers showed us in its design.\n\
      \nP.S. The game itself never explains that orks were turned into \"grimmocks\"\
      , it just names orks as grimmocks. Only Steam description from developers has\
      \ that explaination.\n\n[code]\n* [url=steamcommunity.com/id/Staufen/recommended/12320]Review\
