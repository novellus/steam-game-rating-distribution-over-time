    review: 'I really appreciate the remaster and it being brought to VR.  But this
      is no Myst.  Story is minimal and weak.  Puzzles aren''t very connected to the
      world and there''s too little feedback.  Most of the puzzles reminded me of
      the worst of the Myst/Riven puzzles that had you memorizing lengthy info from
      one place to match in another, through a layer of indirection.  That''s drastically
      harder in VR when you can''t write something down (and there was no built in
      camera roll either).


      I admit my views of puzzle games has changed drastically since reading Don Norman''s
      "The Design of Everyday Things" a few years ago.  While the whole point is to
      "puzzle", there should ALWAYS be feedback/status/result when a action is performed.


      VR: Node movement with snap turn worked pretty well, it avoided clipping issues
      and was still fast as you could still just push the stick.  There were a tiny
      handle of spots where the node was slightly between snap turn positions though.  I
      personally can''t handle yaw at all in VR, so lots of smooth turn is a hard
      no for me.  But the "hand" interaction was super-weak and virtual/physical location
      didn''t map well for me.  It was very hard to reach the start of a lever and
      move it to the end.  Given how few interactions the original source has anyway,
      a simple click would been move straight-forward.'
