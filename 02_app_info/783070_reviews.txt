When I first started playing this around the time of the release, it was really confusing on how to program the models. The dev. listened to what was said about having a really good tutorial in the game. I just recently played it again and now it is so much easier to understand. I totally recommend this. Great job for listening and making it a better experience.","timestamp_created":1578186348,"timestamp_updated":1578186348,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563492059707641602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw3pLPue8Cd+D26QE="}
