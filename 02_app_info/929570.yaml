    review: I'm not dyslexic, so I can't vouch for how accurate this is in terms of
      how text looks to those with dyslexia. And whilst this was tough to read, that
      feels like the exact point - to prompt thought about the needs of those with
      dyslexia, and to encourage empathy for them. In that sense, it absolutely succeeded.
