Fail to respond with pause fast enough, fail.\n\nThere's some pseudo-replay value in the fact that the city and each mission location is random-generated, but unfortunately most of it feels identical no matter how theoretically random it was; there really just isn't enough variety to support it being random. The game probably would have benefited from being more hand crafted. \n\nThe biggest downfall is that the game is not balanced at all. Starting areas are super easy with almost no challenge, but the game almost immediately ramps up into super hard as it plops down random high level areas with massive zombie swarms far beyond what your little squad can handle. Other poor design issues creep up as you will fail pretty quickly if you were not lucky enough to get extra survivors early on or the fact that stores to buy things are not only rare, but vanish entirely if you try to secure the zone they are in. So to use a store more than once you have to leave a gaping hole in your secured path. There's also no guarantee you'll find enough loot to actually make progress and your carrying capacity is terribly small even if you do.\n\nIt's not a terrible game and it's cheap enough that if you want to mess around with a squad-tactics rogue-like you might find some fun with it, but trying to finish it is a lot of frustration and repetition. $3 is pushing the limits of what it's worth, but it's often on sale for cheaper or tossed into bundles.\n\nI think I paid $1 for it on sale, and I did get some hours out of it, so it's cheap enough to still give a thumbs up despite the flaws.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]","timestamp_created":1590873860,"timestamp_updated":1609000210,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593511283397674561","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5dn4z/YCfoejiwI="}
