    about_the_game: Mirador is an online, co-op or solo hack-and-slash adventure game
      where the main focus is on fun, satisfying and challenging player-created boss
      fights! You play as cute, anthropomorphic animals from a late medieval world
      trapped in Mirador, an dangerous alien world, after stepping through a mysterious
      portal that broke down and now, they're looking for a way out. Take down as
      many Sentinels (bosses) as you can and bring back loot to build and improve
      your own Sentinel!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/799350/extras/LobbyMP.gif?t=1603302595"
      /><br><br>In one part, you'll explore a derelict futuristic universe where you
      must survive against powerful hulking war-machines with ever-changing sets of
      abilities and possible configurations. In another part, you'll be designing
      your own Sentinel using loot found in previous runs! Once your creation is complete,
      send it out for other players to fight against it!<h2 class="bb_tag">Endless,
      Player-made Boss Fights!</h2>Hop from portal to portal to reach far away and
      exotic arenas, home to fierce Sentinels. The more Sentinels you defeat, the
      more challenging they become and the better loot you'll get! Survive as many
      of them as you can to find rarer artifacts, or play it safe and end your run
      early. Are you willing to risk your gains to venture further or will you return
      to the safety of The Citadel?<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/799350/extras/Sentinel_Fight.gif?t=1603302595"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Design your own Boss!</h2>With the artifact you loot while
      on your runs, assemble and design your very own Sentinel. Choose its frame,
      its weapons, its behavior, its abilities and even its appearance by forging
      armor pieces onto it. Once your creation is complete, send it out into the world
      and it will defend an arena from invading adventurers! Your Sentinel will bring
      back treasure from defeated opponents! Watch your Sentinel climb through the
      ranks as it encounters and defeats more and more players!<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/799350/extras/NewSteamGif_BossEditor.gif?t=1603302595"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Non-Stop Boss Fighting Action!</h2>Mirador will take you
      on an epic, non-stop journey through portals that lead you to various player-created
      Sentinels. Defeat them if you can, bring the spoils back to your Citadel and
      create your own Sentinel that other players will encounter on their runs!<br><br><br><img

    review: This game is just undercooked. A cool idea with very shallow gameplay
      as well as being technically buggy. Will crash on launch sometimes and doesnt
      allow for custom keybinds on controller
