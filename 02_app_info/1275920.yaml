    review: 'I purchased 1/6/21 and the IGE is not available on my game still. I have
      validated the local files, restarted Steam and my computer and the IGE is still
      not available. The DLC has a check mark next to it on steam to show installed
      but still not showing on the game.


      This needs to be fixed.'
