    review: 'Fuck what other people say, if you enjoy extra funky bits, you''ll like
      this soundtrack.

      i would describe the genre as bigband meets vaporwave. It''s not for everyone,
      but its for sure something I like.


      [h1] Songs [/h1]

      1.) 1bitarrange-ver1: Don''t remember this Piano promenint song from the game...

      2.) 1bitarrange-ver2: This Christmas song I don''t remember from the game either...

      3.) 1bitarrange-ver3: This elevator jazz song I don''t remember from the game
      either, must be me....

      4.) 1bitarrange-ver4: This remakeof Swanky Kong''s game show song was absolutely
      not in the game..

      5.) 1BitHeart: Is probably in the game, and is preformed by vocaloid Rin Kagamine,
      and I''m okay with this one, I used to be super big into vocaloids, until Momocashew
      ruined me for every other vocaloid.

      6.) 1BitHeart: Is probably not in the game, this is the same as the previous
      song, except it''s preformed by Minx, whom I never heard of.

      7.) 1BitHeart: is the instrumental for the last 2 songs, which combines Chiptune
      style 16 bit music with what I would describe as beach rock.

      8.) Mushoku Futoumei: This one is probably in the game again, it''s preformed
      by vocaloid Rin Kagamine, brings back a lot of nostalgia.

      9.) Mushoku Futomei: Again probably not in the game, but it''s the same as the
      previous song, however it is preformed this time by Tezuka.

      10.) Mushoku Futomei: Instrumental of the last 2 songs, no lyrics, very Big
      house Japanese meets jazz.'
