And I can't believe that there are 28 games that come with source code now!!!\n\n**** There are source code in both \"game\" and \"source code\" folder.  Almost all the games have source code now ****\n\nWhen I opened some game projects from IDE there is no files there because the project files  (.agk) are missing.  You have all the source files (.agc) but no project file (.agk).  That's not too hard to fix. Just create new project in the game folder and all the source files will be added to the project.\n\nMost games use two deprecated functions: LoadMusic and PlayMusic.  You need to search and replace them with LoadMusicOgg and PlayMusicOgg. Then go to media folder and convert mp3 files to ogg files. You also need to change filename in the source code to use OGG files instead.\n\nFor Linux users you can copy this bash script and save it to your path. This make it very easy to convert all MP3 files to OGG.\n\n[code]\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nfor fname in *.mp3; do\n    ffmpeg -i ${fname} \"$(basename -- ${fname%.*}.ogg)\";\ndone\n[/code]","timestamp_created":1575722801,"timestamp_updated":1575726345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.617442488670349121","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sv2m8O4CdYvU4gE="}
