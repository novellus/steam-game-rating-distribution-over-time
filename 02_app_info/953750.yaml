    review: '[h1]follow my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33882793/]GenXPlayers[/url]
      for more retro and indie reviews[/h1]


      I was attracted to this game because the character reminded me of chakan the
      forever man on megadrive. It turns out the sprite in the promo video was actually
      ripped from chakan (it has been replaced since). There are possibly more graphics
      borrowed from other places.


      The game didn''t start from steam because of a bug. I had to start it from outside
      steam, and then the menu doesn''t appear unless you press "enter", then there
      is no explnation or ways to change the controls.

      Once you manage to play, the levels are almost empty and the rare enemies have
      really simplistic patterns. You just walk until you find keys to unlock  new
      areas.



      If you''re still tempted to buy, take a look at the game''s discussions first.'
