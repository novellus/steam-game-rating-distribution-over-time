If you can get it cheap or in a bundle, check it out.","timestamp_created":1508086135,"timestamp_updated":1508086135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.670577585697174072","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jYe8kN8Ce7WxiAE="}
