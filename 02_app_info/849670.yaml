    review: "EDIT: This game is great, but without players, theres no point. VR multiplayer\
      \ is a bad buy, in general these days\n\nThis game is affordable and very fun.\
      \ Several different game modes (CTF, king of the hill-ish, deathmatch, etc).\
      \ The movement reminds me a lot of Tribes jetpacking and skiing combined with\
      \ directional boosters thanks to VR motion controls. They did a very good job\
      \ of making a visual system that minimizes discomfort despite the high speed\
      \ of movement too.  \n\nLike all VR games, this won't have the online population\
      \ of CSGO or Overwatch. Hop in the discord to take part in pick-up games that\
      \ fill servers! https://discord.gg/ceJbGqx"
