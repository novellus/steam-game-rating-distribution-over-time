    review: "Yup, it's a documentary about life-size dolls and sex robots. \n\n  \
      \ Fortunately, it's a pretty darned GOOD documentary about life-size dolls and\
      \ sex robots. Now, I'm trying to speak objectively here, as you probably already\
      \ know whether the subject might interest you enough to sit through an hour-and-fifteen-minute\
      \ long documentary about it. On an objective level, this is a solidly-crafted\
      \ documentary film, even if it doesn't quite reach the heights of Some Kind\
      \ of Monster or Indie Game: The Movie. Think an extremely well-made TV documentary\
      \ and you're getting warmer.\n\n   So how does it handle the subject matter?\
      \ Um, I would say frankly, but not indelicately, and most certainly not sensationally.\
      \ Suffice it to say, if you're even remotely vanilla in your sexual outlook\
      \ (like Yours Truly), you're gonna find aspects of this kinda creepy. That said,\
      \ the video doesn't go out of its way to make its subjects [i]seem[/i] creepy.\
      \ That bit's up to you. Like I say: objectively-speaking, it holds up pretty\
      \ well. \n\n   Take \"Davecat\", for example: the guy is clearly very intelligent,\
      \ and seems fairly self-aware about having one or more screws loose upstairs.\
      \ But the doco doesn't underscore his interview footage with eerie music, or\
      \ cut away to a psychoanalyst telling us how much of a fruitcake Dave is. The\
      \ subject speaks for himself, and it's up to the viewer to draw their own conclusions.\
      \ (That said, the fact that he \"plays\" video games with his doll gf, and she\
      \ sometimes manages to [i]beat[/i] him in said games, is clearly cause for concern\
      \ by anyone's standards.)\n\n   If this still sounds like an \"interesting\"\
      \ video to you, then it's fair to say it probably will be. Me, I've always been\
      \ fascinated by the weirder side of things, and this clearly qualifies. The\
      \ price is also perfectly reasonable, and all the more so on sale. The rest,\
      \ as always, is up to you.\n\n  Verdict: 8.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this\
      \ review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\n\

      Cheers!)"
