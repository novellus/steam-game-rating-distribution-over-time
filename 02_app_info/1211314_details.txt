It is a big improvement from the older SVT-38. It fires the hard-hitting 7.62x54mmR ammunition also found in most soviet rifles and machineguns.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ampulomet Model 1941<\/h2>The Ampulomet is a 125mm grenade launcher introduced in 1941 to give the infantry a weapon to fight tanks. It uses a special 12 gauge shotgun cartridge to launch a FBM-125 anti-tank grenade easily capable of penetrating 90mm of armor.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tula Tokarev 33<\/h2>The TT-33 is a soviet semi-automatic pistol. As with most Russian designs it is simple to manufacture and easy to operate and maintain. It is a formidable weapon, with good penetration and effective range.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">TM-35<\/h2>The TM-35 is a square metal cased Soviet anti-tank mine. When a vehicle drives over it and applies sufficient pressure, the main charge of several 200g blocks of TNT detonates usually destroying the vehicle.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">RPG-43<\/h2>The RPG-43 is a Soviet hand-held anti-tank grenade. It uses a very effective shaped charge HEAT warhead similar to the Panzerfaust. It can penetrate up to 75mm of steel armor making it very dangerous for enemy tank crew.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GAZ-67<\/h2>\tThe GAZ-67 is a general purpose four-wheel drive vehicle used by the Soviet military. It’s main design has been copied from the American Willys ‘JEEP’. It serves the important role of immediate troop transportation.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">42WLA Lend Lease<\/h2>The 42WLA is an army motorcycle used for quick transportation of troops or scouting. The motorcycle can be used to get one or two soldiers behind enemy positions for a surprise attack or reconnaissance.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Veteran Membership<\/h2>Progress faster and earn more Credits and Warfunds!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ribbon Boosters<\/h2>Ribbon Boosters will accelerate the progress on all your soldiers during combat.
