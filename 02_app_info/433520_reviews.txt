You are guaranteed to flip around the rulebook scouring for simple rules that are by far the worst formatted rules I've ever seen. To compound this they use several instances of synonyms for completely different concepts to further confound new players.\n\nEven with that in consideration, and the fact I haven't won a single round, I still recommend it.","timestamp_created":1608799878,"timestamp_updated":1608799878,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt7/8yfYCetjbvAI="}
