      \ Adventure! </h2><br>The desert plague is spreading from the East: a reminder\
      \ of a destructive past. <br><br>Man has evolved since the wars of old, creating\
      \ new ways to combat this deadly expanse. <br><br>Using Steel and Steam, man\
      \ fights this terror, as well as the monsters that spawn from its touch. <br><br>Now\
      \ covering half the continent of Terra Corpus, the desert\u2019s slow and steady\
      \ hunger is threatening to consume and corrupt all life in the world. <br><br>Some\
      \ of the desperate seek out legends of the past: elemental guardians said to\
      \ sleep inside the planet. Once resurrected, these powerful beings can be controlled,\
      \ and guided to stop the desert. <br><br>The legends speak of a chosen few who\
      \ have the ability to tame these elemental beings and reshape the world.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Our story Begins With One Such Person. </h2><br>Steel &amp;\
      \ Steam takes the best elements from the fantasy JRPG\u2019s of old, such as\
      \ great stories, awesome characters, and classic monsters, and combines them\
      \ with a touch of steampunk. It\u2019s like taking Lord of the Rings and mixing\
      \ in the Wild West. <br><br>It\u2019s a game where you, the player, decide how\
      \ to interact with the game. The classic games usually had a linear, player-focused\
      \ story moving the game forward. Steel &amp; Steam follows this model, but also\
      \ gives you the option of moving the story forward through multiple, intertwined\
      \ story lines. Any character you meet has the potential to affect the end. Will\
      \ you or will you not save the world? Who you interact with, and how, will affect\
      \ the way the ending is played out. Whatever happens in one city or town can\
      \ affect another. These choices give additional life to the world of Steel &amp;\
      \ Steam.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Who Are the Main Heroes Of Steel &amp; Steam? </h2><br>Noah\
      \ Phoenix, age 19, 5\u201910, 170 lbs. Favourite weapons: sword, axe or pistol.\
      \ Protective wear: shirts, light, medium and heavy coats. Noah is an adventure\
      \ junky; he likes to jump in feet first, while searching for the next mystery\
      \ around the corner. After a short stint with the Silver Head City Guard, Noah\
      \ decided to move on as a freelancer. Without Alyssa to watch his back, he probably\
      \ would have already bitten off more than he could chew. <br><br>Alyssa Noble,\
      \ age 21, 6\u20193, 180 lbs. Favourite weapons: fists, clubs or rifles. Protective\
      \ wear: shirts, light, medium, and heavy corsets. Alyssa grew up learning how\
      \ to fight by protecting her father\u2019s caravans. She likes to step back\
      \ and assess the situation, before laying it out cold with a good punch. Noah\u2019\
      s best friend and protector, she believes that if she wasn't around to watch\
      \ Noah\u2019s back, he would have been killed long ago. <br><br>Here is an idea\

    review: "This is very much my style of game, so I was excited about it. Overall\
      \ so far I think it is well done, but it does have its downsides too. I'm enjoying\
      \ the story, the battle system is straightforward and more or less as expected.\
      \ There are plenty of side quests available that don't particularly drag you\
      \ away from the main story but provide enough xp that so far I haven't had to\
      \ grind out any levels in classic RPG style. \n\nI do have a few complaints,\
      \ but nothing so serious that it has kept me from enjoying the game. The first\
      \ is that there doesn't seem to be a world map, which can leave you floundering\
      \ for town if you wandered too far from a road and aren't exactly sure where\
      \ you are. The second is that the towns simply seem way too big, about 3 times\
      \ as big as they need to be. The number of houses that have nothing in them\
      \ is mind-blowing, yet for those of us familiar with RPG style games we know\
      \ that we MUST check every one because the one missed have a unique item or\
      \ quest. This can lead to frustration if you have a few quests you do at once\
      \ because unless you've got an astounding memory you may not remember exactly\
      \ where you need to go to turn it in. \n\nThe music isn't particularly riveting,\
      \ and gets old with time. I don't mind this at all since I tend to turn game\
      \ music off in favor of streaming anyway. The story seems to be unfolding at\
      \ a good pace so far. There are occasional pop culture references that are fun.\
      \ (Dr. Who, Eric Clapton) If you're an absolute fan of the genre, I definitely\
      \ recommend the game. If not, I can't recommend getting it outside of a sale,\
      \ but it is still worth trying."
