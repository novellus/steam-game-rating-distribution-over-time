All the listed Mk II items and Bridge Officers are not that great, even for early levels, and are not really that useful. You'll find better gear just by leveling and you'll dump these quickly.\n\nAside from that, the Starter Pack contains:\n[list]\n[*]A \"Steam Powered\" title, that appears over your character if you set it up. Useless \"decoration\".\n[*]Resonance Cascade Modulator - a unique console to use on any ship, which may be fun for a while when leveling, but ends up being useless at the endgame.\n[*]Tier 1 Steamrunner Class ship - basically a different starting ship than the default one. You'll fly it for an hour or two before moving on to much better stuff.\n[*]Tier 5 Steamrunner Class ship - a quite good tactical ship for endgame content. The thing is, with the level cap increase some time ago Cryptic introduced Tier 6 ships, which are objectively better. You will be able to upgrade the Tier 5 Steamrunner to a better variant if you'll buy a Ship Upgrade Token, but it still won't be AS good as any proper Tier 6. More on that later.\n[*]Admirality Ship Cards for both the ships, to use in the Admirality System. Very useful regardless of how many ship cards you have.\n[/list]\n\nAll the items above are unique to the Steam Starter Pack and cannot be obtained in any other way. Also, the pack is purely for Federation players - there is nothing for Klingons or Romulans.\n\nIt may seem weird to pay for content that's kind of outdated, but truth be told, you can still get a lot out of it. The Tier 5 ship may not be as good, or as interesting as many of the new Tier 6 ships, but it's still really effective and competitive in all types of content. I'm still flying the Steamrunner on my main character, despite having access to nearly any other ship in the game that may be considered \"better\". It all comes to looks and preferences, as Star Trek Online is in a state where you can be competitive in nearly any ship, as long as you know what you're doing.\n\nIn short, I'd say the pack is worth getting at a discount if you like the Steamrunner's design. Plus you'll get two Admirality Ship Cards which surely will come useful. Other than that though it's hard to recommend the pack to an average player, as there are many other more interesting offers in the game.","timestamp_created":1466741742,"timestamp_updated":1466741768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.590909063816070557","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9OenwNUCddDJWg=="}
