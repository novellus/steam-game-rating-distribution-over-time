Watched some youtube videos and was sold on the retro theme, had no idea I was actually buying a sick f-kin game with tons of replay value.\n\n-DM\n\nEDIT 9/18/2016\n\nI've recently had interest to go back and play this game some more.  Was playing with a buddy and we were having a blast, he wanted to take a quick 5 minute break so I figured I'd pick up the newest expansion.  After I got the expansion, we weren't able to matchmake.  I also wasn't able to matchmake solo.  Prior to getting the expansion, I was matchmaking instantly.  I did some reading on the internet, it sems like the game has been like this since MAY.  HOW HAS THIS NOT ADDRESSED, HOW IS THIS EXPANSION THAT BREAKS YOUR GAME STILL ON STEAM?\n\nI spent (wasted) my time going to their website and contact support.  They gave me a cop out answer \"you'll have to get on our forums and find out when most people are playing.  There must not be enough players online in matchmaking.\"  We all know this is complete bullshit, because before the expansion I was matchmaking instantly.  So, I refunded the expansion on STEAM.  Luckily, it went through.  However, my game is STILL BROKEN.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled, no dice.  I got on the Dead Star forums to explain the issue to the devs.  This was a week ago, and I have still not had my account \"approved\" so that I can post anything at all.\n\nThis was my favorite indie game of all time until this garbage happened.  I had to update my review to NOT RECOMMENDED.  I will certainly change it back once the issue is resolved, I just want to play the fking game.","timestamp_created":1461799402,"timestamp_updated":1474214775,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jYmDn9cCdMG9Vg=="}
