    review: "Oh boy. What a pile of dog-dookie this game is. This game seems half-ars*d\
      \ and unfinished, and it doesn't seem to have anything that would compel you\
      \ to play it for any longer than first couple of levels before you begin to\
      \ start yawning.\n\nWell, let's start with the good:\n\nPros\n  - Starts up.\n\
      \  - Uninstall works.\n\nCons\n  - I had the Viveport version before and it\
      \ was in Chinese only. Had to uninstall both and reinstall steam version to\
      \ get English.\n  - Boring combat, consisting of holding your melee weapon in\
      \ the air and waiting for enemies to collide with it to take damage.\n  - Combat\
      \ has no feedback whatsoever. You feel disconnected from the \"action\" (or\
      \ lack thereof) all the time.\n  - (see above) sword/staff/wandplay feels like\
      \ waving feather dusters at ethereal enemies.\n  - Ranged combat (sorceress/wizard/scantily-clad\
      \ bimbo only?) works whenever it wants to, and there are no means of aiming.\n\
      \  - No sound, other than the \"plong\" menu sound effect. Yes, really. No sound\
      \ whatsoever from enemies or combat.\n  - Collecting loot is more difficult\
      \ than defeating enemies.\n  - Uninspired, generic enemies that don't do much\
      \ other than waddle to you to get killed.\n  - Movement and view direction control\
      \ seems to work when it wants to. You never know which way you are facing after\
      \ a teleport.\n  - Weapons are pointing out in a ridiculous angle, instead feeling\
      \ like a sword hilt they are pointing 45 degrees backwards which destroys any\
      \ immersion there might ever have been (unlikely).\n\nLooting stuff after defeating\
      \ the boss sounds straightforward, but in reality it is so much worse.\nYou\
      \ summon a large chest and throw the stuff enemies drop into it, and they should\
      \ appear in your arsenal in the \"base\" after you exit the level.\n\nSounds\
      \ neat, right? Quite simple?\n\nNo. Far from it. The problem is that the chest\
      \ is deathly afraid to be touched by anything and as soon as you take anything\
      \ even near it it decides to bounce into sky and fly all over the arena. If\
      \ you unsummon it and resummon it, the lid will be clipping inside the chest,\
      \ causing it to float in midair. Which makes tha already fickle thing even more\
      \ scared of your loot. Trying to throw the items (which is impossible because\
      \ items just practically drop straight down from your hand) into it makes either\
      \ the chest or the loot fly 100 meters up in the air and land some time later\
      \ on the other side of the arena.\n\nThis game is currently broken, and I would\
      \ not recommend this to anyone. Ever. Not even if it was 99% off. Stay away\
      \ from this garbage rip-off.\n\n0/10, Unplayable."
