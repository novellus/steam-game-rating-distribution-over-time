    about_the_game: Evil Cult is a turn-based strategy game about various sinister
      cults all vying for world domination. Whether through completing the Final Ritual
      or eliminating all opponents, the victory will not be easy. Managing a cult
      is a tricky job, you see. Pesky investigators, multiple offspring sects, bloodthirsty
      opponent cults, these are all threats that have to be dealt with or successfully
      evaded. And all that has to be done below the radar of the human society.<br><br>This
      version of the game was upgraded with a modern UI look and interface. However,
      the classic minimalistic black design is fully supported, too. Various long-standing
      bugs in the classic version were fixed and all gameplay features were backported
      to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the release of the first public version.<br><br>Features
      include:<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Artifacts of the Arcane Expansion</strong>
      - Use mysterious occult artifacts to enhance the base game.<br></li><li><strong>Multiplayer</strong>
      - Shared screen multiplayer is available. Join your friends or play against
      them.<br></li><li><strong>Custom Game</strong> - Tired of playing the base game?
      Start a fully custom one. Each of the gameplay variables is open for tweaking
      around in this mode.<br></li><li><strong>Four hours of music</strong> - An incredible
      electronica soundtrack by Jeremy Rice of <i>Curious Inversions</i> and <i>Introspective</i>
      fame, known by the fans of the original game.<br></li><li><strong>Classic Mode</strong>
      - Full classic mode graphics and UI included. Relive the nostalgia.<br></li><li><strong>Investigators</strong>
      - These irritating investigators never cease to vex the cults, bringing the
      additional challenge.<br></li><li><strong>Sects Management</strong> - Using
      manual micromanagement or an AI advisor, these, erm, devoted groups of unsuspecting
      people will help you reach your nefarious goals.</li></ul>

    review: Evil Cult is a relatively simple, but decently *enthralling* game about
      several cults fighting to be the first to enact their eldritch endgame, be it
      exerting control over the minds of all humans through the media, or bringing
      the force of a cthulhu-like entity to bear against the world, while avoiding
      the notice of investigators who will devote themselves to the destruction of
      your cult
