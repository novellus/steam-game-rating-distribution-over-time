    review: "I really don't know what to say. I just beat the game again after all\
      \ those years. It was the pure action that make me feel like high right know.\
      \ Like Nomad says you need to keep fighting. One of the masterpiece of all time.\
      \ There was just a little struggle while trying to run the game but sure you\
      \ can find a solution on the net. I am glad that I got a chance to play it again.\
      \ \n\n"
