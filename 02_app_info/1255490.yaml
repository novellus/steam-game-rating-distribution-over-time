    review: 'Up to this point, despite owning many NASCAR and IndyCar games, I''d
      never actually purchased a game that was [i]all[/i] oval courses. I''m newer
      to sprint car racing and wanted to try it, but thought road courses would be
      an interesting addition, and so I snagged this pack when I bought the game.
      The core oval racing in this title absolutely holds up well enough to carry
      the whole thing, turns out, but I still wanted to goof around on these, because
      I loved back in the earlier days of licensed racing games where fantasy courses
      would pad out the roster with inventive, challenging places. I hoped this would
      fill that niche.


      Sure does!


      These courses are definitely more a surreal rallycross-style experience than
      the minute-to-minute wheel-to-wheel action of most events in the game, but they''re
      just straight-up fun and a wonderful change of pace. The AI is competent and
      tough here, but not unbeatable; usually, weirder track layouts in these sorts
      of games tend to come at the expense of single-player gameplay quality, but
      not here. And as someone not too invested in the ASCoC itself or its roster,
      I find myself using the custom paint schemes included here on a regular basis,
      as well, especially the Shadow.


      I wouldn''t say it''s a must-buy to be able to enjoy the game or anything, of
      course. What I can very happily say is, if you''re looking at this and thinking
      "hey, this seems like it''d be fun", it is!'
