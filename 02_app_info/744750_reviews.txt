The game is short, but quite a polished spin on your typical tower defense game. Granted, I'm not sure there's anything essentially unique about the gameplay itself, except the VR interface is really well done and there's nothing like watching tiny goblins and knights fighting in front of you like a bunch of miniature toys.","timestamp_created":1609546804,"timestamp_updated":1609546804,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwsuWd4PYCcfzHvwI="}
