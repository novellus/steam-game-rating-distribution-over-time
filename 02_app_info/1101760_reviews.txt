It is clearly a time pass game. It could be a lot better but the developers left it as simple as that.\n\nGenerally I cannot recommend buying this one in full price, it far too simple and it is based on a unity template project.","timestamp_created":1604175539,"timestamp_updated":1604175539,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s4WUwPUCfoSyqwI="}
