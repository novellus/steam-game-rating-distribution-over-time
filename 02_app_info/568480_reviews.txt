As much as i would love to have one, just not in the cards. \n\nI was asked to come by Quickdraw Studios to play Space Slam before release. I got to preview the game in all its glory with a VR headset. I was totally amazed by the soundtrack and the controls. Smashing into planets. \n\nSo i'm only reviewing the \"2D mode\". You plug in your controller and go to space smashing into some planets. \n\nUpon starting a level, you have to go through the center star to get some BOOST and weapons to start destroying planets. I personally had some trouble getting the controls to work with the sensitvity but quickly fixed it. It takes some time getting used to the ship moving and camera for me personally. \n\nI really enjoy the skybox in this game, its so damn pretty! ALSO the music. they nailed it. \n\nSupport an awesome team ;) and QUICKDRAW STUDIOS. \n\nThanks for reading.","timestamp_created":1485211628,"timestamp_updated":1485211628,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545946598052978516","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnt7g5tkCcMescA=="}
