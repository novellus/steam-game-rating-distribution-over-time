      \ /><br>Paradox Vector is at its core, a first person shooter.  It's gameplay\
      \ is directly influenced by classics like Doom, Quake and Half-Life.   The vector\
      \ graphics and impossible geometry of the levels offer the two main points of\
      \ departure from these original masterpieces of the genre.<br><br><img src=\"\

      \ /><br>Paradox Vector imagines if vector graphics were still popular when the\
      \ first-person shooter genre got started.  In Paradox Vector you can witness\
      \ a different kind of retro shooter.  As Chris McMullen of Gamespew put it:\
      \ \u201CRemember the heady days of the first-person on-foot wireframe shooter?\
      \ No, me neither, but it hasn\u2019t stopped Paradox Vector from revisiting\
      \ a genre that never existed.\u201D<br><br>Inspired by arcade games from the\
      \ early 1980s like Tailgunner, Battlezone, and even the original Star Wars game,\
      \ Paradox Vector takes this abandoned style, and brings it up to date.  <br><br><img\
      \ src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1051840/extras/Impossible_Geometry.png?t=1604796279\"\
      \ /><br>The impossible art of M.C. Escher had a big influence on Paradox Vector.\
      \  This is not a puzzle game, but an action game set in a puzzling environment.\
      \ Hallways appear to go one way but actually go another, enemies may attack\
      \ from angles you might not expect, and navigating the levels may require you\
      \ to think outside of the box.<br><br>Don't think it's going to be easy though!\
      \  The ancient alien stronghold you are exploring is not abandoned.  Robotic\
      \ guards, Squid-Spiders and Flying Jellyfish will make your life a living hell\
      \ if you are not careful!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1051840/extras/Open_World.png?t=1604796279\"\
      \ /><br>Following in the footsteps of games like Metroid Prime, Paradox Vector\
      \ does not limit players to a simple series of levels, but allows you to explore\
      \ an open environment, retracing steps as needed.  Some weapons and items will\
      \ allow you to unlock secrets and upgrades, thus rewarding those who are curious\
      \ and persistent.  Don't let the minimalistic graphics fool you, there is a\
      \ lot to be discovered in this puzzling and challenging adventure.<br><strong><br>About\
      \ AMD Graphics Cards:</strong><br>It looks like AMD cards are not really compatible\
      \ with the line draw commands used in Paradox Vector, and users may experience\
      \ a very low frame rate.  I am not 100% sure that AMD cards are the issue, but\
      \ so far there are several reports that point to this being the most likely\
      \ cause of the issue.  It may be that there is a setting that could help resolve\
      \ the issue, but so far nothing has improved the situation.  Sorry if this has\
      \ caused anyone inconvenience.<br><br>I will be looking at ways in which this\
      \ issue might be resolved.  If you, as a player, have any thoughts or feedback,\

    developer_response: "I have heard from some players that the second part was not\
      \ as enjoyable as the first, but none have been able to express why with such\
      \ clarity.\n\nI really appreciate this feedback.\n\nI do want to clarify that\
      \ there are upgrades to weapons and health in the later \"cave\" and \"factory\"\
      \ maps, but you are right, they are not really new toys, just improvements on\
      \ existing ones.    \n\nPlease let me know if you have any specific ideas to\
      \ improve the level design of the later levels.  I felt they should be more\
      \ difficult, and there are a number of hidden health upgrades, but perhaps they\
      \ are too well hidden?  Maybe the enemies that shoot rockets should only do\
      \ so in hard mode ... or adding a couple more powerful weapons ... just thinking\
      \ out loud.  \n\nIn any case, I will think about revisiting those later levels,\
      \ so future players can enjoy the whole experience.  Thanks again for this,\
      \ sorry it did not meet your expectations.\n\n\n"

    review: The first half of the game is pretty great fun. Kinda claustrophobic,
      but fun. After the first half it forgets it billed itself as a metroidvania
      and stops giving you new toys, and instead pummels you relentlessly with enemies
      that explode on death and are too close to you to avoid the damage, enemies
      that appear around corners, little to no healing, and (most damningly) a total
      abandonment of the old level design that bears nothing in resemblance to the
      first half. Get it on sale if you have to get it at all.
