    review: "Man, all these soundtracks to games I've never gotten around to playing.\
      \ I think I might have a problem! (Do [i]you[/i] think I have a problem? Feel\
      \ free to leave your opinion in the comments below; as long as you know that\
      \ I'm always right, and if you disagree with me you're clearly in the wrong!)\n\
      \n   Actually, nah...if listening to high-quality stuff like this is a \"problem\"\
      , then I'm glad to have one. An absolutely fantastic faux-orchestral soundtrack\
      \ to what I'm told is a genuinely classic game. Boasting 22 tracks, it's also\
      \ got pretty good bang for your buck. Evidently a no-brainer for die-hard fans\
      \ of the series, especially on sale. (I could have done without the Lily Allen-isms\
      \ towards the end, though.)\n\n   Verdict: 9/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this\
      \ review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\n\
