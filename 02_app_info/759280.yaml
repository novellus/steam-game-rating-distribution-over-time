    review: "Before I write anything else, the Port of this for FG is not the Problem,\
      \ it\xB4s the adventure itself.\n\nFirst the good things: \n-The idea of the\
      \ Scientorium in general is awesome. It allows for a lot of freedom for the\
      \ DM to put into the experience chamber what they feel like. \n-All the important\
      \ NPC, Story, etc. is coded up perfectly. Only complaint is that tokens based\
      \ on portrait on some of the NPCs are not included but it\xB4s really a minor\
      \ gripe.\n\nNow to the bad:\n-The structure feels like it\xB4s all over the\
      \ place. Often the relevant info for a location or a chapter is spread between\
      \ the chapters at the start, the savage tales at the end and of course the plot\
      \ point themselves.\n-The differentiation between info for the players and info\
      \ for the DM is not very clear. So you often read something and think to yourself\
      \ \"this sounds like an important detail, let me share it with my players\"\
      . 2 Chapters later it comes back and says, now would be a good time to share\
      \ that info I gave you 2 chapters ago. This has hit me several times with this\
      \ adventure.\n-A LARGE part of this adventure is dedicated on the travel to\
      \ the Scientorium, which has some interesting plot points, that at least for\
      \ me and my group were rather hard to roleplay and avoid metagaming. \n-A serious\
      \ case of DM PC and not only 1 but 2. There are 2 very important NPCs that play\
      \ a massive part in the story. I found it very difficult to still have my party\
      \ shine with these two being around and the campaign specifically saying that\
      \ they are the only ones who can do it. \n\nWhat I ended up doing was that I\
      \ homebrewed quite a decent amount of the story and simply skipped some parts\
      \ of the travel to the scientorium to get to the fun part, the experience chambers,\
      \ as fast as possible."
