    review: 'An amazing game that in my opinion, would be very hard / long review
      to explain why this game is amazing.


      The biggest part for me is the seriously large amount of customization in this
      game from creating a custom player character to placing town buildings where
      you want them. Troop customization is decent as well and another part I enjoy.
      The multiple ways of ending a session are rather impressive.


      Note: Missed that this was for one of the dlc'
