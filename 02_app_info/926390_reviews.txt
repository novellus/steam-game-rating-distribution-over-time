I loved this game with just my keyboard (as it's controller recommended) . I was allowed to reconfigure my keyboard to make the play through enjoyable and more fluent. The art and little special finisher moves is sweet. The randomness of each run , upgrading gear , and further pushes each time kept it very exciting. Once I understood which relic , skill , and weapon upgrades helped the most .. runs got easier. Thanks for this game team","timestamp_created":1609440391,"timestamp_updated":1609440391,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49e2H3fYCco6XvwI="}
