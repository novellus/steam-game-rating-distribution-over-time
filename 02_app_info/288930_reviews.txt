Owl Cave were pretty well aware of point-and-click tropes, and the trilogy plays like a best-hits album of early-2000s Point'n'Click gameplay, getting in a couple of decent jabs and references at genre classics as they go. The writing is also pretty solid- The dialogue is pretty believable most of the time (and while we're at this, most of the voice performances are pretty solid, especially the two playable protagonists), and the plot is intriguing, but raises a lot more questions than it answers. Nonetheless, the mystery of Augur Peak is built up wonderfully, winding in on itself in layers, and it's pretty compelling if you can accept it for the incomplete work (or prelude to a work that was never made) that it is.\n\nI can say \"Incomplete work\" pretty safely, too, because the third chapter ends with a teaser for another game in the Augur Peak series, one meant to pick up the plot threads established by Charnel House and, presumably, explore the forces responsible for these strange events. That game is teased with a release window of \"2016\", and as of late December 2020, that game doesn't seem to exist. At the end of the day, that's the biggest problem with Charnel House- it's an incomplete work. There's real potential in this writing, in the characters and scenario, but another Augur Peak game was never made, so that potential is just sitting here, untapped (or at least unrefined), on display for anyone willing to buy the Charnel House Trilogy.\n\nAlso, it goes on sale for dirt cheap, so it's not like you're spending more on it than it's worth.","timestamp_created":1609280052,"timestamp_updated":1609280052,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwspuk2PYCc/fKvgI="}
