I have not played very long and the game is very much in early access, but what I have played has felt like slowly deciphering an alien language. Gradually, over successive minutes, I began trying to maintain a model of a three dimensional chart of graphemes in my head. I really liked that tension of gradually being able to intuit what moves would work as I played, rather than just going through trial and error or depending entirely on the visual clues to work very slowly towards scoring combinations.\n\nAnyway, it is worth checking out and I hope that it continues to receive updates","timestamp_created":1589155637,"timestamp_updated":1589155637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569591939449310303","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ48NTDgPICf5/5hgI="}
