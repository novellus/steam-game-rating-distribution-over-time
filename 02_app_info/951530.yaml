    review: "this is the first newer sigma team game i have played and it plays almost\
      \ exactly like the original alien shooter that came out back in 2003 with some\
      \ minor improvements new levels and a new gimmick.\n\nwhat was really good about\
      \ this game was how they changed some of the enemies from the original game\
      \ to make them more effective and to mix it up a bit, and the new turrets are\
      \ essential to play this game if you dont use them you die.\n\nand what was\
      \ not very nice about this game is that it reuses almost all the assets from\
      \ their older games with almost nothing noticeably new apart from a big acid\
      \ barrel a new weapon for a enemy a new boss and the turrets, all the music\
      \ is reused except for maybe 1 new track? other then that new track everything\
      \ is pretty much the same from ASV. the ui in this game is entirely designed\
      \ around mobile games which is not very pleasant because this is a PC PORT.\
      \ \n\nbut then again its just $5 so its not a bad deal so go for it if you really\
      \ want."
