    review: 'I actually got excited when one of the Investigations in Wonderverse
      dropped a hint about the Legion, probably the biggest element of DC continuity
      never featured in the game. In my review of Wonderverse I wrote about wanting
      to see the spotlight on underexposed characters, and here we are...


      First, this is the Bendis Legion. I don''t want to go all "not muh Legion",
      but this is what we''ve got. There''s few, if any, nods to classic iterations
      of the LoSH, and the characterisation is questionable and, well, Bendis-y. Also
      the Teen Titans are here, because this game really needed more Titans content.


      I''ve done one playthrough of the content, on Normal. The alert and raid are
      fine, difficulty feels about right. The final Mordru battle has an annoying
      mechanic where you can be knocked off the platform and I haven''t fully figured
      it out yet.


      But, biggest issue, the open world "raid bosses" are back. I was optimistic
      about this in Wonderverse, but it became apparent that these fights are absolutely
      essential to gearing up, forcing players to fight them over and over... and
      over and over... The currency from instanced content quickly becomes worthless
      once you start getting Elite gear, all that matters is the raid bosses. And
      they''re not fun. It''s just the same fight again and again with no variation.
      Small groups don''t work, large groups make them trivially easy, anything in
      between just isn''t happening. We''re down to one alert and one raid, with no
      solo or duo instance, apparently because the raid bosses are considered to be
      enough content. It feels like getting much less in an episode DLC, at the same
      price. And I can already tell how the long hours of farming these things are
      going to feel.


      As I always end up saying in these reviews, a yes/no recommendation doesn''t
      really apply to DCUO DLC, since you need it for endgame progress (unless you''re
      subscribing, etc.). But, final verdict, I just wasn''t impressed by this. It''s
      a poor showing for the Legion and represents an ongoing issue with the focus
      of the game, which I hope will be reconsidered for the next episode.'
