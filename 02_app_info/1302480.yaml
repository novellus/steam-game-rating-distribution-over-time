    about_the_game: 'Welcome to Slurkum, the fantasy based survival game where danger
      and fun are one and the same.<br><br>     Start with nothing but your wit (and
      a smile) to carve out your mark on the world of Slurkum. Develop your skills
      and reputation at your own pace, in a casual pvp environment where looting is
      the norm and karma is king. Resources are plentiful through mining, hunting,
      monsters, and crafting throughout the land.<br>The basic game mechanics are
      simple. Play how you want. Housing can be used with a land claim, factions can
      be joined for Order/Chaos pvp, trade your wares, or lurk in the woods and rob/loot/kill.
      It''s up to you!<br>     <br>      Game server environment is loosely based
      on key elements of popular mmo and simplified for a more casual gaming experience
      in that genre. Using a purely authoritative server architecture, Slurkum is
      made with the admin / host in mind, as well. With the built-in Game Master menu,
      administrators can designate trusted players as GM''s for events, disputes,
      and more!<br><br>      As with any situation, awareness is key. With that said,
