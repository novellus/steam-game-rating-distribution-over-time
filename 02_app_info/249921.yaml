    review: "Well.. to everyone who's asking himself if it's worth it: Would say -\
      \ depends.\n[list]\n[*] You only wanna use 3-Frame animations without the diagonal\
      \ ones? It is totally overpriced for the missing use of the payed, unusable\
      \ content, but yep, as long as money isn't your main concern, buy it.\n\n[*]\
      \ You wanna use 8-Frame animations or vertically ones as well? Get ready to\
      \ dig out a external script that manages that, because here is by far no explanation\
      \ given on how to setup this whole mess. You constantly have glitchy 8-Frame\
      \ character pics ingame, no matter if you put a \"$\" symbol in front of the\
      \ graphics file name, because the main issue is the missing script/instruction\
      \ on how to implement the DLC correctly.\n\n[u]Update:[/u] As a matter of fact\
      \ there's no help available from that DLC on how to use 80% of its content.\
      \ Measured by the amount of additional time you have to put into it to get it\
      \ to work at all this ressource bundle is barely worth 12 bucks. If I'd have\
      \ known this before, I would have definitely bought this ressource bundle, but\
      \ not at its full price. Sry devs, this has been a bit naively/clumsily repacked\
      \ for a payed DLC.\nBut here's an olive branch: You could've just added the\
      \ intel, that it never was originally intended to add vertical and 8-frames\
      \ animations, for \"it's a bonus content\". So you would have been off the hook...\
      \ ~\nFor more updated information, scroll down further, there's an own section\
      \ meanwhile...\n[/list]\n\nBackgrounds:\nHonestly: Great graphics, I really\
      \ love the series the devs put out here. And while the simple usage might be\
      \ fine, I think if not being able to use the 8-frame/diagonal movement graphics,\
      \ it would just be overpriced.\n\nYeah.. For a 12 bucks DLC you expect some\
      \ installation instructions to be given that are post-2012 and compatible with\
      \ this workshop version. Right now you get a collection of folders with pngs\
      \ and a blunt script doc that does explain literally nothing, because all contained\
      \ #comments are from the vanilla script. (Game_CharacterBase)\n\nSpeaking of.\
      \ Yes, you can see, that it's aimed to be used with the script entry Game_CharacterBase,\
      \ but don't you dare to copy paste it there, because it just causes crashes\
      \ on start. Adding it to the user edited section would do absolutely nothing.\n\
      \nSo in the end I'm forced to stick with the 3-frame animations and have no\
      \ use for the 8-frame ones, not to speak about the vertical movement files.\
      \ So I feel forced to use 3rd party content, which is not what is mentioned\
      \ here, nor what I've payed for. Don't do ads if you can't deliver a proper\
      \ guide on how to initialize those scripts!\n\nAs this seems to be a uncurated\
      \ DLC, I don't have much hope this user-\"friendlyness\" would change any more,\
      \ thus I fear this would stay no recommendation...\n\nYeah you can pull in Victor's\
      \ scripts, but as a developer you have to keep an eye on the list of licenses,\
      \ especially if they're for just free for non commercial use... sou.... If I\
      \ find a non-3rd party solition, I'll update this kinda report here...\n\n\n\
      Stressed out, but yet an\n[h1]Update:[/h1]\nThe script delivered within the\
      \ DLC only is a script that makes sure 2 block sized characters don't shine\
      \ through tiles, but become semi-transparent.Well how did I found out that?\
      \ Through the other DLC they released with that dwarfs&orcs. There's a different\
      \ readme contained that finally explains the real use of the script. A file\
      \ that is completely missing in this ressource pack.\n\nSo the containing script\
      \ has [u]totally nothing to do with 8 frame animations.[/u] You're apparently\
      \ forced to get those animation scripts elsewhere. They're not included into\
      \ this DLC.\n\nUsed Victor Engine now and here comes the thing: You basically\
      \ need 4 scipts in order to use all animations available for a character:\n\n\
      [quote]- Script: Victor Engine - Basic Module\n as a base module for the following\
      \ scripts to actually work.[/quote]\n\n[quote]Optional Script: Victor Engine\
      \ - Visual Equip to be able to display and switch different attack frames. [/quote]\n\
      \n[quote]- Script: Victor Engine - Multi Frames to actually use any of the delivered\
      \ 8 Frame animations basically (you still need other scripts for diagonal movement\
      \ or combat anims)[/quote]\n\n[quote]- Script: Victor Engine - Diagonal Movement\
      \ necessary to move diagonally at all, no matter if just 3-frames- or 8-frames\
      \ animations.[/quote]\n\n[quote]- Script: Victor Engine - Character Control\
      \ allows to use different graphics for \"Walking\" and \"Running\", when pressing\
      \ SHIFT. Also adds a way to define an extra Charset for weapon swing animations\
      \ or jumping animations. (Useful for in-world-battle games, without the FF-style\
      \ combat initialisation)\n\nLetdown on this behalf - you're forced to edit some\
      \ of the charsets delivered here, because they are partly inconsequently saved.\
      \ I.e. you don't have the same directions options on the same frame with different\
      \ weapons. This package doesn't seem to be optimized for world-battle animations.\
      \ There's editing necessary for the user.[/quote]\n\n\nThe above displayed order\
      \ is key! Add it in that order to your scripts under \"Materials\" and make\
      \ sure each script has its own entry on the sctips list + correct wording.\n\
      \nHere's the link to all of Victor's scripts for VX Ace:\nhttps://victorenginescripts.wordpress.com/rpg-maker-vx-ace/\n\
      This guy is amazing! Definitely consider to donate for his work!\n\nI'm done\
      \ here finally. Hope this saves any reader those hours I put into it to document\
      \ it and return them here, after figuring all the tricky things out... which\
      \ still is - btw - an ongoing, paralell process... ;)"
