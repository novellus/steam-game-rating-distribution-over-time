If you equip Levi's Halloween Costum every single Screenshot looks like it's straight out of a really strange Vampire Drama. Do not do this to the game. Do this to your entire soul. Buy it and make it a weird and funny experience. Can't wait to get the other DLC's to make this game even weirder and add more layers to the FanFiction-Base","timestamp_created":1559927433,"timestamp_updated":1559927433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543859660625457764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48vS6mesCfp74wgE="}
