Mildly addictive as all good games are.  A few minor quibbles.  Archers and crossbowmen are perhaps a little too powerful.  Almost every battle can be won by the effective use of archers/crossbows.  For historical inaccuracy though this pales in comparison to artillery which is far too effective.  It fires every go and inflicts significant damage.  There are a (very) few glitches in the software; in one battle a unit of cavalry suddenly galloped to the corner of the board, a distance that would normally take about six goes to cover.  Sometimes archers cannot fire for no apparent reason.  Light infantry can almost always run away from cavalry rather than being simply slaughtered.  The scenarios are varied and interesting and each is given a brief historical introduction.  Often there is more than one way to win.  For the price it is fantastic value.","timestamp_created":1597511768,"timestamp_updated":1597511768,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/OLH+fMCfJTUmwI="}
