      you will journey across giant stone archways, travel through dark caves, and
      discover ancient ruins.  Pay attention to your surroundings, as danger lurks
      behind every corner.  This world is full of hidden paths and secrets to reward
      exploration.<h2 class="bb_tag">Consume Alien Plants</h2><br>The Captain needs
      to eat to survive!  Be on the lookout for plants which you can consume to regain
      your energy.  Food items can have a variety of other effects, ranging from restoring
      health and protecting you from fall damage, to hallucinations.  Explore your
      environment to find rare and beneficial items!<h2 class="bb_tag">Battle Alien

      /><br><br>The game features fast-paced lock-on combat.  Dash around your foes,
      dodging their attacks.  Use your trusty laser gun to blast away at your enemies,
      or conserve your ammo by punching and throwing rocks.  You''ll be up against
      a variety of alien beings, including multiple boss fights.<h2 class="bb_tag">Survival
      Mode</h2><br>For those who want an extra challenge, there''s Survival Mode.  Survival
      Mode removes checkpoints from the game, and also removes enemy and item respawning.  This
      mode requires caution and careful item-use in order to make it through.'
