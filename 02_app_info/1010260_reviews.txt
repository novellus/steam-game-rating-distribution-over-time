This is much more like a visual novel, choices are very limited and, by Episode 3, some choices you make seem to be ignored anyway.\nRun in auto mode and you can clear Episode 3 in about 3 or 4 mouse clicks. I just feel like a passenger.\nApologies for selecting \"Don't recommend\". My intention was not to tick either box but Steam doesn't allow that. The \"No\" is only because I was expecting a game more like GP and wouldn't have bought this otherwise.","timestamp_created":1590925296,"timestamp_updated":1590925467,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568504810333251953","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ414OjtfICdsGwiwI="}
