You'll get sweaty and your throwing arm will tire so it's a great title to burn a few calories while being distracted. There's skill required so it feels rewarding getting addional points for accuracy and completing waves. The visuals are good enough and the physics feel realistic.\n\nHowever the title remains in EA without an update since July 2016, so consider this game abandoned by the developer so I'm giving a thumbs down as warning. What you're getting should be considered the complete game. With that said I'd still consider the gameplay worth Â£3.99 in it's current state, but loathed to recommend since the developer has effectively put two fingers up at us.\n\n[h1]30 minutes exercising in VR[/h1] [url=steamcommunity.com/groups/30minvr][b]STEAM Group[/b][/url] / [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33700466/][b] STEAM Curator[/b][/url]\n\nhttps://youtu.be/usuw2098Vwk","timestamp_created":1496534305,"timestamp_updated":1542113972,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw8vnJhucCdZbZeg=="}
