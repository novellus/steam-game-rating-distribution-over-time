    review: 'This game is not for everyone. Although some people complain the game
      has no tutorial, i think the game is pretty straight to the point, and as some
      reviews mentioned, it is similar to Creeper World. The game is also one of the
      few games that has "Networking" to its theme.


      The gameplay is simple, and the games has a Synthwave/Retrowave vibe. Although
      the gameplay its pretty entretaining, i think its price (at least where i live)
      its a little high...still got what i paid for. Some more content would be nice
      (different gamemodes like challenge mode).'
