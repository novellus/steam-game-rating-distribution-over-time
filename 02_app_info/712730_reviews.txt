In olden days PC gaming, there was a similar premise from a game called \"Evidence\". Of all the mobile-type thriller sim, this is the more \"in-character\" in terms of writing. Although the voice work is...like interpreting how voice acting should sound like.\n\nThe storyline is a plausible one. Might want to reconsider if you have heart issues because the jump-scares are quite effective. Personally, I like it. Not for everyone. \n\nRemember: IRIS is always watching over you...!","timestamp_created":1610000223,"timestamp_updated":1610000223,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sbnf7fYCdP6ZwQI="}
