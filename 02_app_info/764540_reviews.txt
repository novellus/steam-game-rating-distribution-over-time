Actually even half the price would be to much for what you get.  The screen shots above make you believe you will be climbing up big cliffs but they are not in the game (maybe that's why the description says \"plus more to come\").  It gives you an archway in a city that you can climb and it's only challenging (not in a fun way) because the controls are not very good.  The graphics are also bad the the \"Spiderman\" level with grappling hook is very poorly done.  Download the FREE Spiderman VR game if you really want to swing and play like Spiderman.  Very disappointed!!","timestamp_created":1609901772,"timestamp_updated":1609901772,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzvHn6vYCevnxwAI="}
