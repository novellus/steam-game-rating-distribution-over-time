    review: Might be an odd thing to say, given the nature of this story,  but found
      it enjoyable and 'restful'.  At no time did I sense any danger, just became
      absorbed in the story.  You would think, given the open-world kind of view that
      one would get lost in this walking adventure, wandering in the darkness, but
      I felt compelled to move in one sort of direction or another, losing the trail
      at several points, easily picking it back up again.  My only downside was it
      wasn't quite long enough and do look forward to further adventures from this
      developer.
