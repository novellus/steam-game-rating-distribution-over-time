    review: Bought for $0.49, but not worth it. If it were free, I would have immediately
      removed it from my Steam library. If the game gets fixed, I am willing to change
      my review. The main issue I have is that if I shoot the ball like I normally
      would, it hardly goes anywhere, but if I flick my wrist a little more during
      the release, the ball takes off like a line drive. Even if I'm standing right
      next to the basket, which even has an oversized rim, you will have an extremely
      difficult time finding a groove. Using the backboard for a shit doesn't help
      either. I think I got lucky when I hit 3 layups in a row. Please fix this shot
      mechanic at least.
