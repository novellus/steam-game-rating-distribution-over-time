    review: '[h1]Short, casual tile-visiting / pathing puzzle game with some original
      ideas and brain teasers[/h1]


      [b]As other Nannings titles, [i]Hexa Path[/i] has [url=https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/728270]a
      free version[/url] available on browser. Steam version has double the number
      of levels, with bigger, more complex ones in the mix.[/b]


      [i]Hexa Path[/i] re-visits a basic puzzle idea: visit every tile in the grid
      once.


      [h1]Puzzle features[/h1]


      To spin the idea, [i]Hexa Path[/i] adds teleporters, tiles requiring more than
      one visits, tiles that need to be visited in certain order, and perhaps as the
      most interesting one drones that follow or escape from you painting a blocking
      path while doing so.


      Puzzles start out as small and introduce the features mentioned above organically,
      with tiny tutorial-style levels. It feels very easy, and the first few levels
      were a breeze.


      Then, the levels start to become bigger and more complex. Some levels are quite
      brain teasers, taking a bit of thinking (though often trial-and-error will suffice)
      to find the right solution.


      [h1]Controls and sometimes the lack of them[/h1]


      You can operate with keyboard or gamepad but for me, mouse felt the most natural
      control scheme.


      My only gripe was the lack of undo button. If you get stuck, you have to restart
      the whole level. It''s a bummer, though the levels are fairly short.


      [h1]Conclusions[/h1]


      Free version has 30 levels, easily completed in about 15 minutes. The Steam
      version doubles the number of levels, adding some bigger and more complex puzzles,
      though it does not add any new puzzle features. Completing the Steam version
      took me about 1 hour without guides (dev provides a video walkthrough in the
      guides section though).


      It''s a decent pathing puzzler. It could be longer still for the price, so I
      suggest you get it on sale.
