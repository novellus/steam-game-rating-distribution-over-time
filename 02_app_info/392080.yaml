    about_the_game: "Our goal was to make a game simulating space combat between large\
      \ capital ships at extreme detail on the scale of individual crew members. We've\
      \ spent multiple years building a custom in-house engine capable highly detailed\
      \ ship interior simulations while still supporting real time combat between\
      \ large numbers of ships in an open persistent world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe\
      \ result is a massive open world where any ship, station, asteroid, artifact,\
      \ or wreckage can be entered by the player and controlled in real-time. Space\
      \ battles are epic and immersive because there are no hit points, instead you\
      \ have to try and survive as pieces of your ship are physically destroyed and\
      \ ships can be cut in half or filled full of holes. Play as a renegade shooting\
      \ up neutral supply convoys and scooping the cargo that falls out, or disable\
      \ and board enemy ships to take back to your hideout. Research technology and\
      \ upgrade designs to make your favorite ship into the ultimate war machine.\
      \ The universe is full of loot and enemies and things to explore, and your character\
      \ will have all the tools needed to design the ultimate ship and put together\
      \ the ultimate crew.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe also look at progression from the\
      \ perspective of RPG mechanics. Even though the game is a deep and detailed\
      \ simulation, we want gameplay to have progression, customization, and specialization\
      \ much like a character based roleplaying game. Instead of unlocking talent\
      \ points you will find crew members that add unique utility to your ship as\
      \ a whole, or you might find module blueprints that allow you to customize portions\
      \ of your ship's design to suit your play style."

    review: "[h1]In Brief[/h1]\n\nThis is the best of the best 2d ship building space\
      \ fighting games, hands down.  It's complex but accessible, gritty, funny and\
      \ the combat is a joyful mess.  \n\nBlow up, board, capture and reverse engineer\
      \ almost everything.  \n\nYou go from piloting small frigates, corvettes and\
      \ destroyers to battleships and battlecruisers.  The game scale goes from flying\
      \ and dogfighting to commanding swarms of fighter drones while maintaining your\
      \ repairs.\n\nBeing pursued by multiple enemy craft, using long range weapons\
      \ to wear them down.\n\nIn combat with multiple enemy ships, allocating bombers\
      \ and firing missiles while planning movement and repairs.  It is complex and\
      \ enjoyable.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1709879309\n\
      \n[h1]1/2021[/h1]\n\nWell, I've seen and played the multi.  It's no joke, and\
      \ it's as glorious as I thought it would be.  Players manning guns, keeping\
      \ the ship together, getting ejected into space or floating off with a severed\
      \ hunk of ship.  Boarding ships and capturing.  \n\nI'm in a weird place, having\
      \ spent literally years arguing with the developer to add multi and him saying\
      \ no, you're stupid and bad, shut up and now adding multi.  I should feel overjoyed\
      \ and triumphant but I was too busy enjoying it to really seek closure with\
      \ that.\n\nWho argues with their pusher, right?  I got what I wanted, and it\
      \ was everything I hoped it would be and more.  Eventually you'll get to see\
      \ this too and you'll understand.  \n\nI'm impatiently awaiting that day.\n\n\
      \n[h1]4/2019[/h1]\n\nAll anyone cares about right now is multiplayer.  The devs\
      \ either staged a very poorly advised april fools joke in which they demonstrated\
      \ a multiplayer game, or they have finally listened to their audience.\n\nThis\
      \ game with coop multi would sell more copies than angry birds.  Period.  Hopefully\
      \ some day the devs will stop spiting people for their failed kickstarter and\
      \ decide to become rich and famous. \n\nThe game has grown steadily over time.\
      \  Devs seem a little less active in the community.  The game is buggier than\
      \ it was 6 months ago in odd ways.  \n\nI should point out, as has been mentioned\
      \ that the devs can be arrogant, obnoxious and rude at times.  There's no better\
      \ indication what these developers are about than the fact that there is no\
      \ subforum for ideas and suggestions.  \n\nFor good or ill, this is George's\
      \ game and contributions are hard won, not eagerly welcomed.\n\n[h1]7/2018[/h1]\n\
      Back again with another 6 month playthrough.\n\nSo far, so good.  The new schematic\
      \ system does a great job of requiring effort to research the body of schematics\
      \ without it being a blocker.  \n\nThe combat system seems largely the same,\
      \ which is good because the combat is good.\n\nI've run into a few bugs, nothing\
      \ really serious.  The game is in much better shape than it was a year ago,\
      \ significantly better shape than 6 months ago.\n\nI have not yet run into any\
      \ of the things that caused me so much distress in previous builds - like the\
      \ RNG ship capture terminals. \n\nI would say without a doubt, that the game\
      \ in the current shape is a must-buy.  It's really the best of breed of ship\
      \ builders that are out there, with significant advances that many of the others\
      \ do not even approach.\n\nget it, play it.  you can thank me later.\n\n\n\n\
      \n[h1]1/2018[/h1]\nAnother 6 months, another play through.\n\nI'm extremely\
      \ pleased to find that the biggest hurdles of the schematic system have been\
      \ addressed through various means.  The former problems have been largely eliminated\
      \ with well thought out mechanisms.\n\nThere are more 'guaranteed schematics'\
      \ as drops, you start with the basic hallways and some other items, shops seem\
      \ to have a better selection of blueprints and you can take specific missions\
      \ from NPCs that will award you a blueprint you don't yet have.\n\nWhile the\
      \ game still has that (to me) unbearable feature of random chance to fail to\
      \ capture ships, I have to accept that this doesn't bother other people to the\
      \ degree that it bothers me.  I have a workaround for that so with the exception\
      \ of Marv's antics of shooting my passengers and running out of the airlock\
      \ to his demise instead of staying put, things are looking much brighter.\n\n\
      It gives me pleasure to be able to recommend this game, because I still contend\
      \ that this is the best of breed of build/fly games and it has tremendous potential\
      \ yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n[h1]EDIT: 5/2017[/h1]\nI've modified the game through decompiling\
      \ and editing to remove the 'random chance to capture a ship' and I can play\
      \ it.  I would not recommend buying it unless you can do the same.\n\n_____________________________________\n\
      [h1] Jan 2017 [/h1]\n\n[strike]The recent changes to the game render it unplayable\
      \ and unenjoyable to me. I would not recommend it with the current game mechanics.\
      \  [/strike] \n\nToo many things in this game have a 'random' outcome which\
      \ means you either save-scum the game or you deal with dice-roll outcomes that\
      \ are pass-fail no retry on things that can take quite literally 20 minutes\
      \ to accomplish.\n\nThis game is technically interesting, and has a lot of merit\
      \ in that regard but there appears to be a lack of cohesive design playability\
      \ grasp.\n\n_____________________________________\n[h1]Initial review[/h1]\n\
      \nSo, this is a very interesting game with a lot of emergent gameplay.  It has\
      \ some rough edges, like any indie dev game can but also it has brilliance.\
      \  The very sort of brilliance you can't find in AAA titles because no committee\
      \ will ever agree upon things that are controversial.\n\nWhile I wil admit there\
      \ are some design choices I strongly dislike and that I think will inhibit the\
      \ game's ultimate success, these are details and not reflective of the systems\
      \ in the gameplay.  \n\n[strike]Specifically first the game forces a save on\
      \ death, which is problematic since there are a lot of ways to 'die' that feel\
      \ arbitrary or are the result of bugs or a lack of indicators - such as a lack\
      \ of oxygen on the player's ship while flying, or walking over nearly-invisible\
      \ damage on a ship's tiles, or just randomly dying while going through an airlock.\
      \  [/strike]\n\nNow add to this, the numerous legitimate ways to die including\
      \ taking on something tougher than you are [strike]or running into rocks[/strike]\
      \ and you have a lot of sudden deaths.\n\nCombine that with the lack of any\
      \ remote places to respawn, and it ends up being a 'fly back to the spot' simulator\
      \ at times, which is super not fun.  \n\nSecondly, the way loot is generated\
      \ is awkward.  You can loot 'blueprints' for ship parts, however these blueprints\
      \ aren't final until you 'reveal' them, and at that point they can randomly\
      \ be useful, or junk.  If they are junk, you can alt-f4 and reload the game\
      \ and try again until you get a result that is non-junk.  I don't know about\
      \ you, but knowing this I am forced to save scum, and I find this method extremely\
      \ unsatisfying.    I'd prefer less loot and have it all be real, personally.\
      \  \n\nThat aside the engineering parts of the game are great.  Designing ships\
      \ is a lot of fun, and using your own designs in combat is a nice experience.\
      \  There are a lot of emergent systems that reward careful and intelligent design.\n\
      \n[strike]The price is a touch high for the amount of content available, but\
      \ the game was worth it to me because I've wanted to play a game like this for\
      \ a while.  [/strike]\n\nI have to admit, though the devs repeatedly deny it\
      \ - I still hold out hope for multiplayer, and most certainly more crew options\
      \ for the player.\n\nAll that said, if you are an engineer like myself, this\
      \ game is a strong recommendation."
