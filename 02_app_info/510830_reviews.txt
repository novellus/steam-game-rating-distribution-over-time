Once you complete it the first time, there will be a nagging sensation to come back and do it again - not necessarily to break your record but {no spoilers} for something that happens near the end which will bring you back at least once.\n\nin saying that, I still need to go around a third time.... Thanks George.\n\nI think the price tag is easily worth paying - it especially has a nostalgic touch to it - not just because of the 80s enemies but something about it feels like I should have this on a 3.5\" Floppy, attached an Amiga Power Magazine.","timestamp_created":1557502747,"timestamp_updated":1557502747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l7yZ0eoCfdD2wAE="}
