    review: "I review Local Multiplayer Games that have from 5 to 8 Players.  My Curator\
      \ name is \"Party Game Reviews,\" check it out for more of my reviews of similar\
      \ party games. \n\nI was happy to try this game, because an 8 player split screen\
      \ game sounds hectic and fun.  It was not.  Besides not all controllers working\
      \ and some controllers that controlled two tanks simultaneously, it was no fun.\
      \  I did not enjoy the mechanics of the game, felt very sluggish and I kept\
      \ getting stuck upside down.  Game needs a lot of work to be a decent playable\
      \ game.  Cannot recommend this game, but if updates are released, I will check\
      \ it out in the future again."
