Honestly would only recommend this game if you are looking for story instead of game play and even that's a long stretch considering that this is a dungeon crawler.\n\nThe story is solid itself but the game play is where it falls apart. At its core as a dungeon crawler it is just SO BASIC. Nothing implemented in the game makes it distinct or unique from other dungeon crawlers or even expanding on the basic formula. Abilities are so watered down that they devolve into your bare bones single target/aoe/buff/heal. The mechanics they implemented are interesting but just don't go anywhere or are not fleshed out enough. Being able to retain your abilities while switching classes is interesting on its own but due to the watered down abilities it falls apart. Each character has their own unique ability that they can use when exploring the dungeon but the game does not utilize them enough at all on top of laughable puzzles. \n\nMaps are pretty basic as they devolve into a maze with endless dead ends. Every single area plays out the same with 0 variety, a maze with dead ends. It becomes so tedious, every single floor & area I went through played out exactly as mentioned above\n\nOne thing to note are also the enemies. The enemies in this game have ZERO DEPTH. It all devolves into spamming your aoe's as the devs thought it would be amazing for every encounter to throw at you 3+ enemies. Enemies and bosses will for the most part do either a single target attack or an aoe attack. Clearly no effort put into designing actual enemies","timestamp_created":1606821202,"timestamp_updated":1609846251,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ434uU6fYCfListgI="}
