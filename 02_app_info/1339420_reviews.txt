The boy's voice during the puzzles gets on your nerves very fast.\nThe art is rather nice and it's puzzling to imagine that someone spent their time drawing all that crap.\nAchievements are broken.\nThe whole thing can be finished in one hour (of which half the time was spent restarting broken puzzles)\nIt runs very poorly because it's made with an app development kit and uses javascript.\n \nMaybe you can consider it as a counter culture art piece, it's the only angle this product would not fail. But then the dev should release more similar items to prove he's not just a shovelware peddler.\n\nBut I'm more tempted to think this should never have left the appstore it came from.\n\n[h1](follow my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33882793/]GenXPlayers[/url] for more retro and indie reviews)[/h1]","timestamp_created":1606917054,"timestamp_updated":1606952808,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527363181114196777","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5L32kvYCcvDgtgI="}
