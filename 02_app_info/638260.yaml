    review: "Second game in the Myths of the World series, this chapter features a\
      \ quasi Norse setting and pits you against the goddess of Winter.\_ Can you,\
      \ the Child of Spring (with your handy-dandy Wand of Spring!) rescue the goddess\
      \ of Spring and defeat Winter?\n\nSummary: \_Not as good as the first game,\
      \ but entertaining enough to be worth adding to your collection. 7/10 for reasons\
      \ set out below; get it on sale (and in the bundle).\n\nPros:\n- all the standard\
      \ features of a solid HOPA game\n- lots of HO scenes\n- puzzles have some variety\n\
      - interesting setting (but not enough done with the setting - oops, that's a\
      \ Con)\n- decent voice acting, though Winter's accent didn't quite fit in for\
      \ me\n\nCons:\n- everything felt... not quite good enough; (1) there were lots\
      \ of locations, but many of them felt too \"empty\"; (2) the story felt a bit\
      \ too forced and too linear (this kind of \"rescue a goddess\" quest is fairly\
      \ typical for the genre, but in this case the story wasn't quite charming enough\
      \ to make up for being trite)\n- the protagonist felt very generic (there was\
      \ a half-hearted attempt at a back story, but it was clearly irrelevant)\n-\
      \ the protagonist's \"pet\" helper was cute, but its abilities were never consistent\
      \ or explained, and some of the things it could do by chewing on things were...\
      \ well, my suspension bridge of disbelief crashed into the murky waters several\
      \ times, and I'm not really that picky about these things\n- the game started\
      \ to go wonky on me toward the end (for example, duplicate/shadow cursors trailing\
      \ across the screen); I quit and restarted the game, and never had another problem,\
      \ but it did make me lose two of the in-game achievements\n\n[b]Note:[/b] \_\
      The guy who said he was tired from fighting monsters, and asked the protagonist\
      \ to pause her (?) quest to make him a good meal made me roll me eyes; I think\
      \ it was the way he lolled on his throne while I hunted for a crystal decanter\
      \ for his wine *cough* *snicker*"
