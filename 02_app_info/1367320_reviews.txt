It is very varied you can play the whole Barbarossa campaign where you have minimal Russian units at the start defending hopelessly, or you can play a later campaign where the Russians are on the attack. and there are loads more battles, operations (multiple battles) and campaigns over the whole eastern front to play. \n\nIt's a very varied game and unusual for the CC games because you play a platoon leader with a set of units that you gradually improve/increase over time as you play. You do also play over several campaign maps going to and fro as you win or lose so that is similar to CC4 Wacht Am Rhein game although you don't have any control over the choice of battles here.\n\nGraphics in battles look very good they've definitely been improved - the front end GUI is small but when you get into the battles they are great to watch, hear and play.\n\nThe sounds are amazing in this game. The gun sounds and voices are great, plus the background sounds of other battles in the distance whilst you are playing are really immersive.\n\nDefinitely the best Close Combat experience you can get at the present time I think.","timestamp_created":1609706333,"timestamp_updated":1609876401,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4to2H6vYCcf+XwAI="}
