    review: "[h1]\u201C\xA1Caramba, Cooper!\u201D\n[i]~Pablo Sanchez[/i][/h1]\n\n\
      OK, let me put things straight. What we have here is not a proper new story\
      \ campaign. Not like you can ask much from a [b]$4.99[/b] [b]DLC[/b], but what\
      \ we have here is just... one mission. That's right. One... bloody... mission.\
      \ Nothing else. Literally. Nothing. And it's not like it comes with a brand\
      \ new map either. It's just a map from the main game ([b]Casta DeVitt[/b]),\
      \ updated with new goals and enemy placement. And you know what? It's a joke.\
      \ I mean, as you probably know, in the [b]PC[/b] version of the game you can\
      \ use some special cheat codes to customize the existing maps. You can even\
      \ share those edited maps with your friends by sending them your save files.\
      \ And it's an official thing, not a custom modification. Heck, it even explained\
      \ on [b]Mimimi[/b]'s website! So, having a customized version of [b]Casta DeVitt[/b]\
      \ for [b]$5[/b] feels... pretty lame, really.\n\nSure, there's heck of a lot\
      \ of [b]DLC[/b] around that feels worse than this. Way worse, actually. Those\
      \ greedy publishers sure sold us a lot of crap through years, can't argue with\
      \ that. But after godlike main game, something as poor as this... is not what\
      \ you expect. Even the story here is a big disappointment. I mean, come on!\
      \ There were so many possibilities... So many things in [b]Desperados III[/b]\
      \ were left untold. I wanted to know about [b]Marshal Ross Cooper[/b], I wanted\
      \ to learn about how [b]Doc McCoy[/b] lost his eye, I wanted to learn about\
      \ what happened with [b]Hector[/b] and [b]Isabelle[/b] before the events of\
      \ [b]Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive[/b]... But what did I actually get? [b]John[/b]\
      \ and his gang robbing [b]Casta DeVitt[/b]. Like... seriously? [b]Samuel Williams[/b]\
      \ from previous [b]Desperados[/b] games will be mentioned, which will give us\
      \ some hints about when [b]John[/b] met him, but that'll be just that \u2013\
      \ a short mention. Sure, you can't tell much story in one mission, but it's\
      \ not like anyone even tried much here.\n\nI kinda admire the fact that, even\
      \ though [b]THQ Nordic[/b] asked for [b]DLC[/b], [b]Mimimi[/b] decided to focus\
      \ on the main game and make it their number one priority, while filling the\
      \ season pass with something basic (instead of cutting things from the game\
      \ and sell them separately), but still, it doesn't really make this [b]DLC[/b]\
      \ to feel any better. As the result, you should either get this as a part of\
      \ [b]Deluxe Edition[/b], which is only [b]$10[/b] more expensive than the basic\
      \ one and comes with all three [b]DLC[/b] maps and soundtrack, or ignore this\
      \ mission completely. As long as you're not one of those rich kids who just\
      \ blindly buy everything in [b]Steam[/b], it just... doesn't worth it. It breaks\
      \ my heart saying something like this about [b]Desperados III[/b], which quickly\
      \ became one of my most favorite games ever, but still, it just.... doesn't.\
      \ Dixi."
