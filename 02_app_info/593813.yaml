    short_description: After Shu Kannogi tearfully tells Shusuke Amagai how he feels,
      Shusuke loses his feelings of ill will towards Ichigo and instead decides to
      help in their search for Rurichiyo. Ichigo worries that this would be considered
      an act of betrayal to the Thirteen Court Guard Squads on Shusuke's part.
