You can't find any players these days so the majority of these have content that simply go to waste.\n\nI picked up Full Metal Rocket due to the survival mode I couldn't get access to before. These maps are part of the chapters (story) we play and we have to survive for a short period of time. Or at least you'd think as while for some it is only 5 minutes we are talking about for others this goes up to 20. Being in the same spot with limited ammo (boxes do respawn), limited array of weapons, missing demon morph mode and tarot cards simply make gameplay aggravating. \n\nThe levels have their own (fixed) difficulty selection (this includes duration of survival); by allowing players to play with the settings and come up with different scenarios this could have been much more exciting. Also, there are new levels - one where we have more lives but by dying we lose the weapon we picked at the beginning. All that remains is the Painkiller itself and a mace-like bomb weapon whose explosion can easily eliminate you.\n\nI hoped this would be better but, unfortunately, it is yet another unnecessary DLC to a game whose remake is already messed up.","timestamp_created":1594084400,"timestamp_updated":1594084619,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":33,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.797987282276153564","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r562k/MCf6K1kwI="}
