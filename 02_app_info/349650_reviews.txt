So if you also have that problem, Just find the game on your computer and open it that way. It plays it just fine!\n\nNow that that's out of the way, this is a hilarious dumpster fire of a game. There are just some games that are so bad they are good and I genuinely believe this is one of them. I get everyone has different tastes but really, just go into this game not taking it seriously and the ending will send you over the fucking top, howling with laughter.
