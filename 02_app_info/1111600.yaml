      /><br><br>Klang 2 is a psychedelic rhythm-action game, blindly pursuing full
      immersion with dance music through high-speed combat. Conduct electronic symphonies
      with your lightning powers, wield magical tuneblades, and achieve a euphoric
      state of trance through skillful play.<br><br>The player''s abilities to fight
      and defeat enemies are divided into three categories: Strikes, dashes and holds.
      Strikes are the most common and will let you fast-attack the enemy with flashy
      fireballs. The dash makes you dodge and counter enemy attacks. The hold makes
      you deal enough lightning damage to shame even the greatest gods of mythology.<br><br>Klang
      2s not only the ideal introduction to the Klang universe, but all things rhythm-action!<br><br><br><strong>Key
      features:</strong><br><br>- 30 levels of intense EDM-Action. Playable at both
      normal and fast speed for extra challenge.<br><br>- Semi-procedural combat system
      ensuring the same track never plays exactly the same.<br><br>- Several boss
      types gradually changing the rules of engagement.<br><br>- Music by the legendary
      composer bLiNd, and other  talented artists such as James Landino, Arcien, Nhato,
      Steven Silo, City Girl, cYsmix and more!<br><br>- Techno-greek aesthetic is
      inspired by synthwave, musical symbolism and greek sculpture.<br><br>- Playable
      with numerous control inputs such as: Mouse, gamepad, drawing tablet and touch.<br><br><img
