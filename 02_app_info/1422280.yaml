    about_the_game: "Torqued Up Legends is a merciless arcade style multiplayer racing\
      \ game. It offers its users absolutely no mercy, ease of play or convenient\
      \ self driving help. Learn to drive like a champion because this isn't your\
      \ grandma\u2019s cart racer. Focus up because you need to ram opponents, launch\
      \ off cliffs and smash through barricades. Even the track is your opponent,\
      \ because one wrong move will see you flipped. From the backyard boggers to\
      \ the drift kings, there is a Legend for every motorhead. The game is not a\
      \ realistic simulation driving game, it lives in a world of arcade style physics\
      \ mixed with real world driving mechanics."

    developer_response: Thank you for playing  the game and leaving a review. Currently
      on the discussion board and on our website news page. We have stated that the
      multiplayer servers will be hit or miss depending on population as we make adjustments
      towards launch. We have opened up all the practice tracks to be free to play
      and will push up AI racing shortly so that you can get a better feel for the
      game. If your looking to race or test out multiplayer please hop into our discord
      channel. https://discord.gg/8Kjz4YuB
