    about_the_game: This pack will provide a route for players to find community-made
      maps for Red Orchestra 2 and Rising Storm, in Alpha stage of development, curated
      by Tripwire Interactive. The aim is to make it really easy for players wanting
      to have this material pre-loaded ready for whatever servers they play on. We
      hope it will encourage more server admins to run more of this material from
      the community, as it will be readily available through here (for free, of course)
      for players and server admins.
