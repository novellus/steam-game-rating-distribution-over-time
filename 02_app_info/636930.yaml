      \nSoundscape VR's innovation has led to the creation of two other advanced pieces\

      \ first mixed reality live stage, an award-winning art installation first debuted\
      \ at Burning Man 2017.  Designed for art galleries and music festivals, SVR\
      \ LIVE takes the Soundscape experience to the next level by blending community,\
      \ live music, and virtual art into a mesmerizing shared experience.  Soundscape\
      \ VR is also proud to present Sound(E)scape - a new application of our art currently\
      \ being used at the forefront of research into the healing power of VR used\
      \ in a therapeutic setting.  Both of these modes are available to license for\
      \ use by professionals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a world where unsavory tech companies\
      \ are increasingly using you as a product, we feel compelled to mention that\

      \ sell any of your data, period. We're extremely focused on user privacy, and\
      \ so pleased that you're here with us to enjoy this music revolution.  We've\
      \ carried our community-driven ethos forward every day for over 7 years, thanks\
      \ for making Soundscape shine so brightly as the antithesis to the social media\
      \ dystopia created by the mega-corporations of today. With hundreds of free\
      \ updates already since launch, we'll never stop improving SVR for you and your\
      \ friends; always made by music lovers, for music lovers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
