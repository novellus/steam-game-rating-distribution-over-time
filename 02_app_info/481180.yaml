    review: System Crash really hooked me.  The cyberpunk theme is great and the well-written
      story really brings the world to life.  There are plenty of different deck types
      that can be designed from the good variety of cards.  Earning credits and using
      them to buy new cards to strengthen your deck is very satisfying and it is pretty
      cool adding cards of the characters you meet as well.  I did occasionally have
      an annoying issue where the battle would get stuck, but overall it was a very
      enjoyable experience.
