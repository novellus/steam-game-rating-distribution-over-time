    short_description: In order to capture the Akatsuki, the Hidden Leaf cast a net
      that even an ant could not crawl through. Still, the Akatsuki elude them and
      frustrate Tsunade to no end. Around that time, Asuma and the others arrive at
      the Fire Temple, only to find it completely destroyed.
