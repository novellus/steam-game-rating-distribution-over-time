      \ /><br>KONSAIRI is more than a platform game, it is also a dungeon crawler.\
      \ <br>You enter the dungeons about halfway through the game and you will need\
      \ to discover clues and arrange the order of the bells in a certain way from\
      \ the inhabitants to discover an exit from each area. <br>Timing is a factor\
      \ and parts of the map must be unhidden as you play. <br>The dungeon crawler\
      \ section of the game takes a significant time to complete and is very fun and\
      \ challenging. <br><br>KONSAIRI is a clever puzzle adventure and dungeon crawler\
      \ that is suitable to retro-fans and players of all ages and experience levels.\
      \ <br>Your key to success is to learn the maps, master the veggies and help\
      \ NPCs out of their dormant state. <br>In return, they will help you progress!<h2\
