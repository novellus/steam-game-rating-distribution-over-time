    review: "Like Clay is a lot like an off-kilter horror experience akin to say indie\
      \ gem Horns of Fear.  They are completely different experiences yet they are\
      \ the kind of indie horror games that have stuck with me longer than a lot of\
      \ other similar but less...otherworldly (grasping for the right word) projects\
      \ have done.  \n\nIn this one you play a man looking for his missing friend.\
      \  You've tracked his whereabouts to a strange and seemingly abandoned hotel\
      \ and end up getting sucked through a rabbithole of a cult ritual and its crazed\
      \ babbling leader, demons, deadly traps, puzzles and much more.  It's not just\
      \ a walking sim as you can die and probably will a few times trying to solve\
      \ a few of the game's strange riddles to progress.  The further you dig the\
      \ stranger chambers you'll uncover in the deep recesses of the hotel and well...it\
      \ just gets weirder from there.  \n\nIt's not a graphical heavyweight but it's\
      \ somewhat grainy and not overly detailed visuals lend an odd charm to the transition\
      \ between the normal urban dwelling that you start out in and the cult's bunkered\
      \ stronghold.  You'll find notes, hunt for keys, avoid traps and a small handful\
      \ of enemies and even find yourself in an over the top boss fight of sorts.\
      \  I jumped more than expected playing this one in the very, very late hours\
      \ with good, noise-cancelling headphones on.  You'll definitely get the most\
      \ mileage out of Like Clay taking on its challenges in the dead of night while\
      \ either alone or being the sole occupant still awake in your house.  \n\nThe\
      \ fact that this is more of an actual video game with challenges and ways that\
      \ you can fail also ups the stakes and will keep you on your toes more than\
      \ a cut n' dried walking sim.  Additionally, a few of the oddball puzzles more\
      \ than hit their mark and can end you if you you're not on your mental game\
      \ in figuring out the rules to succeed.  It's not a hardcore experience but\
      \ it requires more thought than simply, \"Run over here.  Hide in this locker.\
      \  Monster gone.  Door code on paper where monster was near.  Type code into\
      \ wall panel.  Progress.\"  \n\nThis is a twisted, hallucinogen-blasted ride\
      \ for sure.  Don't expect triple A production values, the tightest of the tight\
      \ controls or a perfect experience (though the sound design is truly freaky\
      \ and one of its strongest points).  Heck, what is perfect?  Yet Like Clay's\
      \ inventiveness, fluctuation in puzzle solutions, malevolent threats and strange\
      \ story really create an atmosphere that is completely its own whether you like\
      \ it or not (Horns of Fear is another good one to check out if you want a completely\
      \ different horror experience as well).  \n\nThough I'm not wild about this\
      \ one's ending, I still find myself thinking about the overall experience from\
      \ time to time with the resolution that I'm glad I picked it up and gave it\
      \ a shot.  It's cheap as hell too, so what can go wrong if you don't like it?"
