    review: "Okay, so if you saw the videos, you know exactly what kind of game this\
      \ is.  It's an endless runner.  You have to collect little white balls and you\
      \ have to avoid fallling down through the open floors of the tunnel by moving\
      \ right or left quickly.  As time goes by and as you collect points, you move\
      \ faster, thus increasing difficulty the longer you play.  I played this with\
      \ an Xbox Controller and you either hit left or right on directional pad or\
      \ the right or left shoulder buttons.  \n\nThere are 6 different environments,\
      \ each with their own visuals, avatar, and music.  The visuals were adequate\
      \ as was the music.  I was not expecting much and this game delivered.  The\
      \ game ran smoothly.  It does keep track of your high scores, but I didn't see\
      \ online leaderboards.\n\nSo do I recommend this game?  Ugh, I wish steam had\
      \ a neutral option.  Personally, I didn't have fun.  However, this game delivered\
      \ on exactly what it promised.  I have a real hard time knocking a game down\
      \ when it does that.  \n\nI do disagree with the price point, especially since\
      \ this same game is listed as $1.99 on the Oculus Store.  Even on sale, I can't\
      \ recommend as it's definitely a .99 game given the content being offered. \
      \ \n\nRating 4.5/10 ... buy if you like this type of game, would change score\
      \ if more features added or price lowered"
