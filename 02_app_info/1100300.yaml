      /><br><br>Live through the <strong>life of a developer</strong> in Gamedev Beatdown.
      <br><br>Have you ever wondered what goes behind the scenes of games that you
      love or whose names you never got to hear?<br><br>Have you ever been in a meeting
      that felt more like a war room? With the loudest voice winning arguments and
      deciding what decision gets implemented?<br><br>Play as a member of a team,
      making some hard and some not so hard decisions. If you win, your choices get
      implemented. Lose, and your game and studio might head in a direction you did
      not sign up for.<br><br>Work your way up from arcade-style games to full-fledged
      AAA releases. Once you start your journey as an Indie developer, move to new
      studio locations and hire the right people as you work your way up in the industry.
