This game was more or less the follow up and from what I can tell its sadly worse then the first one.\nThe series in its entire shape and form is a very low budget project, but this game sadly takes away all the charm from its previous title. The graphics are depressing and the controls are a lot more clunky.\n\nThe main issue tho is the track design itself. While the last game had tracks which are around 30 seconds long, the tracks here are way longer stretched out to around 50-60 seconds. Because your ship automatically accelerates you cannot stop, there for all curves cannot be sharp. The tracks in general feel not as creative, repetitive and forgettable.","timestamp_created":1606589865,"timestamp_updated":1606589865,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wvuNiPYCdIrXtAI="}
