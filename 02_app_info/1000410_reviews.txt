I can barely see it and it screws with my aim.\n-weapons are unbalanced. no reason to use the coach gun and minimal reason to use the fang spitter, double barrel rules all especially with its OP secondary. cant say stuff about the goop gun(tm) as i havent acquired it yet.\n-environments seem too samey. there should be more variety in stuff like the castles because they all sort of just blend together. this is just a minor complaint though so i wont be rioting if it isnt fixed by the full release.\noverall 8.5/10 (for EA)","timestamp_created":1609528995,"timestamp_updated":1610063382,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.496753275394439697","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw37DQ7/YCf9++vwI="}
