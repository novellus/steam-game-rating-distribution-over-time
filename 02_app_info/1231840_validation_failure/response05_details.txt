As a player, you are a climber who takes on the most difficult and dangerous peaks on earth. To succeed you need to plan your journey carefully by preparing appropriate equipment, choosing a suitable trail, facing extreme weather conditions and surviving. Conquer your limits, overcome your fear and reach the sky.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Reach the summit<\/strong><\/h2><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1231840\/extras\/1.gif?t=1607690337\" \/><br>Each expedition is different, and the journey to the top is a great challenge. Conquer your fear, face your limits and reach the summit. In order to do that: traverse dangerous trails using specialized equipment such as ice axe, lifelines or carabiners.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Face numerous dangers<\/strong><\/h2><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1231840\/extras\/2.gif?t=1607690337\" \/><br>During the journey, you must face dangers such as blizzards, chasms, vertical walls, steep traverses, avalanches, and crevasses.

Sometimes it's better to take a chance and choose a more difficult route, but thanks to this you will be able to reach the summit before a snowstorm.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Survival<\/strong><\/h2><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/1231840\/extras\/4.gif?t=1607690337\" \/><br>The key to survival is to have appropriate tools when you need one. Each piece of equipment has its weight but also makes your next step harder. Ensure you have enough food to recover your strengths, or you have a warm jacket and sleeping bag to warm up after a full-day climb. <br>Good timing also plays a great role during the expedition. In the high mountains, where weather changes quickly and night falls very fast, plan ahead to set up camp in the right place that gives you wind cover making easier to survive.","about_the_game":"Climber: Sky is the Limit is a game with a unique mixture of survival and simulation.
