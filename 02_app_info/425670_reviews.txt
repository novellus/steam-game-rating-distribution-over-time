First off, it has the \"Dynamic difficulty scaling\" that sounds great on paper but in practice is entirely broken in its difficulty curve. Even when I'm taking it too easy it scales at a higher level way too quickly, and there's no way for the game's difficulty to curve back down which defeats the purpose of the \"dynamic\" part of its feature!\n\nWe also have an unnecessarily confusing and grindy upgrading system. For example, I love the idea of upgrading my max health and have better healing per orb, but before getting that why am I required to upgrade other stats with so few shards that are dropped in-game? Also, Life Seeker and Soul Stealer makes the game bearable, but that robs you from getting the needed attack upgrades to progress through the acrobatic chaos. This again defeats the purpose of getting the upgrades you seriously need, and the long-term upgrades are paltry at times! And what's the point of unlocking a spell that allows you to plunge down to where you can't see a thing when upgrading your existing spells is the better option?\n\nSpeaking of which, we go to another deal-breaker: The camera! You only have a fixed view that desperately needs to be zoomed out, as you can barely see more of what's ahead of and behind you. In a game that ramps up the difficulty level too fast, you will have enemies appear in front of you or in vertical \"blind spots\" from out of nowhere, where you would have much better reaction time if you were given any choice to zoom out and see ahead of you! And why can't this game allow you to see more of what's above and below you, both of which within half the distance of your horizontal view? Super Mario World can do that, yet this game doesn't have that! You can't even plan how to approach those areas unless you like winging it, which is risky.\n\nOverall, go for a better twin-stick shooter than this unbearable ordeal.
