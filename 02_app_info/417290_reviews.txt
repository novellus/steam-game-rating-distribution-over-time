While the stealth & exploration-based gameplay is fairly simple, the environment and worldbuilding is just incredible. Full of interesting and unique characters with wonderfully written dialogue, this game would make an amazing animated film - but in absence of that I'll take this very memorable game instead.\n\nIt takes an adorable anthropomorphic mouse, and puts him in an unforgiving world. Dark prisons full of secret passages and foul-mouthed inmates, bone-filled crypts complete with a ghostly presence, ancient curses and even unsolved murders - this is a love letter to classic animated films that don't shy away from darker themes, like the aforementioned NIMH or Return to Oz.\n\nI really hope to see a continuation of this game in the future. The engaging lore paints an expansive world and an epic quest that I really hope to return to some day.","timestamp_created":1610002858,"timestamp_updated":1610002858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgcDp7fYCdtuawQI="}
