My only complaint that with the Queen Sudoku game mode, the first level is literally unsolvable. The link here https://imgur.com/sRpAf0V shows the first level with all of the spaces highlighted that restrict where a 6 can be placed. When looking in the middle box, you can see that there is no place for the 6 to go, making the board unsolvable. If you can fix this, that would be great, because this game mode has the potential to be the best game mode this game has.","timestamp_created":1609561034,"timestamp_updated":1609561106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5azU4PYCeqPOvwI="}
