      a group of friends trapped in a house during a freak storm. Wander from room

    review: 'The Window Box is a slightly overpriced, very short, very good visual
      novel. It''s characters are charming, the art gorgeous, and the story interesting.
      The puzzles are mediocre, and not very fun. The story itself, without spoiling
      much, is of 5 friends reunited in Elsa''s house, when their lives are at a crossroads.
      Their stories intertwine into your experience.


      It''s good. If you relate to their issues, it''ll probably be better than if
      you don''t. Worth it on sale.'
