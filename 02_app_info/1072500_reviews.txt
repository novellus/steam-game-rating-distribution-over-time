Obviously needs you to have at least four eyes to play this properly. I never understand why put in the VAR when you clearly know it is not gonna help at all. Honestly, I did not know about this being a BigAnt studios game, else I would have never brought it. I have played the cricket games by them and they are atrocious enough. \n\nIf you have an expensive gamepad and you are prone to outbursts as the game is too stupid, save your money and invest on something else and keep your gamepad/controller intact. This game ain't fun at all. Fifteen matches down in the career mode and I was twitching to write a review. Give this a skip, even the FIFA from EA sports is better and that is saying something.","timestamp_created":1609769187,"timestamp_updated":1609769187,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482758641242980957","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4647u5vYCePmywAI="}
