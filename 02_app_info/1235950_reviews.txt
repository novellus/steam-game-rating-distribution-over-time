The protagonist is an arrogant jerk who thinks himself a poet but doesn't respect anyone else. I do wonder how much of this is wish fulfilment on part of the author. Much of the soundtrack is from artists who publish their music on freemusicarchive.org under \"non-commercial\" licenses. Which is what this 2-hour story ought to be.\n\nI have to say that I don't often come across bad Russian prose, and as such, this has been a worthwhile experience; but I do recommend spending your time and money on something better.","timestamp_created":1606465413,"timestamp_updated":1606466665,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.615105748176574707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ov+3hPYCfZ2pswI="}
