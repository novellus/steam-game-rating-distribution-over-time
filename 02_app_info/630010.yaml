    review: "Beh che dire, d\xEC per se la mappa \xE8 realizzata abbastanza bene;\
      \ una cosa pi\xF9 di tutte non mi ha convinto: la linea 6 \xE8 praticamente\
      \ ingiocabile. Non ho un super computer ma per il prezzo che ho pagato per questo\
      \ dlc mi girano molto le scatole, visto il suo enorme potenziale.\n\nOrdunque:\
      \ se non avete un pc dedicato pensate ad altro, una tra queste la X10.\n\n4/10"
