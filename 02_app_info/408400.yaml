    review: "[h1]A fantastic turn-based RPG that's enjoyable for new and old RPG fans\
      \ alike[/h1]\n\n[b]Introduction[/b] \n\n[i]Swords & Sorcery[/i] is a grid-based\
      \ RPG with turn-based combat where you lead a six-person party of your creation\
      \ through a large underground cave complex.  By the time your quest is complete\
      \ you'll have explored several cities, gained the support of dwarfs and elves,\
      \ traveled the elemental planes, and saved the world.\n\nThe game is heavily\
      \ influenced by the first two [i]Might & Magic[/i] games and the classic [i]Wizardry[/i]\
      \ games.  It takes the combat and character advancement from [i]Might & Magic[/i]\
      \ and combines it with the overall structure of [i]Wizardry V[/i].  That means\
      \ the structure is generally linear as you explore one dungeon after the next,\
      \ but will have to backtrack often to reach previously inaccessible areas or\
      \ handle your typical town chores (leveling up, healing, shopping, etc.).\n\n\
      [b]An addictive experience[/b] \n\nLike with the best classic RPGs, I found\
      \ myself having difficulty tearing myself away from [i]Swords and Sorcery[/i]\
      \ once I gained a few levels and started to get into the swing of things.  The\
      \ game never requires grinding levels to proceed and you'll typically be at\
      \ just the right level at all times.\n\nThe game can be played with keyboard,\
      \ mouse, or a combination of the two.  I was pleased to see that the game can\
      \ be controlled entirely by keyboard, with intuitive hotkeys for casting spells\
      \ and even for shopping and moving equipment around!  It was easy to get used\
      \ to the keyboard controls, and once I did it was a pleasure to play.\n\nThe\
      \ level design is absolutely fantastic.  Each dungeon has its own unique theme\
      \ with interesting monsters to slay, quests to solve, and puzzles to figure\
      \ out.  There are even some optional but very powerful artifacts to find throughout\
      \ the game that are a joy to discover.\n\nThe artwork for monsters and other\
      \ characters is done in a comic book style and is quite good, although I personally\
      \ am not a fan of the style.\n\n[b]It's a great game but could use a bit more\
      \ polish[/b] \n\nI very much enjoyed the 15 hours it took to complete [i]Swords\
      \ and Sorcery[/i] and ended up with very little to complain about!  Although\
      \ the 2D artwork for monsters and characters is fine, I found the tile artwork\
      \ on walls and floors to be a bit too simple and dull.  Likewise, although the\
      \ interface is fantastic when it comes to usability, it lacks character and\
      \ looks a bit amateurish.  Finally, the artwork seems to have been scaled somewhat\
      \ awkwardly up to 1920x1080 and has some scaling artifacts.  A cleaner look\
      \ would have been nicer.\n\nThe combat sound effects are actually quite satisfying,\
      \ but music is limited to a few pieces here and there.  The music that's in\
      \ there is fine, but I would have liked more of it!\n\nFinally, I ran into some\
      \ minor bugs.  There were a few times where defeating the last enemy during\
      \ combat didn't trigger the end of the battle... I had no choice but to terminate\
      \ the game and relaunch it!  Still, this only happened a few times over 15 hours,\
      \ so it wasn't a big deal at all.\n\n[b]Final thoughts[/b] \n\n[i]Swords and\
      \ Sorcery[/i] is just fantastic.  It's been a long time since I became so addicted\
      \ to a game, and while it's a bit short at 15 hours, it also ended just as the\
      \ structure began to feel routine\u2014having said that, the final few areas\
      \ of the game are far more puzzle-centric with much less combat, so it was a\
      \ nice change of pace during the final hours.\n\nI know the sequel has been\
      \ in development for some time, but I am eagerly looking forward to it, and\
      \ will definitely buy it when it eventually (hopefully) does come out!"
