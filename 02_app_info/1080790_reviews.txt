With a visual style that I, personally, loved, characters that are just fun to interact with, and a compelling story, I found myself unable to take a break from the game. In short, my only lament was that the game had an ending. I'll be sure to check out and play anything by the creator, should they publish any more games. I absolutely recommend Jack in a Castle; it's a fantastic game that, if you enjoy stories, you'll be unable to stop playing.","timestamp_created":1609109684,"timestamp_updated":1609109684,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8qea0/YCcsT0vQI="}
