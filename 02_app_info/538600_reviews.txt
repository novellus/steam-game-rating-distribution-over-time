If you're a fan from those comics and like puzzles, this is a good pack to have; they're all relatively easy, as they have a low puzzle count, but they're pretty good in my opinion. Unfortunately, though, at the moment I'm writing this review, the pack is just a day or two away from being removed from the store, as its license is expiring. However, if you buy it now, you'll get to keep it.","timestamp_created":1529208151,"timestamp_updated":1529208151,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.606323838233947754","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vZP6heQCeKWYowE="}
