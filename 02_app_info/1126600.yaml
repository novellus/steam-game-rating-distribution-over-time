    review: "The game plays exactly like a walking sim - it's very beautiful but progresses\
      \ pretty slow. My only concern is that it was hard to \"pick chapters\" to go\
      \ back to when finishing the rest of the achievements. \n\nThere were some parts\
      \ of the game where the controls became very stiff and the transitions were\
      \ way too abrupt that it became confusing, breaking immersion into the game.\
      \ This may have been intentional, to add context to the story, but I just hated\
      \ it. I also hated that the mouse sensitivity would change during the dialogue,\
      \ again, another example of just breaking immersion. \n\nI'd still recommend\
      \ the game because the story is very nice, I just didn't like it as much as\
      \ I did other walking sims."
