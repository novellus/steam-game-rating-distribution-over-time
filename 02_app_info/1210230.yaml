      /><br><br>The Fall of Suits City marks the turn of the Final Business Cycle.
      Unbeknownst to most people on Business Planet, the beginning of the end has
      arrived. Those that had prepared for this day were also The ones who caused
      it. At the center of it all is one, recently fired, CEO. The CEO of the terminated
      Suits City. When a city is recycled it is meant to be placed under total quarantine,
      fumigation and extermination. The Shareholders of Business Planet, framers of
      the Declaration of Busidependence, outlined this process in Addendum One: Redaction.
      However, in the world of business, employees are only as reliable as they are
      built to be, and the CEO is now a wanted fugitive. His crime, survival. The
      Shareholders aren''t happy and they plan on finishing the job themselves. Your
      only hope for survival is to befriend the enemy of thine enemy and prepare the
      offensive. Take them out before they come for you, and stop the Shareholders
      from obtaining Absolute Power, lest they destroy anything and everything you''ve
      ever known. Or, perhaps, you will fall to the poisonous temptations of corruption
      before you have the opportunity to exact your vengeance on the world that created
      you and the world that seeks to destroy you.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1210230/extras/combat.png?t=1603029669"
      /><br><br>Suits: Absolute Power uses a Popsicle-Puppet, Sketch-Art style turn-based
      combat system. With features such as, party members, special attacks, enchanted
      relics, consumable stimulants, uniform-style armor system and a wide array of
      &quot;Strictly-Professional&quot; briefcases wielding immense power. Introducing
      a new &quot;Corruption-Mode&quot; mechanic, with unique character transformations
      that change your set of attacks to deal immense damage at the low, low price
      of your eternal and immortal soul :)'
