      all the images in the opened folder in-order.  Images can be viewed one-at-a-time,

    review: 'ITS THE BEST for 2d picture,  the only one I found that let you play
      with the position and zoom on the picture while in a wall slideshow, you can
      change picture left and right with controller physical button but also move
      them in any direction with the VR controller.  best of both world.



      Positive: simple, easy,  load all the folder pic at the start, so realtime and
      fast picture switching.


      negative:  interface need visual polishing,


      Big negative: No way to search for picture folder in interface, you need to
      copy the folder location adresse in windows and then use the paste button in
      the VR interface.  it only load the picture in the selected folder not subfolder,
      would not be a problem it you could change folder in the VR interface.


      I have WMR odyssey plus, zoom button work but a little bit buggy but work, (
      I use driver that force simulate vive wand ) the rest is perfect


      Suggesiton:


      would be nice to be able to zoom in and out with the Vr controller position
      (idea: hold right trigger to move picture and left trigger to zoom with both
      controller mouvment ?)

      Could be nice to be able to move around with the joystick of WMR or the slide
      pad, could be made for zoom and position too.'
