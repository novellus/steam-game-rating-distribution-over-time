    review: "When I first bought a playstation 1, one of the first games i bought\
      \ for it was star wars rebel assault 2. When I played it back then, I thought\
      \ it was pretty fun. It was a lot like playing the old star wars arcade game\
      \ with better graphics and music. That is pretty much what it still is. \nRebel\
      \ assault one works but the controls are horrible. Never played rebel assault\
      \ one before. Rebel assault 2 works fine along with the controls for it. I bought\
      \ it on sale for 3.49 dollars. I bought it mostly out of nostalgia.  I would\
      \ not pay more than this or have very high expectations for this game."
