    review: 'The trailer caught my eye with it''s shooting trains and I thought I''d
      give it a shot (hehe).


      I liked:

      + Novel Concept

      + Hitting targets accurately is satisfying

      + It''s pretty


      Didn''t like:

      - There''s this one annoying sound bug while aiming sometimes

      - Tutorial broke a couple of times while playing

      - It''s Early Access, so waiting for the campaign!


      TLDR: I recommend it, it''s worth checking out at least because there''s no
      other game like this'
