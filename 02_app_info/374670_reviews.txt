Servers got pulled somewhere along half of March 2018 and never got back up. It's the end of April 2018, time to move on.\n\n==================================================\n\nThis is one of the most fascinating match-3 games I've ever played.\n\nIt's well polished, beautiful and even a weird kind of cute.\nOn the other hand it's chaotic, hectic and filled with destruction.\n\nWhat's not to like?\n\nA match usually takes only a couple of minutes, if even that. The game boots fast and plays fast, so it's a great game to play when you got less than half an hour to kill.","timestamp_created":1485088583,"timestamp_updated":1524415462,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwp7+P9+ICf8ydcA=="}
