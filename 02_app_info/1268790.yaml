      \ /><br><br><strong><u>Dark Fracture</u></strong> is an indie psychological\
      \ horror game played in first-person, targeted for early access release in 2021.<br><br>Over\
      \ the course of the game, the player is faced with the character\u2019s inner\
      \ chaos \u2013 witnessing the world change around him as the barrier between\
      \ reality and imagination seems to crumble.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1268790/extras/GIF_-_Other_World_Mix.gif?t=1609720124\"\

      \ /><br>Dark Fracture takes place in the late '90s, set in an isolated forested\
      \ region in the rural USA. You are put in the shoes of Edward: a body farm employee\
      \ who is pained by his past, and only finding solace in the medicine that helps\
      \ him get through the day. Edward is barely able to cope with his personal issues,\
      \ which are only intensified by him living in solitude. He puts on a brave front\
      \ and dutifully wakes up for work every day. His routine serves as his only\
      \ anchor, but deep inside, trouble is simmering...<br><br>One night, while working\
      \ the dreaded midnight shift, a chain of disturbing\_events draws Edward ever\
      \ close to losing his grip on reality. As the very fabric of his world seems\
      \ to unravel and twist. His home of the past few years is being pulled from\
      \ under his feet. The cruel hand of fate once more nudging him towards disaster.\
      \ One that threatens to engulf Edward's home in shadow.<br><br>Is it merely\
      \ his mind playing tricks on him? Or perhaps there truly is something darker\
      \ clawing at his heels, threatening to drag him into the depths? We're counting\
      \ on you to figure it out: The choices you make will shape the results of his\
      \ terrifying tale. Trapped between a world of horrors inspired by the works\
      \ of ones\_such as H.R. Giger, and the unkind reality of the body farm from\
      \ whence he came. Survive a twofold nightmare in Dark Fracture!<br><br><img\
