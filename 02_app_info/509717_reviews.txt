Don't know for the Guitar.\n\"Footloose\" is the definate want from this pack, but you can get just that.\n\"I Wanna Rock\" was more fun to play than I expected so I would recommend that one also.\n\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\" was a disppointment.\n\nIf you only want two of the songs then get them seperate because it's cheaper than the song pack.","timestamp_created":1498526165,"timestamp_updated":1498526165,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gNXH89wCePOhfQ=="}
