    review: 'Well worth playing, I had a lot of fun.  Also, despite its age, I had
      no technical problems running on Windows 10 in 2021.  I note that letting the
      configuration module do its thing upon start-up probably helped.


      Pros:

      - well-written, funny

      - excellent voice acting (lack of perfect accents didn''t bother me; the voice
      actors did a nice job capturing the characters with very few mispronunciations
      of difficult words/terms)

      - the protagonist Nina is a good blend of intelligent and a tiny bit naive;
      she doesn''t know it all, but she''s smart; she isn''t a complete daredevil,
      but she''s courageous and not whiny

      - secondary characters, including the secondary lead, are reasonably well-developed

      - the scenery and art is great; despite older graphics, the game is immersive
      - Russia, Cuba, Ireland are all nicely captured

      - the game only made me think "and how the heck could I know that??" once; the
      other couple of times I consulted a walkthrough were on me (as a moderately
      experienced player, I should have known)**


      ** not that checking a walkthrough is inherently a bad thing:  always remember
      that the most important thing about gaming is enjoyment! This is the beauty
      of single-player games...


      Cons:

      - you absolutely do have to get your mind into adventure game logic in order
      to solve certain puzzles/ situations (is this really a con, since this *is*
      an adventure game?)

      - no true widescreen (due to the age)

      - no Steam achievements or cards


      [b]Overall:[/b]  Definitely recommended for anybody who appreciates old-school
      adventure games with lots of action and humour.  I appreciate games that put
      obvious thought into the story and make the mystery interesting.  The ending
      is slightly weaker than the game as a whole, but it''s not bad.
