Just when you think you've found everything in the game, you discover something new! Between the story, the puzzles, and the characters, there's tons to love. The story keeps you interested, the puzzles are challenging without the \"wtf do i do\" factor, and the characters are SO CUTE! The folks who made this clearly have a passion for games! 10/10","timestamp_created":1609816784,"timestamp_updated":1609816784,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyNej6PYCf5zLwAI="}
