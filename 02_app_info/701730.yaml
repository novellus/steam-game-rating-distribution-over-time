    reviews: "\u201CAfter several playthroughs, I was craving to play more story games\
      \ with a focus on original music ... this could be an excellent platform for\
      \ more original composers to feature their music in a unique, visual way.\u201D\

      The unique draw of Yi is the live band, and music that reacts to you. Each act\
      \ of the game is a new song with the in-game actors performing the verses naturally\
      \ as you come into contact with them.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.pcaficionado.com/2017/11/29/yi-and-the-thousand-moons-review/\"\
