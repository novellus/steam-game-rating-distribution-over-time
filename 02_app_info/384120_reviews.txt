Like Wonder Women but a cat??? nah. This is SPACE KITTY in a rad 3 legged super robot, on a mysterious planet, looking for his kitty friend.  A simple one click platformer game, that all you do is jump jump jump to get though the levels and collect gems. Levels put you through the typical jump over, under, on and through fire, air, mechanical deathtraps and baddies like bats, on a giant cart system. The cart railway is just there with this cart and you use it. The collections for gems, I don't know why... maybe for his kitty friend? or fuel for his rad 3 legged super robot? The music is upbeat and the graphics are pretty clean cut with a style I personally liked. The chill looking black cat in his rad 3 legged super robot is nifty. I do wish there was lasers or something epic added, but it'll do.  Bosses like giant crabs are interesting and different. For a fun, little, simple, click, adventure I think it's a good game. Especially for all those cat enthusiasts and crazies out there that need a cat super hero. WONDERCAT IS HERE!!!! With 50 something levels and 5 worlds and 5 bosses, it'll keep you busy for a while.","timestamp_created":1463365118,"timestamp_updated":1602559285,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477874010801315308","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48ML+j/UCcuLkVw=="}
