    about_the_game: "Throughout the twentieth century, the Union Pacific had an insatiable\
      \ hunger for super power, an appetite that gave form to the \u201CBig Boy\u201D\
      \ in the steam era, 5,000-horsepower double diesels in the 1960s, and powerful\
      \ General Electric gas-turbine-electric locomotives (GTELs) in between. And\
      \ now, through the talents of developer DTM, Union Pacific\u2019s first-generation\
      \ of turbines \u2013 in three authentic versions \u2013 is ready to take the\
      \ rails in Train Simulator!<br><br>The Union Pacific GTEL pack includes the\
      \ unique double-cab 4,500-horsepower turbine General Electric prototype demonstrator\
      \ of 1948; Union Pacific\u2019s initial order of \u201Cstandard\u201D 4,500-horsepower\
      \ GE turbines of 1952-53; and the railroad\u2019s distinctive \u201Cveranda\u201D\
      \ GE turbines of 1954, all with realistic and interactive operating controls!\
      \ <br><br>Built to haul heavy tonnage at speed over long distances, the 4,500-horsepower\
      \ turbines primarily worked Union Pacific\u2019s main line between Council Bluffs,\
      \ Iowa, and Ogden, Utah, including regular appearances on UP\u2019s famed and\
      \ challenging Sherman Hill.<br><br>Although equipped with their own fuel tanks,\
      \ the turbines\u2019 robust appetite for fuel resulted in Union Pacific adding\
      \ fuel tenders, most of which were rebuilt from Class 18-C tenders from retired\
      \ 9000-series UP 4-12-2 steam locomotives.<br><br>The prototype 4,500-horsepower\
      \ turbine demonstrator was unique in having operating cabs at each end and was\
      \ owned by GE. It served on the Union Pacific, wearing road number 50 and UP\
      \ livery, from 1949 through 1951. Union Pacific\u2019s order of ten turbines\
      \ of 1952-53 (road numbers 51-60) was similar to the prototype in have a standard\
      \ streamlined carbody, but with a single operation cab. Union Pacific\u2019\
      s final order of fifteen 4,500-horsepower turbines of 1954 (road numbers 61-75)\
      \ were distinctive in having a \u201Cveranda\u201D style carbody which allowed\
      \ improved access to the engine compartment. All of Union Pacific\u2019s 4,500-horsepowetr\
      \ GTELs rode on a B+B-B+B truck configuration. UP\u2019s 4,500-horsepower turbines\
      \ operated until 1964, by which time they were replaced by the railroad\u2019\
      s 8,500-horsepower \u201CBig Blow\u201D turbines.<br><br>The Train Simulator\
      \ Union Pacific GTEL pack includes all three 4,500-horsepower turbine variants,\
      \ plus fuel tender and a selection of period-appropriate freight rolling stock\
      \ including 46-foot gondola, 40-boxcar in multiple liveries, 4,000-gallon tank\
      \ car, R-30-6 refrigerator car, and Union Pacific CA-5 caboose. The carbody\
      \ details of the standard turbine can be customized and the turbines are provided\

    review: Very well done by DTM, The modelling is perfect, sounds awesome. The caboose
      is so well done and the inside is very well made. I really recommend this DLC
      with hands down. What also caught my eye is the cab lights, very cool indeed,
      then all the wagons that comes with this DLC above it all and surely worth much
      more than the price asked.
