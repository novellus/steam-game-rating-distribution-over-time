    review: 'It''s a very simple shooting game, just pick up the weapon from the ground
      and shoot at the giant monster. The operation is very simple and can be recommended
      for people who have not been exposed to VR. Each game is only a few minutes,
      and the specific game opponents seem to be random, you can''t choose at all.
      However, it is not recommended to buy at the original price, which is too expensive.
      Think about it when you are discounted.
