    review: 'Edited 12/17/20


      First, the big positive, and this may be a niche thing, but as a painter myself,
      I really appreciate how detailed the paintings in this gallery are. Not only
      in resolution, but being able to see thickly painted brush strokes in real 3d,
      the shininess or matteness in areas of the paintings, plus many other very subtle
      details. It''s something very unique to this app, I''ve tried some VR museum
      apps, and they fail to capture the texture and sheen of real paintings, those
      apps usually opt to use a generic bumpmap texture instead of actual scanning
      data. You can tell the devs really put effort into giving a real feeling art
      experience.


      They actually addressed my previous review gripes in an update with more polish
      to the environment and in my opinion did a fantastic job, adding a level of
      surreal quality of the house being on a house sized island in the middle of
      a storm.


      I really recommend this if you are an art lover. Just know that this is not
      a game, it is an experience. Also note that it''s not a huge show, but the works
      that are included are amazingly brought to life. I hope the developers continue
      to refine and release content more content this (and more paintings please!)
      It''s very nice to be able to view art and go somewhere new when not being able
      to leave home.'
