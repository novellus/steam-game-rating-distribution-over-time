Long ago it was the home of the brilliant and yet dangerous alchemists, but now lies abandoned and devastated.

To explore the world you will need to use the power gained through combining the four elements — fire, water, air, earth — along with various ingredients. By making different potions, you will be able to explore the regions, solve alchemical puzzles, and fight dreadful enemies.
