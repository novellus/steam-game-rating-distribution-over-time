It IS co-op, just not online, and the devs never stated that it was online. \nWith that out of the way, i recommend this game. It's slightly buggy and the controls are a bit wonky at times (i recommend playing with a controller) but other than that it's really fun! The sound design is good, and the game keeps surprising you. Just when you start to get a bit bored, the game tosses something new at you. \n\nit costs less than a dollar, pretty good time killer if you ask me","timestamp_created":1532799525,"timestamp_updated":1608817643,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":33,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.729372918605804443","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ436HAyvYCe5eLpwE="}
