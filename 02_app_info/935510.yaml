    review: "I got this addon when it was sale and i gotta say it was worth it \n\n\
      The bus is a Citaro wich theres way to many of i hate them but this one was\
      \ the best one ive driven the only good mercedes bus in omsi.\n\nThe map is\
      \ very detailed and the performance is on of the best yet in omsi everything\
      \ is also detailed keep on the good work but remember release more dlcs with\
      \ swedish buses like volvo and scania not mercedes or Man with vdv if your releasing\
      \ a man use the baseline dash not the vdv please comeon im tired of this german\
      \ ugly dashboard"
