    review: "The Trilarians unfortunately suck. Not because they're not good. In fact,\
      \ they have a pair of very useful bonuses (extra speed on both tactical and\
      \ strategic maps + extra effectiveness on Ocean planets) with zero downsides\
      \ in terms of racial traits. But that's just it: they're boring. EXTREMELY boring.\n\
      \nHow one can make Cthulu-esque fish people boring is kind of amazing actually.\
      \ They simply need some extra traits that make them genuinely unique. For example,\
      \ make their beacons act as warp gates, so they can warp around the map ignoring\
      \ starlanes really early and even into neutral/enemy territory, but have them\
      \ cost 1 BC per turn instead of zero. Have extra effects for all Trilarian workers\
      \ when in any \"aquatic\" biome (Swamp, Terran, Ocean, or Gaia) but have major\
      \ penalties when in any non aquatic biome (Volcanic, Desert, Barren, Arid et\
      \ cetera), thus incentivizing terraforming into aquatic biomes. Let them gain\
      \ immunity from space monsters . . . something. \n\nAs it is, you'll probably\
      \ get them anyway if you pick up the 3-pack on extra races, which is recommended.\
      \ But if you're thinking of picking them up individually,don't. They're just\
      \ . . . lame."
