Only about 2.5 hours.\nPlayed it on PC. Wasn't too difficult like people say.\nYou don't need a mouse!\nMost of the game is just difficult enough to be goofy, but not enraging or anything, which I really liked.\nEven if you mess up a lot, you never die (Well, you do for the story, but that's it) and the narrator says funny things when you do.\nThe music is FANTASTIC.\n\nCons:\nThere are a few points of difficulty or confusion on what to do or which buttons to press, but nothing too frustrating.\nI didn't like some of the crude language. Still, most of it is pretty tame.\nI didn't like so much of the Satanic stuff, but that wasn't too heavy either.","timestamp_created":1609983014,"timestamp_updated":1609983014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx+ad7fYCcbOUwQI="}
