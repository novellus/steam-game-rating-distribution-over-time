    about_the_game: The dragons have been popping peglins and stealing all of your
      gold for as long as you can remember. Enough is enough. It's time to venture
      through the woods, conquer the fortress, and delve into the heart of the dragon's
      lair to take back what's yours and teach those dragons a lesson.<br><br>Peglin
      plays like a combination of Peggle and Slay the Spire. The enemies are tough,
      and if you're defeated your run is over, but you've got powerful orbs with special
      effects and incredible relics that influence both your enemies and the physics
      you'll use to defeat them.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1296610/extras/steam_1.gif?t=1604905157"
