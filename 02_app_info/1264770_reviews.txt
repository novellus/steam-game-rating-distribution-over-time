It's like playing Quake but in 2d. I would prefer it if there was a campaign where you gotta save the world against covid or something like that. But in its current state, it's kinda funny because you basically gotta kill everyone to get the antidote to only save yourself. You can find matches but I am pretty sure the players are bots, so if you wanna buy this for online play then don't.","timestamp_created":1608499971,"timestamp_updated":1608499971,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u7iEwfYCdPzmuwI="}
