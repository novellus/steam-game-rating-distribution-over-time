Unlike most reviewers, I have actually played it long enough to figure it out.\n\nThis is a small, relatively simple (but still surprisingly deep) turn-based hex-grid strategy game with somewhat generic characters, simple graphics, and simple animations. It'll likely run on half of a potato. It's also $3 USD. \n\nIt's not hard, but it's not too easy, and you definitely need to invest the time to learn the game's quirks before you're going to \"get it,\" as evidenced by many of the other reviews. \n\nIt has some bugs. The Grim Reaper will crash the game, as will hovering over skills for angels. As long as you leave those two units out of the mix, which is easily done, the game is completely stable. Considering this under $5 game is nearly four years, its time may have come and gone, but who knows, the developer might come back and patch it up for those two units. More than likely, they worked fine four years ago, but since the forum community here on Steam went completely dead back in 2016, I can understand why the developer might just decide not to mess with it. Four years can introduce a lot of goofy bugs from various hardware, drivers, and Windows itself. \n\nBYO music as the music in-game is the one really nice metal track, one less nice track that fits the game's graphics significantly better and...that's it for music. \n\nAside from those minor bugs, the game is very playable and fun, so long as you like turn-based strategy games. It's definitely worth more than the asking price, though maybe not a whole lot more. That said, I got 42 hours of fun out of it, so maybe it's extremely underpriced.","timestamp_created":1578714630,"timestamp_updated":1578714630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544468522071838379","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw97Cuye8CdKmb6wE="}
