All trees and roughly half the bushes shift in the wind, and ambient forest audio makes this feel more like a walking sim than a shooter.\n\nEnemy character models are nice but often repeated as there's not a large selection of them - three shoot fireballs and energy bolts though which is pretty neat. The procedural environments aren't truly procedural, as they loop around you meaning you'll encounter dropped loot from previously killed enemies but no bodies. Weapon drops are fairly hard to find, but usually located in or near points of interest worth exploring like abandoned gas stations and even a crashed UFO.\n\nApart from the venus flytraps, none of the enemies attempt flanking and instead either just run straight at you or slightly off center. While this makes Bloody Faerie quicker to complete, it also cheapens the overall feel of the game. Horse-based enemies, especially the pegasus, tend to zip across open spaces and then vanish into thin air. You can save your progress, but will need to kill the game with Ctrl Alt Del when you wish to quit.\n\nDespite the issues, I still recommend Bloody Faerie if your game library's lacking in cheap shooters and this is 50% or greater off. Of course if you own piles of budget FPS titles, there are better ways to waste your cash.","timestamp_created":1572054225,"timestamp_updated":1572054225,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.589403748512268066","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hvrugu4Cf87o1AE="}
