The humor is way less inspired, the use of  \"Cthulhu Mythos\" elements felt irrelevant as art and story status of the beings are way less connected to their original counterparts than in the first one, the dialogue (combat) options felt more random and even more so like game of trivial pursuit than something related to the story or characters (though it was a problem to at some points in the first one). \n\nSmall nick pick: for some reason (though not surprising after looking at this company's game library) there is an over abundance of Shakespeare references and I mean there are LOTS of them. Those should really have been references to Lovecraft and his circles of associates and friends\n\nThe combat system is still great and interesting though, but like mentioned before it didn't feel like I was battling anybody through knowledge and logic but just answering trivia questions. There is also a lot of repetition. When you get a random encounter with something you already fought the answers are the same and in the same order and for some reason before fighting the last boss you have to fight all the previous boss and they all have the same answers and in the same order. This was really tiresome and sleep inducing.\n\nLet's now talk about the menus: in the first game to move around you had some nice maps to move around, but for this installment they decided to downgrade and go with dialogue menus with sometimes take multiple pages to go through all the options of zone. I think this specific elements represent best the change between the 1rst and 2nd game.\n\nFor a game build in a visual novel engine there is so many bugs it's uncanny. When I first bought the game I got multiple exceptions that prevented me from starting a new game though this was fixed fast enough. Quest breaking bugs, dead characters joining the party bugs, achievements not unlocking bugs, achievements unlocking without meeting the requirement bugs, etc. etc. \n\nLike the first game there some potential here but it's buried underneath all the problems. Stick with the first one if you're into this kind of game.","timestamp_created":1570718557,"timestamp_updated":1570718557,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535891056060791016","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tOSH2+0Cebnu0wE="}
