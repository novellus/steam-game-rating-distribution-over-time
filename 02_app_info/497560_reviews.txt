The thing is that the dev for this game put an obviously IMMENSE amount of work into the script of this game.  I got to chap 18 before I became kind of bored since I had autoed every fight thus far.  But instead I want to give the dev some advice on making future games since dude this script WAS AMAZING.\n\nBut first I'd suggest giving players a world map to view, this game has an amazing amount of worldbuilding but I legit had to get out several pieces of scrap paper so I could get an idea of where the countries in this game lay at.  \n\nSecond is that go out and get the FIRE Emblem 7 and 8 editor tool I think based off what you did here you can make a game in that particular style with amazing quality.  Since the main drawback here is that you didn't have full sprites to work with so you couldn't really see the main characters really.\n\nThird is that I actually congratulate you on the music selector in base available at the start I spent probably over an hour listening to all the music you gave us to listen to.  I was gleefully surprised.\n\nFourth I'd say is that give us more shop options more frequently, I felt as if I had very little choice equipment wise without using the special shop, which is part of the reason I got so bored, there was no real purpose in the main shop unless your like past chap 20 or so.\n\nBut I do think this dev has lots of promise based off what I see here.","timestamp_created":1562425464,"timestamp_updated":1562425464,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzJL04+sCe+yezQE="}
