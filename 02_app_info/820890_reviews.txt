Good or bad.\n\nMade  a Gameplay Video , so you  can take a look for yourself:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2RnIFtF8E4\n\nPros:\n- nice setting\n- interesting story (thus far)\n- smooth audio\n\nCons:\nLOTS and i mean lots of bugs\nflickering\nweird animations (bug related i think)\nawkward controls\n\nI dont WANT to give it a thumbs down, but at this point, with so many bugs, i dont really have a choice.\nBut please remember, bugs can be fixed, so maybe give it a try at a later time.\n\nEdit:\nThe Developer said that he is working on fixing the bugs and it seems like he is really trying. So i changed my rating. Keep up the good work.","timestamp_created":1555772612,"timestamp_updated":1558040895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":42,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.715872228145599365","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1555946262,"developer_response":"Hello Daromath!\n\nMany thanks for playing our game and taking the time to review it. I am pleased to see that you have enjoyed the key things in the first two chapters - the setting and story.\n\nI am aware of remaining bugs in the game and with every monthly update I come closer to rendering the game bug free. As a solo developer with only a small team around me - this is an ongoing process.\n\nI was a little suprised to hear that you had issues with controls and flickering. That should not be the case, as the controls should be very smooth as they are in our marketing videos. If you have the time and inclination, do swing by the Steam community forums for our game and elaborate some more on that.\n\nbest regards\n\nKosala"}],"cursor":"AoJ44aue4eoCd7TQvwE="}
