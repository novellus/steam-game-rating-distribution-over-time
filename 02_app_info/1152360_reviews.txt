This little gem however scored an impressive 94% score today in my first impressions review!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wYEwzraUFQ\n\nIt's a super tough adventure to avoid the lava and it will take a little time to master for sure!  Love it, Love it, Love it!  \n\nHighly recommended!  ..Keep up the good work developer!  I look forward to seeing what you come up with next!","timestamp_created":1579546975,"timestamp_updated":1579597570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523268997669219971","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/cPW4+8CcpOK7QE="}
