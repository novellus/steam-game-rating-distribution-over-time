The models are done pretty well - I've seen better and I've seen worse. There's some clipping of clothing and graphics, but that's expected. The Interview section was really original and enjoyable.\n\nHowever, I find the dynamic of the couple, (and primarily, the wife's cold attitude), more frustrating than arousing. Because the wife is the biggest witch with a capital B (witholding sex for petty power maneuvering to manipulate her husband, and giving the cold shoulder at the drop of a hat), I immediately hated her. The fact that they've been together for years and yet the cuddling at the end was something he would \"remember forever,\" speaks to the real issues in their marriage - which sex can't save. Unless you play it perfectly (by not upsetting the bitchy wife) to earn points to progress in the story (which was never explained in a basic tutorial and was not apparent until game ended abruptly), you might find progressing to the sexy scenes more challenging than you'd like. I don't know about you, but I don't like to be frustrated when I'm trying to play a fantasy sex game.","timestamp_created":1603703750,"timestamp_updated":1603703750,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561855673789978027","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw16eMsvUCfqubqgI="}
