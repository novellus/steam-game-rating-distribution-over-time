    review: Sadly the game was abandoned. It seems that it was never finished and
      is a little buggy. Sadly some features doesn't seem to work. But if you have
      the chance to buy it on sale or get the key somewhere cheap, I still recommend
      buying it, since the tutorial/training sequence helped me a lot memorizing the
      Hiragana in a quite fun way. That said, don't expect too much.
