    about_the_game: <strong>Renegade Tabletop Tools System</strong>,<br><br>The Renegade
      Tabletop Tools System consists of two powerful, but very easy to use tools to
      aid in tabletop or net-based role-playing sessions.<br><br>Renegade Dice Roller
      System:<br>-The Renegade Dice Roller System (RDRS) simply and effectively simulates
      rolling any number of dice with any number of sides, any modifiers, and will
      break down the mathematic equation results for you and display them for easy
      understanding. It also keeps a running total of which dice is being rolled and
      the grand total of all rolls combined. This can be used as a substitute for
      the chore of rolling real dice and help speed up combat, determining initiative,
      large scale battles, and much more!<br><br>Renegade Entity Dictionary System:<br>-The
      Renegade Entity Dictionary System (REDS) allows users to create and edit lists
      of entities, view lists, save lists as files, load list files, update list files,
      purge lists, and even retrieve a random entity from a list. This can be used
      to create lists of different game elements for nearly any gameplay aspect including
      loot, adventure, time, weather, location, enemies, and so much more! The sky
      is the limit!

      Thanks for checking it out and leaving a review. Glad it could help you.


      Personally, I use this for massive battles whenever I roleplay and don''t feel
      like rolling a bazillion dice and doing all the math. :-)'
