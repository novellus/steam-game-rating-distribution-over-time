There were some things we liked...I've put together a bullet pointed list outlining specific areas about the game\n\nTitle screen/initial thoughts:\nBeautiful art style that gives insight to game\nMusic is mystical and calming good fit for art shown. \nUnique cursor. \n\nGame Art:\nBeautiful tileset\nUnique character sprite\nPicture gallery was a nice touch\nInitial character busts are beautiful\nGame mechanics\nUnique and interesting battle system\nClear key items\nAltar system good\nDetailed clear menu\nConfusing controls\nCannot escape battles\nSpike dying glitch\nDelays in action\nUnbalanced leveling and item prices, too easy to lose HP\nOverpowered enemies. \nPoorly designed levels, floating items on screen, ice too difficult to see, lava level causes too much damage \nOverly complicated mini games, sliding puzzle and coffin controls\n\nGameplay and story:\n\nIntro scrolling text not a good fit. \nPoor taste in dialogue\nBlackout scene very confusing\nForced side quests\nPoor character development\nLack of connection to characters\nToo many mini games\nForced fishing minigame\n\nOur game crashed at the ice level with the ice queen boss... at this point we were so angry with the game we refused to touch it after that. our eyes hurt from the overuse of flashy visuals and we felt very uncomfortable by the unfitting unneeded comments by jen to the main character... after doing some further research it seems as though this game was part of a game jam... it unfortunately shows. It felt rushed and sloppy, we love the idea of it but feel it deserves more.  \n","timestamp_created":1607665335,"timestamp_updated":1607665335,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rceUqPYCfvP9uAI="}
