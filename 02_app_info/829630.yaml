    review: 'The original Altenburger German Face of the cards is missing, and so
      some cards are unclear to me.

      The comments of the AI players (and my own) become very annoying very quickly.
      I regreted paying for the game after the first game. (I played a lot of Skat
      in the past and really enjoy the game but this is not fun!)'
