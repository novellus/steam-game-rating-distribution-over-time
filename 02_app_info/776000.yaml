    review: "This is seriously the best Choice of Game i have played. \nAnd as a VtM\
      \ fan with only afew changes it would be the best VtM game ever, the writing\
      \ is amazing, the stories are great, the characters are fantastic and iv played\
      \ it multiple times and each time had a unique story and character. \nJason\
      \ Stevan Hill is a outstanding writer and makes the world come to life. \n\n\
      If Night Road made you wanna puke with its atrocious ..everything, this game\
      \ will revive you, give you a refreshing drink of blood, wink at you and tell\
      \ you not to lose hope. \nBuy this game, you wont regret it."
