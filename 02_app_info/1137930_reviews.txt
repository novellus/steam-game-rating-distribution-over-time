Oh boy was I wrong to be! This is a great collection of modern arcade-style NES games. My favorite is Perfect Pair which is an adorable game a lot like Pac-man where you play cupid to a couple. It's too bad this pack doesn't have any reviews because it's one of Steam's best kept secrets. This is a rare gem, even a diamond in the rough. I highly recommend this collection, and I hope they put out more volumes. \n\nThere are some unfortunate bugs, like in Perfect Pair sometimes you can complete a square and it doesn't register, making the level incompletable. And whenever the Steam overlay has popups it causes weird artifacts, at least for me. Personally, I prefer to play the games in other emulators (Mesen is packaged with it). The developer said you can rename the .dat files to .nes files (in the only discussion on the forums). So if the emulation isn't what you'd like, you can always take it over to Retroarch which is coming soon to Steam. Overall, it's a fun pack, and I highly recommend it.\n\nAlso, props to the devs for including instruction manuals. Too many collections on Steam fail to do this.","timestamp_created":1605582943,"timestamp_updated":1605583282,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9ZOO6vUCe9jvrgI="}
