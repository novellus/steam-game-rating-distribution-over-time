Sure combat is easy, but it's fun and can be brutal, it just comes together to make a simplistic yet awesome feeling combat system, only downside is counters, while everything else is pretty easy to do the counters were hard for me to actually get working, seemed random. \n\nI'd recommend this game, but it is short and can be repetitive as combat is what you'll mostly be doing. If you can get passed this and like Watchmen and even beat 'em ups I'd for sure recommend this, but mainly as a time killer or a \"in between\" sorta game. Try to find it on sale.","timestamp_created":1609972125,"timestamp_updated":1609978676,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsqCN7fYCda6QwQI="}
