    review: 'Both puzzle and open-ended exploration games demand patience to be appreciated,
      and the requirement is all the greater if the genres are combined. The Moonstone
      Equation, however, seems deliberately designed to tax the player''s tolerance
      for tedium as much as possible. What fun there is to be had is locked behind
      a wall of boredom, of content seemingly not intended even by the developer to
      be engaging.

      The game simply lacks a map and fast-travel, two staples of open-ended exploration
      in video games. These sound like bad things, and they are, but the game''s world
      is mercifully small and simple to navigate. Indeed, were the actual activity
      of traversing the game''s world fun, it might benefit the experience for the
      player to be forced to internalize the world''s structure.

      However, the game''s world is simply devoid of any form of engaging activities.
      The game''s bona-fide puzzles, first of all, are entirely sequestered away from
      the rest of the world behind special portals scattered throughout the world.
      Getting from point A to point B almost never requires any kind of puzzle-solving,
      and what puzzle-solving is required for locomotion seems deliberately pared
      down from the game''s own more serious offerings.

      This game features player physics that could, theoretically, serve as the foundation
      for some form of platforming challenge, but in my time playing this was mostly
      absent. You are expected to jump over pits, etc., but "platforming" in this
      game is entirely between stationary platforms with no mobile obstacles. It''s
      mostly trivially easy, but some jumps require relatively precise timing to get
      the full distance necessary to progress. As I played, I found myself more frequently
      undone by misjudgments of the player character''s jumping capabilities than
      by timing, though neither was satisfying as a cause for punishment. Compounding
      this is the fact that the game punishes you mainly by forcing you to loop back
      around through an empty environment; while the game has a reset feature that
      teleports the player back to the most-recently used door, the advantage is often
      dubious.

      The world isn''t massive, but there''s ample space that the player must navigate
      and traverse in the ways I described above in order to find their objectives.
      As a result, the game simply feels like a timesink; so much time is spent mindlessly
      wandering. The game world isn''t a terribly compelling place to just wander
      around in, either. There''s a run-down town, some sewers, a laboratory complex,
      and some caves; all of these locales are exactly as boring as they could possibly
      be. The game does manage to conjure up some good atmosphere in the puzzle rooms,
      but these are the places where atmosphere is least needed. The story and lore
      are severely hampered by robotic writing, often-awkward grammar and the fact
      that much of it is locked behind terminals that needlessly force the player
      to navigate a special interface to look at what is essentially a bulletin board.

      The "bona fide" puzzles themselves are all based on a very small set of mechanics
      that don''t really get used in very interesting ways. You slide special blocks
      around, and if two blocks adorned with matching symbols come into contact, both
      disappear. Sometimes the player must use conveyor devices to transport the blocks.
      Most puzzles involve eliminating a given number of blocks in a particular room
      to get past a gate. They can be enjoyable, admittedly, even if the mechanics
      are simple, but it''s far from enough justify the tedium necessary to reach
      them, let alone in a game you''re expected to pay money to play.

      I didn''t finish the game, but I''ve fully activated six interface rooms and
      I have zero indication from the game that it''s going to get any better. I''ve
      already spent $10 on this game, I don''t need to give it any more of my time.
      Feel free to let me know if the game suddenly turns amazing midway through.'
