    review: Game is a lot of fun and look forward to seeing it further develop. I
      just have a few things I'd like to mention though. I noticed in the section
      with the flashlight if I accidentally went into my steam vr menu when I go back
      into game my flashlight was gone. Also having a setting option to switch the
      gun to the left hand would be awesome for the left handed players out there.
