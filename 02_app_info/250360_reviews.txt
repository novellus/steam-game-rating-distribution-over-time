If you're serious about it, though, I would recommend that you use this as more of a scratch pad of sorts.\n\nThe software makes it a lot easier to structure your screenplay, at least when it comes to writing. Just list how many characters you have, and you can easily write a few pages of dialogue in no time. But that's also because the width margins are kind of narrow, and you'll end up using way more pages than needed if you're needing to print your finished work. And the software, unfortunately, doesn't allow you to edit these margins. If anything, be prepared to edit this in Microsoft Word, or use a printer where you can print on both sides, if you're trying to conserve paper.\n\nAs someone who writes multiple screenplays for my own YouTube channel and other endeavors, having this software on hand does make it a lot easier to write scripts faster, but from my experience, this is essentially \"Baby's First Script Writer\". If you're looking for more Industry Standard type of stuff, like Final Draft 11, you're gonna be paying anywhere up to $249 for it. So if you're looking for a simple start, or just something cheap, then you can start here. But, basically, you're getting what you pay for.","timestamp_created":1574045535,"timestamp_updated":1574045535,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530854344367980957","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sZmbvu4Ce/P72gE="}
