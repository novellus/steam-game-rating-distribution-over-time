This DLC adds several extra scenes to the main app. It also adds customization options that make the app better overall, such as a timer, the ability to change between narrated or music or no music, and game mode. You can also switch between scenes more seamlessly.","timestamp_created":1608513619,"timestamp_updated":1608513619,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.612726867198944092","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w8C4wfYCd83ruwI="}
