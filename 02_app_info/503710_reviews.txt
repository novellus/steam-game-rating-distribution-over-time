Tried again, same result, same solution.\nI then tried the main scenario. It's either it lags and/or the wonky controls and/or ''motion blurr'', but the orientation/control is, quite awful.  Athough really cool atmosphere, I wish I could enjoy it more.. By reducing the ''Fantastic'' settings to ''Bearable'' somehow, but there's no option menu, neither when you boot up the game nor in the main menu. (EDIT: I find that when you lower your resolution, it may help a bit, if you experience the same thing I explained).\nSo I tried again the main scenario, I took my time so I could get the hang ot it and now it's okay-ish, but I wish it could have atleast lower settings IF the controls were intended to be tedious.\nIt was still tedious, so I went back and tried training mode, again. It froze so I waited it out until it warmed up (cough...) it'll work, it'll work I said....... and it worked! Only to find a terrible choice of music: Upbeat dubstep or whatever it is while listening to someone lacking oxygen.... So I endured both, and the tutorial was fine afterall.\nThen I tried Random scenario and then, only then, the game became good, myabe: You are presented some sort of objective and there the music fits\n\nLonging thought while playing:\nI'm sure I'd be better off playing Capsule...\n\nBut, \nI won't, because gameplay-wise, with its theme and its music, Void is a win but the lack of options, especially visual/graphic settings and that intense ''motion blurr'' lost a chunk of my interest.\nWhile it has its flaws, It does offer its players a tense experience of struggle with little to no control, in space.","timestamp_created":1516649629,"timestamp_updated":1592926786,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530497610569000244","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnbr18PICdcXrlgE="}
