    review: 'Great casual game to have some friendly competition with! Love the leaderboards,
      even though im hoping for a better filter update in the future.


      Right now the game is a bit short (27 levels) even though some levels Can be
      challenging.


      Worth the money and has Great potential with some minor updates'
