It is trying to be like the Emergency series but in Roblox style graphics. Too much micromanagement for gameplay. AI pathfinding is terrible, officer response to threats will get them killed, and firemen will always walk over dangers. This game has too many issues, and the devs are non-existent, and have very clearly bailed on their product. Save your refund request, and don't even but it.","timestamp_created":1609293465,"timestamp_updated":1609293465,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42rDX2PYCdMzRvgI="}
