    short_description: Mysterious Space was originally created for the 2014 7-Day
      Rogue-Like competition, but has received many updates since! It features many
      familiar rogue-like elements - including potions, equipment, and procedurally-generated
      worlds - but is ultimately a side-scrolling action shooter.
