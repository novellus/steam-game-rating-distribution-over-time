The gameplay is dull at best and more feels like a flash game than something on steam. The only input to the game is the left click mouse button so you don't really feel engaged. To sum up I wouldn't buy this game because there are similar games on mobile / flash.\n\nTLDR : Mobile port with no special gameplay.","timestamp_created":1470080644,"timestamp_updated":1470101042,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491067856550216675","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtba2pNYCcPiHXg=="}
