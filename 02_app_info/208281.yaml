      \ will find that it is necessary to read the manual thoroughly and familiarise\
      \ themselves with the controls and driving modes. As the driver, you are required\
      \ to get the locomotive ready for work before starting out, including raising\
      \ the pantograph and switching on the main power circuit. You then select the\
      \ required driving mode, depending on what kind of service you will be running,\

    review: "This is kind of a loco which you can't move without reading the manual\
      \ first.\nIt's driving controls are very different from anything else in Train\
      \ simulator.\nFirst, it's most unique feature is cruise control (AFB) with 3\
      \ distinct modes - stop-and-go, uphill, downhill.\nThrottle input with A/D keys\
      \ sets the target speed, not the power output, while power or brakes added automatically\
      \ (depending on the mode). Manual power control also possible, it's usable for\
      \ shunting mode or moving without the train.\nAlso, it has ZWS driving mode\
      \ , when locomotive remotely controlled from driving trailer in push-pull trains.\
      \ \nThe driving controls feel awkward at first sight, but once you get mastered\
      \ it, you can easily accelerate and brake on RegionalBahn routes with short\
      \ distance between stops.\nOn the negative side this add-on is very old (dated\
      \ by 2012),\nso it doesn't have all fancy features like openale doors/windows,\
      \ sparks from the pantograph. \nI wish cab would be more detailed.  But from\
      \ the driver's prospective it's very fun to drive, because of nicely implemented\
      \ sophisticated controls.\n\nAlso, this loco cannot be driven in simple mode,\
      \ or using HUD driving aids... HUD only shows power/brake level in %, but handles\
      \ can be operated only by mouse or keyboard. \n"
