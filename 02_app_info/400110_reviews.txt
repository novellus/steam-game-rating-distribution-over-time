Took a long time to get started (hacking) - as with a lot of others. Almost gave up, until I found what I needed - then the whole game really takes off. Like a giant sandbox playground. \n\nThe story was going great, up until you finish - but I can see a whole lot of replayability in here. If you know a little bit about coding, a lot, or are just interested, its great. You don't need to know much to get through it. If you know lots, well... I can only imagine the ways you can break and remake the world. \n\nIf you're stuck trying to get to hacking - just look up where to find a \"modifier\", and don't look at any spoilers.","timestamp_created":1609549493,"timestamp_updated":1609549493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sIao4PYCcpjJvwI="}
