    review: 'Is there a reason why every single thing in this game moves at the speed
      of molasses?


      The game is very tedious and repetitive. The sci-fi story is entertaining enough,
      but the EVER SO SLOW movement of everything in this game just makes it not worthwhile
      to progress.


      I was really hoping to like this one...
