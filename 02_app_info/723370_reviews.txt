In a nutshell, I have to give it a thumbs down. It pains me to do so, as the game has a certain amount of charm, and is still in early access.\n\nHere are some of my issues:\n- Lack of overhead map. Kind of a no starter for me.\n- Combat seems very bland.\n- Tons of things that just aren't clear, and no introduction of any kind to really make me want to give a darn.\n- 10-15 fights, no loot except herbs... blah.\n\nLike I said earlier, the game has some charm, and I like the writing. There's lore, the world seems interesting, and I haven't run into any bugs or technical issues. Also, 5$ is a good pricepoint.\n\nMaybe hold off until things are a bit more polished. With a map, and a better intro, maybe some cool loot to get me started, I might come back for another go at it.","timestamp_created":1521139105,"timestamp_updated":1521139105,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.372564077377319336","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1521163359,"developer_response":"It is unfortunate to hear that you gave up so soon, but I would like to clarify the misinformation in your post.\n\nSparkling bones and chests provide the most loot. In the intro, within the first half an hour, you can obtain Healing Herbs, Focus Herbs, Arch Gems, a Fireball Spellbook, a Whitewood Staff, an Allfather Coin, Flametar Husks, Zapwater Urns, a Poison Lick Spellbook, Remedial Moss, Tevean Nachos, Sunsoul Pizza, Northland Porridge, Leek and Pork Dumplings, Healing Potions, Mana Potions, a Protector Spellbook, Healberries, Manaberries, Zestberries, Healing Jam and Radiant Arch Gems.\n\nThese all come from free sources in the world, and it is unfortunate that you missed them, as they do provide the good starter boost you were looking for. The whitewood staff in particular, is a level ten staff which can be immediately equipped by Amber. You must have overlooked the presence of all this loot.\n\nAside from first dungeon globins(slimes), all monsters give exclusive loot in addition to herbs or potions for maintained sustenance. Lolicaps = Lolicap Cap. Ancient Machines = Rusted Cogwheel, Machinery Scrap. Starshell Crabs = Starshell Platinum, Crab Meat.\n\nThank you for your criticism in all other areas, however. It will all be taken on-board and will all be a part of the ongoing effort to make Spiritbird the best it can be."}],"cursor":"AoJ4zpe9leICcsLimwE="}
