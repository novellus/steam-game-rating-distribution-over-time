      \ thinking about buying this game, let me tell you...throw it in your cart.\
      \ It is AMAZING! \n\nShort version; amazing graphics even if you need to put\
      \ it on low, puzzles not too difficult but makes you think, storyline thrilling\
      \ and just keeps progressing, can be replayed over and over, some historical\
      \ and Agatha Christie vibes all throughout and plays like most point and click\
      \ games so easy to follow. \n\nLong version; It's been on my wishlist for forever,\
      \ but for some reason it kept saying coming soon or something like that so I\
      \ didn't buy it until recently on the winter sale. I LOVED IT! \nIt's like most\
      \ point and click mystery games, basic controls with inventory and a notebook,\
      \ gives a lot of Agatha Christie vibes; you literally start on the Orient Express\
      \ and the Constable looks pretty darn close to Poriot so that's nice. \nPuzzles:\
      \ Are they hard? Not really, sometimes a little frustrating but not impossible,\
      \ a lot of walking back and forth at times, and sometimes the puzzles don't\
      \ make a lot of sense so I write down a lot of things so I can do it right the\
      \ first time. And if I missed anything, because you can miss stuff. Save a lot\
      \ because there are some glitches but nothing that worried me.  \nStory: AMAZING.\
      \ Like I said, Agatha Christie in a lot of ways, and just a good mystery. Keeps\
      \ you guessing the entire time. And the little subplots are just nice to follow\
      \ along. Characters are cool, especially as you learn more and more about them,\
      \ and you will be surprised about some when you get to them.\n\nOnly downsides\
      \ were it can be a bit glitchy; sometimes a little loop of a person doing something,\
      \ or a cutscene freezing but people keep talking. I never had anything that\
      \ was too bad, saved a bunch so that way if I had to go back to a save file\
      \ I don't have to repeat too much. It's a bit laggy on my computer but I did\
      \ the remastered first, so I might try the old version to see if that helps.\
      \ I just did low graphics and about half way did it in windowed mode; worked\
      \ great and the graphics still beautiful. I don't really care for their hot\
      \ spots; they disappear kinda of quick and so I can easily spend 50 points just\
      \ making sure I clicked on everything. Their hints are good, found them out\
      \ late in the game-check your journal-but cost points.\n\nI don't really know\
      \ what else to say. I HIGHLY recommend. I believe I got it on sale but it's\
      \ worth it, and you get both the original and remastered, but I think the only\
      \ difference is graphics so play whichever one. I hope this review helped anybody\
      \ interested. Happy playing! :D \n"
