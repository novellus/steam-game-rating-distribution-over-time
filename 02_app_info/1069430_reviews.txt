My game is completely FREE, Better than this game, and DEVELOPED FROM SCRATCH IN UNDER AN HOUR!  ..If you wanna try my game, I call it \"Dodge & Eat!\" and you can get it either on the link in the description of the above linked video or go searching for \"Zaxtor99\" on GameJolt.\n\nIt was only made to show how pathetic this developer is for trying to sell this extremely low effort trash on Steam here for money.\n\nNOT RECOMMENDED!
