The aircraft UX actually makes sense and the modeling makes it fun to flight. A specific special mention goes to the Training missions which are the least convoluted and least nonsensical of all the modules listed. There's no doubt that's why is the most popular module right now.\nThe only thing that comes close in the fun factor to flying this thing is the acrobatic plane but it is not a single area that makes this aircraft alluring, is the combination and balance of many areas that makes it work.\n Finally, a module that works.!!\n \nA-10C\nF-16\nF-14\nFlaming Cliffs simplified modules\nM-2000\n","timestamp_created":1609647138,"timestamp_updated":1609647138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzcSc4/YCfpT6vwI="}
