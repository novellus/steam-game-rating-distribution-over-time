Funny that I did not notice ever since, the lack of presence of these newest additions of characters of the game. Since, I got them anyway as CPU adversaries and, arcade mode bosses to their respective retro-editions of Street-Fighter games.\n\nReally enhances the game play experiences and, forces you to improvise to each of these awkwardly new and, re-brought back from a deep past like bosses(Gill and Sagat).\n\nMy satisfaction to this game is completed. Only Ultra Street-Fighter IV is to be considered as a throw back title to revisit and enjoy. ;)\n","timestamp_created":1608681197,"timestamp_updated":1608681197,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539594888687133789","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43OG3xvYCeOamvAI="}
