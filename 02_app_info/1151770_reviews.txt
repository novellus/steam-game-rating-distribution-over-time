The main menu is in Chinese and you have to keep trying to select different things from the menu until you find the options menu that lets you change it to English. Make sure you make two copies of your save every time because autosave will overwrite your save file, and make sure you backtrack at the beginning of the game to get all of the extra healing potions. The game randomly leaves some of the treasure chests empty every time you start a new game. This is a really good game for a dollar. At first I didn't even pay attention to the fact that the weak healing potions are a lot cheaper then the strong ones. I like to add the third character to my party and buy another expensive ring for $9000, and then return to the previous area with weaker enemies to level up a little bit. I like this game because it doesn't seem to have any of the annoying dungeons that other games have, and it is really easy to play through without a walk through.","timestamp_created":1599480731,"timestamp_updated":1604262461,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45M/fwvUCdMCuoAI="}
