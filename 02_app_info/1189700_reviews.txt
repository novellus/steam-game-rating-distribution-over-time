Crafting enables you to refine your deck in a different way by limiting the cards in a character deck. Making a custom piece with specific abilities like armor piercing weapons is easier with crafting. Implant is a flat improvement to team member stats. Having trouble with evasion targets? Get an accurate implant. Used properly it can boost gear stats and help you custom build a damage resistant character or \nevasion based character and the like. The random events are also a nice change of pace. \nThe inventor class is different. At the start you have new card attacks that drain health assuming you bypass the shields. In would recommend unequipping either the power glow or the energy blade in the beginning as you'll need leeching strike to keep the class health up in the beginning. Once you gain the perk to restore health on attack, its less vital but at the start its just easier to have leeching strike ready and likely to be drawn rather than relying on the reload cards. \nOverall it improves the game experience.","timestamp_created":1609316110,"timestamp_updated":1609321540,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552845537662506104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmr3C2fYCfofbvgI="}
