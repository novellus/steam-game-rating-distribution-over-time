You start by investigating the mystery regarding a masked figure (a direct inspiration from the Phantom of the Opera) and a mystical disappearing muse in the bonus chapter. \n\nPROS:\n- Male protagonist!\n- Good graphics;\n- Good music;\n- Journal entries;\n- Fast travelling map;\n- Varied hidden object games;\n- Bundle of extras good to try;\n- So many good mini-games;\n- Two sets of collectibles that you can spot easily;\n- Feels like Charles Dickens' novels mixed with the Phantom of the Opera and any detective story.\n\nNEUTRE:\n- It does not give the masked figure's sidekick's point of view.\n- The masked figurine isn't a vampire, though he looks like one. :)\n\nCONS:\n- The story could be improved;\n- A little bit of mystery and imprevisibility wouldn't hurt;\n- Voice acting could be better, but it's good as it is;\n- Some subtitles don't appear in the male detective's deductions.\n\nOver all, it has been great fun to play this game. Opera houses, competitivity between artists, secrets, love triangles, orphans, opera singers, mystical swami, masked entities, you name it. It was fun and informative. \n","timestamp_created":1595016107,"timestamp_updated":1595016107,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v8qXr/MCeJb3lQI="}
