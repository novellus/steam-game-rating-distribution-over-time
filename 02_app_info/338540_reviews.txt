I'm an old Jedi member from Navyfield 1 and was excited to play Navyfield 2 since they first announced they were working on it. I really enjoy fast pace strategic games, like Starcraft and such so NF2 was on the list. \n\nTwo days into it, I have a tier 3 BB with tier 2 DD. The complexity of NF1 is gone, same with the common public player strategies. Everyone rushes in to the middle and it creates a bloodbath, even ships that have far enough ranges to kite rushes in and sinks within seconds. No one hardly speaks on chat but when someone finally did, it was to call me a \"noob bb\" because I was the last one left vs 4 and I was kiting, I was able to sink 3 with lots of hits on others, racking up a simple 98k damage and coming in first place on my team at the end when I was sunk. \n\nThats how we played in NF1(200k dmg+), with other like minded players it became an amazingly fun mental battle. The fact that even the majority of the high tier ships rush in to die in seconds, no dodging or weaving, probably auto aim, possibly bots (no chat or common sense), and some just dont even shoot back makes this games gameplay lame.  The freedom of customized ships is gone and the community feels dead. If you miss NF1 and wanted to play like the old times with just updated graphics, this game is not it.","timestamp_created":1488307199,"timestamp_updated":1488555591,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.622677803039550781","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41fi0ytoCeLewcw=="}
