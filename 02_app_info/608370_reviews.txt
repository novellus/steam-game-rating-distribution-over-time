Let me explain...\n\nThere are less than 20 songs\n\nWhen your playing a song, you would think that the only drums you hear are yours, but know they dont even cut out the audio for you to play and hear your own. You are just playing over the songs.\n\nWhen playing the songs you have a choice of 3 difficulties, they are fun mode, hard mode and pro mode. I am not even a drummer in real life and I would rather play the pro mode than the other two modes. The fun mode is more like the play 1 note slowly for the whole song. This game is so stupidly easy and is only fun to play in the pro mode. But to play in the pro mode you have to play in the other two modes to get to it. This makes the game way longer than it needs to be. What I liked about guitar hero is that it gave you the option to choose what mode to play in, this says no you have to earn your way. Imagine playing guitar hero or rock band and you want to play a song, but you have to play the whole dang song 2 times first on easy mode just to play it on hard. \n\nThere are only 2 maps/drums\n\nThere is a thing on the side for lyrics, but many of the songs dont actually show the lyrics so why even put that in the game. \n\nThe only good thing about this game is that when you do get to play in pro mode it is fun... thats it, its not worth your time to play everysong 2 times to get pro mode. If there are like 17 songs and each song is like 3 minutes, then you have wasted    around 2 hours cause sometimes it will say it wasnt even good enough and you have to play it again. The total amount of fun that you will have in this game is less than an hour, while like I said you will be wasting your time not having fun in this game for 2 hours.","timestamp_created":1604177129,"timestamp_updated":1604177129,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44o2awPUCd9uyqwI="}
