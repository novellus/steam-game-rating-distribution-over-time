    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Space Farm is a space-themed farming RPG!</h2><br>You\
      \ are a farmer on earth, a bright light shines on your barn. Concerned for your\
      \ livestock you chase the light. Running after it, you get sucked into a tractor\
      \ beam and forced to survive on a foreign planet. You must farm, collect, fish,\
      \ and upgrade your way to finding the secret to your escape. You will meet friends,\
      \ foes, and stories along the way. Can you solve the mystery of... Space Farm?<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Features</h2><br>We have done a few things to try to make\
      \ our game stand out as a different game, but keep some of the core values we\
      \ all love so much. A few things we have done in our game:<br><br>Dynamic Marketplace\
      \ - instead of throwing your stuff in a box and going to sleep, you can now\
      \ sell live to one of the 4 planets that are near the planet you are on! We\
      \ have done this to make it more exciting and also, to help you choose with\
      \ Race you gain Reputation from.<br><br>Reputation - While not a new idea, it\
      \ is new in the realm of this genre. You need to sell items, do quests, and\
      \ use some in-game mechanics to gain race reputation. What's it good for? It\
      \ helps you unlock shops, and new map areas, among other things.<br><br>Farming\
      \ Tools - While we all love holding 14 tools in our bag slots (NOT). We have\
      \ decided to create an all in one &quot;Farming&quot; Gun! Use this to farm,\
      \ collect, battle, and fish! Mind you, it may require a few parts...<br><br>Crops\
      \ - We have an absolutely GREAT time farming the same salad in every farming\
      \ game since 1990.. But to switch things up we have also created a unique mix\
      \ of Space Crops to grow and enjoy, just watch those side effects! (Also you\
      \ can grow the same old salad.)\_Mind you, you gotta figure out how to use that\
      \ darn 3D printer first..<br><br>Storyline - Instead of trying to compete with\
      \ games in our genre that are built around building and unlocking items to infinity,\
      \ we decided to add a secret sub plot around our game. So yes, there is an END!\
      \ Enjoy our light-hearted\_humor to find the secret to Space Farm...<h2 class=\"\

    review: "UPDATE: November 1, 2020:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sksvG5mYQAE&t=256s\n\
      \n----------------------------------\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW - OCTOBER 18, 2020:\n\
      \nUgh.  $25 for a game where the ESC doesn't even work and there is NO WAY TO\
      \ EXIT THE GAME?!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/M_PsOp9Os84 \n\nI tried to like this game.\
      \  I see a TON of effort and probably a lot of heart and soul put into this\
      \ game, but I can't recommend this as it is now for even $5, much less $25.\
      \ \n\nClunky movement.  Extremely user UN-friendly.  Text dialogue between your\
      \ man character \"Zak\"/\"Zack\" is way too small and cramped together to read\
      \ easily.  Terrible UI.  This game is just a mess right now.  Ugh.  I feel bad,\
      \ but it needs a lot of work and polish and I hope the dev(s) continue to work\
      \ on it.\n\nDeveloper(s)..  What are you thinking?  You should know better than\
      \ to sell a game in this poor of a state.  I get that you probably put a TON\
      \ of time into this game, but why didn't you spend 5 minutes programming ESC\
      \ key functionality?  \n\n----------------------\n\nIMPORTANT MESSAGE TO THE\
      \ DEVELOPER(S):\n\nListen, as an indie developer myself of games right here\
      \ on Steam, I totally know how much this negative review hurts.  It hurts like\
      \ hell.  The first negative review I got on my first Steam game \"Rock 'N Roll\"\
      \ made me initially wanna both cry and throw up.  \n\nPlease DO NOT let this\
      \ negative review make you lose any heart or passion for this game or making\
      \ future games.  Instead, do what I did with my first negative review.  Learn\
      \ from this, and use it to make your game 5x better.  Remember and understand\
      \ that if I had not been honest with my review, if I had not shown you and people\
      \ in my video review the bad parts of your game and gave it a positive review..\
      \ that would have been a HUGE disservice to you.  Now you know that it still\
      \ needs a lot of work and where you need to focus that work.  \n\nI genuinely\
      \ LOVE what I see here.  This game holds a TON of promise and I look forward\
      \ to seeing it as it develops further.  \n\nWith that, please.. for your own\
      \ sake, not my sake or anyone elses sake.. for your own sake, please consider\
      \ dropping your price to $15 USD.  The reason i strongly suggest this is really\
      \ because Stardew Valley is your biggest competition and it's priced at $15.\
      \  Charging any more is only going to KILL your sales.  In fact, if I could\
      \ recommend a price to you with my experience, I'd suggest $12.99.  I honestly\
      \ think you'll sell 10x as many copies at $12.99 as $24.99.  And in the end,\
      \ while I understand your game is probably going to be worth the $25.. you will\
      \ likely make 5x as much money on this game asking around $12.99 as opposed\
      \ to $24.99.  I hope this review helps you and your game succeed.  ..And I will\
      \ re-review it in a couple of months to see where it's at then.  I honestly\
      \ wish you and this game all the success in the world... and this is the first\
      \ time I've ever made statements like \"this\" on any game with over 700 reviews\
      \ now!  ...That should tell you something!!   - Keep up the good work!\n\n---------------------\n\
      \nNOT RECOMMENDED... but perhaps put this game on your watch list as I will\
      \ do.  It's clunky, frustrating, and just not fun in its launch day state..\
      \ sadly.\n\nIf you want to support this/these indie developers who are obviously\
      \ pouring their hearts into this game, definitely give it a purchase and perhaps\
      \ help make suggestions and give your ideas in their forums to help them mold\
      \ their game to perfection.  =)  If there is any un-finished or un-polished\
      \ game on Steam that should get support, in my opinion.. this is the one!"
