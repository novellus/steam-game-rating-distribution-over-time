The building process is fairly good with a good, but not great selection of building blocks.  There are several tiers in maybe 5 different categories that you unlock by spending DNA.  This includes mouths, spikes, guns type weapons, healing, armor, etc.  In a normal game you will gather both protein and DNA by eating food and supposedly by mating.  I never actually tried mating though as you would have to find a partner and line up the \"mating\" parts which did not seem worthwhile at all.  The building has some issues though, there needed to be ways to quickly drop many parts, invert pieces and such.  Building just gets cumbersome when you get to larger organisms.  A bigger problem is that after unlocking a higher tier (which means a different central cell), there is no way to swap out the main cell.  You have to remove the old one.  When you remove the central cell, every other part is also removed.  Very bad design as the building is already clunky.\n\nThe game itself leaves a lot to be desired unfortunately.  The only game mode is a random map where you can tweak a few parameters like size, active disaster types and some other things which I don't remember (temperature maybe?).  You can play these maps in a few ways but they are all multiplayer focused except one.  In the map you just swim around and survive by eating based on your mouth parts (find meat mainly by attacking or scavanging or plant matter lying around the map).  Fighting other cells or avoiding them and trying to stay alive is fun for a while, but it quickly wears out it's welcome.  This process is sped up by one annoying bug where food can get stuck inside your creature.  This messes up your movement and when you get a bit bigger it happens very frequently and gets very frustrating.\n\nOther negatives is there is no sense of evolution.  You can change from a carnivore and to herbivore or from a tiny creature to a massive creature at will (assuming you accumulated enough protein and unlocked the parts already).  Also energy consumption is very unbalanced.  I found it impossible to keep energy levels up, even when constantly eating.  With no energy you take damage but it is slow so isn't that big of deal.  The game even has fat reserves that can be accumulated when energy is maxed out, which was a joke.  I never once was able to get even a single point of reserved energy.  Maybe I was missing something but I don't think so. Beyond that the cell building will often not let you put a cell where you think you should be able to.  I'm sure there is a reason but the editor doesn't tell you anything at all.\n\nAs a big fan of the cell stage in Spore I was really looking forward to this game but it just doesn't have the fun of that.  It is a game with good ideas and some good pieces but just doesn't have the polish and attention to detail it needed to be a game worth playing for more than a few hours.  It is not something I would recommend as anything more than a curiosity.","timestamp_created":1605853129,"timestamp_updated":1605853129,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ksWT8vUCfpi2rwI="}
