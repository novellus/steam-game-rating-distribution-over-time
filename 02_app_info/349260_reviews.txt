The developer seems active with this game which is nice. \n\nAfter an update the game now supports multiple resolutions and vertical screens (shrinked). If you have an arcade machine with a 16:9/9:16 screen, it plays well with an arcade button panel.\n\nRecommended.","timestamp_created":1596597508,"timestamp_updated":1600404438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501811623573303223","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv7fiz/QCc9i/mQI="}
