It's literal, digital comic book, and quite nice digitalization as well. It's not just a VN or a scanned comic book, you don't just read page by page, but you got dramatic panel by panel reveals, whole page panning, focus on dialogues, etc. The art and story are the good part of old 80s superhero comic, if you like old X-Men comics you'd find the art and writing feel very familiar, and even enjoyable.\n\nAnd in between readings, you do turn based rpg battle, with quite some strange twist. At first it starts simple, but basically, you can only field limited amount of member at a time but each member has specific interaction with other member. So you must think what combination should be on the field at any time, and what formation you want to do since different formations give different benefits.\n\nBasically, weird but good. Not sure about replayability or length, I assume it got as much replayability as any other comic book. And you can actually remove the battle part and just read it as a comic book. Get it when it's discounted.","timestamp_created":1509294522,"timestamp_updated":1509294693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qKu+tN8Cdo7jiQE="}
