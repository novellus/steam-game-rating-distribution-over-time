    review: 'This game looks amazing, but its downfall is the horrible controls. With
      keyboard, you use WASD to move. The problem with this is, I had to press both
      W and D to move in a straight line. And that only worked sometimes. With a controller,
      it is even worse! I had to set my own controls, which I thought was a bit odd.
      I tried both the stick and the D-pad on my Xbox controller. To move from left
      to right, I had to press up, right, down, right, down, right, down. This got
      me across the opening area. Then I had to press up, left, down, left, up, down
      to get to the door. And the action button to open the door never worked at all.
      I definitely had more fun with keyboard (both because I actually made some progress
      and because, since it had been on my wishlist for so long, I willed myself to
      find some pleasure in it).


      The graphics are quite nice, but that is the only redeeming quality. The onscreen
      dialogue between the two playable characters (you have to unlock one I think;
      only one could be chosen from the menu) is painfully cheesy, the nonsense you
      would expect from siblings on a Disney show.


      The game itself had some oddities. I am not sure why I was collecting purple
      balls of light; they did not appear to do anything at all. And my weapon in
      the hotbar was a stick (really, it was a twig), but I was shooting balls of
      light. Was this a dollar store magic wand? The game seemed to imply there are
      more weapons, but in three levels, I never found any. There were armour pieces
      I could buy from a merchant, so perhaps I just never got far enough for another
      weapon.


      This was a major disappointment. I had wanted it for quite a while and when
      I finally pulled the trigger, the game was pure crap. A huge thumbs down. Refunded.'
