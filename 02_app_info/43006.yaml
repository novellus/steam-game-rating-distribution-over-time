    review: 'They shouldn''t even sell this anymore.  You can only get points for
      upgrades by playing with other players and nobody, I mean NOBODY, plays this
      anymore.


      The couple of times I did get to play with other people, long ago, it was pretty
      boring anyway.  I wish they''d just unlock all of the upgrades so we could just
      build cool looking wanzers.  I''d consider reinstalling just for that.


      Anyway, don''t waste your money, this thing is DEAD.'
