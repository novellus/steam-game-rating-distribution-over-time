Why is the constant connection needed for a simple light filter, you ask? Who knows. If you believe the dev's intentions are entirely innocent despite this, bear in mind that every time your connection drops, this thing will stop working and ask you to email the dev with a bug report. They won't reply. Like I said before, it'll crash with alarming regularity, even with a clean connection.\n\nI've had it for a good while and there haven't been any attempts made to update or improve anything. I'm sorry to say this is literally one of the worst things I've ever seen on this platform. \n\nI'll remove this review if it's ever fixed or if the dev ever replies, but we both know that's not going to happen.","timestamp_created":1586903257,"timestamp_updated":1586903257,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586466193199157715","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+sGzvfECdf/pgAI="}
