It has a series of story missions that begin with a prologue tutorial in which you play some higher-powered characters. I like the engine. I would have preferred a more serious story and dialogue, and progression and a slower and less generous pace of progression and reward, but I'm not a fan of the JRPG style in general so that's on me.","timestamp_created":1530419661,"timestamp_updated":1530419826,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1amIquQCeNPopAE="}
