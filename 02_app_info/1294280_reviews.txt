Its not hard at all, and it's cheap.  I got it for $0.49US, totally worth the price for a little bit of entertainment.  Not really any replay value for adults, but for kids that start out on the easy puzzle size, they should be able to get a bit more out of it trying to do the more difficult versions.","timestamp_created":1608738360,"timestamp_updated":1608738360,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrOmRyPYCeavBvAI="}
