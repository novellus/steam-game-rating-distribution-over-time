    review: 'While a bit unpolished, this really is a nice puzzle platformer. It has
      an interesting story to keep a player engaged and employs generally well-paced
      puzzle solving for an overall enjoyable experience.


      ...Oh, and there is a gallery of clickbait but you actually have to play the
      game to unlock all of it, so have at it.'
