    review: The main game is a hard resource utilization game, and that part is solid
      and fun. Unfortunately there is a mini-game with the random events that is nearly
      impossible to play. These have resulted in frustration, and inevitable game
      failure when the negative consequences of those failures resolve in the main
      game. Until those mini-games are fixed or replaced with a better mechanic, I
      can't recommend this game.
