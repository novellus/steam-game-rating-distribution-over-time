    review: "I was a bit curious what it might be. Since it was fairly cheap despite\
      \ being on early access (Around 9 USD when I bought it. ), I decided to give\
      \ it a try. I don't really know how will this game evolve but at the current\
      \ state I wouldn't say it's worth buying even for that much. \n\nYou have 2\
      \ types of attacks, dash ability (It doesn't seem to be possible to mix it with\
      \ an attack. ) and jump that CAN be mixed with an attack. Game uses analog stick\
      \ for movement and camera adjusts automatically (Though it sometimes gets stuck\
      \ behind objects. ). You can also grab (But it seems that there's only one grab\
      \ animation per character. ), block and if your gauge is high enough - use an\
      \ ability that seems to be similar to a guard impact or use a finisher (The\
      \ last one takes some time to execute. ). There doesn't seem to be a crouch\
      \ option, low guard or low attack possibility so despite I played it only against\
      \ the AI opponent - I'm a bit sceptical to how fun can be a game against a human\
      \ player without various types of attack and block heights. When it comes to\
      \ AI - there is no difficulty setting and what you're given is not much. It\
      \ doesn't really seem to be possible to lose against it and it often gets stuck\
      \ while running in the corner of the arena or just stands there and does nothing.\
      \ \n\nI know that it's an early access game (And a fairly small project. ) but\
      \ at the current state - it's just not worth it. Maybe after some major changes\
      \ it could become an enjoyable budget (Or free to play with minor microtransactions.\
      \ ) fighter but it is not that at the given moment."
