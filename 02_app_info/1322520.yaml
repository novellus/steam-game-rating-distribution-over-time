    review: very poor english translation. many of the features that drew me to this
      arent implimented. and the syntax and command structure are counter intuitive.
      ive played many text adventures and this one just feels weird. i like the idea
      of using wasd for easy navigation but the commands for everything else just
      feels wrong, and isnt enjoyable for me. instead of "get box" or "look at picture"
      you have to type it out as 'Get' [enter] 'Box] or 'look' [enter]  'picture'.
      its an extra layer of tedium. and that coupled with the poor translation, and
      the use of characters that a pc anywhere out of japan wont have in the font
      banks, i just cant get my head around of it. having a map of the shape of the
      room is really what got me to buy this, but it uses messy characters, and no
      color variation between you, items and walls, so it just looks like nonsense.
