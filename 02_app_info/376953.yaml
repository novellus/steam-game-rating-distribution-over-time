    about_the_game: "The California Zephyr \u2013 the train many enthusiasts and railroaders\
      \ alike considered the single-most magnificent passenger train to ever journey\
      \ across America \u2013 is now available for Train Simulator! Featuring the\
      \ train\u2019s complete consist of eight unique car types, the DLC also includes\
      \ highly authentic Western Pacific and Rio Grande Electro-Motive diesel power.\
      \ <br><br>The California Zephyr made its first run in 1949 and was the ultimate\
      \ expression of America\u2019s post-World War II \u201Cstreamliner era.\u201D\
      \ On a journey of 2,532 route-miles, the streamliner crossed the American west\
      \ between Chicago and San Francisco\u2019s Bay Area. Nicknamed the \u201CSilver\
      \ Lady,\u201D the luxurious train carried travellers, riding in dome cars and\
      \ comfortable sleepers, across the plains of America\u2019s Heartland on the\
      \ Burlington Route, through the Rocky Mountains on the Rio Grande, and over\
      \ the Sierra Nevada via Western Pacific\u2019s Feather River Canyon rails. <br><br>The\
      \ Budd Company built the California Zephyr\u2019s passenger equipment. Eight\
      \ car types would eventually become standard on the train, and each is included\
      \ in this DLC: a streamlined baggage car; vista-dome coach; vista-dome buffet-lounge-dormitory\
      \ car; 10-roomette, 6-bedroom sleeper; 48-seat diner; standard coach (converted\
      \ from 16-section sleeper); 5-compartment, 6-double bedroom sleeper; and the\
      \ train\u2019s signature vista-dome bedroom-lounge-observation. All the California\
      \ Zephyr cars were individually named with the prefix \u201CSilver\u201D and\
      \ each lived up to that shimmering image, being constructed of fluted stainless\
      \ steel. <br><br>Western Pacific powered its leg of the California Zephyr with\
      \ EMD F-units, and beginning in 1950, FP7s became the standard lead units for\
      \ the California Zephyr on the WP. Train Simulator\u2019s FP7 California Zephyr\
      \ set includes Western Pacific FP7 and F7B units for use on the Feather River\
      \ Canyon route, and also included are Rio Grande EMD F9A and F9B diesels which\
      \ served as regular power for the streamliner on the D&amp;RGW. <br><br>The\
      \ \u201CSilver Lady\u201D made its last transcontinental run in March 1970,\
      \ but even then its tradition carried on, as Rio Grande elected to continue\
      \ (through 1983) the Denver-Salt Lake City leg of the train\u2019s schedule,\
      \ with the streamliner renamed the \u201CRio Grande Zephyr.\u201D The new Train\
      \ Simulator DLC includes passenger equipment both with and without California\
      \ Zephyr markings, so that both California Zephyr and Rio Grande Zephyr consists\
      \ can be created. <br><br>The California Zephyr, a cherished fixture of the\
      \ American railroad scene, is now available for Train Simulator \u2013 and it\
      \ delivers the unforgettable experience of taking the throttle of one of America\u2019\

    review: WOW!!!! This is one of the greatest DLC for this game yet. The loco is
      wonderful, and the coaches look AWESOME!!! All the cars have full interior too.
      Also included D&RGW F9 and cars. Why didn't they just include CB&Q as well?
