I continues the series' tradition of lovely artwork, soft music, and light gameplay.\n\nIt's pretty much standard hidden-object fare, but it's a relaxing game with lovely artwork.\n\nRecommended.","timestamp_created":1607742366,"timestamp_updated":1607742408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1Mi6qvYCdaepuQI="}
