    review: "Para no poner spoilers: de todo lo que el juego promete en el anuncio\
      \ y en la primera parte de la historia, no se cumple pr\xE1cticamente nada.\
      \ No se desenreda la conspiraci\xF3n, los finales son similares y no hay manera\
      \ de \"ganarlo\". Se siente incompleto; termina en suspenso.\n\nTo avoid spoilers:\
      \ Of all the promises in the advertisement and the first arc of the game, it\
      \ delivers close to none. The conspiracy is never unveiled; endings are quite\
      \ similar and there's no way to \"win\" it. Feels like an incomplete work of\
      \ fiction, ends on a cliffhanger."
