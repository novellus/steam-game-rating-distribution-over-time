    review: 'This is my new favourite game, even as a heter o home sexual being I
      have feelings for Renault and Discus... Dot dot dot... <3 I can''t wait for
      the sequel... Dot dot dot...


      Also, the gameplay is fantastic, compliments the story really well, with dynamic
      combat and overwhelming strategy comparable even to Divinity 2. An absolute
      masterpiece and severely underated... Boy love is the only love <333'
