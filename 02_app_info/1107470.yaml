      /><br><br>Applewood is a fruit-centric, nutrient-rich imp-ing game featuring
      Ringo the Imp! He's not very strong. He doesn't have magic powers or a sword
      that vanquishes darkness. He can fly! ... But only for a few seconds at a time.
      He's a pale and squishy little guy who isn't even <i>that</i> good at the one
      thing that makes him special. Yet, in spite of all of this, he's about to go
      on an incredible adventure, see and do some amazing things, and overcome his
      weaknesses through clever-thinking, compassion, and a stick-to-it attitude like
      no other!<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1107470/extras/Game_Features.png?t=1585513902"

      /><br>- <i>How long is it?</i><br>It usually takes a person around 4-6 hours
      to complete their first run of the main story. 100% completion takes a bit longer
      than that, and currently seems to require around 9-10 hours.<br><br>- <i>This
      looks cute, but I'm terrible at platformers...</i><br>Actually, I designed the
      game to be approachable by players of all skill levels! There are no instant
      deaths, most of the challenge comes from thinky puzzles instead of twitchy action,
      and you can correct any mistakes you make midair using Ringo's hover ability!
      It's super accommodating! Just like how I responded to this bullet point, even
      though it's not technically a question. See? Accommodating!<br><br>- <i>Is this
      a Metroidvania?</i><br>Not really! There isn't much of a focus on backtracking,
      and Ringo doesn't acquire new abilities as you play. It's a story about inner
      growth! You gotta maximize your potential without relying on character upgrades.
      <br><br>- <i>If Ringo doesn't get new abilities, how does the gameplay stay
      interesting for 6 hours?</i><br>Applewood's all about using items you find in
      the environment to your advantage! There are a ton of different item types,
      each with unique characteristics. Couple those with Ringo's surprisingly nuanced
      movement mechanics, and you've got yourself a game full of super-diverse gameplay!
      Plus, there's also the whole &quot;story&quot; aspect... Oh, look, a relevant
      question!<br><br>- <i>Is there a story-focus?</i><br>Yes! And I cried while
      writing it. Many times...

    review: "[Summary] \nThis game is like Undertale but more wholesome, and with\
      \ better comical timing.\n\n[Review]\nApplewood is a game with lovable characters,\
      \ fun mechanics, and a catchy soundtrack. It isn't insanely hard (except for\
      \ a certain optional dungeon) and provides a decent challenge for any level\
      \ gamer. \n\nNow while all of that is awesome, there is much more to this game\
      \ than meets the eye...\n\n...This game has emotion...\n\nIt's not all about\
      \ scaling the mountain and saving the day. It's heart-wretching. It's heart-warming.\
      \ And it's an incredible story. I'm not saying the game will make you cry (this\
      \ isn't the Hallmark Channel), but it will get you invested. It deals with heavy\
      \ themes and makes you care about the characters.\n\nThe beginning of the game\
      \ is humble. Yet, it is the ending which sets it apart.\n\nIt is reminiscent\
      \ of Undertale, but has a better story. You can see similarities in the intro\
      \ story, as well as in the ending.\n\nI sincerely hope this game gets the popularity\
      \ it deserves some day. But until then, I will cherish it as a private gem.\
      \ Thanks Garrett. \n\nGodspeed,\nBurton\n\nEdit: I had the chance to interview\
      \ the creator in a Q&A style talk! See here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bW-iOV_kNQ\n\
      It was a ton of fun. :D\n\n(Edited for Grammar)"
