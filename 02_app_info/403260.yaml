    about_the_game: '<strong>Albino Lullaby: Episode 2</strong> is a horror adventure
      game that doesn''t rely on jump scares or gore. A Lynchian psychological nightmare
      where you play as yourself. Escape from a dark and surreal Victorian town that
      clings to the precipices of underground cliffs. The gamespace dynamically twists
      and contorts around you in real time, as you unravel an equally twisted narrative.
      Discover the hidden spaces haunted by ''The Grandchildren'' as you uncover clues
      to understanding just where and what you are. Albino Lullaby is set for initial
      release on the PC and will be fully VR compatible.   <br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/403260/extras/garden2.png?t=1517894513"
