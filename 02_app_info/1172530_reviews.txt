Love the idea, so would like to see more added in updates or packs.\n\nAgree with some of the feedback here, plus: \n- the lack of contract between some of the colours like white and light blue can be too difficult when in Pro mode.\n- the discounted price was about right since there are so few puzzles at this stage, I wouldn't have paid more.\n- I ended up muting the music and playing my own lo-fi; getting more of a selection would be good. Sfx with scene could be cool too.\n- An option to spread the puzzle pieces equally would be helpful for the puzzles with so many pieces. Spent a lot of time just trying to organise so I could see the pieces.","timestamp_created":1609742109,"timestamp_updated":1609742109,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lOmG5vYCfuKnwAI="}
