Your current mission forces you to take a half-year long journey to a faraway station, and bring with you a mysterious cargo, while maneuvering between cultists, anarchists, men in blue, and corporats. It's a nice story about an uneasy task, full of dangers and intrigues. Amazing cast of characters, well-written fractions, and lots of opportunities to shape the exact captain you want to see.","timestamp_created":1602810231,"timestamp_updated":1602810231,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542546391487121582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jee7l/UCetmOqAI="}
