    review: "It's your standard RPG Maker game in terms of combat. So it's very bland\
      \ and boring in that regard. I find the art at times charming, at least for\
      \ the monsters. I mean there's a bunny on a scooter with a magic wand, what's\
      \ not to love there? But some are ugly as sin, like that weird ogre looking\
      \ thing seen in screenshots.\n\nBut beyond that, frequently, the visuals are\
      \ an abuse toward your eyesight. Some doors are hard to even see, the floor\
      \ tiles in some areas are just so ugly and blinding, and they hide NPCs in them.\
      \ NPCs who are also really ugly to look at. There's just not a lot to work with\
      \ to justify recommending it. \n\nOh and oddly there are five monsters in your\
      \ party [once you get 5], and you can only see 4 of their information on screen\
      \ at a time you have to otherwise scroll to see the 5th. I don't know if that's\
      \ a limit of the RPG Maker used or what, but it's really goofy. [you can see\
      \ the little arrow in the screenshots of the battles, that's what that means;\
      \ a fifth monster down there]. Makes battles a bit more annoying as you can't\
      \ at a glance make sure your team is okay to keep going.\n\nThere's the world's\
      \ worst ice puzzle ever made. On top of that I froze the game there by interacting\
      \ with a bouncy rock [why you bounce off it is beyond me]. I was inbetween a\
      \ stationary rock and a bouncy one and you can interact with the bouncy ones\
      \ to bounce back and after doing that and having nowhere to go it froze. And\
      \ that entire cave is annoying push puzzles that do not save when you finish\
      \ them, so that's fun, the save in the cave is after the awful ice puzzle. Yay.\n\
      \nThere's a boss battle with the most padded stats ever, the battle took over\
      \ 10 minutes of just beating away as there's not even access to mana restoration\
      \ items before that point so you just keep attacking and using potions until\
      \ the stupid thing dies."
