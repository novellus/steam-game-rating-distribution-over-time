    about_the_game: Malus is a Action Role Playing Game with an emphasis on horror,
      combat and gameplay. The game is much slower paced than your typical ARPG. <br><br>In
      Malus, the world has been overrun by eternal darkness. Demons have won the Celestial
      War and taken over the world. Every corner of the land you will find evil lurking.
      Humanity is in the brink of extinction. You play as either a Male or Female,
      you wake up in the middle of a forest, not knowing how you got there, you scower
      the land in search answers.<br><br>Soon uncovering dark and horrific secrets
      about the land and also yourself.<br><br><u><strong>Key Features:</strong></u><br><br><strong>Unique
      Combat System</strong><br>Malus features a lock on mechanic, while in combat
      that allows you to maneuver around enemies effectively. You also have the ability
      to Block (if you have a shield equiped) and Dodge on command. Combat is slower
      and more tactical compared to other ARPGs<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1254400/extras/malus_blocking.gif?t=1604462515"
      /><br><br><strong>Realism</strong><br>Your character keeps his weapon sheathed
      when not in combat, pulls an arrow out of the quiver when firing a bow and equips
      a lantern to light up dark areas. When there is no source of light, the area
      becomes almost pitch black. The goal is to create an immersive, believable atmospheric
      environment to allow players to engage in the story we wish to tell. We also
      try our best to minimize UI elements such as damage numbers and flashing enemies
      when hit.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1254400/extras/malus_drawsword.gif?t=1604462515"

      NOTE, THIS GAME IS IN ITS EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
      A LONG LASTING ARPG TO PLAY, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME</li></ul><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>The
      current build consist of a short portion of the starting questline. However
      once you finish the quest, you are able to explore on your own but do keep in
      the mind the map is not that big as this is only a temporary map. Future updates
      will consist of a much bigger open world map.</li></ul><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Keep
      in mind that this version of the Alpha build only allows for 1 save file, future
      developments will include multiple save profile.</li></ul><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Drop
      rates for all items including Uniques and Legendary has been set to 10% for
      testing purposes.</li></ul><br>Heres a link to our Discord <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://discord.gg/aDsMvjA"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"  >https://discord.gg/aDsMvjA</a></p><br><h1>Update
      Notes</h1><p>PATCH NOTE 02/03/2020<br><br>- fixed abominations in the city not
      doing damage for certain attacks<br>- fixed Yorgos music getting stuck<br>-
      fixed Yorgos not spawning after resting if you decide to not fight him the first
      time<br>- Fixed Status effects visible even after enemy is dead<br>- Fixed certain
      mobs not properly targeting on player<br>- Fixed Malus rock attack to cause
      damage<br>- Reduce damage of Malus beam attack<br>- Changed cursor to use hardware
      cursor instead of software to avoid mouse movement being tied to framerate<br><br>PATCH/HOTFIX  31/03/2020<br><br>-
      Fixed Yorgos spawning multiple times<br>- Fixed HP regen after death<br>- Fixed
      drawing a bow without quiver causing player to be stuck in &quot;draw&quot;
      state<br>- Fixed right clicking during new game scene causes your character
      to stand up and prevent UI from appearing<br><br>In sticking with the theme
      of souls like combat, I have decided to alter the combat alittle<br>- Melee
      attacks now have 3 hit combos instead of 2<br>- Changed the combat system of
      staff and melee to no longer be hold to attack, instead its a Combo Build up
      system, you can still hold to attack the only difference here is you have a
      combo counter, if you click once, you initiate combo1 if you click again within
      1 second time frame, you initiate combo2, if you do not, combo counter resets,
      max combo is 3, in the future, there will be passive skills that add to more
      combo attacks, allowing for combo customizations.<br>- Dodging no longer cancels
      attack animation, if you are in an attack animation you have to wait for it
      to finish to be able to dodge<br><br>The idea in this combat change is to force
      player to comit to an attack, giving consequences to the players actions<br><br>PATCH
      NOTE 30/03/2020<br><br>- Reworked Stats/atributes and level relations<br>- Implemented
      formulas for damage, armor, element, and resistances<br>- Implemented Weapon

      weapons<br>- Implemented enemies ability to output status effects such as burning,
      poison, etc<br>- Tweaked mouse movement input, cliffs and ledges will no longer
      restirct movement, meaning that your character can run off a cliff to his death,
      if you so choose<br>- Tweaked movement speed modifier for mouse-to-character
      distance to be less dramatic<br>- Fixed lampposts in the City blocking mouse
      input<br>- Reworked enemy AI, enemies will now keep chasing you as long as you
      are in its line of sight, to get away from an enemy you need to break line of
      sight, the enemy will then go to your last known location and search for a few
      seconds before returning to its spawn point.<br>Take a look here <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/153MoUwcMuTN-rY6XD0jT40hnAeQCupre/edit#gid=1960503375"

      3x<br>- While using bow or staff, when you turn to face an enemy from a distance,
      there is a slight delay to the turn rate, meaning you might miss your target
      unless you wait a little. This is to balance out ranged combat<br>- Modified

      during certain attacks)<br>- Added ability to be interupted when casting skills

      implemented into player stats where agility would add to &quot;Interupt resistance&quot;)<br>-
      Bosses are generally more stronger now<br>- You are now able to kill Malus,
      however you are not meant to, it is regarded as a bonus and its extremely dificult
      to do becasue the boss is designed to not be beatable. (If you do beat malus,
