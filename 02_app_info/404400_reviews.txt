The visuals are amazing, that's needless to say. it's exactly the reason why i bought it in first place. With such immersive visuals, I can't help but look at the characters and the environment, and wonder, what brought them to killing each other in the first place?\nThat is one way to improve it: add some cinematic, hints about the lore by implementing new game modes (solo, online) or new characters. Badblood feels empty after playing it, because it becomes somewhat of a repetitive experience. Sure, every gameplay varies because you don't know if you'll be able to strike the opponent this time, but then it just feels like a very small game.\n\nI watched Winnie Song's talk about violence, and sure, her game it's very violent. However, it has a lot of potential to express her message entirely, about how no one really wants to die and how violence is sometimes necessary. That's my take, it's a game with huge potential and i would definitely love to see it grow. i'm not sure if Song is still onto this proyect, but I absolutely still recommend it.","timestamp_created":1570904945,"timestamp_updated":1570904945,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lubO4O0CffP+0wE="}
