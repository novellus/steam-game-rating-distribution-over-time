    review: 'Short review:

      Would have played this longer but this "throw something" to "distract" the guards
      to get to the next point became very irritating, very fast. After reaching the
      point to board the transport and crossing some invisible line which triggered
      the guard at the other side of the screen and 10 tries to get past this point
      was enough to stop this game and put it in my superfluous folder.


      Summary: the controls in VR and implemented "distract" system are not polished
      enough for me to enjoy this game.'
