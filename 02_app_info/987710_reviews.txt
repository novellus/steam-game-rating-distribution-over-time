Your friend Jason has invited you to his birthday party. \"Well, I don't really care for social--\" \"It's at a laser tag arena.\" \"Now wait a minute.\"\n\nWhile you're lurching around the arena, ordained with clunky plastic, someone quietly calls out to you. \"Psst! Hey! Come 'ere!\" \"Huh?!\" \"Come look at what Gus figured out.\"\n\nYou stealth your way over to an obscure part of the arena where your friends are waiting. One of them hands you a postage stamp. \"Eat this first.\" You put the stump in your mouth and wait. \"Now what?\" \"Hit it, Gus.\" What does Gus do? He does something really weird with a mirror, a lightbulb, and his laser rifle. The result: BLASK.\n\n[b][u]The Good[/u][/b]:\n[list]\n[*]The game tricks you into thinking it will be easy.

Ever had to hit every ball in pockets at the same time to win? That's sort of what this is like--except not really.","timestamp_created":1586396927,"timestamp_updated":1586396927,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.622331678867340088","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wYKorvECe56n/wE="}
