Literally.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/www.thegamer.com\/spellpunk-vr-early-access-launch-trailer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Sam Watanuki, The Gamer<\/a><br><br>“As VR games go, this one’s pretty unique. Spellpunk VR gives players the ability to virtually ‘cast’ spells by actually drawing them out in space. Yes, that sounds a little bit Dr. Strange-y.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/brutalgamer.com\/2020\/04\/24\/mages-clash-in-spellpunk-vr\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Jason Micciche, Brutal Gamer<\/a><br><br>“Once I learned a few spells, I immediately felt the intensity settle in upon starting my first duel. SpellPunk makes me feel like a toddler trying to remember how to draw certain shapes. The main difference is I’m under pressure to draw a circle for a shield or a triangle to shoot a fireball.
