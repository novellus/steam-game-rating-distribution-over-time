When I played it back then, I thought it was pretty fun. It was a lot like playing the old star wars arcade game with better graphics and music. That is pretty much what it still is. \nRebel assault one works but the controls are horrible. Never played rebel assault one before. Rebel assault 2 works fine along with the controls for it. I bought it on sale for 3.49 dollars. I bought it mostly out of nostalgia.  I would not pay more than this or have very high expectations for this game.","timestamp_created":1609556371,"timestamp_updated":1609556371,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ446TC4PYCfp3MvwI="}
