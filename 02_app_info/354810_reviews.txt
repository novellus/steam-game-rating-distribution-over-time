I liked the backtracking mechanics and redoing levels with new colors, and I loved the visual color accessibility available for users. Unfortunately, I found it harder to avoid not breaking the game than to actually play the levels. I recommend it only for players with more discipline in not abusing glitches, who are interested in spending a little time with the game’s simple but interesting mechanics.","timestamp_created":1553023164,"timestamp_updated":1553023164,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5pvZy+kCftKzvQE="}
