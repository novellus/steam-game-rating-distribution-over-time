Your character lacks the ability to actually kill anything so the killing of enemy comes from luring them into the traps that would normally kill you.\n \n\nThe principle is good but the actual gameplay not so much. There is a lack of an ability to peek around the edges so a lot of times you are stuck just jumping into an area you cannot see at all and dying on a trap. Most of the difficulty in this game seems to stem from this die until you have seen  the entire stage aspect + the extremely jenky hitboxes. Traps that have already activated can still kill you before disappearing, the first major boss will kill you even if it is clearly not hitting you on the screen, enemies that kill you on touch will hit you when you are visibly out of range. Basically Flappy Bird in terms of hitbox accuracy.\n\nThe music is pretty decent, most of the tracks feel like a rehash of something else but different enough to not feel like a total ripoff. The aesthetic is the same fun Don't Starve style, some of the sprites are pasted on a bit poorly but you aren't likely to run across them except during deaths. \n\nNot sure if the game will actually run you 5 hours as the dev claims considering I reached the boss of the first of 5 worlds in under half an hour with my poor platforming skills.","timestamp_created":1492374700,"timestamp_updated":1602109750,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60336756706237793","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr9fLgvUCdtr7dg=="}
