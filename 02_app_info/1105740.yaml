    review: This Is Quite Rough Around The Edges, But I Love The Concept. I Think
      The Timing Minigame Is Really 50/50, People Either Like It, Or Hate It. Lots
      Of T Posing NPC's, Animation errors, Etc. Changes to Camera Angle Would Also
      Be Enjoyable. Character Customization Is Quite Limited as well. If You're Looking
      For A Basic RPG, Look Elsewhere, This is a unique spin on it, and i love the
      idea, however it seems to have been executed a bit sloppily, however I do enjoy
      the game in it's present state, despite all the bugs and issues. As far as i
      can tell, the devs are working on it, and are looking to improve it. And i'll
      support Them! But the most glaring issue here is the janky movement / no functioning
      minimap outside of combat, i think if that were improved, it would be a much
      better game.
