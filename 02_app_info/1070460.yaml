    review: 'Paid 99 cents, full price.


      This is a "wander a map picking things up from the ground and trading them with
      NPCs" puzzle game with a countdown failure mechanic. You''re in a vaguely Middle
      Ages town surrounded by woods, and need to find a cure for your disease as you
      slowly waste away and starve. All around the forest are various herbs, as well
      as water, wood and wildlife. Some things you can eat to reduce your hunger,
      such as berries. Some will reduce your disease level slightly, such as various
      herbs in combination that must be traded to an NPC who can turn them into a
      potion. Other NPCs can turn other materials into food or potable water, which
      might be needed for another combination of ingredients to trade, and so on.


      Based on the description, it sounds like the available trades will get more
      and more complex, eventually leading you into the town, where you can raise
      your reputation (your third stat) by more trading, eventually enabling you to
      trade your way to an actual cure. But I didn''t get this far; it''s not really
      my kind of game, and I found the controls a bit frustrating as movement is slow,
      I was constantly getting hung up on terrain, and was having difficulty right-clicking
      in exactly the correct spot to get a trade interface to open.


      It seems to do what it was designed to, has an interesting art style, and is
      fairly priced at 99 cents for a thematic puzzle game that won''t have much replay
      value once you figure out the optimal path for the trades. I''ll give it a thumbs-up;
      just know what to expect going in.'
