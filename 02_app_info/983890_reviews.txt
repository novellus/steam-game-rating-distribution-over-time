Not that getting hit hurts enough that you care, since you'll be teleporting back to town every so often to keep building the tower, and you get a free heal every time. The movement controls are also awkward, but it's not as though that ends up mattering much.\n\nNothing threatens you from the start and the game never gets harder, so it's probably fine that you don't improve until the end of the game, but... well, my point is it's trash and there's nothing to this game.\n\nNot recommended for anyone, not even if you already own it for some reason.","timestamp_created":1577334925,"timestamp_updated":1577334925,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559305965900421143","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47JyfoO8CcN+H5wE="}
