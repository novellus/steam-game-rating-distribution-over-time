      There\u2019s one word that continues to come to mind the more I play GhostControl\
      \ Inc.: Charming. This game has an undeniable charm that oozes from the fantastic\
      \ pixel art, silly wording, and simple but tough strategy elements. As long\
      \ as you\u2019re willing to go broke a few times, there\u2019s tons of fun to\
      \ be had while playing. Go forth and exterminate ghosts!\u201D<br><a href=\"\

      \ Inc is an awesome game! After all, who hasn\u2019t watched Ghostbusters, and\
      \ wanted to start a business like that? In many ways, it gives players enough\
      \ rope with which to hang themselves, but I wouldn\u2019t have it any other\
      \ way. I can\u2019t recommend it more highly! [...] I can easily see myself\
      \ coming back to it to go farther with the game, or start a new one on a higher\
      \ difficulty setting. So yeah, buy it!\u201D<br>5/5 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://operationrainfall.com/review-ghostcontrol-inc/\"\

    review: "GhostControl Inc sounds like a bargain title name used in a cartoon or\
      \ TV show to denote a Ghostbusters-like title they need for background noise\
      \ without actually paying for GhostBuster royalties for clips.\nIf you think\
      \ this, you'd be right. Is this game just as cheap? Somewhat but that's a good\
      \ thing.\n\nFor the price of 15 dollars you get a tactical strategy game set\
      \ on a isometric map that is turn based.\nYou are managing a team of Ghost Hunters\
      \ who use vacuum based weaponry and toaster traps to fight and capture spirits,\
      \ slowly earning money to become better at your trade.\n\nYou can upgrade your\
      \ weapons, characters, vehicle, and HQ. In a way it does remind me of the early\
      \ GhostBuster game from the Commodore 64. In small casual doses it can be fun.\
      \ Don't expect to binge nonstop on this because you'll eat through the game\
      \ very quickly.\n\nHowever despite the small dose of fun you get, there are\
      \ drawbacks.\nThe music is fairly small in selection and very repetitive, so\
      \ expect to turn it down or off after the first 20 minutes of play.\nThe artwork,\
      \ though not the greatest, does the job decently.\nThe map feels very small\
      \ for play, but at the same time that small size allows you to zip around the\
      \ city at a fair clip.\n\nSo if I have these problems, then what's the good\
      \ of the game? Honestly it feels good because of how simple it is. This game's\
      \ small maps and limited UI doesn't require too much thinking. Lay the trap\
      \ down, zap the ghost, and don't spend so much time on the map either the location\
      \ is destroyed or your hunter's sanity (the health meter) goes to 0 and they\
      \ run away. Your characters don't die as far as I can tell so it can be a forgiving\
      \ game.\n\nSo going back to the beginning of this review, GhostControl Inc sounds\
      \ like a low budget GhostBusters without the royalties and it is, but it does\
      \ what it says: Capture these spooky ghosts, earn money, and keep doing it.\
      \ There's no big story, no grandiose plot, no DLC, no controversy, it is very\
      \ much that trope of \"What's on the tin\". \n\nFor the financially minded,\
      \ if $15 is to much to spend on a cheap but fun game, wait for sale then. Aside\
      \ from that, I don't mind that I got this at full price. The amount of money\
      \ I put into this game would equal DLC on a big budget game that would maybe\
      \ provide a portion of fun or an outfit in a MMO. For that amount of cash, I\
      \ get a fairly casual and fun knock off of a beloved title from my childhood.\n\
      \nGet it, play it, forget it is in your library, then reinstall it again for\
      \ a quick hit of fun. That's my recommendation."
