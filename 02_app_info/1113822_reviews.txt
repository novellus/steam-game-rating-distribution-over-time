Then I have started to have place when I stop because I'm requesting to stop and next step of scenario is no more displayed. Nothing happen and I have to restart.  Then I have requested to swticher if I can pass or not pas I'm still to have any reply : nothing more is displayed.  It has occured several times. In another scenario wagon are attached to MP15DC. It's mandatory to detach them to do the scenario : there is no instruction to do so. Just now a train has decided to use same track I'm using requesting on 50 minutes lost on that mission.\n\nIt's globally good. I choose a negative review  because of those bugs. I may reconsider if they fix this.","timestamp_created":1599905415,"timestamp_updated":1599905415,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49efywPQCeqyooQI="}
