You progress slowly and with caution until you feel safe, start being uncautious and ... die miserably... \nBut you don't feel angry because like all die and retry you progress each time a little bit more and it feels quite rewarding to upgrade the different stats and perks of your character. Now you know better, you are better and you start again !\n\nFor this price, I would recommend it to any player that can bear to not just automatically advance through story line. Just give it a try it' a great game fellows.","timestamp_created":1584095483,"timestamp_updated":1584095483,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x9rc6fACdvHk9wE="}
