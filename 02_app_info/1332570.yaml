    review: "I'd give this game a neutral rating if I could. \n\n+ Story was interesting\
      \ for me but it was really hardcore. I don't remember making so many bad choices\
      \ in a Choice Of game.\n- Stats really need some description, I generally didn't\
      \ understand which stat was needed for which critical choice."
