    about_the_game: Uprising offers more strategy than a military sim, and more action
      strategy than a shoot'em up. Using your hi-tech assault tank, loaded with powerful
      weapons, you need to establish tidal bases, mine for power, build factories
      and direct legions of allied units against the enemy - all in an amazing 3D
      world. The path to the stars was heralded as a new beginning for peace, expansion
      and discovery. It did not happen. The oppressive Imperium power now controls
      the whole of known space, and the masses are restless. Now is the time to rise
      up and smash this regime.<br><br><strong>JOIN OR DIE!</strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><br><ul

    review: 'TL:DR >>> THE GAME IS GOOD BUT STEAM RELEASE IS BAD


      That is why I''m giving this a negative review and recommend not buying it here,
      but instead to try the GOG store. It seems to be far better.


      Uprising: Join or Die is my most favorite games ever, being a mix of RTS and
      FPS, perhaps one of the first in the genera. Released back in 1997/98, this
      had filled me with fears as a kid from the designs of the turrets (specially
      the enemy citadels) and how enemies would simply be "teleported" to your position
      when you least expected, and in the eyes of a 4 year old me, that was scary.
      When I became a teen I took upon myself to try and play it again, but not only
      that, try and beat it. And I did! But part of me wishes for more and more of
      it, and I keep coming back to it every year to do it all over again.


      When I first saw the release on GOG and here on steam I got hyped seeing how
      it has achievements and other goodies. "Finally I can play on windowsX and not
      on a virtual box!" I thought, but no. It is extremely unplayable, broken and
      doesn''t load properly. For a game that was abandon-ware to suddenly get "revived"
      to such a horrible state leaves me sad.


      To dive a bit more into the issues I''ve gotten to:

      Some cutscenes have lost color information and look like a puke of colors while
      you see it

      The mouse movement feels like it''s on a grid, it''s not a smooth movement and
      I have yet to see mentions of this for some reason. I''ve changed rigs twice
      and still have the same issue.

      This "modern re-release" has a feel of cheapness. Like, buying the IP and putting
      it on sale, but nothing works "correctly".

      Going through the pain of installing a virtual box with WinXP just to play the
      old abandon-ware version is far FAR better than this steam release.


      It saddens me but eh, it is what it is I guess.'
