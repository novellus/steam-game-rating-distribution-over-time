    review: I mean it does what it is intended to do. Be a spectator. Watch the cars
      zoom past once and not see them for awhile until they are on lap 2 or 3 etc.
      You can walk about the map. Hell you must be strong as I was able to push an
      accelerating car into the wall just by sprinting at it. (I do admit I did try
      to have my self killed by walking into the oncoming path of one of the cars
      but it just stopped right in it's tracks and I was not hurt). Another thing
      I noticed is that the cars can't seem to reverse properly (either that or the
      drivers are extremely incompetent). The last thing I will point out is the countless
      graphical glitches around the map, I am talking about various trees popping
      in, invisible bridges as well as invisible barriers. Not only that but the barriers
      you can see aren't terribly well modelled. This would of been a good demonstration
      piece for maybe a school project but as a game that you can spend real life
      money on? I don't think so. Don't get this game. At least for now. Maybe in
      the future the developer might add updates and other things that would improve
      the game.
