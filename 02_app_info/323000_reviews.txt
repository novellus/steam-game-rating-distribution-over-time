But because some major issues it is really a pain.\n\n1) upkeep (grind fest).\nyour mobile base and \"turrets\" cost you some money. For example you need to pay 20% of your income for base and 15% for your \"turrets\". it means that the upkeep for a fight is at 35% and that means that if you get 1000 gold from map it will be reduced to 650. The further the game you are the bigger the upkeep is and the more expensice the ubgrades. so basically the furhter you are the more gold you need but you will be recieving less. Taht means that if you need some money you need to play a map you can beat with \"low cost\". so basically you will be farming one map lots of times to get your ubgrades. This is not fun at all.\n\n2) Game Bug.\nWhen a mele mob is engaging your fortress, you stop moving. and sometimes your fortress dont start moving after you kill the one who stopped you. Everyone likes to restart map right? Because at this point there is nothing you can do.\n\n3) Auto aim\nSome of your turrets are \"automated\". They work really good... well most of the time. Some mobs can run away from you (for example range mobs that are to close to you) when they run the auto targetting wot hit it. and if your turret locks on that mob it will be occupied by shooting behind a mob till the mob wont stop or die.\n\n4) Progress\ngame keeps your \"record\" in 3 categories: monster killed, gold looted and time needed to finish. That is theory. in practice game dont save your time stats (but luckly you can live without it so it;)\n\n5) Medals\nyou can get your new fortress plans and \"turrets\" from 2 sources. By completing maps and by collecting medals. That is really great but... at some maps there are fiever mobs on map that you need to kill ( for example you need to kill 120 but map offers only 100). The trick here is that some mobs are in huts. if you destroy that hut to fast you loose mob. So in some maps you need to wait as long as you can with the destruction of the huts to get more mobs. And here comes the bug. You wait monsters comes in mele game crashes. you dont wait mobs dont come out you dont have medal...\n\n6)Info\nsome \"turrets\" just lack the proper info. For example \"spread shot\" shoots 4 arrows and it deals x amount of damage. The question is that is combined damage of 4 arrows or damage of one arrow?\n\n\nThe bottom line is This is a very good example of a very bad example. The game got great potential and it is wasted. If you plan only to simply \"finish the game\" it will be fun. If ou want to \"complete the game\" it will be a rebooting iritating grind fest.","timestamp_created":1484444626,"timestamp_updated":1484444626,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502487540245056152","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxe3yz9kCdI3Qbw=="}
