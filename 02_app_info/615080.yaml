    review: '5.00001/10 meh (Cannot believe this isn''t a F2P game)

      Not Good enough for a ringing endorsement. Not Bad enough to rip with a Neg
      review.

      Such a fun, unique concept, but falls flat on its face with totally bland GUI
      and scenery (just like screenshots above)

      The constantly panning camera sometimes takes train completely out of view &
      is just pitiful, almost unplayable.

      Can only recommend this game on D-E-E-P discount - I picked up for 70% off in
      the recent sale, so no regrets - However, at Full price - I cannot recommend.
      Cheers

      Other thoughts - from an Achievement standpoint, this is the grind of a lifetime
      (b-o-r-i-n-g) - just lather-rinse-repeat the same levels over and over enough
      to connect 2000 cities on varying difficulty levels - Total BS - IMHO'
