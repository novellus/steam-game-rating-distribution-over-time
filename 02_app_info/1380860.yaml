    about_the_game: "Ars Victor is a fast-paced, tense, two-player board game of tactical\
      \ combat. You command a furious fighting force OF THE FUTURE against a ferocious\
      \ foe. Recruit your armies. Scout out a unique map. Draw a hand of Command Cards.\
      \ Deploy your Vanguard. The battle is joined!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo win, you\
      \ must reduce your enemy\u2019s Glory to zero before they do the same to you.\
      \ Your successes on the battlefield chip away at your enemy\u2019s Glory. It\
      \ never goes up, only down; so it\u2019s always a tense, back-and-forth race\
      \ to the bottom.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour turn is simple: play a Command Card\
      \ to activate one or more of your units. Move them across the battlefield, and\
      \ try to slaughter the enemy. In the process, try to hold on to the three Capture\
      \ Points in the middle of the board, and keep your Headquarters alive.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nCombat is resolved in a single roll of multiple colored dice. Dice\
      \ quantity and color can be affected by terrain, as well as unit Special Abilities.\
      \ Simple icons on the dice show the results"
