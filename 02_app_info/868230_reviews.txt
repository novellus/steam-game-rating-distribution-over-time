I ended up rating it yes because it's a cute little easy hour of sokoban with a nice soundtrack, worth picking up on a sale if not at full price, but again, I wish I could give a sideways thumb, because there are some SERIOUS design problems with this game.\n\nFirst off, like other reviewers have said, basically all the difficulty is fake. The puzzles range from trivial to easy, but the fact that there's no undo button (so you have to restart if you die or accidentally press a box against a wall) and some real-time-based hazards (the trapdoors) artificially inflates the time required to beat the game. The game looks like it was ported from mobile, so I assume the absence of the undo button was originally paired up with an ad whenever you restart the level, but as a paid PC game this element is orphaned and weird.\n\nSecond off, there's a SERIOUS lack of polish. For instance, not only is there no continue button, it doesn't even save your scroll level on the level select screen; there's only 5 screens but the animation to scroll a screen down lasts like 3 seconds which is TEDIOUS\n\nThird, there's literally no way to tell which holes are actually coloured tiles waiting to be enabled until you press the button, which impairs the player's ability to make plans. Also as another person pointed out there are trivial unintended solutions for a lot of levels\n\nI rated thumbs up because I want to see another game with these graphics but better design","timestamp_created":1605147339,"timestamp_updated":1605147339,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j5WP3fUCf9rtrQI="}
