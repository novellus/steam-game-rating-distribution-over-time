    review: The game is okay, it is fun and nice but it is really short, You get an
      achievment for every level you beat so you can litterally 100% the game in less
      than an hour. The game looks fine, and the sound design is okay.  The game play
      is pretty much an automatic platformer where only one button is required to
      play, a really short and easy game of 24 short levels and a leaderboard.  If
      you want a small time waster to 100% this game might be for you, however I feel
      as if this would have been better off as a free game as it does not offer much
      else.
