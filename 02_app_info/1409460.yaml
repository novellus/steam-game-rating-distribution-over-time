    about_the_game: 'Brutal Fate is a fast-paced ultra-violent retro first-person
      shooter from the creator of the multiple award-winning mod &quot;Brutal Doom&quot;,
      inspired by 80''s and 90''s sci-fi movies. It blends the best features of classic
      shooters such as non-linear level design, a huge arsenal and large enemy variety
      with some modern aspects, making it a unique mix that does not try to hang on
      nostalgia, but be something of it''s own.<h2 class="bb_tag">Plot</h2>It is the
      year 2251. You are a Staff Sergeant serving as a platoon leader for the G.O.A.S.M.C.
      As the colony on Jupiter''s moon Callisto has gone silent, your battalion is
      called in to investigate. After a four-month journey, you arrive only to witness
      the most disturbing scene. Both the government personnel and one million civilians
      that lived in this colony, were merciless slaughtered - their bodies defiled
      in unspeakable macabre rituals. An unfathomable evil lurks in these dead streets
      now, its hungry eyes gazing upon you.<br>Suddenly the battleship is destroyed,
      over half of your attack force still inside. The surviving marines are helplessly
      stuck on this dead planet with no kind of support or a way out. A legion of
      interdimensional creatures arise from the darkness and surround you. Your one
      and only objective: Survive!<br>Will you fight alongside your brothers and sisters
      in arms and try to find a way to escape this nightmare? Or throw your own humanity
      away and dive into the abyss for a chance of your own survival?<h2 class="bb_tag">Do
      you want to know more?</h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>This game features
      a huge arsenal</strong> of weapons that may require the use of all your keyboard
      numbers to scroll through. We got battle rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers,
      smart missiles, laser rifles, nukes, knives, sharp sticks, you name it.<br><br></li><li><strong>Fight
      an entire circus of monstrosities</strong>, carnivorous demons, zombie-like
      cultists, shuffling supernatural incomprehensible abominations from beyond,
      and corporate henchmen that want to make sure you won''t leave this haunted
      colony alive after seeing everything you just did. Just like in classic fps
      style, each enemy type acts like a piece of chess made to compensate the weakness
      of another. Gib them into delicious meat pieces, burn them to ashes, almost
      every enemy features locational damage and dozens of death animations, including
      different  deaths for different weapons used.<br><br></li><li><strong>Explore
      huge non-linear levels</strong>, look for secrets to find special rare alternative
      ammo types for your weapons, health and armor upgrades, and much more. No &quot;procedural
      generated levels&quot;, no faux-retro arena level design, just handcrafted levels
      by someone with over 10 years of experience in classic game level design. Get
      the feeling of exploring believable locations, fight enemies in many different
      scenarios, scripted or not, pick them alone or in small groups and sometimes
      try to come up with a strategy to fight up to 50 enemies at once.<br><br></li><li><strong>Command
      your fellow marines</strong> out of this hell. Your character''s rank as a Staff
      Sergeant isn''t only for show. Find any survivors of this disastrous operation
      and they will follow you. They have an acceptable AI that will actually follow
      your commands, won''t block your movement, and will kill enemies for you. Magnificent,
      isn''t it?<br><br></li><li><strong>Mod it until it breaks.</strong> Running
      on the highly reliable GZDoom engine, this game is extremely easy to be modified.
      You can make mods,  add custom weapons, enemies, levels, and entire new user-made
      campaigns.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">How this game will work on Early Access?</h2>You
      will have a demo campaign of about 6 to 8 levels, 2 boss fights and at least
      one Horde Mode map (where you must defend an arena from waves of enemies). A
      free 2 level demo will be included the same day Early Access launches.<br>As
      days goes by, the Early Access builds will keep getting more levels (generally
      Horde Mode levels, because they are the best kind of levels to test the gameplay
      aspects of new weapons and monsters being added), and eventually in 2022, the
      game will receive a full launch with it''s main plot-driven campaign.'
