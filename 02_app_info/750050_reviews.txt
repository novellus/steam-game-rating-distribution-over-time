All i see with this game is some guys that gained clout on YT made a game with no physical knowledge of diesel trucks. The suspension is just a minor thing of it all, there needs to be more variations of suspension styles, for example, standard(its already in the game), 3-link, twin I-Beam, and straight leaf springs. The engine and transmission choices are down right disgusting, first the engine that is in-game currently, based off the close up of installation, is labelled Cummins with the proper injector count, apparently is now a V-12 in-game. there should be accurate representations of the motors, they dont even need to be branded to the company they are from, for example for the current styles of vehicles in the game, the salen 77 should receive a 6.0, 6.4, or 7.3 Powerstroke style motor. The Hill encore should get the 5.9 24v Cummins. The arton sterling should get the 6.6 Duramax. Each with their respective stock transmission being their real world counterpart. The exhaust on each vehicle should only be one pipe from the motor, unless its the 6.4 powerstroke as it is a twin turbo from factory, unless specified by usage of a \"Y\" pipe. Being there is already a catalyst there should be an optional muffler bypass pipe. The lugs are also a major flaw. There are no diesels in the entire world, on both 3/4 and 1 ton trucks, that utilize 5 lug wheels. There should be an option when you buy the axles to decide if you want either 6 or 8 lug wheels. The \"wheel support\" part is also useless unless you want spacers on the truck. and even then it should only be either 6 or 8 lug. no adapter from 6 to 8 lug. But if you add 10 lug wheels do add adapters and the appropriate 10 lug axles too. The drive shaft should have visible U-Joints, as well as there should be shaft supports like there is on modern vehicles. If you, the devs, would like to know more of what i would change about this game, contact me directly through the direct messaging of steam. If you cant let me know in your reply to my review and I will provide contact information.","timestamp_created":1609651601,"timestamp_updated":1609651601,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45set4/YCfIr8vwI="}
