      /><br><br>Gather your party and get ready for a new, back-to-the-roots RPG adventure!
      Discuss your decisions with companions; fight foes in turn-based combat; explore
      an open world and interact with everything and everyone you see. Join up with
      a friend to play online in co-op and make your own adventures with the powerful
      RPG toolkit. <br><br>In <strong>Divinity: Original Sin</strong> you take on
      the role of a young Source Hunter: your job is to rid the world of those who
      use the foulest of magics. When you embark on what should have been a routine
      murder investigation, you suddenly find yourself in the middle of a plot that
      will rattle the very fabric of time.<br><br><strong>Divinity: Original Sin</strong>
      is a game that gives you a lot of freedom and plenty of gameplay mechanics to
      use or abuse. The game''s epic story may drive you toward your ultimate end-goal,
      but how you get there is entirely up to you.<br><br>Or up to you and a friend,
      because Divinity: Original Sin can be played completely cooperatively, and features
      both online and local drop-in/drop-out multiplayer. Great adventures become
      even greater when shared with a trusted comrade-in-arms!<h2 class="bb_tag">Key

      use skill &amp; spell combos to overcome your many foes: Use magic to make it
      rain on your enemies, then cast a lightning spell to fry them to a crisp. Experiment
      with different skill combinations to ruin the day for enemies and townspeople
      alike. <br></li><li><strong>Play with a friend in co-op multiplayer.</strong>
