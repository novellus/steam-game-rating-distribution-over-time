A LONG time ago, almost a year now I believe.  At that time, it came across like a standard RPG.  It seems (at least according to the developer) that based on a desire not to go with the traditional mechanics, the game has now changed to something more resembling a visual novel with occasional airship-ness.  I believe the airship-ness is what they wanted to use as the selling point.\n\nNormally this would be okay, except that (at least from what I did play) the game has become absolutely dry.  Instead of a fully explorable 3D world, you are basically just advancing text like a visual novel.  A visual novel is NOT what I wanted, else I would have bought that kind of game.  \n\nThings just \"happen\" - here's a guildhouse for you, here's an airship for you, here's your first guild member, etc.  There's no real \"build\" to any of it and the story isn't enticing to go through.\n\nI could forgive the pacing issue, if it weren't for the horrible airship parts.  Controls are clunky (in my opinion) and it's just an exercise in fetch quests.  Looks nice, but not fun compared to what originally attracted me.\n\nSadly, I did ask a refund because this isn't at a point where I even see potential to get better.  Not without a complete rewrite (which I know won't happen).\n\nI am always willing to forgive developers that get it wrong when they fix it.  And he appears to be course correcting. But he maintains a very smarmy, very arrogant attitude about it - like he's offended that so many people dislike his current direction.  Maybe, sir, you need to understand that your vision is your vision, but you then will reap what you sow if people don't like it.\n\nWorst case, release two games - the original game you put out AND this other Frankengame that you developed and see which is more popular by sales numbers.  Because at the end of the day, that's all that matters - what's going to sell, not necessarily what YOU like.\n\nHere's what we ALMOST got, by the way.  Now, if the below video is an insta-buy for you, let the developer know this.  Please.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUn2KX-bppQ\n\nBut in the bigger picture of a thing, if you choose to try this game, be forewarned of how you will be treated by a developer that will happily take your money and not respect you as a customer.  He'll ban you for challenging his design direction and threaten you for trying to help him understand that he got it wrong.  It happens.\n\nThe difference is - as with No Man's Sky, for example - instead of going dictatorial, they FIXED their game and welcomed criticism, instead of asking for an echo chamber.","timestamp_created":1582946756,"timestamp_updated":1606446458,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":198,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.898314118385314941","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwyfTqg/YCcP+X9QE="}
