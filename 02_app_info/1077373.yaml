    about_the_game: 'This training program allows a client with speech anxiety to
      practice speaking in front of a large audience. The therapist can turn on a
      lamp that shows the client to what extend they are able to keep the interest
      and attention of the audience. The better they perform, the brighter the light
      shines. This is influenced by three factors: speaking loud and clear, standing
      up straight, and using body language. The program also shows the therapist which
      of these factors the client is applying.'
