      \ /><br><strong>Enter the world of Eco,</strong> a fully simulated ecosystem\
      \ bustling with thousands of growing plants and animals living their lives.\
      \ Build, harvest, and take resources from an environment where your every action\
      \ affects the world around you. An imminent meteor strike threatens global destruction.\
      \  Can you save the world without destroying it in the process?<br><br><img\

      \ /><br><br>Construct buildings and towns, tend to your farm, hunt wildlife,\
      \ build infrastructure and transportation, craft clothing, build power plants,\
      \ and research new technologies. Specialize in a craft and trade your goods\

      \ /><br><br>As your civilization grows, you\u2019ll need to analyze data from\
      \ the simulation; evaluating the impact you have on your world.  Use this data\
      \ as evidence in proposed laws, restricting harmful activities without disrupting\
      \ the advancement of technology. Balance your individual needs with the needs\
      \ of community, all while maintaining the state of the ecosystem. The future\

      \ /><br>Every organism in Eco exists as part of a detailed simulation; a disruption\
      \ in one species can have cascading effects across the planet. Chop down all\
      \ the trees, and habitats for creatures will be destroyed. Pollute the rivers\
      \ with mining waste, and your farms will become poisoned and die. The ecosystem\
      \ supplies the resources you and your community will need to stop the meteor.\
      \  Manage your pollution, mining waste, hunting, and resource collection to\
      \ balance your effect on this system.  <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/382310/extras/Mine_Tailings.gif?t=1607126536\"\

      \ /><br>Eco is built on a rich ecological simulation. All the data generated\
      \ from the interaction of plants, animals, climate, and players can be searched\
      \ and analyzed using in-game graphs and heat-maps. Use the collected information\
      \ as scientific evidence support to proposed laws.  The ability to successfully\
      \ debate using scientific evidence is your greatest weapon against the destruction\
      \ of your world.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/382310/extras/DataBorder.gif?t=1607126536\"\

      \ /><br>Establish and maintain your own set of laws and government, which are\
      \ enforced automatically by the game. Draft a proposal to limit clear-cutting\
      \ in a protected forest, incentivize green energy solutions over fossil fuels\
      \ by providing tax subsidies and penalties. Participate in elections for world\
      \ leadership, allowing you to set tax rates and allocate community money.  Use\
      \ a programmable law system to make dynamic and flexible rules for the community,\
      \ passing them by vote.   Construct a wide variety of governments; from tightly-regulated\
      \ dictator-states, to tax-and-spend subsidy programs, or even lawless communities\

      \ /><br>Your skills increase based on your food and shelter. By consuming a\
      \ highly nutritious variety of food and building an elaborate home you will\
      \ rapidly increase your skill points. Skill points can be spent on skills like\
      \ farming, hunting, trade, engineering, research, and more. Contribute to the\
      \ greater good while increasing your own personal success.<br><br><img src=\"\

      \ /><br>In the player-run economy, you achieve the most when you specialize\
      \ and trade both goods and services. Create stores to buy and sell goods you\
      \ need asynchronously with other players. Setup contracts within the game\u2019\
      s quest-like labor market, soliciting other players to perform specialized work\
      \ for you in exchange for payment. Build complex crafting machines and charge\
      \ a fee for players to use them. A thriving economy in Eco can be both a powerful\
      \ tool for progress, or a dangerous threat to the environment.<br><br>To grease\
      \ the wheels of commerce, you can create your own currencies, backed by fiat\
      \ or by resources.  Manage the value of your currency relative to others by\
      \ setting exchange rates at asynchronous currency exchanges. Sell items at stores\
      \ and collect credit from other players.  Eco is designed for rich asynchronous\
      \ play, allowing many players of many disciplines to contribute to one another\u2019\
      s goals at separate or simultaneous times. <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/382310/extras/Mint.png?t=1607126536\"\

      \ /><br>All of the world\u2019s resources originate from its environment, which\
      \ is affected by your actions.  While a meteor looms over head \u2014  set to\
      \ strike the planet in thirty days \u2014 a more subtle threat grows from player-interaction\
      \ with the environment.  Without careful attention, ecological destruction can\
      \ destroy civilization before the meteor even strikes.  To ultimately succeed,\
      \ you and your community will need to use the tools of government and economy\
      \ to find a balance between progress and protection.<br><br><strong>Included\

    reviews: "\u201CNumber 1 game of the year...Eco is a revelation...it made me realize\
      \ that games are actually crucial for understanding our relationship to all\
      \ kinds of natural and man-made systems. The thing that gives me chills is that\
      \ I think it is only in games that we can play with economic systems. And I\
      \ walked away from my experience in Eco feeling like I learned so much even\
      \ though we had no instructor. No one was connecting the dots for us. We simply\
      \ learned through play.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/27/jeff-grubb-game-of-the-year-2018/\"\
