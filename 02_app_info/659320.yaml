    about_the_game: "*In a super deep movie voice* In a world deprived of pixels,\
      \ Bit needs your help to restore the resolution in Chrominance. By using your\
      \ sick pixel gun and platforming skills you can help save Chrominance from Spectre\
      \ and get the girl (just kidding that's totally generic). <br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nTo complete this bad \u2665\u2665\u2665 adventure you must go through a series\
      \ of 3 worlds, each containing 20 levels (that's a total of 60 levels in case\
      \ you have some trouble with math). There are a variety of obstacles you will\
      \ have to surpass in each level, which will progressively become harder as you\
      \ go. Some of these include spikes, lava, and enemies with guns.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nAt the end of each world, these obstacles will seem pathetic compared\
      \ to the boss of the world. Once you defeat the boss, some of the pixels in\
      \ Chrominance will return. After defeating all 3 bosses, Chrominance will be\
      \ completely restored. Will you save Chrominance?"
