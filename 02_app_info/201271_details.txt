The Sakai clan could also claim to be related to the Minamoto clan, and to be cousins of both the Tokugawa and the Matsudaira clans. They are, then, very well connected. Their domain is worthy of them. The town of Obama had been a prosperous trading port, but its importance declined as Japan closed itself off from the outside world.

Their use of Ninja is unsurpassed on the battlefield and in covert operations.<br><br>The Todo clan, rulers of the Tsu domain, cannot claim a proud samurai lineage like many of the other great clans of Japan. Their beginnings are actually rather humble: Todo Takatora was an ashigaru, a peasant footsoldier, during the great wars of the Sengoku Jidai. So what? So too was the mighty general Toyotomi Hideyoshi, revered as one of the three great unifiers of Japan! Todo Takatora was wise enough to side with the Tokugawa clan at Sekigahara, and he was rewarded with the fief of Tsu, comprising a good part of the provinces of Iga and Ise.<br><br>Historically, the Tsu chose to play a &quot;long game&quot;, apparently supporting the Shogunate until the very last moment. At the Battle of Toba-Fushimi they sided with the Choshu and Satsuma domains, and therefore with the Imperial forces. They then provided the Imperialists with a strategic position to continue the drive towards Kyoto. Their central position on the mainland, in what is now Mie Prefecture, lay between Edo and Kyoto, and this allowed them enviable flexibility and options in their loyalties. Such flexibility goes some way to explain why they have such excellent shinobi at their command.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>About the Sendai Faction Pack<\/strong><\/h2><br><br><strong>The Negotiators<\/strong><br><br>Fiercely loyal to the incumbent Tokugawa Shogunate, the noble people of Sendai endured the ages of turmoil to emerge as respected tacticians and sublime diplomats.<br><br>Date Yoshikuni, the lord of Sendai, is loyal to the Shogunate. His family have been loyal to the Tokugawa clan since the end of the wars of the Sengoku Jidai. Then, Date Masamune had proven himself worthy, and established the domain with the blessing of the first Shogun. Even before then, the Sendai had been a noble and notable family of samurai, beginning as the Isa clan under the Minamoto. Given control of the Date province, and taking the name as their own, they survived centuries of turmoil. They have done this by political guile, implacable enemies, and fierce warriors. Now, as lords of Sendai, they are still all of those, even after centuries of relative peace. In battle, Sendai armies have longer when attacking, and need to defend for less time, making victory less of a race to achieve. The Sendai also have a bonus to all diplomatic efforts and are tolerant towards people with different allegiance.","about_the_game":"A Total War Saga: FALL OF THE SAMURAI features a dramatic clash of traditional Samurai culture with the explosive power of modern weaponry.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Now including all DLC faction packs, build up your armies with the Saga, Obama, Tsu and Sendai factions.<\/strong><\/h2><br><br><img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/201271\/extras\/FallOfTheSamurai_GIF1.gif?t=1603131053\" \/><br><br>About Total War Saga: FALL OF THE SAMURAI<br><br>Set 400 years after the events of Total War: SHOGUN 2, guide ancient Japan into the modern age, as the arrival of America, Britain and France incites a ferocious civil war which will decide the future of a nation.<br>Based on the backdrop of the Boshin War period, the new campaign starts in 1864, a time of growing resentment against Western colonial power and influence.
