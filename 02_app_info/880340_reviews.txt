I went on YouTube and watched a play through to make sure it was going to be something i would like. After a couple of minutes i realized it would be and since the game was on sale decided to snap it up.\n\nGlad i did. Very nice little FPS! \n\nNo real tutorial so you need to mess around with the keys to figure out which keys do what. R = Reload, Space = Jump, WASD to move FBLR, etc. etc.\n\nFirst level is on a space ship and you will get lost, use the M = map.\n\nI like it!!!","timestamp_created":1561134875,"timestamp_updated":1561134987,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60649418830871582","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47665vesCdOv2wwE="}
