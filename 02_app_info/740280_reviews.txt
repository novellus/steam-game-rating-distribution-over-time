I was hoping for a fun arcade shooter but this fails at being fun. It would have been a bad arcade game as well since they want to keep you playing long enough to keep dropping quarters in the slot. Your helicopter is HUGE and makes dodging bullets nearly impossible and you have to shoot enemies so many times that you're stuck in front of them like a sitting duck. Don't waste your time or money on this game.","timestamp_created":1607835148,"timestamp_updated":1607835148,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7qucrfYCefHbuQI="}
