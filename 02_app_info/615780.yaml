    reviews: "\u201CEvery step Nancy takes builds on what she has learned and it all\
      \ rolls out in a very logical way. This allows a player to advance without a\
      \ lot of the frustrations found in other games and really helps to get the gumshoe\
      \ juices flowing. This helps to provide the game a nice equilibrium to gameplay,\
      \ which benefits those looking for a challenging, but enjoyable gaming experience.\u201D\

      \ storyline is greatly enhanced by its historical elements. Marie \u201CLet\

    review: I played this as a young girl back when it first came out. Back then I
      had to have my dad help me with the puzzles. It is a challenging puzzle/mystery
      game set around Marie Antoinette's life. It was still challenging for me 20
      years later and still a lot of fun
