    review: "Easily the best choice of game I've read (second to Choice of Robots???)\
      \ There are so many outcomes and choices to make mutiple playthroughs are a\
      \ must, my next playthrough I'm going to 'mance [spoiler]Vega[/spoiler] and\
      \ maybe [spoiler]off the king[/spoiler] >:). The only [strike]negative[/strike]\
      \ complaint I have is the story is meant to be played with the king romanced\
      \ in chapter 1, you have 2 other options in chapter 1 (as far as I am aware\
      \ [spoiler]I can't bring myself to court the dusty ass aristocrat[/spoiler])\
      \ but I would love another chapter written on [spoiler] de Dendoza and your\
      \ life after you run off together, I just feel it ended to soon #DLCoppertunity\
      \ ;).[/spoiler] Other than that is was a great read I'm going for my 3rd run\
      \ soon and can't wait. \n\nIn conclusion, I am bitter [spoiler]I was betrayed,\
      \ I was burned at the stake and it sHOOk meee[/spoiler]"
