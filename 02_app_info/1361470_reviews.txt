You can teleport (but no way of turning other than physically turning yourself around obvs) & the only other movement is by holding the grips whilst swinging your arms. Definitely needs a better control scheme. Apart from that, the graphics are good but the sound can be a bit glitchy at times. Gameplay-wise, unless you know how to do all 33 Masonic rituals, you‚Äôve got absolutely no hope of getting very far at all. There are definitely some interesting set pieces & I‚Äôm glad I got it (mainly out of curiosity)....... Now for the jokey bit!: I hope someone will make a full walkthrough of this but I can‚Äôt see it happening somehow. I‚Äôve made SOME progress & done the first FEW basic ones but after that I‚Äôm totally stumped. THE ANSWERS NEED TO BE MADE READILY AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE!!! (Yes I‚Äôm being ironic). üòÅ","timestamp_created":1595458671,"timestamp_updated":1595458671,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56204378604888916","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4meqvvPMCea7+lgI="}
