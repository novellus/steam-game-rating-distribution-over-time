Now that Killing Floor 2 is out, there really isn't an excuse for most of these packs to be 8 dollars each. This is strictly for hardcore freaks of the first game with money to spend.\n\nStrangely, this one doesn't seem to be fully registered on the Steam storefront as DLC for KF1; most notably the purple DLC box on the store pages of all other downloadable content isn't present.","timestamp_created":1482560912,"timestamp_updated":1487117591,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570398509502410889","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nbTHn9oCcdyEbQ=="}
