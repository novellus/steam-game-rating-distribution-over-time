    review: 'The base game is great, and the DLC for this game is no exception. I
      am glad to see it was nominated for the Labor of Love award, because it deserves
      it. The developers clearly put a lot of work into this game. New bosses, new
      items, updated visuals (at least it looked like it to me. I took a break for
      a long time playing, and came back to a cleaner looking game).


      The new areas are sort of a mix of new levels and a spin on the older levels.
      The new enemies are great and actually generally feel more balanced than the
      base areas. While this makes me want to pick the new areas as their runs are
      easier, some of the bosses are more challenging. So it sort of depends on if
      you are feeling lucky.


      Even when me and my friends die and inevitably fail to beat the very very final
      boss on Nightmare difficulty because it is outrageously difficult and requires
      insane RNG (at least on multiplayer), we still have a lot of fun. A lot of crying
      and self-reflection as a result of our repeated defeat. But it is fun.


      There are some suggestions I would like to add, or things that I was hoping
      they might do but did not: I get SOOOOO MANY souls from my inevitable wipe in
      the very final area, just to see them all flushed down the pooper. It would
      be nice if there was something you could do with them. For example a vendor,
      some kind of continuous talent system you could add them into, a buff system
      for the next run, etc. I have easily wasted a million souls haha. I also think
      it might help if they added another option for the second area as well, or incorporated
      occasional side rooms there. New character variations would also be a nice addition.


      Overall though, this is a very solid DLC, and if you enjoyed working hard and
      getting your ass smashed in the first game, you will enjoy it here too.'
