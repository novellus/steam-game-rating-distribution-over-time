    review: 'This is a fairly short HO game.  It took me 5.5 hours to play both main
      game and bonus chapter.  The devs have maintained the quality in this game but
      it was far too short and ended very quickly.  The bonus chapter was good and
      was full of twists and turns.

      You are the leading expert on harmonium after all your travels.  A professor
      friend contacts you when a man from another world falls through her new portal.  He
      is ill and they don''t know how to cure him.  Kraixx tell you that his world
      is on the brink of destruction because the harmonium there has become imbalanced.  It
      could affect Earth too.

      You go back to his world and have to dodge the Watchers who arrest anyone with
      magical abilities.  As you travel Kraixx''s world, you discover the backstory
      of his culture.

      It is well done and the graphics are beautiful at times.  The music heightens
      the urgency of your quest.  There is a twist in the tale (which I saw coming).  There
      is a fair bit of backtracking, but you can fast travel through the map.  The
      map highlights where you can go next.

      The HO scenes are varied which keep your interest.  You have a popper game as
      an option if you can''t find an object.  The puzzles make you think, but are
      doable.  I didn''t skip any.

      There are owl collectables in every scene.  There are souvenirs too.  Both collectables
      can be found at the end of the game if you miss any.

      I have been left with mixed feelings with this game.  Some things are done really
      well, like the puzzles, some of which were quite unique.  But I thought the
      game finished with a rush as if they ran out of ideas.  5 hours is very short
      for a HO game and especially at the asked price.

      No bugs.  7.5/10'
