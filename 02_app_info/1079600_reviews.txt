The problem is nothing is satisfying in this game other than the movement. There is not enough sound effects, not enough animations, it's like playing a badass game that is not badass. It feels like a toy bow and arrow and I think the bow just needs more sounds and animations to make this game fun. Also the bow shoots at a horizontal angle which doesn't make sense to me. But on the bright side Aro Games, you have a good smooth engine, you just need to work on the action packed satisfaction in my opinion, and just the sound overall.","timestamp_created":1559339209,"timestamp_updated":1559339209,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60968327522277832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1559377082,"developer_response":"As I said on your Youtube channel\n----------------------------------------------\n\nHey thanks for your review and that you played E06 :)\nFirst: I like the way you make your reviews. It looks very natural and sympathetic.\n\nThere is no team behind this game. I like to develop video games and slowly try to turn my hobby into a profession.\nThis ist my first game :D \nI learned a lot during the development of E06 and will implement this knowledge in my new project.\nThrough your review, I now also know which weaknesses I urgently need to improve.\nYes sound effects are currently a big construction site with which I had to fight a lot during the development of E06.\nI will definitely work on my knowledge to expand this topic.\n\nOf course you are absolutely right it is a puzzle game in ego perspective.\nIt was important to me that the player gets as little help as possible because I find today's games too easy.\nYour muntion is also your life and it is getting harder and harder to keep up with while playing.\nThis is not only due to more difficult enemies and bosses but also puzzles that must be well thought out to waste as few arrows as possible.\nSo it is sometimes better to shoot the heat arrow and make the DoT tick while skillfully dodging the enemy to save arrows.\nWhile sometimes a frontal attack with the energy arrow is the better option.\nE06 is a slow game where many situations require a short break to choose the best strategy.\nExploring the environment for arrows and hints for puzzles are thus a key feature of this video game.\nUnfortunately, this is certainly not everyone's taste.\nNevertheless, I hope that you had at least a little fun :)\n\nI have subscribed to your channel :) \nGreetings from Germany and best regards \n\nAro Games"}],"cursor":"AoJ4koL3h+sCcqm9wgE="}
