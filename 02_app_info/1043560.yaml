    review: A very intriguing story set in an interesting cyber-punk world, Static
      offers a creepy and unsettling narrative that goes beyond the premise of a simple
      escape room.  Fantastic narration drives you to your objective to get the hell
      out of the massacre that your character evaded.  The world that this title sets
      up is intriguing and deep, providing story bits throughout the adventure via
      written and recorded logs of the victims in the building.  It makes you want
      to learn more about the world of Kanaka, something that I plan on doing by checking
      out Dogwood's other title in the universe, Ashes of Kanaka.
