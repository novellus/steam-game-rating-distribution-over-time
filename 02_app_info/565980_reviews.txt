You can finish this is in two hours, one sitting, so if you are in the mood for a short mystery, this one's for you. This is part of the Evertree saga, but this is a complete story. The sequel is more of an \"another story by the same protagonist\" thing, this gives you a satisfactory conclusion to the events it introduces. \n\nTraveling from point A to point B, you stop to spend the night on an inn. In 3 hours time, you will find a body. How you want to spend those 3 hours is up to you, and will heavily influence what happens. You can try to get closer to a particular guest or staff member, try to solve a mystery you stumble upon, or just keep to yourself. As the evening moves on, you may discover different clues. Do well enough, and after each segment you'll be treated to a nice stats bonus. Once you discover the body, you'll have to make an educated guess at who (or what) is behind the incident. What I like here is that it seems the game doesn't reward you for making the one correct answer, but by making one that makes sense according to the clues you have gathered up to that point. Afterwards, you have to deal with the incident to the best of your abilities, and fight for the best outcome, whatever that is to you. \n\nI like how straightforward the stats are. You only have 4: Combat (melee weapon and intimidation related), Guile (Stealth and deception), Perception (ability to read situations, surroundings, and Bow use), and Magic (self explanatory). \n\nI think the story was clever and the writing was good. I feel quite satisfied with this game, and it gets a strong recommendation from me, definetly worth experiencing if you are a fan of interactive fiction, or want to try it out for the first time.","timestamp_created":1594319176,"timestamp_updated":1594319176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlIC1mvMCe/WOlAI="}
