Very unique environment designs that were well thought out by the devs. Does not have finger tracking but controls just fine on the knuckles. Smooth turning is in the game and you can disable all the safety settings. Very atmospheric and creepy.\n\nNow for the bad stuff.. The game needs better optimization. Im getting on average 60fps and thats with SS turned to just 100%. Sometimes it dips down to the 40s and my reprojection rate is somewhere around 40% for some reason, never had this problem before. I wouldn't even touch this game if you have anything less then a 2080. \n\nWhile the game is gorgeous to look at, it can be draining to figure out. I don't mind when a game doesn't hold your hand but this game feels extremely disjointed and loosely put together with its mechanics. Once you figure them out it makes the game better, but only just a bit. I died 10+ times on the first puzzle simply because I couldn't figure out what to do. This game feels like a AAA horror game with shotty direction.\n\nI recommend this only to the hardest of VR Horror fans.","timestamp_created":1609714464,"timestamp_updated":1609714464,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0K6d5fYCdbycwAI="}
