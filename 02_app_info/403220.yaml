    about_the_game: This is the Original Soundtrack of Secrets of Grindea! It currently
      features 37 tracks (31 from Story mode, and 6 Arcade remixes), and new tracks
      will be added as the game itself expands.<br><br>The soundtrack is composed
      by Andrew Riley (Lucky Lion Studios), who's a superb musician and overall just
      a swell kind of dude! When we started out on the project, we were all students
      with no money to spare, and so couldn't afford any music. Along came Riley,
      who was so hyped on our work that he couldn't let that stand! He offered to
      compose the music at student-friendly rates, without sacrificing an inch of
      the quality.<br><br>We're very happy to be able to offer his music as a standalone
      soundtrack, and we hope you'll enjoy it!<br><br>For more Andrew Riley, check
      out his <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://luckylionstudios.com/"

      target="_blank" rel="noopener"  >bandcamp</a>!<br><br>To listen to the music,
      you can either use Steam's own music player, or find the songs as MP3s in the
      game install folder.<h2 class="bb_tag">Track List</h2><br><strong>Story Mode</strong><br><br>01
