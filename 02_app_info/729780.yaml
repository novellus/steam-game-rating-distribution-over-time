    review: "An old school light adventure with intelligent (and no junk pile) hogs\
      \ . \nI say old school as there is NO hand holding but there IS a very handy\
      \ journal in which our adventurer writes clues and sometimes figured solutions.\n\
      The graphics in this game are stunning ; I quite often forgot to play as I was\
      \ so often admiring the scene before me. \nThe story is different and engaging\
      \ , it progresses logically and maintain's ones interest. \nI was surprised\
      \ at how few seem to know about this game so felt obliged to write a review!\
      \ YES recommended!\n"
