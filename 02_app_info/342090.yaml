    review: Wow another negative review today...  I didn't finish this nor do I plan
      to.  This game has quite a number of problems a lack of sprint being among them.  I
      was actually playing on normal for once, and wasn't really enjoying it.  I got
      to Onyxus with one member dead, no revives left, and didn't have the supplies
      to make it back to the vending machine.  The worst part in this game is not
      only do enemies lv with you, but there's this rather lengthy section right after
      the first boss which requires you to play as a different set of characters that
      just breaks the flow of the game and it made me pretty bored.
