    review: the game is actually good.. but come on u have to collect this souls that
      look like little flames.. and i collected all i saw.. but sure some i didnt
      see.. even found extra hidden ones.. i helped all ghosts until i didnt have
      enough souls anymore.. about purple red and blue big stones in a cave.. and
      a ghost that needs 80 souls to help.. i have 72... can u pls... lower the souls
      that are needed to help.. 70/80 souls is getting to high.. with 50 and 60 i
      didnt have any problems.. but its bad that i now because of 8 souls cant help
      the ghost.. but im glad i still can continue playing just at a youtuber he has
      40 souls there (doubled it in new version ?) .. what i would have.. but not
      80
