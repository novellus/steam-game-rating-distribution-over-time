There hasn't been an update nor any word from the dev for over two years. I can't really blame him as this game was definitely going nowhere as you can probably tell by the low number of reviews. I think the dev just realized this wasn't worth working on anymore. Yet another unfinished indie game that never got out of early access. Don't waste your time even trying it at this point.","timestamp_created":1481837698,"timestamp_updated":1608612592,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504132270812988281","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwmIeyxPYCfb6obA=="}
