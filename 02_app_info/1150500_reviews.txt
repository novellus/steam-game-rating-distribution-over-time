This isn't even in a pre-alpha stage yet, it's more like in a drawing board stage of development. Shame, as I really liked the idea/concept of the game. But I should have listened to the overall negative reviews, you can't even do the tutorial in the game without it breaking, and can't delete your character to try again when it DOES break.\n\nThis should not be for sale, as the game is not even in a testable state.","timestamp_created":1609653818,"timestamp_updated":1609653980,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493421077728271484","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwttG24/YCdP38vwI="}
