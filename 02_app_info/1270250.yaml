      /><br><br>Unlock the never before seen Haidran Runner, Dread Streak and Saw
      Ship!<br><br>Only in this exclusive DLC gain access to three powerful warships
      with which you can wreak havoc upon the galaxy. <br><br><strong>The Haidran
      Runner</strong> - A powerful predator crafted in the remote parts of the galaxy.
      This ship will easily take the place as the flagship of your alliance. Capable
      in long range engagement, blockade running and battle it is versatile and deadly.
      This ship shoots explosive projectiles which detonate mid air in an array of
      destruction. <br><br><strong>The Dread Streak</strong> - The Dread Streak has
      incredible speed which makes it hard to catch and even harder to hit. This ship
      has the reputation of the fastest ship in the galaxy and it has been known to
      destroyed enemy strongholds single-handedly. Its power and unique maneuverability
      is more than often the key to victory. <br><br><strong>The Saw Ship</strong>
      - The Saw Ship substitutes a normal cannon for a massive saw blade which carves
      enemy ships into pieces. When you activate the saw, the ship slows down and
      begins destroying everything within its reach. This battleship is more like
      a beast than a space craft and it has been known to destroy entire worlds.

    review: "TL:DR - \n\nWYSIWYG. Makes the game funner... if you already enjoy the\
      \ game. xD\n\nLong Version -\n\nBasically this DLC gives you space ships that\
      \ you can't normally unlock in the first campaign. Two are level 4 ships and\
      \ one is a level 3 ship. Basically what that means is that they ANNIHILATE.\
      \ If you are having trouble with the campaign they turn the starting levels\
      \ into a breeze. Quite fun to play with, or in my case re-play the campaign\
      \ with these ships slaughtering stuff.\n\nI love this game so ofc I was going\
      \ to buy the DLC. This is a nice DLC but doesn't really change the game in anyway.\
      \ It alot funner playing with these with friends and its alot funner playing\
      \ these in the campaign but I'd say only a buy if you already really enjoy the\
      \ game.\n\n------\n\nGetting into more details I will specifically note that\
      \ the Hiadran Runner and Saw Ship are VERY FUN to play with. The Hiadran shoot\
      \ missile that then explode on second shot, the saw ship literally has a saw\
      \ hahahahhaha. Dread streak is good because it moves so fast but the least interesting\
      \ of the three ships.\n\nNote that the saw ship has to actually touch enemies\
      \ to kill them."
