    about_the_game: 'PSI Magic is a game developed with the intention of the player
      (you) being able to pick up the game and have a casual fun time. <br><br>With
      that in mind, levels in this game only have meaning in learning new skills as
      you level up allowing you to create more diverse strategies for enemies who
      also get stronger along with you. These same diverse strategies help when facing
      bosses which can modify the battle field to provide extreme elemental advantage
      in their favor so be careful not to forego the leveling aspect of the game!<br><br>PSI
      Magic also caters to those who simply wish to explore the game world by having
      hidden maps, bosses, collectibles, treasure and a mercenary system. If the player
      achieves certain criteria, they may even discover a hidden after boss beyond
      the final boss of the game!<br><br>Custom music tracks have been created to
      provide a novel experience along your journey throughout the game world in addition
      to the creation and use of custom assets to alleviate some of the eye sore that
      comes from over use of the base assets that come with the game engine.<br><br>The
      story focuses on the esper pair, Abell and Ceres, who, after a confrontation
      with a mysterious group, ended up in another world. In this world, the pair
      are joined by two others who then go on to face off against this group and put
      a stop to its grand-fully reckless scheme!<br><br>Gameplay Video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZZLGnnV-AA"
