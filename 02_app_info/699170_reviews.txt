You take on the role of an Arbiter, a law enforcer, of Captain rank who runs a company of Arbiter officers. Each officer in your company is a unique character w/ their own equipment, class & stats (HP, MP, Attack, Mind, Defense, Resistance, Speed). Classes range for standard fighter (mercenary), thief (scoundrel), black mage (wizard), white mage (mender) & branch out into dedicated rangers, assassins, spell-swords, barbarians, paladins & so on; requiring a certain amount of levels in other classes to unlock. There are *a lot* of classes, each w/ their own abilities & stat growth profiles.\n\nStory is interesting enough, serving well as a frame for turn based tactical battles as well as a solid enough mystery. But the core gameplay is solid enough to recommend on its own.","timestamp_created":1609822134,"timestamp_updated":1609835022,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw66Dp6PYCcpzNwAI="}
