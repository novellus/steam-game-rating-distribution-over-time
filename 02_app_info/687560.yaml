    review: I actually paid for this game back in the day, and I have zero regrets.
      Now that it's free there is no reason to not try this game. It's a cool unique
      puzzle disguised as a dungeon crawler. You have to plan ahead before moving
      from room to room (e.g. point to point); if you barrel blindly ahead, you'll
      lose.
