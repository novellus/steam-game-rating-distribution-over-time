    short_description: Horus IDLE is an IDLE rpg where you see similar scenarios but
      with a differnt approach. Horus IDLE has only one mission type and one Enemy
      Type. Horus IDLE was an attempt to pick what I liked from certain games. I also
      tried to shorten the game a little bit.
