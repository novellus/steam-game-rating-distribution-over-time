    review: "This is probably the most fun I've had with the Oculus Rift. Next to\
      \ Blaze Rush, this is one of the best examples of a simple aspect game. It's\
      \ probably my favourite shooter... not because the graphics are over the top,\
      \ though I'd definitely say they are good. But this is a game that gets your\
      \ adrenaline going. A little practice will amaze your friends the first time\
      \ out. It will only last for 5 minutes at a time, but you will want to play\
      \ over and over again. If you can manage to start hitting early, the spawn mechanism\
      \ will have you under intense fire quickly. The only real drawback that I can\
      \ see is the inability for me to switch hands, which being the southpaw, I want\
      \ to do. \nStill, one of my all time VR faves."
