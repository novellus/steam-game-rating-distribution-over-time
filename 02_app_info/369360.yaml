    about_the_game: "Summer break, a time to relax and have fun. But what's the difference\
      \ between a good summer and a great summer? Spending money, of course! And what\
      \ better way to earn some extra cash than a car wash? Unfortunately, the local\
      \ branch of Ninja Car Washing Corp. is right across the street and they don\u2019\
      t appreciate the competition...<br><br>Wash cars quickly to keep your customers\
      \ happy and keep the money coming in. But beware! Those pesky ninja will do\
      \ everything they can to run you out of business. You\u2019ll need to use your\
      \ wits, reflexes, and collection of basic car washing tools to defend against\
      \ their attacks while keeping your customers happy.<br><br>Learn to wield powerful\
      \ items like the Garden Hose, Giant Sponge, and Reptile Wax both to clean cars\
      \ and fend off the attacking ninja! You\u2019ll start by defending against simple\
      \ threats like muddy water balloons and exploding shuriken, but prove yourself\
      \ superior to such petty tricks and your reputation will grow, earning you more\
      \ customers and more attention from your enemies. Use the money earned to upgrade\
      \ your stand and buy new gear such as the Polishing Cloth, Textured Sponge,\
      \ and Fire Hose then put that equipment to work, taking on bigger jobs and fighting\
      \ off mud firing bazookas, ninja assassins, and the dreaded trained pigeon attack\
      \ squad!<br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br>Action/Casual Gameplay<br>A hilarious\
      \ story with hours of fun!<br>Three fast and furious arcade modes for endless\
      \ replay value!<br>Over 25 different tools and upgrades for your car wash!<br>Over\
      \ 20 different ninja to fight!<br>Choose to learn the game at a slow forgiving\
      \ pace, or skip ahead to the start of the action!"
