    review: "Small expansion for Medieval packages from PVGames. With this extension,\
      \ you can enrich your city or village life with different characters - I\xB4\
      m using them mostly as NPC\xB4s. \n\nBefore you evaluate negative packs from\
      \ this creator, it is important to note that DLCs from PVGames are not intended\
      \ for RTP style stuff or Celiana\xB4s DLC. It's because of a realistic concept\
      \ from this author (as well as his work for the previous generation of the program\
      \ - RPG Maker VX ACE). \n\nFull use of all DLCs from PVGames requires patience\
      \ and a little need to set up third-party plug-ins. Yes, this is not a plug\
      \ and play extension. For advanced use of the material, it is necessary to use\
      \ graphic software. [url=https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/plug-in-and-tools-list-useful-for-pvgames-resources.63602/]\
      \ Here is a link to the list of add-ons recommended by author himself. [/url]"
