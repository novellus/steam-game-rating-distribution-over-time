SCU feels like something completely new and very familiar at the same time.  Visuals, music and, especially, sounds create overall atmosphere of the game that is well integrated with its plot. \nGame play is also done well-though plot is linear in general, you’re able to choose your own pace and you don’t have to run around the whole area looking for triggers or items you need without any clues. \nI hadn’t any technical issues, the only inconvenience I had was inability to save game in other way than autosaves in check-points.  \nI’d recommend SCU if you like: (self-)exploration games with puzzle elements; games that make you reflect on it or good unusual indie-games.","timestamp_created":1610138450,"timestamp_updated":1610138706,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhdzv8fYCcubQwQI="}
