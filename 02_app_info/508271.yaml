    review: 'The manual is cute, but not required to play the game, unless you need
      a map.

      It''s useful if you want to talk about the game with someone else, e.g. a child,
      because it names all the creatures and plants in the game. It may also help
      someone for whom computer gaming is new or unusual.


      Unfortunately, it''s not part of the "Might and Delight" bundle.'
