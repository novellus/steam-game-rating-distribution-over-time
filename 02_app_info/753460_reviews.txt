He also deleted all the comments on his bad article about the K2 though I saved a screenshot of myself correcting him before he did so.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2126034055\n\nAfter I made a post pointing out that it is kind of rude to just post \"no\" and then lock the thread when a customer suggests something (I had suggested adding the T-34-85 to the game) he perma-banned me for \"spamming.\"\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2125956158\n\nA live-service game is only as good as the people working for the company and now that I know the caliber of the people working for this particular project, I wouldn't recommend it.\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nThe ban was removed... from Steam by someone working for Valve... but I am now banned from the AW Discord after I made the mistake of asking the mod \"Soren\" for help with the Steam ban. Soren is not even pretending to be decent as you can see. He even brazenly put \"Thanks for the feedback\" as the reason for the ban.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2127547497\n\nSo yeah, Steam is good but My.games is staffed by morons who treat their customers like dirt... That means that their games probably won't last much longer. Save your time and money. \n\nOld Review:\n\nI originally bought this purely because I wanted to support the devs. If you like the way it looks, get it. If not, don't get it because you can't change the paint.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it's exactly like the T-72A you get by playing the game.  I guess that's kind of a good thing but you can't use it to unlock other tanks since it is outside of the tech tree so in practice, I rarely use it since I feel like I am wasting my time if I am not progressing in a tech tree.","timestamp_created":1523588979,"timestamp_updated":1596933841,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553986310958862305","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hpSr6PMCdbWRngE="}
