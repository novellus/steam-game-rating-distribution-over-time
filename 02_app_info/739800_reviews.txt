Sort of. Actually, VR does not work automatically. You have to go into the game folders. Then get into the VR folder. Make sure Steam VR is running. Then double click on the VR game executable file, Classic mode is not available. \n\nSo now you started the game. The only option is arcade mode. So you have a laser pointer to make selections and get rid of the text bubbles. Then you can pickup a pickaxe and an axe. You grab them by selecting trigger. You notice that neither of them sit correctly in your hands. In fact, the pickaxe is facing the wrong direction where your Touch controller is facing.\n\nAnyways, you wave your hands and trees fall with the axe. Rocks get excavated with your pickaxe. Kill enemies with your axe. Except, nothing feels right. It's almost impossible to tell when you've hit an enemy or rock or tree. It feels like you're aimlessly waving your hands. Combat is some of the worst that exits in VR.\n\nThe game world looks ugly and repetitive. Is there an objective? Just keep killing enemies over and over and keep excavating rocks for worthless artifacts and different skinned weapons that feel the same? Is there a point to anything. If the game were free to play, I still wouldn't recommend it. The fact that the dev wants $3 for this is amazing. I should be paid $3 for troubleshooting your game and getting the VR to work.\n\nRate 3/10. I'm asking for a refund. I hate to do it, but this game is absolutely awful. Besides, VR doesn't work and I only got it to work because I figured it out on my own.","timestamp_created":1532408332,"timestamp_updated":1532408332,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.612077057361602783","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1532657374,"developer_response":"  To clarify your issues, this game is not tested on the Oculus Rift and not guaranteed to work. Rift+Touch compatibility is a hope for the future. Sorry for your experience.\n\n    That being said, if you had a Vive, which is the system this game was built for and tested on, VR mode would have been an option upon startup. \n\n     Again, the description clearly stated Oculus/Touch compatibility is untested. That is a fair reason for a refund, as you clearly didn't realize that compatibility for your device was not guaranteed. And your other criticisms are fair game. That being said, a fair review would clear up the fact that your hardware was not compatible. It's kind of a big point.\n\n However as someone that worked hard on this game by myself with some help from only one other person, and built this game as my first as I taught myself to code, your other criticisms are completely fair! This game will never be my best work, possibly my worst and possibly not. It is what it is, and as I develop my professional skills, I still have a family to take care of, and it is completely understandable if any particular thing I create with my growing skills is not up to par in terms of quality, that is certainly your criticism to make as a potential game buyer. I respect that completely, and I appreciate your review and the time you spent. Thanks, and don't discount future products! Everyone starts somewhere, and I'm not ashamed of having started somewhere! Have a good one."}],"cursor":"AoJw7u+p5eQCf/HepgE="}
