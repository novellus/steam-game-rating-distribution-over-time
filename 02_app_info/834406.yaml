    review: "Weardale & Teesdale is the very best route for TS2020 by a big margin.\
      \ It is the route I keep coming back to after trying others, particularly in\
      \ Quick Drive using a timetable from a suitable Bradshaws.\nHere we have a pack\
      \ of 10 new scenarios, all very different to those that come with the route.\
      \ These scenarios are exciting, challenging and fun to run. What is not to like?\
      \ \nThe scenarios utilise first generation diesels but with some steam. Anyone\
      \ who is a fan of trains that had to be driven and need a certain level of skill\
      \ will be well pleased with this pack.\nIntriguingly the pack is labelled  Weardale\
      \ & Teesdale Scenario Pack 01 which suggests there may be further packs - yes\
      \ pleeeeease.\nAt \xA36.99 it represents excellent value and I would have no\
      \ hesitation in recommending it.\nThank you Dovetail for this add-on pack.\n\
      Update: Have completed 5 scenarios successfully and they are great. Some of\
      \ the scenarios head up branch lines not utilised in the main route so very\
      \ interesting. HOWEVER:\nScenario WVR 1.06 Maintaining Lands Viaduct does NOT\
      \ work. You have to exit yard to pick up brake van past a signal at danger -\
      \ request to pass and request is approved BUT as soon as you pass the signal\
      \ its game over for passing a signal at danger. Surely this should have been\
      \ picked up and sorted if any sort of quality checks had been made. Quality\
      \ checks must be mandatory before releasing any software !!!! Also class 105\
      \ from Bishop Auckland to Middleton gave me a score of 0 points when I had actually\
      \ scored 765.\nI gave this pack a recommendation when it first came out because\
      \ Weardale is my favourite route and I really wanted more scenarios, particularly\
      \ over some of the branch lines which this pack offered. Unfortunately the quality\
      \ control is noticeable by its absence. Scenarios that do not work completely\
      \ spoil this pack. Save your money and do not buy."
