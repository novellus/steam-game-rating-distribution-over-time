I got 5 of 6 (couldn't get one of the girls endings). It's okay-ish as a game, the good thing is you can skip all dialogue right to a choice dialogue screen so you can try for all the endings really quickly. I wasn't really a fan of the game but I've never read the Sweetest Feminist comic it's based on so maybe I'd be more into the animation and humour if I had been a fan of the comic.","timestamp_created":1609422038,"timestamp_updated":1609422038,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv+zB3PYCc6qNvwI="}
