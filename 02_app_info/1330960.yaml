    about_the_game: "<strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ABOUT THE GAME</h2></strong><br>The\
      \ Commission 1920 is a turn-based strategy game set in the roaring 1920s where\
      \ you play as a Don of a mafia family. The goal is to manage your resources\
      \ and exert your influence on the city to remove competing powers using violence,\
      \ politics, and careful investment of illegal rackets. The Commission 1920 is\
      \ a remaster or &quot;definitive&quot; edition of the original The Commission\
      \ game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FEATURES</strong></h2><br><strong>Choose\
      \ your path:</strong> <br><br>Choose to align with one of five families, each\
      \ with unique backgrounds, strengths, weaknesses, and connections to the city\
      \ of New Shore. <br><br>The <strong>Bogiana family </strong>is a wealthy family\
      \ that runs like a big business. They\u2019ve established deep ties with the\
      \ politicians of New Shore, and specialize in high-end rackets. They often take\
      \ their success for granted, leaving their guard down: a key weakness that is\
      \ exploited by other families. <br><br>The <strong>Calessi family</strong> is\
      \ a family that is known for its code of honor and respectable operation (for\
      \ a crime family, at least). Their strategy can be described as \u201Cstrength\
      \ in numbers\u201D, and they have a growing network of associates throughout\
      \ the city. They traditionally have had the strongest reputation with the Commission\
      \ out of the five families.<br><br>The <strong>Donano family</strong> is a mysterious\
      \ family that prefers to stay out of sight and out of trouble. They prefer not\
      \ to get involved in conflicts, but that shouldn\u2019t be mistaken for pacifism.\
      \ Their influence on city politics and the media should not be underestimated.\
      \ If you wrong them, you\u2019ll find yourself with the whole city turned against\
      \ you.<br><br>The <strong>Junio family</strong> is a boisterous family that\
      \ is largely comprised of immigrants from the old country who settled in 1890s\
      \ Fordham. They specialize in low-end rackets that don\u2019t take much time\
      \ or investment. They seem to find profits in places other families would deem\
      \ a waste of time. They are the ever-present underdogs of New Shore.<br><br>The\
      \ <strong>Rocca family</strong> is a dangerous family that has no qualms about\
      \ engaging in high-risk rackets and killing those who get in their way. The\
      \ Rocca family faces perpetual inner turmoil, but no one can deny their influence\
      \ over the city. Nearly everyone knows someone who fell victim to the senseless\
      \ violence of the Rocca family\u2019s machinations.<br><br><br><strong>Expand\
      \ Your Control:</strong> <br><br>Through moving the members of your family to\
      \ different neighborhoods and boroughs, you can expand your family's influence\
      \ into New Shore and invest in a variety of illegal rackets. Expansion into\
      \ neighborhoods and rackets owned by other families will result in conflict,\
      \ requiring you to delicately balance between aggressive and peaceful actions.\
      \ Gain intel on other families, and target enemy units for assassination or\

      \ have shifting loyalty based on the actions of the family. Units with that\
      \ are disloyal can be recruited by enemy families and are more likely to sing\
      \ to the authorities when arrested. Loyalty is treasured among the family. You\
      \ can assign titles to your units, granting benefits, but also fueling the jealousy\
      \ of their disloyal peers.<br><br><strong>Manage Capo Agendas:</strong> <br><br>You\
