You sail around a fairly large map, have lite naval battles complete with boarding attacks, and land at various locations to explore towns, find side quests, and explore dungeons.  \n\nThere's a pretty good variety in weapons, with each type also having a few unique variants that are worth finding for the novelty alone, like a bow that lets you steer the arrows after firing or a hand axe that heals you when you do damage, and even more build customization in the other equipment and stats.  The dungeon exploration is pretty engaging, as they all have distinct puzzles and riddles to access all the unique loot.  You can hire AI crew members to tag along behind you, and even unlock your own settlement that you can expand and improve with all the money you stop really needing otherwise.\n\nThere's a few problems - items on the ground vanish if you leave a map, even ones that were hand-placed to appear the first time you enter, so if you go exploring and bail before completing an island or dungeon, you might not have the tools necessary to do so.  The storage is extremely limited, even if you take into account the stashes on your ship, and juggling weapons and items when you find something you want to take along is frustrating, especially if you're trying to complete multiple quests that require delivery.  The ally AI makes recruitable crew mostly useless, and sometimes downright hazardous [your own musketeers tend to shoot you in the back of the head during ship boarding] and the final ship upgrade is unnecessary, extremely expensive, and makes you go painfully slowly.  It was always fun finding a new unique weapon or unlocking a new spell, but many of the spells are too situational given the extremely fast pace of the combat, and casting requires a free offhand that's better used for a shield.  You can go fishing, but about half of the spots where fish appear are literally inaccessible with your hook.\n\nPlunder is a great game that feels straight out of the era of Flash games that were more compelling than a lot of AAA titles of the time, with just enough to see and do to keep you hooked without becoming a slog.","timestamp_created":1583080557,"timestamp_updated":1583080557,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.585226178169250488","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nIm9y/ACd9rE9QE="}
