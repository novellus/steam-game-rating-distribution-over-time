Players will already be hearing some of the tracks over and over while playing the game. More importantly, the music is intentionally pushed \"to the limits of bearability\" and, although it is cute and original, it just isn't one of the strong points of JaC itself (which I reviewed positively). I got this OST in a bundle (for $1.19) but won't be opening the files and wouldn't have paid money for it otherwise.","timestamp_created":1571922939,"timestamp_updated":1571922939,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x5H6/u0CfeHS1AE="}
