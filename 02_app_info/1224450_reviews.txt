This game not only has a great story but also great artwork to go with it.  It really makes this game compelling to play; you want to complete just one more puzzle to find out what happens next.  The game-play is what you'd expect from a jigsaw puzzle game but it is implemented in a solid way and is as satisfying as any physical jigsaw.  An absolute bargain considering how many puzzles you get for your money and how many options you have for the puzzle sizes.","timestamp_created":1608377336,"timestamp_updated":1608377336,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjNCwvfYCfNG0uwI="}
