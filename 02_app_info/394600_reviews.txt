Couple of the bosses are a good challenge but nothing that'll take you too long to overcome if you play a lot of games like these. Seen some reviews complain about unavoidable attacks on bosses and how they seem cheap but I'd just ignore that, you can no damage every boss in the game, just requires practice and repetition like any other game of this style.","timestamp_created":1609044496,"timestamp_updated":1609044496,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6NGh0fYCf+fQvQI="}
