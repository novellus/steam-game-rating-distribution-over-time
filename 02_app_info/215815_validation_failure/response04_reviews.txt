It just gives you armor that is very OP... if you are level 5 that is. Yes, this gear is for level 5, no you don't get level 10, 20, 30 versions. Just the level 5. It's useful up to some point and it's not bad, but not worth it's price. If it's on sale, with an at least 70%/80% off, then buy it, if you really want this armor. Otherwise it's just a waste of cash and yes, I recommend this... not the DLC, the game. But the DLC as well, if it's on sale only though. :D\n","timestamp_created":1434061530,"timestamp_updated":1434061530,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524064481258392334","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwucyu8s0Cc86ePg=="}
