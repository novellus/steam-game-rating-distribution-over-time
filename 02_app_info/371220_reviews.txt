Graphics are no where near some of the stuff I play so no reason it should be the graphics card. Makes the game 0% playable. No control config either, and the page it sends you to for how to play doesn't include all the buttons needed.","timestamp_created":1593498936,"timestamp_updated":1593498936,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498851895332336426","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrIT8gfMCe6nGkQI="}
