It really isnt very hard and can be super fun!\n-Easy to get going and play, but has a high skill cap so a lot of fun to learn mechanics and tactics!\n-Fast paced, one hit one kill gameplay (my opinion these are the kind of games i like).\n-many more\n\nThe cons\n-Small player base but is growing.\n-not much else honestly.\n\nLike i said earlier the devs are constantly taking community feedback and informing the community through discord of changes and updates (https://discord.gg/FYuBpu). Started playing early development around October 2019 i believe and have had fun watching it grow. Haven't been able to play much because of school but still recommend it when people ask for VR shooters!","timestamp_created":1609374043,"timestamp_updated":1609374043,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4t+GK2/YCd5H5vgI="}
