      \ strategy that are only further enhanced with those precious Void Stones you\
      \ collect.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fast paced combat</h2>Vault of the Void offers\
      \ card fights that are fast paced and familiar, with some subtle unique changes.<br><br>Although\

      \ turn, they\u2019ll increase your Threat. At the end of your next turn, your\
