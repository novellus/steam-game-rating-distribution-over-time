    review: 'Fun parody of RPGs with amusing lines and fights. Tactics were not as
      good as in the first part where using the Obsession meters to your advantage
      was necessary to win the fights by having the enemies trigger your best moves,
      whereas here it only unlocks another ultimate move I found myself saving for
      the next and then the next and the next fight.

      Unfortunately a bit buggy from time to time but usually nothing a good quickload
      or restart of the game won''t fix, just save often, the Quicksave is a blessing
      for your nerves.

      Overall well worth the buy in my opinion.'
