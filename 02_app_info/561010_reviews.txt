Unfortunately, I wouldn't consider it really complete as-is; there's absolutely no ability to save (you cannot hope to cultivate any truly satisfying ecosystem in one sitting), menu options are incredibly limited, draw distance is very small for a (very rapidly) ever-expanding island on which you are meant to keep an eye on the whole ecosystem of. The draw distance problem is further worsened by the fact that some new species will spawn a fair way out on the water, and won't actually appear on your island until you go collect it. And it's moving.\n\nThere's also, often, extremely little feedback. This is true both of your actions - aside from deleting a creature/item, there's no apparent impact - and of the state of the ecosystem itself. The lack of informational panels only works when there are more sprites/models to communicate the most basic info. For instance, what are things eating? What plants are new sprouts? Which are  growing old, and about to die? All in all, at least early free mode gives the impression of the worst kind of guessing game, basically just pouring energy into the flora and hoping that even does anything. Maybe enough trial and error would make this less opaque... except that there's no save feature, so there's not really any motivation to try and learn when your ecosystem will always be in the early stages, and the short view distance can make it difficult to judge the state of  things.\n\nI really wanted to love it, but even for the most simplistic of ecosystem games, it just doesn't meet the minimum requirements. I liked everything else: the controls are standard and respond well, intuitive enough to require no tutorial - moving around works exactly as you'd expect; the art style is simple, but adorable and endearing; the concept is one I desperately desire; the music is peaceful. However, no saves, no feedback and little draw distance just spell a death sentence here. Any sign of recent activity an I'd give it a second chance, but there's been nothing since 2017.","timestamp_created":1562320264,"timestamp_updated":1562320264,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtOvi4OsCdM/OzAE="}
