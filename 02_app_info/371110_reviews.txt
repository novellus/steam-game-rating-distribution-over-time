The bulk of it is a detailed walkthrough.  Bright red chapter headings warn you away before you read spoilers for the next bit of the game.\n\nIt's a 16+ MB PDF file that is accessible two ways.  \n\nFirst, by launching the game through Steam.  After purchasing the DLC, when you launch Midnight's Blessing directly from Steam you'll be asked whether you wish to start the game or 'View Walkthrough'.  The latter option opens up the guide in whatever program you have associated with PDF files.\n\nSecond, you can just browse the game's local files and find it that way.  Right-click on Midnight's Blessing in Steam, then click Properties->Local Files->Browse Local Files.  The guide is the only file in the Guide directory.\n\n(This might seem like information overkill, but at the time of writing the only other review implied the guide couldn't be accessed.  The main reason for leaving my own review was to set the record straight.)\n\nI bought it at 85% off and am happy with my purchase.  I'm not sure I'd pay full price for it, but at a 50% off or more sale it's probably worth it.","timestamp_created":1439951422,"timestamp_updated":1439951422,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.574502706527709961","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo+Dyoc8CduqVQw=="}
