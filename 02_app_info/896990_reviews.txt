At least they tried to be original (unlike many of the Artifax Mundi games). It was a good attempt at being original. However, the main game was too short and ended too abruptly. I don't even understand what happened at the end. Some of the mechanics in the main game were really confusing. I didn't care for the mini-games.\n\nIf you get it cheap (maybe 4.99 US or less), then it would be worth it, I think.","timestamp_created":1589682098,"timestamp_updated":1605427722,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8d685fUCetujiAI="}
