Its fantastic.\nDo you want to play a casual monster catcher with dark themes? \nThis is for you.\nThe atmosphere of the game is awesome and it shows promise with being developed throughout Early Access.\nSomethings can be improved but most importantly - the game is fun.\nThe way the breeding works and all the little features such as boss monsters are really enjoyable. \n\nI'm looking forward to seeing what they do and I'm glad to support it.\n","timestamp_created":1609740242,"timestamp_updated":1609740242,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwxdn/5fYCfZOnwAI="}
