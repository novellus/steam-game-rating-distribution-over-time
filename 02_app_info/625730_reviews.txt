This game is a thrilling adventure filled with explosive fun. I would highly recommend it to both puzzle lovers and people that wouldn't consider themselves good at puzzle games.\nI've never been a big fan of puzzle games but I still love this game. The puzzles are just hard enough to provide lots of fun blowing stuff up but not too hard that I feel like I want to quit after 10 minutes.\n\nI see lots of other reviews that don't recommend it due to the lack of content. There is now a level editor and community made maps. If you don't like the amount of levels in the game I would recommend making your own. I had so much fun making my own levels and trying to solve them (even though they where mostly impossible.\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say is that it does require a pretty decent PC, which is too be expected with such a high quality game.\n\nGood job Pixelz Games\n\n10/10","timestamp_created":1608069976,"timestamp_updated":1608069976,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/JGctPYCdLnGugI="}
