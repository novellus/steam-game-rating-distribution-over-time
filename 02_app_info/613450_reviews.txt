It's a perfect story of mental health and depression, it explains the state and the spiral downwards in a way I have not seen before in a game. The experience is tough on you, and this might have been the first time I wanted to step in to a game and give our character a hug, some food and just exist in their life telling them that they are not alone.  I will replay it again sometime when I myself feel better. And don't forget, it's cool to cry. 10 of 10 tears!","timestamp_created":1608992233,"timestamp_updated":1608992233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44qLaz/YCcOWyvQI="}
