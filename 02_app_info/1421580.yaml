    review: They might have stumpy little legs and so can only move 2 hexes uninspired,
      but they do also pack a punch once they get into the thick of things. A fun
      warband to play around with - place objectives situationally to help you inspire
      round 1 and then try to cause maximum damage to your opponents in rounds 2 and
      3.
