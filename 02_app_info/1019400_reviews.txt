Good music great screen effects, good for entertaining friends at house parties. easy to play, hard to master. and will work with all your own music as well as the pre-installed tracks.  Pretty good range to play with. and not as competitive as DDR or beat-saber. So everyone can enjoy it!  it's a perfect game to come home from a hard day of work or school and relax to! It gets my recommendation!  \n\nCons: it did not detect my xBox1 Wolverine controller at startup no matter what i did __Until__ i disconnected it while the game was running on the main menu, and reconnected it while still on the menu.  I have written to the devs about it and it will probably be fixed shortly.  That's not a big problem though really.. Just reconnect the ctrlr while the game is running.","timestamp_created":1570510244,"timestamp_updated":1570510244,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwipHt1O0CcJHe0wE="}
