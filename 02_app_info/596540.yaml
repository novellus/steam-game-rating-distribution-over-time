    review: "This is one of those games that can be played stand alone, but would\
      \ be better and make more sense if played with the other two games in the series.\
      \  If played stand alone, then the game would seem rushed and the stats gained\
      \ would not be as good.  In fact, if played just stand alone, it would seem\
      \ rushed and terrible.  If played with the other two games it is a lot better.\
      \  For best results, one must play with the other two games and import the character\
      \ made.\n\nIf I were to say one thing about this game that does not hold up\
      \ well, whether stand alone or with the other two games, it would be the tournament.\
      \  I managed to make a character with high stats and able to use most weapons.\
      \  Despite that, I lost in the second round.  I had a strength of 179, and the\
      \ other person had a strength of 27.  After the roll, I lost with a strength\
      \ of 17 versus the opponent's 89.  \n\nTo get certain endings. one had to craft\
      \ a character all through the three games to get the stats needed to gain the\
      \ certain endings.  The multi classing needed keeps from going pure one class\
      \ very well, or even the way one wants to play.  To make it so that any sort\
      \ of play through can get any ending, minus the obvious alignment of good or\
      \ evil, is something that I find to be a bummer in and of itself.  Even so,\
      \ I find it funny how one can get a 'Good' ending by being a Dark Knight with\
      \ 100 percent citizen fear, all the while worshiping an evil god  and being\
      \ an immortal demon."
