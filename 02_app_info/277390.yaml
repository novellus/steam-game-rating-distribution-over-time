    reviews: "\u201CEvery piece of Videoball feels crafted for competition, and even\
      \ when I was getting whipped by the game's AI opponents, it was a joy to play.\
      \ With the pinpoint control and endless playability of the best arcade sports\
      \ experiences, the small team at Action Button Entertainment has invented something\
      \ wonderful and new in Videoball.\u201D<br>9 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/7/12/12124516/videoball-review-pc-ps4-playstation-4-xbox-one\"\

      Best of all, it all feels really good. There is a great sense of momentum and\
      \ movement in Videoball. The sense of acceleration after a dead stop, the slipperiness\
      \ of trying to reverse direction, the desperate race for a last-second save.\
      \ Everything has a pleasing kind of grip to it.\u201D<br>9 \u2013 <a href=\"\

      \ clean retro stylings and deceptively simple set up, Videoball may blindside\
