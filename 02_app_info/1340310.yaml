      [b]nine lives[/b] is a cat-based isometric puzzler with excellent voxel-based
      presentation from the developer behind the amazing [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/dohi64/recommended/1113690]senna
      and the forest[/url], among other things. I''m not a fan of cats (to put it
      mildly) and I think they''re seriouly over-represented in video games, as they
      are in real life, but in this case their presence is justified because of the
      whole nine lives thing.


      the cat starts with a single life and has to earn the rest by completing various
      trials. it''s basically [b]one of those cloning and timing games[/b] where you
      have to do something, then create another iteration of yourself, then do something
      else while the first one retraces your steps, etc. or in this case, kill the
      current cat and start moving another while the previous one''s ghost does its
      thing. movement uses energy, which I found unnecessary at first and it won''t
      be an issue for quite some time, but comes into play later. and of course grabbing
      more lives in later areas won''t let you use them in earlier ones to trivialize
      those puzzles.


      besides stepping on pressure plates, there are shooting plants, mice to catch
      (if spooked, they move between bushes of the same color, ghosts don''t block
      them, nor can they catch them), stingy objects that only disappear for a while
      after touching them and they have an area of effect attack, and areas where
      ghosts can''t enter. cats can be drowned in water and ghosts will serve as bridges
      or rafts, and mad cows have to be distracted and moved away from pressure plates.
      or lured in front of shooting plants to block their shots. no animal is safe
      here.


      simply putting boxes in their place comes surprisingly late in the game, but
      it''s a trickier venture than it sounds. not only are you slower while carrying
      one, but it consumes more energy and after a while the cat dies from exhaustion
      and the next one has to take over. then there''s reverse movement: stepping
      on an inverted pressure plate will reproduce movements backwards, letting you
      use ghosts behind no-ghost barriers. the whole cloning business is already way
      above my brain capacity, but this is something else, especially when combined
      with all the other stuff.


      the [b]80+ levels[/b] are grouped into 9 packs, unlocked with coins, but you
      don''t have to complete every level to get enough for the next pack, and there''s
      usually more than one level to try at any given time. wasd, arrows and the mouse
      are used for movement, mouse wheel to zoom (not really necessary), space to
      end the cat''s current life and restart the cycle with a new one. backspace
      brings up the undo screen to take back any number of lives, or all of them,
      effectively resetting the level. separate volume settings, resolutions, windowed
      mode and anti-aliasing options are available as well.


      it''s a bit clunky sometimes, but despite the cat theme it''s [b]just as charming
      as the developer''s previous games, but a lot more difficult[/b]. varied, colorful
      presentation and lots of clever mechanics, my favorite being the chaotic final
      level pack. too bad I hate this cloning/timing-based puzzle type, so I passed
      on most levels, but wanted to support the developer and put the game on the
      radar for those who enjoy this sort of thing but might''ve missed it otherwise.
      you can try it for yourself, a [b]demo is available[/b].'
