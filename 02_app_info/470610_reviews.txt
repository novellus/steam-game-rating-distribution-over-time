You get almost as much value for what you pay (still slightly better than LP purchase in store). If you are new, I'd suggest getting either the Martyr's Bounty DLC (extremely good deal) or Treasure of the Calamity DLC (very good deal) instead. If you want some extra LP, you can also snag this one alongside the others. Only really recommended if it's on sale for a discounted price, otherwise it's still okay to get, but nothing special.\n\n[b]Recommended if on sale.[/b] [i]You may choose to play this game for free as it has a fantastic free-to-play mode that won't take you long to acquire a decent deck, but this will give you a slight headstart.[/i]\n\nIf you are new, I will help you understand what value this has.\n\n1 Booster Pack = 150 LP (purchasable ingame currency) or 3000 IP (grindable ingame currency)\n$1 = ~200 LP\n\n[olist]\n[*]You get 3 Booster packs total (faction specific packs = 300 LP). That means you get a total LP value of 450 LP (~$2,50). \n[*]You get 3 Rift Run Tokens (draft mode). Each Drafted Mode Run costs 75 LP or 1 Rift Run Token. 3 Tokens = 225 LP (~$1)\n[*]You get 3x Wealthy Noble. This card is very easy to obtain, so it hardly has any nameable value. ($0)\n[*]You get a few cosmetics and 3x 24-hour 50% XP/IP Boosters. Hard to value, so lets say it's free ontop.\n[*]You get 400 LP ontop (~$2)\n[/olist]\n\nLet's do maths: $2,50 + $1 + $2 = $6,50 + Freebies!\n\n[b]Conclusion: You pay ~$6 (~5â‚¬) and get value worth ~$6,50 + a few Freebies.[/b]","timestamp_created":1466761161,"timestamp_updated":1466761764,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.716342926025390625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyov0wNUCf+rMWg=="}
