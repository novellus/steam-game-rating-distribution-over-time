Like the other games, it has lovely artwork, soft music, and light puzzles. \n\nI found the story to be pretty decent and a good conclusion. The bonus chapter, which takes place years afterward, was a bit long and tedious. It also had an issue with the final mini game where the rules changed on the final wave.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this game and recommend it for fans of this series or fans of hidden object games in general.","timestamp_created":1607742461,"timestamp_updated":1607742461,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xOK6qvYCda6puQI="}
