    review: I bought this game around April.  The last time the game was updated was
      in April.  It's absolute trash the way this developer has updated their game.  It
      hasn't had an update since April 2020.  They get upset at another customer in
      discussions on them calling the game a scam, which at this point I do agree
      with that statement.  There's no communication from the dev on when the game
      will get updates or anything.  Too late for me to get a refund but for anyone
      else, do not waste your money.
