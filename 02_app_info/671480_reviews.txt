The colors are beautiful, the animationa dn landscape are cool and dreamlike, the music and sound effects are great. You are a blue crieature that must follow a kind of wisp and activate musical critters in order to travel around the scenery. The more you activate, the more complex the music they end up making.\n\nMokMok is fairly intuitive and easy to use, and at the beginning it displays some tips on how you can navigate through the world. \n\nI actually enjoyed the experience despite it didn´t seem too challenging nor much of a game-game, I felt more as if I was in soem kind of sandbox.\nI did finish teh episod eon my first run in under 15 minutes, and I was in no hurry at all. That and the little sense I got of actually playin were my biggest drawbacks. I didn´t find the sounds especially relaxing either, so it is not like a Game I would come ack to if I wanted to relax. Maybe other episodes will change that, but not for now.\n\nBut still, the graphs, soundtracl and concept were interestinge enough as to end up recommending it.","timestamp_created":1515120887,"timestamp_updated":1515120887,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zcCP4uACfceFlQE="}
