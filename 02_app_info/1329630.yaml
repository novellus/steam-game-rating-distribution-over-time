    about_the_game: "The first major battle of the Civil War was fought in Georgia,\
      \ from September the 18th-20th 1863.  The Battle of Chickamauga was the most\

      \ number of casualties of any civil war battle, after the Battle of Gettysburg.\
      \  The army of the Cumberland under Major General William Rosecrans engaged\
      \ the Confederate Army of Tennessee under General Braxton Bragg.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nIn early September Rosecrans had forced Bragg's army out of Chattanooga\

      \ decided to meet a part of Rosecrans army and defeat them, allowing him to\
      \ move back into the city. On the way north he ran into the Union army.<br />\r\
