    about_the_game: You can't beat this game!!! Super Hipster Lumberjack is a love
      letter to very difficult flash platformers. It is a collaboration of ideas I
      have had since I was a kid and the games I have always enjoyed playing. In this
      story Noah attempts to make a game for the first time. He then gets trapped
      in his own creation. He learns that making games is a lot harder than he thought.<br><br>Note
      From Dev (2020):<br>This is a game I made while I was in high school. It meant
      a lot to me that so many people were very supportive of this game when it came
      out. I don't know if I'd be making games today without getting to have the experience
      of finishing and releasing SHL. Since making this game I've gotten to apply
      everything I've learned into making even better games and will continue to as
      long as I can. This year 2020 I released an FPS called Apastron! <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1264850/Apastron/"
      target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"  id="dynamiclink_1" >https://store.steampowered.com/app/1264850/Apastron/</a>
      That games creation wasn't possible without the support people have given SHL,
      so from the bottom of my heart, thank you!
