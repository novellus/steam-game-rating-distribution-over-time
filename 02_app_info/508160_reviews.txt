There are not enough around in my opinion and this one is worth the investment of money and time. I adore the characters and the hugely complex world of this game, it pulls on the heart-strings and leaves you wanting more.\n\nShinji's Epilogue was a lot of fun, getting to see what happens after the drama of the story.","timestamp_created":1534781051,"timestamp_updated":1534781051,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h4qFrOUCddfzqAE="}
