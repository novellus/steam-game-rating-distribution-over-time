I really enjoy this game because you can strategise the launching/flinging move of the Piggy Princess herself. Another nice feature that makes it different from Angry Birds is the use of objects; it's a but like animism, only you can use the objects to strategise your moves. For example, in one level you have to startegise with levers, boulders and magic all at the same time.\nIf you would like a game that works very similarly to Angry Birds but still has its differences, then I would recommend this game to all gamers. It's an interesting title that's worth the purchase.","timestamp_created":1468092640,"timestamp_updated":1468092640,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.441767066717147827","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsP3I6NUCdM+vXA=="}
