Even if no issues occour durring the game itself when the frames have ended nothing happens and I once again have only one option to close the entire program and relaunch it. If this issue were fixed I would advicate highly for this game but until it is fix I must warn you away.","timestamp_created":1532501307,"timestamp_updated":1532501307,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ458WM6OQCfPropgE="}
