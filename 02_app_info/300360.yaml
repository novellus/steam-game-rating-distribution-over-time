    review: "29.5.2020.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGame #127\n\n[h1] I bought this game to support\
      \ my country. I regret it [/h1]\n\nEvil Pumpkin: The Lost Halloween might be\
      \ remember on Steam for one thing and one thing only. It was the first video\
      \ game ever to be released on Steam by Serbs. Being an effing Serb myself, I\
      \ felt like it was my civil duty to buy this game (on sale) and support the\
      \ developers. \nI tried hard to like this game but I just couldn\u2019t.\n\n\
      [h1] The sad truth about Hidden Object Puzzle Adventure (HOPA) games [/h1]\n\
      \nWhile our neighbors in the north-west are making games like Serious Sam https://store.steampowered.com/app/41000/Serious_Sam_HD_The_First_Encounter/\
      \ and The Talos Principle https://store.steampowered.com/app/257510/The_Talos_Principle/,\
      \ us Serbs here are mostly stuck making, almost exclusively, HOPA games. Hopa\
      \ games are an interesting breed of games. They mostly consist of really detailed\
      \ still images, some texts and very light puzzle solving. I actually really\
      \ like HOPA games. They can be a lot of fun. Not only are they relaxing to play\
      \ but you can also give your brain a nice workout and even improve your vocabulary\
      \ while searching for that one hidden item. \n\nThe problem is that\u2026 HOPA\
      \ games are massively produced. Before Steam opened the floodgates of Greenlight\
      \ and Direct it didn\u2019t really have a lot of HOPA games. I\u2019m not saying\
      \ that HOPA games shouldn\u2019t be on Steam but, if I was in the mood for a\
      \ HOPA game, Steam wouldn\u2019t be the first place to look for one.\n\nWebsites\
      \ like BigFishGames are the main publishers/distributors of these games and\
      \ they have so many of them. Not only that, but most HOPA games seem take place\
      \ in a spooky mansion with eerie music and other generic creepy themes. \n\n\
      [h1] The story about a boy who cares too much for Halloween [/h1]\n\nThe story\
      \ in this game starts with a little boy reading a stolen Halloween book that\
      \ tells the \u201CActual\u201D story of Halloween. As he reads this book, a\
      \ talking owl appears and persuades him to figure out the actual truth behind\
      \ Halloween and its origins. Seeing how the boy doesn\u2019t have anything better\
      \ to do, he sets out on a journey to escape his house and figure things out.\n\
      \ \n[h1] All HOPA games play this way [/h1]\n\nThe gameplay of this game, and\
      \ all other hopa games, consists of you going through rooms, solving puzzles,\
      \ collecting items and, most importantly, looking for hidden objects. While\
      \ item collecting and exploring rooms is nothing unusual, looking for hidden\
      \ objects is where the meat of HOPA games really is. Most rooms in this game\
      \ consist of still beautifully drawn images with a lot of attention to detail.\
      \ Whenever you see something unusual, out of place and sparkly, you should click\
      \ on it. More often than not, you will click on a sparkly place and be sent\
      \ to a window with a messed up pile of junk, but don\u2019t be disgusted, because\
      \ that\u2019s what these games are about. You are supposed to find a list of\
      \ items in this pile of junk and after you finish the list, you will be awarded\
      \ with an item which will help you progress, at least, that\u2019s the idea.\
      \ The object is usually a key, a piece of a mechanism or something similar.\
      \ \n\n[h1] Evil Pumpkin: The Lost Halloween wants to be MORE than just another\
      \ HOPA game [/h1]\n\nLike I mentioned above, most HOPA games are the same and\
      \ it\u2019s really hard to tell them apart. Publishers of HOPA games don\u2019\
      t want too much straying from the regular formula, not even when it comes to\
      \ the theme. Thus, Evil Pumpkin: The Lost Halloween also falls in the category\
      \ of still images, spooky atmosphere and a few puzzles. BUT BUT BUT this game\
      \ is on Steam, so the developers figured they could be a bit more innovative.\
      \ So what did they do? Well, they made a hidden object game where I struggled\
      \ to find hidden objects. Not because these objects were well hidden but because\
      \ I didn\u2019t have that many opportunities to actually go looking for them.\
      \ Instead, I was stuck going through rooms, looking for a way to progress so\
      \ that I can look for more objects.\n\n[h1] The developers seem really proud\
      \ of their puzzles and clues. So proud that they didn\u2019t even let me enjoy\
      \ this game [/h1]\n\nI mentioned above that I find HOPA games relaxing. While\
      \ they do have some puzzles thrown in, the majority of the game is relaxing\
      \ as you search for specific things in huge piles of junk. OH, but not in here,\
      \ oh no! I had to EARN the right to look through another pile of junk by figuring\
      \ out what the developers were thinking when they made this game. See, instead\
      \ of looking for hidden objects, like in most HOPA games, here, you will spend\
      \ the majority of time figuring out what the clues actually mean and how to\
      \ use this item with something in the environment. So, it sounds more like this\
      \ game wanted to be a point-and-click adventure game instead of a HOPA, huh?\
      \ Well, either way, it fails. The game fails as a HOPA game because it has huge\
      \ walls of puzzles and progression before getting to the next hidden object\
      \ section and it fails as a point-and-click adventure game because the puzzles\
      \ aren\u2019t very well made or explained. For instance, you have a book at\
      \ all times, where the main character journals his experience. You are supposed\
      \ to constantly look through this book and figure out, based on vague clues,\
      \ where to go next. The developers really want you to stop, think and figure\
      \ out where to go and what to do. While this would be admirable for a game like\
      \ Myst, it\u2019s just annoying here.\n\n[h1] Not even my wife liked this game\
      \ [/h1]\n\nAs I was struggling to figure out where to go and what to do in this\
      \ game, my wife came to the room and noticed I was playing a HOPA game. A smile\
      \ appeared on her face as she sat on my lap and happily took the mouse away\
      \ from me as HOPA games are something she also enjoys. We played this game together\
      \ for about 30 minutes before I asked her: \u201CHoney, are you even having\
      \ fun?\u201D, to which she said : \u201CNO\u201D. And that was that. That was\
      \ the end of my time spent with this game. \n\nA little fact, the first games\
      \ I ever played with my wife were, in fact, HOPA games and we have never had\
      \ so much trouble with progressing through one. NOT EVEN AFTER LOOKING THROUGH\
      \ A WALKTHROUGH did we manage to figure out how to progress and, again, we played\
      \ a bunch of HOPA games in the past.\n\n[h1] Why isn\u2019t this game just be\
      \ another HOPA game? [/h1]\n\nThat\u2019s all I (sorry, honey) WE wanted. WE\
      \ wanted to support our country and just buy and play a simple HOPA game and\
      \ Evil Pumpkin didn\u2019t let us. It\u2019s so proud of its own puzzles that\
      \ not even its hint system, easiest difficulty and a walkthrough wasn\u2019\
      t able to help us progress. Yeah, did I mention that this game has difficulties,\
      \ a hint system and even RPG mechanics? The difficulty is probably there just\
      \ so it can make the hint system not work and even with that, it wouldn\u2019\
      t matter because the hint system is absolutely useless. It will just point you\
      \ to the nearest puzzle whether you have the right item or not. And as for RPG\
      \ mechanics. Well, you will have items that will level up after a number of\
      \ uses. They won\u2019t change or perform better\u2026 actually they won\u2019\
      t do anything differently\u2026 but it sounds cool when you say you have RPG\
      \ mechanics, right?\n\n[h1] Just play a different HOPA game [/h1]\n\nOverall,\
      \ this HOPA game isn\u2019t worth it. Just go to BigFishGames and play a different\
      \ one that will actually let you look for hidden objects.\n\nNext game: EXAPUNKS\n\
