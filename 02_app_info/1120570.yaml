    reviews: "\u201CTo be blunt, I went in skeptical. I\u2019ve seen so many writing\
      \ programs that I ignore most of them and build my own from whatever applications\
      \ I have laying around. This one has a great deal to offer, and if you are just\
      \ beginning to build out your world, then this is a great tool. For crazies\
      \ like me who have entire systems already laid out in other formats, it would\
      \ be a daunting process to transfer everything into this program, but there\
      \ is enough convenience here that I will use several of the features in future\

    review: Pretty interface. I like that everything is accessible. Campfire Pro and
      the World Building bundle has everything you need to write your story... except
      for a word processor, which is only available in Campfire Blaze, a web-based
      program released this November. Save your money here and just get Blaze... or
      any other word processor.
