    review: 'I regret the time I wasted playing this. No events, quests, NPCs or anything
      of the like. You literally only do these three things: scan for doors, kill
      rats and open chests. "Progressing" down to the next level just resets everything,
      including every single thing you''ve gotten up to that point. Which leads to
      the question, what the hell''s the point? Game screen is tiny with no options
      whatsoever. Pressing escape exists out of the game completely so if you intuitively
      press it hoping to access some options or exit your inventory, you''ll close
      the game. Inventory is clunky, you can''t just click and drag something to equip
      it, you have to click then drag then click again. Gold seems to have zero use.
      It feels like there was no love put into this game. Creator couldn''t even be
      bothered to remove the item placeholder text on every item''s description. Only
      cool thing about the game were the rocks which can be used as a ranged weapon.
      This just seems like a lazy cash-grab.'
