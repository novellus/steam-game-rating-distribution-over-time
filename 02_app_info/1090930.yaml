    review: "[h1] The Good [/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]A procedurally generated world being\
      \ used for an RPG, to me at least, seems like a natural combination that should\
      \ be much more common place in the world of RPG gaming. This is such an unbelievably\
      \ fun concept that in my opinion at least, adds much more replayablity to a\
      \ genre I really enjoy.\n    [*]Having so much control over the customization\
      \ of my party is another feature I love seeing in an RPG that many RPGs often\
      \ miss the boat when during implementation. I also really greatly approve of\
      \ larger party sizes being more common in RPGs of this nature. To me, six party\
      \ members feels like the bare minimum. I often have less fun in games where\
      \ I am only allowed 4 or 5, even less character slots to fill for my party.\
      \ In Endless RPG, we get [b][i]eight![/i][/b]\n    [*]Exploring each new world\
      \ is incredibly satisfying and it's really fun seeing new enemy dens/forts/towers\
      \ pop up and watching how the NPC towns interact with the new threat.\n    [*]I\
      \ personally am a huge fan of any game that feels like the world in which it\
      \ inhabits could continue on endlessly even if the player character(s) weren't\
      \ a factor. This game makes you feel like an important piece of the world, but\
      \ not a necessary component for its continued existence. Way too many games\
      \ these days are designed around the idea of the player character(s) being the\
      \ \"chosen one\" or what have you, which to me is just an excuse for poor writing\
      \ or limited game design. You won't have that with Endless RPG!\n[/list]\n\n\
      [h1] The Bad [/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]The \"fetch\" type quests are a bit boring\
      \ after the first 5 or so times you do them. I would have liked to see more\
      \ variety here, but at a certain point I found that I didn't really need to\
      \ do too many of them before my party was fit enough to do more fun tasks on\
      \ its own.\n    [*]I would have liked to see a much bigger world, but the ability\
      \ to generate new worlds and easily transfer my party to those worlds is a nice\
      \ substitute.\n[/list]\n\n[h1] The Overview [/h1]\nFor me, it's easiest to judge\
      \ how much joy I will get out of a game like this when I find myself constantly\
      \ saying: \"If I was building a game like this, I would have done it exactly\
      \ like this!\" many times throughout my time with the game. Endless RPG is a\
      \ game that feels like many of its design elements were pulled straight from\
      \ my subconscious and \"put to paper\" so to speak. There is so much here that\
      \ [i]feels[/i] like a game I would design and play myself. Does this mean it's\
      \ a great game that's fitting for every type of gamer? No. However, if you are\
      \ the type of person who really enjoys world building or the concept of world\
      \ building, really enjoys the idea of building your own party from the ground\
      \ up and shaping them into a force to be reckoned with all the while interacting\
      \ with a rather believable world, then I would say this is the kind of game\
      \ for you.\n\nIt honestly has a great deal more replayability than I thought\
      \ it would, which is why I held out on purchasing it for as long as I did. I\
      \ didn't think the \"small\" maps would hold my interest for very long, but\
      \ somewhere around the 10 - 15 hour point it really dawned on me just how much\
      \ there is here to be enjoyed. Especially if you create multiple parties. The\
      \ game is designed in such a way that if your first party gets stuck on your\
      \ first world (on a quest you cannot beat, the enemies have gotten so powerful\
      \ you couldn't keep up, etc.), you can simply create a second world and play\
      \ on there until you feel comfortable going back to your first world. In my\
      \ personal experience, my first party actually became kind of hindered by my\
      \ own design choices, so I made a second party that ultimately became 3x more\
      \ powerful than my first party, and I was able to go back and finish a lot of\
      \ quests on the worlds I had become \"stuck on\" with my first party. There\
      \ is a lot of flexibility in that way for the player, and I appreciate things\
      \ like that."
