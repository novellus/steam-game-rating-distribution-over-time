    review: "Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\n\nOne-Punch Man is a great series\
      \ made better by their in-your-face jabs and stabs at comic and anime tropes.\
      \ One of which being overpowered or god-like characters that are made so artificially\
      \ strong that it sparks never ending debates amongst fans of whose stronger;\
      \ like the ever famous goku v.s. Superman flame wars. \n\nThe creators essentially\
      \ made One-Punch Man kind of an Anti-hero of sorts for their refusal of giving\
      \ him a long, tedious overplayed tragic or illustrious backstory like Marvel\
      \ and Capcom does. Instead his backstory is that he did some push ups and never\
      \ turned on the A/C in his house. Pair that with the fact of that NO MATTER\
      \ how strong, NO MATTER how powerful, yatta yatta yatta, the bad guy going up\
      \ against him...will be killed in 1 hit. Every time. End of story. \n\nGoku\
      \ = 1 punch\nSuperman = 1 punch\nThanos = 1 punch\n\nDefinitely a fresh series\
      \ worth watching!"
