    review: This is really good. Good sound quality and a lot of lesser remixed songs
      on here, although it does have the obvious mm1/2 songs. Dark mans remixes are
      all really good too, but I was a little disappointed when it's described as
      having music from classic, x, and legends, when there's only one legends song.
