It was quite a night in the streets of London, you met up with Mark and Wally that day. That day is where you, Jack finally were going to work on the great but grand funland. Ah, wasn't it exciting. Though, there was a thing that Mark offered you. There is a workshop they've worked on before they got the grand attraction park ready. He offered you to take a nice but cozy stay at there. Why wouldn't you want to stay at a gigantic workshop that is all yours! Quite fancy, ain't it? But if you think deeply about it, you might realize the terrible things that may happen. the terror of not being alone in the workshop. But who can think of that crazy idea? I can't really think of bunch of machines from a funland trying to get some sort of a revenge on you. What a weird idea, haha! But of course, <strong>there is a chance that you may not be alone.<\/strong><br><br>Wally Hardmaker's Funland: Home Trials is a free roam horror game. You explore the workshop as Jack, finding secrets and many dark things that may wait to be unfolded. There are four levels, and four chapters in total in this indie game. Each level has a task and some deadly machines you need to hide from. Each chapter has an intense boss fight and exploration around the underground. <br>On the ''Level''s part of the game, the mechanic mostly is doing tasks and hiding from the robots.<br>On the ''Chapter''s part of the game, the mechanic is mostly cinematic, free roam and fighting enemies. You also get to talk with real NPC's in the chapters aswell.<br><br><br><br><br><br><strong>Credits<\/strong><br><br>Wally Hardmaker: Head developer, creator of project, 3D Character modeling, 3D character rigging, 3D Envorinment modeling, Character designer, storyboard designer.<br><br>Newgame+ LD: Head programmer, ideas, envorinment modeling.<br><br> Game Design, Special Support, Story Design<br><br><br><br><br><br><strong>Music Team<\/strong><br><br>Synoxis: Musician<br><br>Georgina Rhodes: Composer<br><br><br><br><br><br><strong>Voice Actor<\/strong><br><br>Seth Raffield: Voice Actor<br><br>Joel Collins: Voice Actor<br><br>Steven van Renselaar: Voice Actor<br><br>Logan Krekelberg: Voice Actor<br><br>Sebastian Brown: Voice Actor<br><br>Devin J.
