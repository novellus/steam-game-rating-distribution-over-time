Sometimes still crashes at launch, but 2-4 tries and it will be stable each time.\n\n+++ Ooo-oo! Custom portraits! I love these.  Gotta scan in and color some drawings.\n\nWell....custom characters are not intuitive:  \n1) Go to Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Stranger of Sword City\\PICTUREGATE\\   \n2) Choose a folder per character   \n3) Each folder need 4 files labeled as userImgA,B,C,and D.  thats an i not L.   \n4) userImgA [746 x 720 pixels. This is your main character image!]    \n    userImgB [350 x 380 pixels. This is the portrait that displays in your party.]    \n    userImgC [160 x 240 pixels. This is your character creation/selection portrait.]     \n    userImgD [146 x 32 pixels. This is the mini icon that displays during combat.]     \n5) Look in the USERDATA folder for examples of framing.     \n6) Save as either.jpg, .bmp, or .png  Png and Bmp are recommended for the transparency layer.     \n7) yes, userImgA is wider than it is tall.     \n8) IMPORTANT, images must be imported in the options menu.  The game doesnt tell you this unless you f*** around for 3 hours with the Userdata folder enough that an error appears.       \n9) Where in the Options??? There are tiny TAB buttons in the  corners of the screen.  Miss them?  I sure did.  hence the 3 hours of trying to figure this out.  \n\nCool! Now I have my character for this fantasy game!  I have imported my DnD elf cleric!\n\n---The main character must be human.   S***.  Continue anyways and deal with dialogue as it comes.  \n\n---Ooooooh.  The schoolgirl on the cover isn't japanese fanservice.....there are too many not so subtle hints that you, the PC, are a human who fell through a portal from earth and all earthlings are stronger here, hence the schoolgirl using a bastard sword.  Well......there goes my fantasy game immersion.  \n\n---Combat! I read that it's no cakewalk, even for beginner, but seriously, all the mobs are 10 levels higher and one shot me.  Ok, I'll just defend and heal while the schoolgirl swings for 10 turns.  I still die.  what fun.  Hope it doesnt count against my hearts for permadeath or this will be REAL short.  She revives me, no consequence, she tells me to be more confident and attack more.\n\nNext fight. dead turn 1.  Schoolgirl diablo-click till win.  fun.\nNext fight. Dead turn 1. Schoolgirl diablo-clicks twice as long for a win.\n(Yes, I used her Taunt skill.  They all still attacked me.)\n\nSave point.  Motivation is fully gone now.\n\nIt may sound petty, but the first impressions are: \n1) No, you are either a boy or girl human.  Athlete or a gamer.\n2) Look how much you suck at everything!  Be careful of one hit permadeath! (Good for DarkSouls, bad for RNG evasion)\n3) We broke our own rule of permadeath to show you how much cooler our characters are compared to yours.  \n\nI am building a sandcastle, it must look traditional, A bully can randomly kick it over, I can do nothing; the bully's sister will beat up the bully.  Nothing matters because she is still grouped with he bully and my sandcastle is still smashed.\n\n==========\nOriginal\n-----------------\n\nIve never gotten it to launch on\n\nIntel 2.4G xeon server 8core\nwindows 7\n32Gb Ram\nNvidia 970\n\nRyzen 5 3700\n16GB Ram\nnvidia 1660ti\nWindows 10\n\nMicrosoft Surface 3 Pro\nWindows 10\n\neven tried the \"install on C: fix\"","timestamp_created":1609917848,"timestamp_updated":1609980756,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgpiV7fYCeqH3wAI="}
