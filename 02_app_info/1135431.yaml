    review: 'I only bought the pack for the 6 Series (Hornet) and WOW what a machine.
      It handles amazing, its the single best car for C class. I haven''t tried A
      class because of the only problem with this car, the gearing. Its a 4 speed
      which means its very long and vague in this game. A snappier 5 speed would make
      this THE car. Paint schemes aren''t exactly what you want if you enjoy motorsport
      correct paint schemes but you can make it work.


      Other than that i could give less of a shit about the Hot Rod or Lawnmower V2.
      Solid 2/10 for value for me but i can see others getting a kick out of it. The
      Beamer made me buy it.'
