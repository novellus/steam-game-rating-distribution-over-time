If they had gone to the trouble of actually having a progressing story i think this game could have had potential(and this is the EXTENDED CUT...wtf was the normal cut like).","timestamp_created":1388297405,"timestamp_updated":1607491131,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ454L8ovYCc+z/Hw=="}
