    about_the_game: Flip-Out! is a challenging pinball game with a twist, the flippers
      can move!  This combination of pinball and the Breakout-style gameplay of horizontal
      movement and brick breaking brings you a brand new way to play pinball with
      new challenges and strategies.  Our first table, The Curse of Crab Cay, puts
      you in what should be a serene undersea grotto, but marauding pirates and ghostly
      skeleton crews overhead have disturbed the calm of the cay and it's your job
      to assume the role of a local crab to restore peace and quiet.  Hit your targets
      and you'll get to face an even bigger threat!
