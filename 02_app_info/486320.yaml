    review: "The manual quick targeting and pace of the game seems an interesting\
      \ concept for tower defense. The first missions have a nice pace to it, tho\
      \ later missions seem to pile on the enemies so fast that it\u2019s isn\u2019\
      t too obvious what you should be doing, as you find yourself overloaded on trying\
      \ to think of a good strategy to defend your planet.\n\nThere is no story behind\
      \ what you are doing, so it lacks any sense of urgency for your mission. Maybe\
      \ that will come later as it is early access.\n\nThe enemies are well differentiated\
      \ and colorful for the player to easily recognize, tho they also lack some character.\n\
      \nThis is clearly a in progress project. I dont know if the manual targeing\
      \ mechanic is a strong enough unique feature to stand on it own, but maybe that\
      \ will change as the game is developed more. \n\nIf you like fast paced towe\
      \ defence than give it a shot."
