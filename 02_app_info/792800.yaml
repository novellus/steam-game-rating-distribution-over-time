    review: 'Challenging platformer game with different levels that requires some
      puzzle solving to avoid defeat, it makes you think carefully whats gonna be
      your next step till you figure out the solution with "trial & error" method
      coz there are traps in different areas that insta kill you, plus a time limit
      to beat the level.


      It feels much better with controller, i use the wired xbox 360 controller and
      it made the game more confortable than playing with keyboard & mouse, still
      controller its not required but imo you gonna need more practice with k&m.


      Its not too long but for the price i think its pretty fair the fun you get from
      this game, it has only 3 achievements, very few but adds some extra value since
      many other indie titles and even some old games made by renown companies doesnt
      include not even one achievement.


      Finally dont pay attention to those other reviews imo they didnt make a proper
      review, just look at what they wrote its totally unfair with so little gameplay
      time invested and clearly more than one is trolling i mean, if you gonna give
      a bad review at least take your time and explain it better than just saying
      "the price is a scam, its a .99 with nothing special" trashy reviews...'
