I went through them all very easily and with pleasure.\nThe game itself is not difficult, but for fans of this genre it is very suitable.\nLet me remind you that this is the second game from this developer and he is very generous, he made an excellent sale of his games with big discounts.","timestamp_created":1600035263,"timestamp_updated":1600035263,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581749081611633301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oZLixPQCdd3ToQI="}
