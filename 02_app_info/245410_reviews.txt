So how is it that 30 years later it is still available on Steam platform?  Because it is a classic, and a good one at that.  Looking from now, graphics are not great, the interface is somewhat relatively \"basic\", sound effects are more than dated, but there is depth underneath, and an interesting story that asks you to believe, or not, certain elements of the fragmented information you will receive while exploring the dungeon.  And believing or not these elements have a direct impact on the end story and how you will interact with some key NPCs you will meet in the dungeon.  \n\nIt was actually quite unbelievable for me to be able to find this oldie on Steam...  And because I actually had not been able to finish the game in the 1990s, well, I had to try it again.  The story was as intriguing as I remembered (as you only receive bits of information from time to time) , you have puzzles to solve, and of course combat to be subjected to (lots of combat, and it can be grindy at times).  Don't miss the clues or you may end up having the impression of being in a dead end (which means think and search for the clues!) until you discover how to get to the other areas of the dungeon.  \n\nIf you don't mind the age of this game, the dated graphics and sounds, and you also don't mind some detective work and quite a handful of combat with an intriguing story, you'll like the game value that this oldie brings you.  You can expect some 300 hours of gameplay if you take the time to thoroughly explore this dungeon and its story.  For the price, specially when it is for sale, it is a bargain!  And if you liked it well enough, the story continues in two other subsequent games (Wizardry 7 and 8).","timestamp_created":1609273440,"timestamp_updated":1609273440,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8P6K2PYCc5HHvgI="}
