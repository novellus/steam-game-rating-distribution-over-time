The performance is much better now, but unfortunately it has the same issues like many other of these cheap horror games : i don't know where to find the first key in these darkness. The batteries of my flashlight are empty, all drawers are locked, the first door, too. I stumbled around without any light source, find another door, locked of course...minutes later i came to a wide gate to access an bigger area in the game and what happened?. Right, nothing ! I need an item to break it open. What a surprise. Some time later i figured out how to open drawers, you have to hold \"e\", press left mouse button and pull with your mouse. Furthermore the game has bad checkpoints. If you die a little later, you'll have to play the entire first part again. Very nice ! A pity, is it too much effort to make these games more beginner-friendly so that you don't lose the joy playing the game in the first 10 minutes? \n","timestamp_created":1581172595,"timestamp_updated":1608555643,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1581234899,"developer_response":"Hello\n\nWe trying to make a cheap game for horror lovers.
