Always enjoyed the art style like this. There isn't really any feel of progression happening. Its more, you just have to hope you get the right items to mesh well with your gun and play style.\n\nYes I do recommend this game but only if its on sale. Don't think I would of paid full price for it.\n\nNeat none the less and worth a sale price to have a but of fun with it :)","timestamp_created":1609647873,"timestamp_updated":1609647873,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vquf4/YCeLv6vwI="}
