    review: "I once played this game so much that pigeons wouldn't fly near me anymore,\
      \ and the city I lived in quickly turned into chaos. \n\nThe leftover food on\
      \ the streets quickly piled up, with no pigeons to eat it; The mouse and cockroach\
      \ moved into full force. \n\nThe city council contacted me and warned me that\
      \ I had to take a break from this game to gain favor with the pigeons. \n\n\
      Since that day I've kept to only playing Pigeons Attack for only 4 hours per\
      \ day, a reduction from the 24 hours a day previously played.\n\nYou have been\
      \ warned, don't start another pigeon famine"
