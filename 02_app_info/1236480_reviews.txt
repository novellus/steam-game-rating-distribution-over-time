While it is mentioned a few times, the main focus is a lesbian couple. There are very few sex scenes, but buying the VN for this is definitely not worth it.\n\n\nSo, this game is about two girls being in a volleyball team, training for some big tournament. The both always had good sync and compatibility, but this suddenly stopped. That's because the two girls were in a relationship for about two years and just recently broke up. \nYou, as the ex-volleyball-pro, are hired by the coach to solve the problems they are facing, while she is unaware of the personal struggles the girls are going through. \nRemember I mentioned sex scenes? Yeah, so this game is about getting them back together. So how do you unlock the ecchi stuff? Right, you completely ignore their broken relationship and instead hook up with one of them. Great!\n\nThe UI is and looks horrible. \nOnce you're on the bad-looking title screen you'll know what I mean. There are localisation issues and unintuitive interface design. \n\nThe soundtrack is ok, while the one background you see 70% of the game looks so bad. \nLike, imagine an talented artist drawing a painting. Almost before he finished, he suddenly retires. Now, you force your unpaid intern to draw the last corner of the image in paint. After 5 minutes you decide that he could instead sort some documents and tell him to just copy and paste the one bottle he drew a few ten times and you're ready to go.\n\nDespite the mediocre-at-best background, the sprites actually look pretty great... they don't fit the rest of the game at all though. Cute, clean drawings are mixed with blurred real images. There is no consistency at all. Settings can't be accessed in the settings menu, real pictures are mixed with cute anime sprites, which are again mixed with another authors work... the trailer is a pretty great example of this. \n\nHighlighting the speaking character is a great Idea. I like it. \n\nMuch to my surprise, the game actually implemented the I-Am-Very-Discriminated-Against-Parts pretty good. It doesn't feel as forced as expected. \n\nHowever, the language... Urghhh. It's.. not just not my cup of tea, I guess?\n\nIt feels pretty amateurish and awkward. And the talking about sex... I'm not against being open about it, but is this how 40-year-old women talk? I don't know. I just wish this had never happened. \n\n\nSo, should you buy this game? No, definitely not. \nWhile the LGTBQ stuff is actually quite good implemented, buying a game that has nothing else to show off except for bad UI and miserable backgrounds is just not worth it, even if you're into that stuff. \nNext time I would recommend the devs to focus more on the actual game. This could have been a good game if they had tried, but they didn't. And I'm not giving them credit if they think that a message is enough to make a game good.","timestamp_created":1585944232,"timestamp_updated":1607953849,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.46946108341217041","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qpPhsPYCerfk/QE="}
