      \ you can build up your base and build up your massive army. Ranging from Ground\
      \ units and Air Units. We also take you on a story base RTS where a faction\
      \ has a meaning to the map or why its in-game. We are a balance focus on PvP,\
      \ PvE and Story/Campaign. We don't want focus on the PvP Competitive or ESports\
      \ side of things. Since we feel like RTS games are ment for Story and Campaign.\
      \ We also understand that alot of players don't even want to PvP so they expect\
      \ great PvE so we hope to have the right Balance between all those 3 core gameplays.\
      \ We want make a RTS thats plays from the Classics but has the Graphics of New\
      \ Gens for the players that haven't experienced the great RTS games we had in\
      \ the pass. We hope you guys like this project as much as we do! &lt;3<br />\r\
