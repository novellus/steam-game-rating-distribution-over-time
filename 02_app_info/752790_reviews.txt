I've checked the task manager but everything seems to be normal. I've also tried multiple compatibility modes but none worked.\n\nI am going to request a refund from steam, but I'd be happy to buy the game again once the issues have been resolved.","timestamp_created":1563449316,"timestamp_updated":1563449316,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539951622486114502","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwquq1guwCcuvNzgE="}
