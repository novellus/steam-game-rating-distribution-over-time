With support from 2 childhood friends, he tries to turn his dreams into reality.\n\nThe game is fairly short; I finished in less than two hours (but I'm a fast reader).  It has very nice artwork and excellent voice acting.  The writing is fluffy and lighthearted.  The game lacks adult content; I don't know if it was excluded from the US release on steam.  The story is focused on slice-of-life with a twist at the end.\n\nAs a fan of visual novels, I enjoyed this game.  But players who prefer a longer VN with more content might rather skip it due to Wanko of Marriage's short length.","timestamp_created":1608243719,"timestamp_updated":1608243719,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528571426868438721","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tfWyufYCeYOGuwI="}
