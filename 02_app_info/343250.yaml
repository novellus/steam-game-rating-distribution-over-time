    review: 'This is one of those times where I wish there was more than a simple
      yes or no answer for whether or not I recommend this game to others. Given the
      low asking price, I suppose I''ll have to give it a thumbs-up. For collectors
      and completionists, or people looking for a mindless game to play while listening
      to podcasts, Gene will be an interesting enough distraction for the four or
      so hours it takes to beat - or even less if you aren''t trying to fully complete
      every level.


      Gene is, from start to finish, an incredibly simple side-scrolling platformer.
      You play the titular Gene, a little blue alien with big eyes facing a bit of
      bad luck. After your space ship starts smoking for entirely unknown reasons,
      it crashes hard enough to break apart into twenty different pieces. Those parts,
      as well as a bunch of gems that one of the game''s generic enemies steals for
      equally mysterious reasons, are spread across fifteen levels.


      The main gimmick of Gene is mutation. You start off as a blue version of the
      character, whose abilities include being able to travel through teleportation
      spheres and moving faster when there are boost arrows in the background. From
      there, you''ll find five other colors of Gene to become, each with their own
      uses, who you''ll be constantly changing between throughout each level. These
      range from the somewhat believable grey Gene that can jump much higher to the
      red Gene that can.. place and detonate bundles of dynamite by remote. Three
      of the mutations center around placing explosive devices, and two of those are
      primarily ways to access parts of the levels that are otherwise blocked off.
      At times it can feel a bit too obvious that some of the choices were made simply
      as a way to pad out the play time.


      The enemies in the game come in a few different flavors but they''re really
      just a different paint job on the same exact obstacle. They move back and forth
      on whichever platform they''re standing on, and cause damage on contact. The
      game does give you a mutation right from the start that lets you place land
      mines in their path, and a single one is enough to kill anything outside of
      the single boss encounter toward the end. It was nice to see all six of Gene''s
      collected mutations being used as part of that final fight, though some of the
      ways you''re forced to attack go against the ways you''ve learned to keep yourself
      safe until then.


      The platforming controls are nice and tight, and I''m glad the developer didn''t
      include some arbitrary "your double-jump doesn''t work if you haven''t used
      it before half of your jump distance is completed" mechanic. Sadly, there were
      more than a few times where I ended up clipping through a thin platform or even
      getting entirely stuck inside of a wall through normal gameplay. Then there
      were the times when the red Gene just stopped planting bundles of dynamite when
      I hit the E key during a level. Level introductions can be skipped, but if you
      do so before the part that includes an animation of the exit device appearing,
      then the exit simply won''t be there when you finally get to that part of the
      stage. Issues like those brought me very close to giving up on the game on a
      few occasions.


      Gene is an interesting enough game to play, so long as you''ve got the patience
      to deal with its shortcomings, and preferably have something interesting to
      listen to in the background. Given the price I pay for coffee each morning,
      I can''t really fault having paid one dollar to get just under four hours worth
      of mindless platforming.'
