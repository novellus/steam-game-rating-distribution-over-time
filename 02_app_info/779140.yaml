    about_the_game: "Slumbering deep within the nether, lies the mysterious creature\
      \ known as the Void King. His dreams are the essence that connects our world\
      \ to reality. All planes exist within his mind, cogs in a machine none can comprehend.\
      \ Often, his dreams are pleasant, bringing light to everything he touches. But\
      \ when his dreams are dark, the nightmares that plague his mind run wild through\
      \ forgotten realms. Step into his dream and explore that which is the Void King's\
      \ nightmare.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOutrealm is a top-down roguelike hack and slash\
      \ title. It combines traditional hack and slash gameplay with modern-day roguelike\
      \ mechanics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach realm has a required kill count to activate\
      \ the portal there, increasing in each successive level. However as time passes,\
      \ monsters grow in strength and resilience. To survive, you'll have to constantly\
      \ rack up kill count and loot to become stronger.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTraverse\
      \ varied worlds, from rain-drenched highlands to mushroom-filled catacombs.\
      \ Each realm comes with it's own unique enemies and mechanics.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nThere are seven playable characters with their own playstyle and specialist\
      \ moves which set them apart from the rest. The first character unlocked is\
      \ the Blade Master, an all-rounder designed for old-school Zelda players to\
      \ pick up and play. However, characters such as the Boreal Hunter and Smasher\
      \ are designed for advanced players.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are eighty different\
      \ items to loot within the game. Items come in chests spread throughout the\
      \ realms, sometimes in plain sight, sometimes hidden. Items have many different\
      \ effects, from increasing your raw damage, to providing defense boons, giving\
      \ crowd control effects or triggering an attack.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs you play,\
      \ you'll collect achievements which in turn unlock new items and characters.\
      \ There are also Item and Monster logs which fill in as you loot more and defeat\
      \ monsters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith seven different playable characters, six\
      \ vibrant worlds, eighty items to loot and over twenty achievements, Outrealm\
      \ has plenty for the roguelike enthusiast to sink their teeth into."

    review: A really fun take on roguelike games. Getting powerups/items is really
      satisfying, and there's no shortage of those. The fighting can get a bit hectic
      (especially when you get swarmed) but it feels like every hit can be avoided
      if I really improve at the game.
