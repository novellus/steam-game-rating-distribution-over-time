      /><br>Pyramid Plunge is a lighthearted action platformer with procedurally generated
      levels that offer a challenging experience every time you play. Take control
      of an odd cartoony couple and protect your partner from peril. Have complete
      freedom while you explore the fully-destructible pyramids of ancient civilizations
      filled with deadly creatures, booby traps and immense treasure. Be fast or slow,
      greedy or cautious, safe or reckless... it's all about fine balance between
      risk and reward!<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Roguelike
      Platforming</strong> - Randomly-generated, fully-destructible levels are filled
      with traps, monsters and lots of loot. You'll also find equipment from previous
      lost explorers. Quick reflexes and quick thinking on how to use the environment
      to your advantage will go a long way!<br></li><li><strong>Hilarious Local PvP</strong>
      - Enjoy comical battles with your family and friends, where the player who enters
      the exit with the most money wins!<br></li><li><strong>Help each other in Local
      Coop</strong> - Select your character to control and hone your communication
      skills to reach the exit in one piece (or is it two? :) ).<br></li><li><strong>Choose
      your character</strong> - You choose who will be the hero... Giorgio or Felicie?<br></li><li><strong>Beat
      your friends online</strong> - Play multiplayer with your Steam friends as if
      they were beside you. They don't even need to have the game installed!<br></li><li><strong>Pyramid
      of the Day</strong> - Each day a new set of levels is generated. Get to learn
      the best path and brag your highest score on the online leaderboard which resets
      every 24hrs.<br></li><li><strong>Lovable characters</strong> - The odd couple,
      Giorgio and Felicie are two complete opposites. She likes reading and visiting
      museums and old temples. He likes beer and farting! Will they put their differences
      aside and find their way out?<br></li><li><strong>Learning by <span class="bb_strike">Doing</span>
      Dying</strong> - With each excruciating, hilarious, and surprising death, you'll
      learn how to think faster to escape the traps and creatures lurking in the pyramids.</li></ul><img
