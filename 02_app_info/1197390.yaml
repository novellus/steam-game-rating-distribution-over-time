      of little things to look at if you''re feeling like doing so... you can talk
      to plants! But you don''t have to. You can plow through the story if you want
      - speeeeeeed ruuuuun. Also, the music is good, the sound effects are nice, and
      it''s quite pleasing to look at!<br><br>If you like visual novels and games
      that are mostly about story, you may like this game as well. <br><br>Nims are
      the most popular brand of humanoid robot in the galaxy. You start in a factory
      where you are activated and told your assignment - flight attendant! After that
      it''s off to the ship where you meet the captain and learn that there are no
      other passengers. Over the course of 5 days, you and the captain talk about
      normal stuff. He doesn''t like his job very much, and he has trouble opening
      up... sound familiar!?'

    review: 'A neat little visual novel, very few characters, but they are very endearing
      and it''s interesting trying to see the world through Nim''s eyes. Despite it
      being so short, you still get a window into the life of the Captain of the ship,
      and you still feel a connection to his struggle of trying to figure out if this
      is what he really wants to do in life.

      Lots of good humour in there too, it''s well worth you time'
