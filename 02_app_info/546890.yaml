    review: "Hello,\nSome frustrations with the game. I have been playing for about\
      \ three months and I am mixed about the game. It appears at times some are \"\
      cheating\" but now the more I ask questions during the time waiting for a battle\
      \ to start in the chat box I am learning a small bit at a time. There is little\
      \ to explain how player seem to make impossible shots time after time; I do\
      \ not understand how they are doing this. Forexample, using a 1 minute smoke\
      \ seems to make little difference. I am some how still in view of the \"enemy\"\
      \ team and sunk. I am unable to see past the smoke but they seem to be unaffected.\
      \ \nSo, I have frustrations but all and all it appears that a lot of attention\
      \ and effort was put into the game which causes me to give a positive review.\n\
      thank you,"
