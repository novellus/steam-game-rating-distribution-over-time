    review: 'This soundtrack is incredible. All of the music played in-game just suits
      the overall theme and is killer when it starts playing and getting you in the
      groove of things, especially combat.


      I bought it while it was on sale along with the game itself, but I''d easily
      pay $5 for how amazing it sounds. As for the only (at the time) other review
      here, it''s true that it''s more hybrid. There are electric synths and instruments
      but also physically played instruments by a real musician which in my opinion
      is a great combination. There simply are just sounds a computer can make that
      a human with an instrument cannot and the other way around.'
