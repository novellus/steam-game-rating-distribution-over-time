    review: "Wow.  Just wow. \nI've seen lots of games filled to the brim with far-left\
      \ propaganda, but this one surely takes the cake.  \n\nWe're talking about the\
      \ farm collectivization in communist Russia;  the violent submission of land\
      \ owners to Stalin's \"master plan\", and the subsequent famine of 1932-1933.\
      \   \nYes, we're talking about more than 10 million dead people - especially\
      \ in Ukraine;  this was without a single doubt an absolute genocide, masterfully\
      \ executed by Stalin, the bolshevik dictator whose atrocities can only be equaled\
      \ by Hitler himself.  \n\nFarmers who dared to oppose the bolshevik regime were\
      \ either exterminated or sent to gulags;  their possessions forcefully, violently\
      \ confiscated, their Christian icons burned, priests arrested and their churches\
      \ closed by the godless communists.  Their farmer class (kulaks) completely\
      \ eradicated.   \nEven the children were encouraged to \"rat\" on their parents\
      \ (if they dared to hide any grain to avoid confiscation by the communist state\
      \ agents).\n\nSuch was the extend of this famine, that even cannibalism was\
      \ not uncommon.\nThat's the true legacy of Stalin and his communism:  millions\
      \ upon millions of dead - because human life in a bolshevik regime has zero\
      \ value;   it means absolutely nothing;  the complete submission to the party\
      \ is all that matters.  The only alternative is death - through starvation,\
      \ or worse.  \nDid you think the Katyn massacre was horrible?   Think again;\
      \ that was nothing, compared to this;   and it was just one of the famines that\
      \ would befall communist Russia.  \n\nAnd yet in this \"game\"-piece of shameful\
      \ communist propaganda, the main character tries to.... \"peacefully reason\"\
      \ with the farmers, \"get in their head\", in order to... \"peacefully convince\"\
      \ them to give up their property and become a part of a \"collective\".  \n\
      Indeed, it will all be done \"peacefully\"...  \nBecause, otherwise....  there\
      \ will be \"peaceful\" starvation....   \"peaceful\" imprisonment in gulags....\
      \  and \"peaceful\" executions.  \n\nAs a closing comment, I'd like to urge\
      \ anyone who feels too lazy to read about the Dekulakization, the Holodomor,\
      \ the Collectivization, etc., to, AT THE VERY LEAST, watch the 2019 movie \"\
      Mr. Jones\".  (and while at it, maybe even learn what inspired George Orwell\
      \ to write the \"Animal Farm\" and Big Brother's absolutist-totalitarian-regime-exerting-control-through-massive-propaganda,\
      \ that was depicted in his seminal book, \"1984\")."
