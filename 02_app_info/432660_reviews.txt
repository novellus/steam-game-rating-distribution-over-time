This makes it very hard and time consuming to find things. \n\tGeneral lack of mouse control in the UI:  You basically right clicking to open something then using the scroll wheel to find what you’re after and clicking either right of left click to get it. No reason here why a pointer couldn’t have been used other than being lazy. \n\tUI is lacking key information:  such as Food, Water, Oxygen, and poison levels displayed instead they post these thing down in a chat box. If not a fan of this could have been easily and clearly posted in the top of the screen.\n\tUI is hard to see due to its color matching most of the textures: I didn’t look to see if there was any way to change this or not but the UI is insanely hard to see at times. The text is very small and the color of the text placed on the back ground environment makes it very, very hard to read at time. \n\tVery redundant game play: Ever room looks the same and you basically get the same items from each room, with little to no verity at all. \n\tThe rate at which you loss Hunger and thirst is insane. I don’t know what it is with survival games thinking you should starve in 15 mins and die of thirst in 10. Only game I have played that has even come close to getting it right is “The Long Dark” and even then I used chat engine to go in and change some of the values.\n\tFOV no field of view slider = fail.\n\tI really wanted to like this game the idea behind it really intrigued me. I love a good problem solving game. I have played through Myst and its sequels back in the day as well as currently in Obduction(Cyans newest Myst like game) I have played many critical thinking games over the years but I just couldn’t get past the UI and the Inventory and everything looking the same in this game. \n","timestamp_created":1486924276,"timestamp_updated":1486924276,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.459610015153884888","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkvzlmdoCfdb9cQ=="}
