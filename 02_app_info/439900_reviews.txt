One of the things that drives me to love these games is their gameplay, which for many people do not like.","timestamp_created":1491904304,"timestamp_updated":1579608917,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wOiB5O8CfbjFdg=="}
