If they accidentally push down on the trackpad or touch the thumbstick they can be miles away from the play field and not know how get back while the timer is ticking. A simple recenter button would be much better.\n• Would like to have a setting to enable resizing of objects. Maybe as a separate game mode.\n\nI’ll give this a thumbs up since it can be fun to play with friends and the price is reasonable, but I really hope custom wordlists will be added and teleporting issues will be addressed.","timestamp_created":1568214362,"timestamp_updated":1569501389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481348633766174316","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jNTktu0Cc9CG0gE="}
