    about_the_game: Translunar Enterprises gives gamers the tools they need to compete
      in randomly generated sandbox universes. In these universes are multiple worlds
      to either colonize or exploit for their resources. Players can either fight
      for more resources through war or complex trade agreements. With a unique design
      system that enables players to design new reactions from elements and components,
      They can share or keep the research they discover throughout the game.<br> <br>As
      a player, you will have to manage the economics, production chains, colonies,
      wars, and research of your corporation. Dive into the translunar universe where
      you will play as a corporation, either alone or with friends. Each session will
      never be the same as each universe is generated randomly, which will force you
      and your opponents to think differently on each playthrough. You can take up
      arms if you can't find a peaceful resolution, or fuel the fire between other
      players and sell your high-tech weaponry to the highest bidder.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul

      You won't have to manage menus to upgrade and build your megacity or industrial

      and combat will never be a menu or numbers game. Use your battle strategies
      and tactics to your advantage and prepare to defend yourself against enemy players

      incoming attacks with close-ranged defense systems that will eliminate most

      and specify who can produce your items and the cost of the royalty fees they
      must pay. With over 20 different items to design and more on the way, each player
      is challenged to find the best combination while keeping their resources stocked
      by trade or mining. Successful execution of these skills will reveal the pros
      and the rookies.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1099780/extras/player_design.gif?t=1605116324"
