I love the concept and I enjoy both pinball and RPG games. Unfortunately this game falls short of expectations. The RPG elements are minimal and the pinball feels sluggish and non-responsive. There is very little to do in each area, basically every game ends up with one enemy that is difficult to hit and absolutely nothing else in the level that you can hit.","timestamp_created":1609471525,"timestamp_updated":1609472063,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44daA3vYCf8WkvwI="}
