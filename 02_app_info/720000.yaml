      \ will not be easy - you can just call the place the appearance of each zombie,\
      \ and then they all do. Zombies are mindless, they just run on the smell of\
      \ the nearest person. If they catch him - kill and run to the next.<br />\r\n\
      With people things are not so simple. Someone running away from the zombies,\
      \ someone immediately escapes from the city (if someone succeeds, you lose the\
      \ game) and someone shoots them.<br />\r\nIn addition, the gameplay variety\
      \ of boosters, with the help of which you can break someone's arms, to turn\
      \ him into a zombie, blow up, or crush a group of people.<br />\r\nThe game\
      \ also features a level editor with which you can create your own challenging\
      \ strategic puzzle game and give play it your friends, or just to make a bunch\
      \ of people and blow them up :)"

    review: That got boring really fast. Don't waste your money on this. $1 is way
