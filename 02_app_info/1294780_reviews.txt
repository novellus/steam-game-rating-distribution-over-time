You have to memorize the safe path then draw it when it is hidden. You can use pins and checkpoints to help you but you lose points for using them, so be careful if you aim the high scores. I like that they use scenarios from different people in History, even some unusual like the Mali!","timestamp_created":1602718118,"timestamp_updated":1602718118,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.642857134342193604","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwh7bclPUCfoH1pwI="}
