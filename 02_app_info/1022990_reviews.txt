I have played a LOT of horror games in VR (and not in VR) and this one has scared me and made me uneasy more than any other game I think I have ever played.  It is far from just a bunch of jump scares.  The game plays a little bit like an old school horror game (think silent hill or resident evil).  The biggest difference that this game has from those older games is how much depth this game has in terms of playstyle.\n\nOne second you're sneaking behind a monster and the next you're turning around and running for your life because you don't have enough health to get into a fight.  The only reason you don't have enough health is cause of the last fight.  \n\nseriously I can't stress enough how incredible this game is, I don't know why it isn't more popular.  don't let the price scare you away either because I'm 5 hours in and still only on the first chapter.  \n\nThe devs are also very responsive in their discord channel.  You can tell they put a lot of time and effort into this game and continue to.  I am looking forward to seeing the rest of the chapters for this game as they come out and I already know I wont be disapointed with them. \n\nBe warned, this one is NOT for the faint of heart.","timestamp_created":1609831577,"timestamp_updated":1609831577,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ42o7c6PYCe7bQwAI="}
