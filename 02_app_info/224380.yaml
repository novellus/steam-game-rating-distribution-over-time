    review: "It's a fake toy! \nAs soon as you plug in a DJ controller, they want\
      \ 100's of $ to unbrake the controller working. (Yep! lots of extra code and\
      \ work for them to force brake and ransom it working!)\n\nThere is much better,\
      \ less buggy, 100% free software that dose a much better job than this in every\
      \ way.\n\nOther huge niggles with it. It pesters you to be online, logging into\
      \ there own account (not steam). \nIt pesters you with popup windows. Like a\
      \ free phone game!\nIt's locked to pixels, so go's wonky at diff screen res,\
      \ never quite fits correctly (They don't even window scale prop so it's always\
      \ a few pixels out etc etc)"
