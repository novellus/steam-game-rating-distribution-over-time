      \ as you dig more you\u2019ll discover a variety of challenges and goals. Will\
      \ you spend your coins on a helpful item at the shop in 1-3 or horde them in\
      \ an attempt for a high score. Maybe you\u2019ll try to unlock new Warp Bones\
      \ or try and beat all 4 worlds without dying.<br><br>Or maybe just chill out\
      \ in Free Dig mode with some cathartic digging. I love destructive environments.\
      \ You can pretty much dig up a whole level if you want. (Although that can be\
      \ quite dangerous.)<br><br>As you dig more, you may start to find some of the\
      \ game\u2019s hidden depths. For instance, if you fast stomp on an enemy you\u2019\
      ll create sparks that ripple to the left and right. These sparks are both useful\
      \ and dangerous. It depends on when and how you use them.<br><br>On a personal\
      \ note, Dig Dog was the first game I've programmed and drawn without using my\
      \ hands. It was a challenge to make the game this way and I'm quite relieved\
      \ that it's now complete.<br><br>I hope you enjoy Dig Dog. I think there\u2019\
      s a lot to uncover here!<br><br>-Rusty"
