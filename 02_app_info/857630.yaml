    legal_notice: Although the Sphaeres VR Experiences are intended to be calming
      and relaxing, some people may experience discomfort due to the nature of immersive
      Virtual Reality and 360 degree videos. Should you experience any discomfort
      we recommend taking off your VR headset immediately and to sit or lie down until
      your discomfort has passed. We take no responsibility for any injuries, accidents
      or discomforts caused during or after watching our 360 degree VR video experiences.
      You watch 360 VR video experiences entirely at your own risk and we recommend
      that you closely familiarise yourself with the risk of using VR headsets before
      use and that you closely read and follow the manufacturer's guidelines of your
      particular VR headset.

    developer_response: Thanks for the interesting insight KrigarNooben. Just for
      some context, we have received many requests for single-scene VR Experiences
      and this video is serving those customers who just want to sit in one spot for
      a long period of time. We understand that it is not for everyone so we would
      like to thank you for providing your point of view so others understand the
      nature of the this video before watching it. Thanks for your support :)

    review: "Shame to say it but this is the one in the series (complete set as of\
      \ I type this) I have disliked the most.\nBeautiful scen (1 same scene ) but\
      \ this could easily been seen as a normal video.\n1 out of 5\n\nWorth getting?\
      \ Nope \n\n(not even in the set worth it, drags down the otherwise high quality\
      \ set)\n\nWatchable on normal screen without VR set."
