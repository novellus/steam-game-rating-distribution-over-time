People that had the game in their steam library before the special update received a special offer that they can claim when they boot the game up that gives diamonds and in-game cash.\n\nThis obviously a port of a mobile game to pc, in which the in game purchases have been removed. And to be honest I was looking for a game like this on pc to play, without the extra purchases. I had played a few of them on mobile, but never paid extra so of course you can only go so far on those with the extra pay. \n\nI was having real fun playing this, completed the first two restaurant all with three stars and fully upgrade. Get to the third business, a cake and slurpee joint and low and behold I am stuck. Stuck due to lack of diamonds, things you are awarded during play when finishing levels. So now that this third store needs even more diamonds to upgrade things, very high charges of 10-20 diamonds on a lot of it, and I can no longer complete levels with three stars without upgrading. I now have to hang out at the \"casino\" endlessly spinning the wheel trying to get diamonds. \n\nSo I went from having fun to getting bored silly spinning a \"roulette\" wheel that only gives 2 diamonds a pop when you actually land on the diamond giveaway slot. And I also had 90k in money, which has dwindled down to 29k and now I only have 2 diamonds. I will probably consider this game done and uninstall, what a waste. Too bad because the game WAS fun.\n\nThis is a DEFINITE no buy, unless you like to be frustrated a lot, not by your skill level or a challenging game, but by a lack of foresight by a dev when bringing a mobile port to pc, then by all means grab it  lol","timestamp_created":1557886185,"timestamp_updated":1589056983,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":52,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.832834184169769287","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/anL/fECcLebwQE="}
