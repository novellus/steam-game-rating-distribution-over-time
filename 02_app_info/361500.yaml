    review: '[h1]A reflection of moods[/h1]

      The game itself is depending on its emotional soundtrack, which certainly delivers.


      The OST is a combination of atmospheric and diverse ambient''ish tracks, sometimes
      sounds strange, and weird enough, often familiar?


      Be it minimalistic classic, a mixture of soft synths ambient, Zen music, or
      rather dark industrial''ish sounds. Surprisingly, this diversity mostly does
      work as an album on its own, although some tracks may drift into repetitive
      dullness.




      [h1]Sidenotes:[/h1]

      Considering this is a DLC, you probably heard the music already. Personally,
      i wanted to test-listen, which is possible here:

      http://studiopaint.bandcamp.com/releases


      All 24 tracks come as DRM-free MP3 & FLAC, and can be found under:
