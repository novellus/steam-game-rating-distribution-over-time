Different layouts from different points in time, how cool is that ? \n\nBesides, if you read the details on each track pack, in some of them it is stated that a few more layouts will be added, and will be available to people like us, who purchased it without any additional cost. \n\nIn short, it is a great deal. Spa is yet to be released, and there will be another one of those tracks coming ( Monza ?) + future layout updates/addition all without any additional cost.","timestamp_created":1609061999,"timestamp_updated":1609061999,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mbTk0fYCc8nYvQI="}
