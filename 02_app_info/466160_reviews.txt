Art- really great art for the characters and monsters you will fight throughout the game. \n\n2. Skill system- There is also a robust skill system you can customize and fine-tune for each character as they level up. Characters through status effects and combo mechanics and depending on how you build them can synergize with each other in interesting ways. \n\n2. Price vs value- It's price is really cheap for all the custom art and great gameplay provided. I highly recommend it for a good time to lose yourself in a game. \n\n\n\nCons- \n\n1- I can't think of any really bad aspects of the game.\n\n2- Anything bad I can think of would be more subjective like disliking 16 bit art.","timestamp_created":1585334471,"timestamp_updated":1585334471,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lYnTjvECd5nM+wE="}
