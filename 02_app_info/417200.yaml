    review: 'Why I don''t recommend the game: The game has some issues and the last
      update listed was July of 2018. Ultimately, I requested a refund.


      The game has two modes: Story and Creative. In Story mode  you sail around in
      a circle collecting boat parts and chimes that expand the map, so you can sail
      around in a circle to collect more parts and chimes. In Creative mode, all the
      parts are unlocked and you use the boat editor to build boats and then sail
      them.


      The boat editor is difficult to use. When rotating the parts they can get stuck
      in the foreground/background of the camera and won''t snap to mounting points.
      The mounting points also misbehave or are difficult to determine you''re on
      the correct one. Once the part is placed, your only option to move it is to
      delete/undo and try again. The parts are divided into 4 categories,  Hull parts,
      Buoyancy parts, Sails, and Other. Many are copies with cosmetic changes and
      once you have a lot of parts unlocked, it becomes an annoyance to scroll through
      all the Hull parts.


      The sailing physics was OK, but had issues. I have some real world experience
      with sailing; having raced sailboats for a few years. I couldn''t get the boat
      to sail upwind with the upwind sails. The best I could do was a beam reach,
      anything higher and the sails stopped working, the boat would slow to a halt,
      and then you''re dead in the water. Once the boat stops moving your avatar drops
      the controls and you have to click to release then click again to control the
      boat. Although you can''t trim them, if you''re using the square downwind sails
      you can kind of backwind them to get the boat moving backwards and regain some
      steerage. However out of several attempts, I was only successful in backwinding
      and turning downwind once. Using the avatar to get out and push the bow around
      didn''t seem to have any effect either.


      The boats don''t have any ballast or weight in the keel, only an overall weight
      to buoyancy ratio. To offset this, every design (that I saw)  has some sort
      of symmetrical outriggers to keep the boats from flipping as soon as they sails
      fill. Also, at times, it feels like you''re sailing on a wine cork the way they''ll
      bounce, especially with smaller builds. I tried making a smaller boat with an
      upwind sail to test the upwind physics and it was uncontrollable. And for lashed(?)
      together ship wreckage and barrels, these things move way too fast. It seemed
      like average cruising speed downwind with full sails was around 30 knots. Amazing
      for plowing through the water with no rigging to secure the mast.


      Anyway, this game has potential to be a fun sailing game, which I''m always
      excited to see because there are so few. The graphics and audio are good, in
      its current state its playable, if repetitive, but needs work on the main components
      of the game; the build editor and sailing physics.'
