    review: The gameplay was already thin for the price, but the idea was interesting
      enough to give it a try.  Unfortunately I ran into a game breaking bug early
      on.  I posted about it on the forum, but the developer never responded and there
      have been no updates.  Sadly I have to recommend avoiding this one.
