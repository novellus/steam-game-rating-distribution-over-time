    review: 'In Fear I Trust''s fourth episode might as well be regarded as the final
      one, even though the main store page states that a fifth entry was supposed
      to be released. The first episode introduced main character Nikolay, and took
      place in a hospital. The second episode took place in a school and had a story
      about some ghost girl, students, and faculty. The third episode was a semi-murder
      mystery in the abandoned factory that used to house Nikolay''s job. This fourth
      entry is the first, and only, time that we get to see his character model, and
      it takes place in a theatre; it also sports a semi-murder mystery vibe as well.


      Essentially, your goal is to find out the identity of the arsonist that burned
      down the theater. Nikolay''s employer from Episode 3 makes an appearance, which
      will lead players to ultimately conclude that he''s some sadistic freak who
      is responsible for all of the crazy murders, and is in charge of the VERSA Corporation.
      Though this is never actually spelled out as there''s no actual conclusion to
      the game, it''s the only reasonable assumption. The storytelling in this final
      episode is better than its three predecessors, but it''s still incredibly confusing.


      For some reason, the puzzles take a huge leap in difficulty, and as such In
      Fear I Trust''s fourth episode is the longest one, clocking in at well over
      an hour. Of course, this depends on how good you are at sliding puzzles in particular.
      There are a couple others that require in-depth problem solving as well. As
      usual, not all of these puzzles have to be solved in order to complete the episode,
      but the most complex ones do.


      As a whole, In Fear I Trust is a convoluted mess of a game. It starts off promising
      enough, with a creepy hospital/deranged mad doctor vibe, but it just seems like
      the developers had no idea what they actually wanted to get out of the game.
      Is it a murder mystery? Is it a psychological thriller? Is it a supernatural/paranormal
      investigation? Who knows. Certainly not me. Except for one character that shows
      up in two of the four episodes, there seems to be no connection between any
      of the episodes, and the story is far too complex. For the most part, the puzzles
      are far too easy.  Regrettably, the end of Episode 4 isn''t worth the three-and-a-half
      hours it takes to reach, and at no point does the plot become any clearer. Just
      avoid this mess entirely, I wasted a good chunk of my night off on this crap.
