Other DLC packs had only female characters often but this has a better balance (6 male / 10 female characters).  The quality is also good with various bust types, full body images, and SV and walking sprites. So everything you need if you want to use it for RMMV (or Visual Novel Maker).\nThe quality of the characters are like the Heroine Packs. However, I find this pack better because it is more balanced in male and female protagonists! \nThank you for listening Degica and I hope we can see more Character packs with a balanced number of male and female characters. :)\n\n","timestamp_created":1577385560,"timestamp_updated":1577385560,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.645497381687164307","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/LDgoe8Cf7+c5wE="}
