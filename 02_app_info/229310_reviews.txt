Yes. For $7 it's a bit pricey for three new levels, but the DLC bundle 2 gives you three DLC for $14, which I think is the better option to go for and saves you a little bit of money.\n\nSo what did I think of the new levels?\n\nFarm 51 has added a version of Prison that isn't difficulty locked, unlike in the original. This is a good change, as I never really liked how levels were locked behind difficulty in the original. Other than that, it's mostly a straight port, with a few visual flairs and decorations added here and there. Good level in the original, still a good level now.\n\nCity is where the DLC starts to shine. For starters, the zombies you fight throughout the level have got a graphical update that makes them feel more unique than the reskinned plague victims from the original game. The level itself has received a nice visual overhaul as well. In the original, it was mostly a flat, grey level. Here, ash now rains from the sky, a new skybox gives it some nice visual flair, and the textures now have a bit more detail. The level is mostly the same gameplay wise, including the annoying fire escape jumping section about halfway through. The final miniboss fight has also been changed, but this is mostly for the better.\n\nPentagon has also been updated. The original wasn't a very good level to begin with, so any change is positive. It's received a nice visual overhaul, with new lights, a giant spinning fan, and other little visual flairs that break up what was mostly a concrete box in the original. Instead of fighting the Panzer Spider right off the bat, you first have to spend some time killing a couple waves of enemies, which is a good way to increase the level's play time and get the player a few extra hitpoints for the final fight.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this DLC and would recommend it. My only real complaint is, again, the lack of ability to backtrack through levels after fights to gather supplies and look around. City and Pentagon were already like this in the original, but Prison especially was always a level I liked to wander through. Beyond that, I think they should have re-designed Pentagon to be more of an actual level instead of one big arena, but I respect that they were simply trying to bring the original level to Hell and Damnation.","timestamp_created":1600870476,"timestamp_updated":1600870476,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjp3U3fQCfO7GowI="}
