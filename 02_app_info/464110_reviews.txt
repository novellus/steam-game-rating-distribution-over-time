In that, you controlled three droids with different abilities, each of which could be controlled directly or programmed to execute a series of commands simultaneously to solve various puzzles. Factotum 90 has a much simpler conceit, only two droids, neither of which can be programmed only controlled alternately, both with the same abilities. Otherwise it's about using them cooperatively to navigate across a level, solving various small puzzles along the way. You might get one to stand on a button that activates a moving platform on which you've positioned the other, who can then activate a switch to turn off a force-field so the first droid can get through, that kind of thing.\n\nIt's a pretty gentle puzzle game, not particularly challenging - you will probably not get stumped, it's mostly a case of seeing what you need to do, and then executing it. This is pretty satisfying for the most part, although some of the tasks seem like busywork (take box here, run back there, take second box here etc) but never to the point of tedium. Each level is short and sweet. You've guided by a British guy who does a good job with the script, he'll introduce each level and interject every now and then, although the story isn't going to surprise you at all. Annoyances? The elevator music can't be turned off, there's no \"always run\" button (and you will want to always run, as walking speed is quite slow), you collect data packets with... no apparent benefit, and there's a vague air of clunkiness to the whole thing. But I still enjoyed it.","timestamp_created":1595772301,"timestamp_updated":1595772301,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.58403170108795166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47J3cxfMCdJTVlwI="}
