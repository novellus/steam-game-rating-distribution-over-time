It is not a long game, but it seems to have some good replay value, as it is different each time you play.  I really liked the way it forces you to think strategically, especially towards the later levels.  \n\nEach enemy requires a different approach, and there are several strategies you can employ to finishing a level.  The tension rises as enemies start to take a more offensive role.  I found myself, after failing a few times, learning how to be more careful in where I looked, where in the earlier levels, I would try to \"see\" the whole board before making any kind of decisions.  \n\nAs someone who is not into strategy games, I felt like this was good as an intro to a new genre that can seem overwhelming to someone who prefers single player, first person action games.","timestamp_created":1609905571,"timestamp_updated":1609905571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y7D26vYCfarzwAI="}
