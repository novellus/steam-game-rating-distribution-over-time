    review: After just 5 minutes of gameplay (and with more or less calm tutorial
      in that) the game made me more sick than I ever was in VR. It is roller-coaster
      level of sickness. I foolishly assumed that it would be more of a puzzle game,
      slow, more tactical fight where managing your ship would be most important.
      But no, it is action packed and with very quick steering that makes you sick.
      Maybe if you can play anything in VR you could find it fun. Maybe after I recover
      I will play challenges and it may be more managable.
