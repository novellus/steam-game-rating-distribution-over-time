      sides and doors. All had the standard RCH 4 shoe brake rigging.<br><br><strong>BR
      Banana Van</strong><br>The banana vans were of plywood construction and were
      fitted with thick insulation, but unlike earlier designs of banana vans they

      they were however steam piped. They are characterised by a large yellow spot
      on each side.

    review: 'Certainly a nice pack and a good addition to you''re rollingstock collection
      which fit''s in to the early BR era onwards. You get 3 different wagons with
      4 variants each bringing the total to 12. The come as clean and three stages
      of dirty and worn. Trial and error is found here as there is no manual covering
      this.


      Only downside is actually finding them in the scenario maker as their not found
      in the DTG folder despite them being the publisher. Once you open the object
      set filter you need to find a file called ''MichaelWhiteley'' open it and you''ll
      find the wagons labled as ''VanWagonPack3''.'
