It vaguely reminds me of Legend of Grimrock, but crossed with Moraff's Dungeon and System Shock. If you like first person, turn based crawlers, and you like science fiction, then this game should be up your alley.","timestamp_created":1608966302,"timestamp_updated":1608966302,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk633zvYCfcOmvQI="}
