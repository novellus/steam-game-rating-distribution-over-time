I started in a long room with a computer terminal type machine in the corner, I could enter stuff but nothing was doing anything, I must need a code! I searched everwhere and found nothing. Defeated at the first hurdle I looked at a youtube vid to get a clue. In the vid a line of text popped up telling him what to input! not in my game it didn't and no way in a thousand years would I have randomly guessed that. Any way, the next puzzle was quite hard, and some of it didn't make sense, misleading clues etc, but I did it and went to the third. The third was clicking on 16 tiles with rune like symbols on them. Again, no idea, no clue, back to the walkthrough. The answer made me refund it. I believe I am quite good at puzzles but these are stupidly hard with no logic and seemingly random answers. I stared, I sighed, I gave up, I watched youtube, I went WTF! I refunded.","timestamp_created":1529136056,"timestamp_updated":1529136056,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.478841871023178101","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7JDng+QCe52OowE="}
