    about_the_game: "DUNGEONS OF CHAOS is a tribute to the 2D turn-based pixelart\
      \ RPGs of the 80s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA game where you can create your party\
      \ of 6 characters with a few clicks, or spend more time creating a customised\
      \ party with feats unlocked in previous plays.  Where exploration is encouraged\
      \ and rewarded, with no level cap, non-linear side quests and a vast array of\
      \ items, item properties, shops and enemies.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game already\
      \ has over 30000 happy players on other platforms, and most often they mention\
      \ the likeness to 80s RPGs like Ultima or the goldbox games.  It is retro. \
      \ Your hand will not be held.  It does not try to have realistic 3D graphics.\
      \  It is not multiplayer, and never will be.  If you long for the days when\
      \ you traded your sleep for a chance to direct a party of adventurers through\

      \ it a try.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd as all existing players already know, all\

      \ a complete-detail wiki somewhere, as the fan interaction on questions and\
      \ strategy are a very enjoyable part of the game.  So come join our community\
      \ of DoC addicts and play a game where a troll is still a hairy monster you\
      \ can kill, where there are no level caps, where you are not confined by a slim\
      \ storyline path, and where it all starts with fighting rats in a cave/cellar.\
      \  Fans have usually spent anything upwards of 80 hours playing it.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nP.S.: apologies in advance for the puns in the game, but to my defence\
