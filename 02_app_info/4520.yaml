    short_description: The U.S. Army is the most powerful ground force in the entire
      world. The backbone of a ground invasion is the U.S. Army Infantry, and in the
      midst of combat, their skills, courage, and teamwork are put to the test. While
      readiness continues to be the U.S. Army's top priority, how it goes about its
      business is changing.
