    review: 'A very small deathmatch game. The one level I played was small and felt
      like cs_office.

      This is indeed an arena shooter just like the description says. I expected too
      much of it.


      The level/arena borders are defined by a kill-zone just like you would encounter
      in other games where you shall not leave the map area.

      I thought it would be a bit bigger and openworld and generally more epic and
      sometimes players would meet and PvP each other. And sometimes people would
      hide in Asteroids. But its just small and made for quick fights.


      Not for me.

      On the other hand, it is a perfect small space shooter if someone really needs
      one. So if you need this kind of game get it and see my review as a recommendation.


      Unfortunately this game concept does not work for me...

      Could not refund because purchase was too long ago and I could not test it earlier.'
