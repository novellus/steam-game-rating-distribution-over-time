    about_the_game: "In Overture, magic can cure all diseases, but not those of the\
      \ mind. Society looks down on those whose illnesses are incurable by magic,\
      \ and these &quot;lunatics&quot; must stay in madhouses until they recover their\
      \ sanity\u2014if they ever do.<br><br>But no one has a worse madness than 13-year-old\
      \ Janis\u2014not even those who long for death, or live in constant fear, or\
      \ see and hear the unreal\u2014because in a city where everyone can use magic,\
      \ Janis alone can't. &quot;Magic Deficiency Disorder,&quot; they call it.<br><br>Her\
      \ disability makes Janis an easy target for bullying, but she still fights back\
      \ despite always losing. One day, she is saved from her bullies by Aidan Woolf,\
      \ a powerful mage and police commander.<br><br>In Woolf, Janis finds a father\
      \ figure, but the commander didn't come to her madhouse just for a visit. He\
      \ has a mission.<br><br><strong>Characters:</strong><br><br><i>Janis</i><br>Janis\
      \ has lived in a madhouse since she was a small child because she suffers from\
      \ what many people call the worst madness ever - she can't use magic. Between\
      \ her so-called &quot;magic deficiency disorder&quot; and the bullying she has\
      \ to endure every day because of it, Janis is ready to give up hope, but her\
      \ life is about to change...<br><br><br><i>Aidan Woolf</i><br>As the commander\
      \ of the Overture police's most elite special forces unit, Aidan Woolf comes\
      \ to the madhouse on a mission from the king himself. There he meets Janis,\
      \ a teenage girl who reminds him of the daughter he lost many years ago in an\
      \ incident that transformed him into a hardened warrior who puts duty above\
      \ everything else.<br><br><i>Candela Carroll</i><br>Her sketchbook is the only\
      \ thing in the world that can hold Candela Carroll's attention for more than\
      \ five minutes, but she's Janis's best friend at the madhouse. However, since\
      \ she's three years older, Candela will be forced to leave the children's ward\
      \ before Janis does, and that time may come sooner than they think.<br><br><i>Drake\
      \ Perrault</i><br>Drake is a bully. He and his friends - or, rather, his underlings\
      \ - especially like to pick on Janis because they see her as a helpless girl\
      \ who can't defend herself. But his friends and victims don't know that, for\
      \ Drake Perrault, bullying is a way to cope with his condition.<br><br><i>Ena\
      \ Polidori</i><br>Though a little clumsy, Ena Polidori is the children's favorite\
      \ nurse. She volunteers to teach Janis magic, much to the younger girl's displeasure,\
      \ and always encourages her to keep trying. Things get awkward between Ena and\
      \ Joff Godwin after she mistakes the young lord as a new patient at the children's\
      \ ward, but that might not necessarily be a bad thing...<br><br><i>Joff Godwin</i><br>Lord\
      \ Godwin recently founded Magical Mechanical, a company that researches and\
      \ manufactures magic machines. With his aristocratic status and his position\
      \ in the new magical engineering industry, he helps Commander Woolf's investigation\
      \ by approaching the madhouse's owner with a business proposition.<br><br><i>Johann\
      \ Poe</i><br>As one of the most well-known and respected magical scientists\
      \ in Overture, Professor Poe uses his extensive knowledge of magic to assist\
      \ Commander Woolf in his investigation. But will he also learn something from\
      \ his time at the madhouse?<br><br><i>Alanis Blyton</i><br>Professor Poe considers\
      \ her to be one of the brightest students he has ever taught, but Alanis Blyton\
      \ sometimes wonders if magical science is the right field for her. Instead,\
      \ she often finds herself poring over psychology textbooks.<br><br><i>Colton\
      \ Sherwood</i><br>The madhouse is not a correctional facility, Colton Sherwood\
      \ believes. He built his madhouse to give lunatics a place where they can be\
      \ who they are, where they don't have to be &quot;normal,&quot; where they can\
      \ be safe from the outside world.<br><br><i>Oriel Sherwood</i><br>Oriel Sherwood\
      \ is a magical scientist, but her main job is to help her husband operate the\
      \ madhouse. Because she and her husband don't have children, they care for the\
      \ children at the madhouse as if they were their own."

    review: 'Recommended, especially if you have read "An Octave Higher" (and even
      if you havn''t read it). A nice and short pre-story of that visual novel. There
      are some problems on mental issue descriptions and some pacing problems, still
      recommended though.


      Most aspects of the game itself are similar to "An Octave Higher". Most of them
      aren''t outstanding, but also good in average. Quite importantly, I find this
      visual novel surprisingly immersive...'
