These are pretty much different game modes where a factor or two is changed to spice things up. One for example is the \"Shrinking Hands\" game mode. As you save more and more balls the smaller your hands become. Another example is the \"Slow Mo\" game mode where balls come at you in slow mo and it feels like you're The Flash saving balls with super speed.\n\nThe game is well worth the price point to the extent where its almost a steal for this price. \n\nHighly Recommended.","timestamp_created":1492937689,"timestamp_updated":1545974283,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534205436706542969","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r+/P+ecCddS6dw=="}
