    review: 'I actually liked this story. It''s no way near perfect but it really
      was an interesting read about experience with psychological distress and depression
      (I have depression myself so I could relate). This is a separate story from
      the other Truth Disorders, so you don''t have to read them in order to understand
      this one.


      The English is so-so but if you can bear with it, it''s ok. I guess the fact
      that English is my 2nd language helped me to deal with it ''cause I don''t care
      about the depth of the words as much as a native English speaker would.'
