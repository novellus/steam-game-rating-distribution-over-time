    review: Tbh I thought this game would be like rest of the simulation games like
      just to build factory and do some normal stuff,but this game amazed me.The graphics
      is epic,the visuals are stunning and exploring the flora and fauna were totally
      great.It is fun with company. Totally worth for 10$
