    review: 'Thought I would swing back around and make a contribution to the thumbs-up
      jar for this one.

      First, the graphics are wonderfully stylized, and I thought the use of pictograms
      explaining how everything works was really clever given the theme.  Sure, it
      may still take some trial and error to fully understand what things do, but
      that can happen even in games where you have text descriptions.

      Music is good, sounds are great, and I also appreciate that any gear you equip
      shows up on your character model.

      One of the most common complaints is the slow pace, but I find myself leaning
      more towards agreeing with the developer on this one.  If enemies moved too
      quickly, you could miss quite a bit of what''s going on.  You need to be able
      to pay attention to how many tiles an enemy can travel so that you can learn
      their patterns, which panels they''re stepping on, which traps they''re triggering,
      the tiles the traps are affecting, and so on.

      Given that the maps aren''t that large, and once you advance so far, you then
      have guards chasing you from behind, it essentially forces you to pay close
      attention to your surroundings and carefully work out how you plan on making
      it to the floor exit.  Whether or not you''re going to skip grabbing some goodies
      because the guards are too close for comfort, or if you''re going to risk walking
      into a trap zone because the consequences of staying put are much worse, etc.

      This isn''t an easy game, but I wouldn''t necessarily say it''s harder than
      any other rogue-like, just difficult in its own unique way, if that makes any
      sense.'
