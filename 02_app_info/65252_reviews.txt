The loco/air braking feels very well done - careful consideration needs to be made regarding their use, especially when going downhill. I have often found long distance engine braking to be more effective (which should be the case!).\n\nThe scenarios included on the WCML-North feel slightly strange. The Class 70 first hit UK rails at the end of the 2000's and yet the scenarios feature swallow liveried 43's & 86's (I guess they just used default locos already included on this route, so at least its accessible).\n\nI've seen others complaining about the \"General Electrical Goods\" scenario, notably that the braking physics incur penalties. Such penalties are entirely fair enough and down to driver error - you need to use long distance engine, & not air-braking when going downhill, and you can still stop in time for red signals. There is however an error with this scenario whereby I incurred a 40 point deduction for going along a bend too quickly (81 rather than the Loco's MSP of 75 - fair enough), but I somehow ended up with only 835 points rather than 960.","timestamp_created":1595704601,"timestamp_updated":1595704779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j9Taw/MCddzClwI="}
