      IMPORTANT ! Please Read Entirely and Carefully!<br><br>YOU MAY NEED TO VERIFY
      GAME FILES OR REINSTALL IF THE GAME WILL NOT START.<br>THIS IS CAUSED BY NOT

      apologize for the inconvenience, but since the last two updates combined was
      basically an overhaul, this has caused some issues with some users, with the

      methods fixed the update not going through, or game not running properly.<br><br>The
      combined last two updates included:<br>Graphical Updates, Re-Balancing Updates,
      Quality of Life Updates, New Game Mechanics, <br>and PS4 Controller Support

    review: "After nearly two hours the combat has yet to evolve beyond spamming basic\
      \ attack. There is more to this combat, but I have not found a way to access\
      \ this. Objective is a library in the south, but going directly south led me\
      \ to two new towns containing no library, or anything interesting. \nBoss-appearances\
      \ are not telegraphed, and so you'll just be fucked at the end of exploring\
      \ something. The bosses I encountered are regular mobs with higher health and\
      \ the same mechanics. There is also this fun thing called curse, that procs\
      \ rarely, but lets you hit yourself, which might take a third of your life of\
      \ just kill you from full. \nLost gold on death cannot be recovered as far as\
      \ I can discern. Escaping enemies who will kill you given 20 turns (because\
      \ your stats aren't high engough) doesn't seem to work, even with allegedly\
      \ 25x higher chance to escape from an item/move. \nThe game was clearly made\
      \ without an artist, and looks the part, including pixelated images displayed\
      \ at the wrong resolution. I can empathize, but nothing of the atmosphere makes\
      \ me look past this. \nNothing here besides a failed attempt at combat mechanics\
      \ and atmosphere says soulslike. The two crashes I encountered are a known issue,\
      \ but nevertheless amazing for the otherwise stable RPGMaker-Engine. \n\nI won't\
      \ refund this, because I like the idea, but it's shit and this idea has been\
      \ done much better elsewhere."
