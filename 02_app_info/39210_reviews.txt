If this game had free roam combat it probably would be better.  If id never played a video game before it probably would be funner, Eorzea really shouldn't of gone past level 50.  I would of liked to see an upgraded game instead of the expansions which they did make a game but It wasn't a new online game..it feels adding the flying mounts and expanding the story was good but there are so many boring repetitive quests that it doesn't add anything to the overall experience.","timestamp_created":1543109586,"timestamp_updated":1609903676,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.431795895099639893","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwppPv6vYCfKzfsgE="}
