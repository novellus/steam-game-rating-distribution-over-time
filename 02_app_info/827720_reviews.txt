It was developed indigenously by Hyundai in South Korea.\" (I didn't say so in the forums but it seems very likely that at least part of the article was written by an absurdly patriotic Korean and NOT by Silent Stalker.)\n\nhttps://aw.my.games/en/news/general/black-panther\n\nAfter deleting the comments, Silent Stalker become hostile and then banned me for saying he should be more polite.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2125956158\n\nI tried asking for help from the mods on Discord but when I asked \"Soren\" for help, he banned me from the AW discord and posted \"Thanks for the feedback\" as the reason for the ban.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2127547497\n\nThe Steam forum ban was then removed... from Steam by someone working for Valve... but I remain banned from the AW Discord after spending huge amounts of money on the game, starting my own clan, etc.\n\nSo yeah, Steam is good but at least part of My.games is staffed by proud morons who treat their paying customers like dirt... sad to see a potentially good game in such hands.","timestamp_created":1591974681,"timestamp_updated":1597280146,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528031587600708008","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpZrU8vMCfq/PjQI="}
