It's at first very stalkerish and adds some forced drama in there so you can pretend that your actions are justifiable by being a hero. There was no established reason to start the peeping other than just being a fetishist and the fact that they tried to act like it's a justifiable crime if it helps you intervene on a crime is some real \"Big Brother Patriot Act\" way of thinking that I couldn't get behind.\n\nThere are some lewd images, but nothing particularly fitting of the theme, just kind of generic lewd images. If you end up buying this product at full price, expect a game of finding items that match the shapes on the side of the screen in order to progress the \"story.\"","timestamp_created":1609707940,"timestamp_updated":1609707940,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwir2E5fYCcveYwAI="}
