I've seen some logorrhea in games, but this one takes the biscuit. It's fully voiced, and decently so, but that doesn't alleviate the abrasion.\n\n- Bad puzzles. Half of them simply consist of exploring all dialogue options. The rest is full of combinations that seem random even after you see their result. On top of that, you've got unresponsive spots that only and silently become responsive after arbitrary events occur. Awful.\n\nSo annoying that I could only bear the game in short sessions. A pity considering the good art, the great music and a decent interface, including a hot spots key. The humour is weak but I did smile twice so that is not completely lost.\n\nI would almost recommend, but the ratio wait/play is just too high.","timestamp_created":1594829245,"timestamp_updated":1594829373,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45J/PqfMCfLm9lQI="}
