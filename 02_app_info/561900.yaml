      s important for me as a GM that my gamers encounter varied areas and islands\
      \ when they are sailing across the high seas, searching for treasures or revealing\
      \ hidden secrets. If you are also among those who like to make these visible\
      \ on your tabletop, then you know that sometimes it\u2019s simply hard to find\
      \ the right map if you need a small island, a coast or a group of islands; and\
      \ it also isn\u2019t worth it (neither in time nor money) to seek out or create\
      \ a new one every single time your players want a small-time raid. You can sketch\
      \ them up anytime, but if you are not an artist or you need a more spectacular\
      \ solution, well, you had to go for a map. Until now...<br><br><i>This set includes:</i><br><br><ul\
