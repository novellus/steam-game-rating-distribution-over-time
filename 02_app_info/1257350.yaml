    review: 'I''m not an expert at this game by any means but I really like this DLC.
      Yoko is a fun character to play as since she has a cool design (that modern
      school jacket mixed with the classic witch look is super cool) and a fun story
      about trying to prove she can become a true witch. I can''t help but admire
      such determination.


      Anyway, The character has a nice forward shot that has decent coverage. Her
      friend Michael sticks closely to her and fires a single, powerful bomb blast
      at a time. This might not be ideal for people who are used to more rapid fire
      attacks, but the tradeoff means more power (I need to double-check how powerful
      the shots are)


      Anyway, if you like Trouble Witches and have been itching for more content,
      go ahead and by this DLC along with Yoko and the Walpurgis difficulty mode!'
