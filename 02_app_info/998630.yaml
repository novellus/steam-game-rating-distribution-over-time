    review: 'Okay, so this one is a complete lift of Ogre Battle mechanics, except
      that there are no monsters and your army consists entirely of ... I''m not sure?
      Interchangeable bored teenagers? The sheer number of goggles indicates a steam
      punk setting, but the equipment they fight with ranges from medieval weaponry
      to random garbage, so maybe this is a drunk teenager army simulator? Is that
      a thing?


      Anyway, your scrubs fight some other scrubs that wear different colors. One
      of your scrubs comments on the futility of this, but the other talks him into
      continuing to beat on everyone else wearing different color shirts. Good. You
      capture some towns, which provides you with more supplies (drugs? snacks?) with
      which to bring out more units of scrubs and so forth. If the procedurally generated
      level gives you towns nearby, you probably win. If not, you might lose as the
      enemy scrubs can bring units out faster. Boo. Sometimes you have to find really
      finicky little hidden things that require your guys to land on just the right
      pixel. Sometimes you have to escort a bomb cart to a city. Sometimes you just
      murder a bunch of goth teenagers. Why? I''m not at all sure!


      In each stage, you can find one hidden town, one guy who will boost one stat
      for one of your scrubs, and one new scrub to recruit. You get some money with
      which to buy garbage to fight with. The ones that look like weapons help a lot.
      Sometimes your guys gain levels, which gives them some stats and a choice of
      two perks. They all have some potential meter, which maybe gives them better
      stats if it''s higher, but everyone you have is just varying shades of low potential,
      as befitting a troop of homeless whino children. (Edit: Apparently you can trade
      in levels for extra potential? Make sure to hit every possible button on every
      screen as there aren''t great prompts to do so.)


      Anyway, don''t buy this if you don''t understand what a game of drunk Ogre Battle
      would end up being, but if you do, it''s worth the low price to mess around
      with. The class change and trait flexibility end up being a lot of fun once
      you figure out what the heck is going on.'
