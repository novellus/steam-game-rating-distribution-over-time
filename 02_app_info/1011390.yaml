      \ edition is a bundle including FOG2 and FOG Empires 25% discounted.</p><br><h1>Provincial\
      \ Units Infographic - Full List</h1><p>In Field of Glory: Empires almost every\
      \ province in the game has a unique unit. These units are often quite powerful\
      \ or have unique traits but the cost of each unit will increase as you raise\
      \ more.<br>Provincial units are usually slightly more effective than the generic\
      \ unit of their type. In addition, some are very useful such as archers and\
      \ some cavalry units. Others are very powerful and a valuable addition to any\
      \ army. <br>Wondering what type of Provincial Unit will you unlock in Hiberia?\
      \ Or are you in desperate need for some good Infantry Unit and want to know\

    review: "That \"would you recommend\" pop up got annoying so I decided to do this\
      \ to get rid of it.\n\nDo i recommend it to fans of the genre? Yes.  Hell, I\
      \ even recommend it to newer players since it is a way easier game to get into\
      \ (and I'm sure many out there know what I mean when I say \"get into\" lol)\
      \ the grand strategy genre with than almost anything else out there. \n\nAt\
      \ the end of the day, I'm an AGEOD fan with American Civil War 2 being 1 of\
      \ their best, if not the best game that they've made.  To End All Wars is another\
      \ OK one.  Haven't tried Wars of Napoleon and \"30 years war\" or something\
      \ akin to that title relating to the 30 year (or thereabouts) religious/sectarian\
      \ war that occurred in Europe in the 1600s.  \n\nThere's one annoying fact about\
      \ AGEOD (and their publisher Slitherine) and that's the DLC.  No, they don't\
      \ release a crapload of it but they overcharge for it.  \n\nTL;DR - yea, go\
      \ ahead and get the game (even at full price) but try to pick up the DLC when\
      \ it is at least 50% off, o and stay the frruck away from Fields of Glory 2\
      \ and the whole \"battle importing\" BS.  Its a waste of time/money."
