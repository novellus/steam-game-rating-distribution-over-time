Character's acceleration in the air is absolutely brutal, many different enemies although they all feel the same (except for a few). Level design feels like an after thought. Only good thing about this game is the music.","timestamp_created":1570243341,"timestamp_updated":1570243341,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547865629196166992","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rP3yzO0CcI7E0wE="}
