I cope with depression and Beerman helps me forget about it. I connect with Beerman on a spirtitual level. I'm so greatful for whoever gifted me this game because I would not be the way I am today. The voice acting is top notch. The characters feel like real people not like the robots that Mass Effect Andromena gave us. The gameplay is simple but addictive. With an amazing story, great characters, amazing voice acting, you should buy yourself a copy of Beerman to be changed like I was.","timestamp_created":1532321021,"timestamp_updated":1532321021,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.460893839597702026","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xOfc4uQCdZzWpgE="}
