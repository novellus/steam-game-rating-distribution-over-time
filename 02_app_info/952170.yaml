    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Overview</h2>All the secrets to creating\
      \ an amazing car in Blender are packed into this step-by-step course. Over 15\
      \ years of experience and 6 months of development bring you a Blender training\
      \ course like no other. I\u2019ll take you through every step of the creation\
      \ process for creating a Corvette Stingray, including modeling, shading, rendering,\
      \ and compositing. You\u2019ll learn all the techniques you need to know to\
      \ create flawless surfaces and impressive renders.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Get Perfect\
      \ Curves with Advanced Modeling Techniques</h2>The biggest hassle of subsurf\
      \ modeling is dealing with adding details to curved surfaces and having that\
      \ additional topology ruin your smooth surfaces. In this course I\u2019ll show\
      \ you methods that bypass that problem entirely so you can maintain your perfect\
      \ curves without any hassle. Not only are the results perfect, but the workflow\
      \ is actually fun and much faster when you don\u2019t have to worry about every\
      \ detail affecting your surfaces. Plus one of the best benefits is total and\
      \ care-free control over the resulting topology of your model.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Advanced Modifier Usage for Efficiency and Awesomeness</h2>Modifiers are so\
      \ insanely powerful, and can be combined in so many ways to achieve really complex\
      \ tasks. In this course you\u2019ll learn a ton of different and unique ways\
      \ to use modifiers. From general complex modeling tasks, to other things like\
      \ instantly getting your windshield wipers flush against the windshield surface,\
      \ we\u2019ll be using modifiers to make our lives easier in making just about\
      \ everything.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Shading and Rendering</h2>I\u2019ll be showing\
      \ you how to create your own customize-able car paint including metallic flakes\
      \ and orange peel, and all other shaders necessary for the final renders. Then\
      \ we\u2019ll be setting up an environment to get the right lighting and reflections,\
      \ and setting up some compositing nodes for a little post processing.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Keep in Touch!</h2>This is an intermediate difficulty course so as\
      \ long as you have some experience with blender you should be able to follow\
      \ along fine. But if you need any help going through the project you can get\
      \ in touch with me. Or even if you just want to share your progress or chat\
      \ about the techniques!"
