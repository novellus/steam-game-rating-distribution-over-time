    review: "After playing the few other free versions on the market I'd say this\
      \ paid version is superior to those in a few ways.\n\n----------------------------Pros------------------------\n\
      \nThe best feature is the automatic scripting for setting up the game. Watching\
      \ the pieces move around into their spots is a spectacle akin to winning a game\
      \ of solitaire on a windows 98. It will also set up in either 1-2 player configuration\
      \ or 3-4 player depending on how many players are seated.\n\nThe how to play\
      \ book is also scripted for easy one click back and forth page turning. A very\
      \ nice feature.\n\nThe table and background look beautiful, in alot of ways,\
      \ the $6 your paying, is mostly for the looks, and it's almost worth it.\n\n\
      The tokens snap together perfectly anywhere on the board so your beehive's always\
      \ look beautiful.\n\nThe map is uncluttered and simplistic, there's nothing\
      \ on the table that doesn't need to be there.\n---------------------------------cons-----------------------------\n\
      \nWatching the script you can clearly see which age of end card is being put\
      \ on the bottom of the deck. This kind of ruins the surprise and give an edge\
      \ to anyone paying attention.\n\nThe script automatically deletes the rest of\
      \ the age of end cards. Which is bad because Destiny of the Delvers requires\
      \ you to pull two more age of end cards. \n\nThe table is lumpy on the sides\
      \ which means you can't draw on some parts, which makes final score calculation\
      \ a chore.\n\nThere is no automatic score calculation. I understand this would\
      \ be a taxing feature to implement but as it stands, there's not much setting\
      \ this paid game apart from the free versions already available.\n\nThe board\
      \ is kind of small, it can get crowded fast\n\nAn additional script for calculating\
      \ what dice totals are already on a ruin as well as a deal button for passing\
      \ back dice, delve cards, and the claimed ruin would be nice.\n\nFinal Notes:\
      \ \nIf you really, really, really like to play unearth, go ahead and buy this.\
      \ It looks better and plays better then any of the other mods on the workshop.\
      \ But if you just want to play a few games and have a fun time discovering ruins,\
      \ save your money and go to the workshop.\n\nFinal score: 7/10"
