    review: Coffee! ( In all seriousness it's a pretty good visual novel and a fantastic
      story) I feel like this visual novel is on par with Crystalline which is one
      of my favourite visual novels that I have read. It also reminds me of Spice
      and Wolf. When I heard the opening song of this Visual Novel I knew I was going
      to be in for a treat. I loved the soundtrack of this visual novel and the art
      was fantastic. This Visual Novel also has a lot of good emotional moments and
      there are not a lot of visual novels that I could say made me feel moved in
      a emotional way before. The only thing about this visual novel is that it is
      a shame this visual novel wasn't fully voiced but it doesn't stop it from being
      a really good visual novel and story..                        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxwcQ1dapw8
