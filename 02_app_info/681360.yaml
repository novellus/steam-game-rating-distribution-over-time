    review: "I come from a DDR background. I also have enjoyed plenty of music related\
      \ games. The idea of putting these into this setting, and in VR no less, intrigued\
      \ me. Once it came out, I saw the price and couldn't pass it up. \n\nI will\
      \ say, it is simple in its design, to which there is room for improvement. For\
      \ example, the system for picking your song is hard to use, and using the scroll\
      \ bar on the side doesn't always work for me. Also, I can't seem to get the\
      \ special to work after getting the swords to glow, but that may be because\
      \ I'm playing it on an Oculus instead of the vive. and finally, I can't quite\
      \ figure out how it senses music. Some songs I think will be extremelyt hard\
      \ (Through the Fire and Flames for instance), aren't, and vice versa. \n\nAll\
      \ that aside, I still will give this a thumbs up, because when it comes to actual\
      \ gameplay, it's a blast! Me and my son have been playing with it for a little\
      \ bit now, and it's quite the workout as well. Although, like my kid, you can\
      \ play this by just swinging your swords around wildly an do pretty good, the\
      \ idea of being able to \"slice\" through multiple blasts at once, and do it\
      \ intentionally, is quite rewarding. \n\nedit: There has been an update, and\
      \ the problems of scrolling through the music, as well as not being able to\
      \ fire the special, have been fixed. The UI where you pick your songs has improved\
      \ as well."
