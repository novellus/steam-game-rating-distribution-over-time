    review: "So I bought this game following my experience with the first one which\
      \ I found weird but entertaining. \n\nSadly the followup feels tired and stretched\
      \ thin. The humor is way less inspired, the use of  \"Cthulhu Mythos\" elements\
      \ felt irrelevant as art and story status of the beings are way less connected\
      \ to their original counterparts than in the first one, the dialogue (combat)\
      \ options felt more random and even more so like game of trivial pursuit than\
      \ something related to the story or characters (though it was a problem to at\
      \ some points in the first one). \n\nSmall nick pick: for some reason (though\
      \ not surprising after looking at this company's game library) there is an over\
      \ abundance of Shakespeare references and I mean there are LOTS of them. Those\
      \ should really have been references to Lovecraft and his circles of associates\
      \ and friends\n\nThe combat system is still great and interesting though, but\
      \ like mentioned before it didn't feel like I was battling anybody through knowledge\
      \ and logic but just answering trivia questions. There is also a lot of repetition.\
      \ When you get a random encounter with something you already fought the answers\
      \ are the same and in the same order and for some reason before fighting the\
      \ last boss you have to fight all the previous boss and they all have the same\
      \ answers and in the same order. This was really tiresome and sleep inducing.\n\
      \nLet's now talk about the menus: in the first game to move around you had some\
      \ nice maps to move around, but for this installment they decided to downgrade\
      \ and go with dialogue menus with sometimes take multiple pages to go through\
      \ all the options of zone. I think this specific elements represent best the\
      \ change between the 1rst and 2nd game.\n\nFor a game build in a visual novel\
      \ engine there is so many bugs it's uncanny. When I first bought the game I\
      \ got multiple exceptions that prevented me from starting a new game though\
      \ this was fixed fast enough. Quest breaking bugs, dead characters joining the\
      \ party bugs, achievements not unlocking bugs, achievements unlocking without\
      \ meeting the requirement bugs, etc. etc. \n\nLike the first game there some\
      \ potential here but it's buried underneath all the problems. Stick with the\
      \ first one if you're into this kind of game."
