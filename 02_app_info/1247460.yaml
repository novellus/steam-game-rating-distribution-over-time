      notes: This game contains written descriptions of graphic violence, some minor
        visual representations of said violence, alcohol, and allusions to sexual
        activity. There is one situation in which a character tries to seduce another
        through their abilities where the player must decide whether to resist or
        give in that may bring up associations of non-consensual sex for very sensitive
        players.

    review: amazing game, been updated on this game from the beginning! i am so proud
      that AEON DREAM STUDIOS has made it this far! and to think that they will start
      working on book 02 in 2021 makes me really excited even though i know it may
      take some time it's worth the wait!
