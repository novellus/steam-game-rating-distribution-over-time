    review: Having never actually seen any Sailor Moon show before, I figured I might
      as well watch this when a friend bought it for me. I expected it to be more
      aimed at children or young girls, but it was pretty good for an all-ages show,
      and if it wasn't for the fact that I don't have time to watch however many hundreds
      of episodes this show probably has I might be inclined to finish it. In technical
      regards, the show is in the original aspect ratio no matter what setting you
      choose in the player and seems to  be unedited, but the audio is strange in
      that while the show itself is the dub, with no option to choose the Japanese
      original (which seems a bit underwhelming for $3 per episode) the opening and
      ending credits are the Japanese versions, with no option to use the dubbed version
      of the theme. It's a good show, but the pricing scheme they have on Steam is
      pretty awful, but let's be real here nobody can actually afford to pay for anime
      no matter what media format it's in.
