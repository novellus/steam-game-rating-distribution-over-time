    review: I love this DLC.  I love how easy it is to use and it has a great fantasy
      flavor/style to it.  Hand drawn and charming, and lots of great features/art
      which all fit/flow together well.  I cranked out my fist map in about 30 minutes
      (which included exploring the features/learning it for the first time) and the
      map looked even better than I was expecting or hoping for.  (And the river graphics
      they added worked great for me.)  I'm very satisfied with this product at this
      price.  And honestly for me- the ease of use, and the speed of production vs.
      output quality ratio is so good- I'd have been happy paying $20 bucks for this.
      Also something I really appreciate- the developers included a help menu which
      made it very easy for me to figure out how to use it.  I've tried several overland
      map making programs- and I don't see myself using any other than this one from
      now on.
