    review: "Think this tantalising strategy/Tactical game was a challenge before,\
      \ then try this map. Loaded with obstacles you must cross or go around to get\
      \ to your target, with unlimited angles and corners for enemies to hide in or\
      \ behind makes this a must-have for anyone ehose found their way through so\
      \ far.\nNo-one could call this game is easy, and I'd call anyone out on it who\
      \ does, but this one is a doozy. Okay, you only get one map but you aren't paying\
      \ $4 as Stardock would have you pay, and you are getting better value (yes you\
      \ get a sub-faction with the \"Ashes...\n map, but one already created in the\
      \ forst \"ashes...\"). Think of the time it took to create this devlish masterpiece,\
      \ test it out and tweak it some more and you have more than your money's worth.\n\
      Don't let this game die - support the Devs and crow about how you breezed though\
      \ without a loss (and watch me call you out on it...hehe).\nKeep the content\
      \ coming, guys. There are still players looking for more challenges."
