The story is definitely heavy, but I like the ideas behind it. The gameplay is bullet hell galore, and the game takes cues from Blazing Star, one of my favorite classic shooters. \n\nDefinitely give this game a spin if you like shmups.","timestamp_created":1608250469,"timestamp_updated":1608250469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1608292284,"developer_response":"Thanks a lot for the support and I'm glad you like the game.
