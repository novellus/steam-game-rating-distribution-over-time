    review: I would've wanted to like this, but this is extremely hard to read due
      to a terrible translation. Pronouns are constantly changing for characters,
      even in the same sentence. Names are rarely ever accurate to what they're supposed
      to be. Sprites are reused for completely different characters, descriptions
      are inaccurate and several times it feels like what I'm reading is meant for
      a completely different scene and I'm just left scratching my head. There are
      "4" endings that all end exactly the same save for one line of text indicating
      the received ending. There also aren't any CGs. None, zip, zilch. The only positive
      I can see is the character art is decent.
