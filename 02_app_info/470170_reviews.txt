I find it chilling and comforting which is a strange but very welcome blend.\nThe story, especially as it pertains to the side story happening around you, is touching. To spend most of the game in bleakness, with bleakness happening to others around you, makes the final story beat most touching. To be specific, the fact that one man's petty selfishness hurt the potential love story someone was cultivating, while at the end we see what a true love story can feel like is the perfect contrast. Don't just blow through the game as you're quite able to do, do the side things and take your time to get the full contrasting exposure.\n\nIt was really cool to see the developer consider colorblindness so much since it was so key to the game, it wasn't hidden away in a menu, it was part of starting the game.\n\nI came across only one bug, but I worked around it in 30 seconds. In addition I got stuck on day 2 because it wasn't clear to me what to do, until I realized I was missing the obvious game developer's hint of pay attention to the only movement on your screen (the birds).\n\n\nDisclosure - Friend made this game","timestamp_created":1593071095,"timestamp_updated":1593071095,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521378636360168457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zfmb9fICcKmDkAI="}
