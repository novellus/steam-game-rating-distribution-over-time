      Santa Simulator is the simulator you have been waiting for since your first
      Xmas. Become Santa, a raging alcoholic with anger management issues. Discover
      how shitty Santa's job is, how annoying all those letters and the bloody elves
      really are. But when you get close to having enough and quitting, use your trusty
      bottle of vodka to power up with XXXmas spirit and keep going. </strong><h2
      class="bb_tag">Make your elves work</h2><br>The elves need a little something
      stronger to get going. Help them out by giving them something good to drink
      and they will show their gratitude by using their new found strength for making
      presents for you to deliver. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1163370/extras/1.gif?t=1603548974"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Deliver presents</h2><br>Customize your sleigh for better
      performance and looks. Pack your cargo so it fits, put those Tetris skills to
      a test. Take good care of your reindeer, the better they feel further and faster
      you will go. Be careful when you're high and up in the air - it's easy to get
      into an accident or fall off when you've had a little bit too much of the good
      stuff. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1163370/extras/2.gif?t=1603548974"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Sneak in</h2><br>People don't believe you exist. That means
      if they see you, you will end up on youtube and the news. You don't want that
      to happen! Use stealth, the environment your cunning and good alcohol to find
      a way into peoples' homes without getting caught or leaving a trace of your
      presence. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1163370/extras/3.gif?t=1603548974"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Make decisions</h2><br>You are Santa. All those letters
      are addressed to you. You make the call if little Johnny gets that bike he always
      wanted. Maybe he doesn't deserve it? Maybe, he should be punished instead? It's
      always up to you, and the only person you answer is yourself. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1163370/extras/4.gif?t=1603548974"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Stock up on supplies</h2><br>Remember how people were taught
      to leave cookies for Santa? Well, that simply won't do. You will need something
      with a little bit more power. Once you drink that, you will need something with
      a lot of calories. So make yourself at home in other people's homes and always
      be ready to take whatever food and drink and more drink that you so rightfully
      deserve. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1163370/extras/5.gif?t=1603548974"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Improvise</h2><br>Difficult situations call for complex
      solutions. Keep your wits about you and be ready to improvise whenever necessary.
      No solutions is off limits, sometimes only the most crazy ideas will solve your
      problem. Maybe you will need the kind of inspiration that can only be found
      at the bottom of a bottle of vodka. With that, a crazy idea might seem more
      plausible... and it just might work.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1163370/extras/6.gif?t=1603548974"
