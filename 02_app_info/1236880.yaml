    review: Early Access game with a good design.  I was not able to play on multiplayer,
      no servers available.  I did play on singleplayer.  There is crafting, building,
      finding loot that spawns and wildlife.  It has survival aspects of needing food,
      water and stamina.  I found the food bar drops very quickly.  I would have liked
      more interactable structures such as being able to climb the ladder to the watchtower,
      build a water well, etc.  The character is not customizable, but has a nice
      design.  I was unable to rotate the building structures except by walking around
      and placing.  Hoping they continue working on this EA game, it has a nice design.
