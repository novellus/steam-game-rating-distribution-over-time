I love being able to listen to this game's soundratck and stories wherever I go, since the first time I played this game I've been in love with the soundtrack's piece \"Welcome to Mousewood\", and might try to learn it on my cello or clarinet while I'm self quarantining. As someone who grew up on Beatrix Potter's stories, I absolutely love Matt Kempke's Stories From Mousewood. Personally, I think that this DLC is well worth the price, and probably would have spent this much on the additional comic alone. :0)","timestamp_created":1603588367,"timestamp_updated":1603588367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qZTUrvUCfen4qQI="}
