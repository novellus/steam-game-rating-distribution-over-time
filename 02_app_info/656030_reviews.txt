Played through it over on Youtube, so for anyone wanting to see a sample of gameplay before deciding whether to buy, here's a handy link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yrfcfzsmoU&list=PL05Yc3_TEBpPeXinXRdPCIZYhRjiRE7La\n\nGraphically, this game isn't amazing by today's standards - but it still looks pretty and is generally nice to look at (there are some beautifully artistic static images that do come up at certain points in the game, though). The sound design's fine in my eyes, and the voice acting has a certain charm to it. The Lost Legends of Redwall also has a story that could have come straight from one of Brian Jacques' books, so the devs have certainly done a good job of capturing elements of the 'Redwall feel', to put it that way.\n\nGranted, it's not a very long game, but I have to commend the devs for some of the ideas behind it. The scent mechanic really is an interesting idea, and I can't think of many other games that use something like it (certainly not as a core gameplay mechanic).\n\nIn short, I'd be very interested in seeing where the devs take it from here. Given the title of the game, I'm guessing they intend to do more instalments and develop a series? If so, consider me interested.","timestamp_created":1609776899,"timestamp_updated":1609776899,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u8SL5/YCdaq3wAI="}
