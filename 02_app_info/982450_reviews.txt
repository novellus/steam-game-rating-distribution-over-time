It's no way near perfect but it really was an interesting read about experience with psychological distress and depression (I have depression myself so I could relate). This is a separate story from the other Truth Disorders, so you don't have to read them in order to understand this one.\n\nThe English is so-so but if you can bear with it, it's ok. I guess the fact that English is my 2nd language helped me to deal with it 'cause I don't care about the depth of the words as much as a native English speaker would.","timestamp_created":1595943578,"timestamp_updated":1595943856,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+NTqyvMCfeaHmAI="}
