Time to update it because I'm bored.\n\nAs to what the other reviews say... It is harshly abandoned and unfinished. You're better off just buying No Man's Sky, Elite Dangerous, Rodina, or any of the other good space games out there - there are tons of them.\n\nI bought this game years ago, hated it, and never really put any time into it. I will admit it was fun to  play for the sake exploring an old abandoned indie game. (It is kinda sad, I feel like this game had lots of potential.)\n\nI honestly wish when this game was abandoned, that the developer released the source code to keep the game alive by the community.. I personally would have contributed to it myself.\n\nShould you buy? Simply put, no. -- with the exception on if you really want to spend $8 on an unfinished abandoned indie game that you'll only play once.. Then go ahead and get it - You probably will still be able to get your refund after you're tired of playing it.","timestamp_created":1459559523,"timestamp_updated":1584762417,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49u3M/fACfofSVA=="}
