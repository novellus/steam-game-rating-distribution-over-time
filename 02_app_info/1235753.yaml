    review: Was disappointed by this DLC and it's lack of content. The description
      isn't overly specific and I couldn't find a lot online. If I hadn't spent several
      hours building a house before checking out the new content, I could jave got
      my money back. As it is, I'm stuck with it. Wouldn't recommend purchasing at
      sale price, let alone payig full price.
