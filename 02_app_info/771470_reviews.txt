But it does put you on edge. I jumped a bit when someone had touched my neck while playing.\nGameplay is easy in the beginning but can quickly get harder. I needed to replay the thirth song a couple of times before i could complete it. Arcade song 2 seems a bit impossible for me.\nThe story is shown to you in bits and pieces before, during and after the song. It's easy to figure out what happend after completing the fourth song. But it was a nice short little mystery.\n\nI'll give this game a 7/10: it's not the best game that exist, but i also don't hate it. it's a nice concept to mix horror with rhythm. You can certainly finish this game within an hour, but you can keep it on your desktop in case your in the mood again for some horror rhythm.","timestamp_created":1596037585,"timestamp_updated":1596037585,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hpvQzfMCfM+imAI="}
