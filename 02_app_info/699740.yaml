      \ /><br>With two resources, Wood and Gold, the game takes inspiration from predecessors\
      \ within the genre and has a very high skill ceiling while still being easier\
      \ to get into than comparable competitive RTS games. <br><br>While staying true\
      \ to its roots, Bannermen takes the best elements from the genre and adds its\
      \ own unique flair to it. The nature of the game is competitive. Matches generally\
      \ last between 10-25 minutes, depending on playstyle. This fast format allows\
