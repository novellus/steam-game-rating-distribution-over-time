I'm currently making my first RPG game themed around pirates, so i thought this music pack would fit in perfectly.\n\nSet Sail is pretty good.\nI gotta say, Seaside Inn sounds really good out of everything that is in here.\nIsland Hideaway makes me want to think about a small island with a friendly tribe living on it.
