    about_the_game: 'The game that started the popular survival horror genre returns
      better than ever! Players control Edward Carnby, the main character from the
      original Alone in the Dark, on a thrilling journey through a dark and terrifying
      re-creation of New York''s Central Park where Carnby must discover the truth
      behind a dark conspiracy. <br><br>With inspiration from the presentation style
      of popular action TV dramas, Alone in the Dark will be split into a number of
      distinct episodes. With approximately 30-40 minutes of gameplay comprising each
      episode, the structure of Alone in the Dark pulls you into world that delivers
      a fiercely gripping and terrifying experience. Each time the player launches
      a saved game, the episode will begin with a video summary of the previous episode
      to quickly re-immerse the player in the story and removing the need to remember
      where they were or what they were doing. Every episode will close with a nail-biting
      cliff-hanger ending to rattle players'' nerves, and if the player is leaving
      the game a video teaser of the next episode will play to leave them wanting
      more. <br><br>Alone in the Dark will provide a complete next-generation, action
      packed experience within a highly detailed, free roaming environment, featuring
      a mixture of real-time physics and full environmental interaction. The game

      ficos do jogo na aba Display, meu jogo simplesmente crasha, sem problemas, fui\
      \ l\xE1 e resolvi o problema, se fosse s\xF3 isso estaria de boa, mas n\xE3\
      o, os controles s\xE3o horr\xEDveis, do mouse e teclado ao controle de Xbox,\
      \ lembro de jogar este jogo quando era pequeno e simplesmente ama-lo, hoje em\
      \ dia, digo que estou um pouco decepcionado com o jogo, pelo belo porte que\
      \ fizeram pro pc, uma pena um jogo t\xE3o daora ter um porte t\xE3o ruim."
