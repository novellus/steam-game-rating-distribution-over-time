Indeed my son and I are not disappointed, 10 hours and ongoing says everything. Hunting dinos in VR is definitely topping the 2D gaming from the past, tried the old game again and decided that's not working for us anymore.  However, the scenery is beautiful, love the jungle, the little alien like monsters jumping out of their eggs reminding me much on mini \"Aliens\", of course, and add great fun. Somehow one can't stop playing unless you die. Re-spawning is sometimes tricky, stand still don't move the headset or you easily hang in the glitch with no way out.  Graphics are great but my 1060 GTX has  a hard job to do. Not the games fault, just need to upgrade to a better card. That said, if you like great jungle landscape, dinos and aliens, sniper rifles and all kind of weapons which are getting better the more you play, then that's the game for you. Devs, you have created a fantastic scenery and game, only wished the day and night cycles would be a little longer, both look stunning though.","timestamp_created":1600186996,"timestamp_updated":1600186996,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0vqkyfQCf/2BogI="}
