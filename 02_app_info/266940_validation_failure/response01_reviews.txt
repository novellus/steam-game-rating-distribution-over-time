The game was developed by Alawar Entertainment and published by Viva Media.\n\nSince this is a platinum edition game, it comes with extra features that are not available to its' counterpart; the standard edition.\n\n[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]\n\nGame Visuals\n\nI want to mention that the visuals in the game are well done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGame Audio\n\nI want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are two different game difficulty modes to choose from: Casual and Expert.\n\nThe notebook keeps track of progression in the game. Such as story events and clues.\n\nThere is an interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly without having the need to constantly backtracking. It also indicates that there are a variety of tasks that can be completed at various locations within the game. The interactive map is automatically given at the start of the game.\n\nThere is no padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in place to make it stationary. The inventory panel does slide up whenever it is being moused over.\n\nThe hidden object scenes consist of the following: Traditional word lists. Some of these hidden object scenes may require a little or no interaction.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly challenging but they are solvable without having the need to skip any of them.\n\nThere are several different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need to be completed before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game only.\n\nSince this is a platinum edition game, there is a bonus chapter, but it can be accessed only after the main story is completed.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThere are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Soundtracks; Concept Art; Wallpapers and Game's Strategy Guide. Most of these extra features can be accessed only after the entire game is completed.\n\nThere are six different trading cards to collect. Only three of those trading cards are given out by the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the trading cards: Purchased from the Steam's Community Market; Trade with friends; Booster Packs and its Booster Pack Creator.\n\nFinal thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.","timestamp_created":1433417228,"timestamp_updated":1601576135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.512724578380584717","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lY3Y8vQCdrbePQ=="}
