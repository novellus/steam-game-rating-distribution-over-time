    review: This game was very hard and fun but it got to a point where you get on
      a ship and the screen just turns black you could hear game sounds and even get
      in the items menu. i dont know if i beat it and the credits just never roll
      or theres more to the game and its broken... i dont even know who to report
      the bugs to. but it was fun hope it gets fixed soo so i could continue playing.
