Bought it again, but on Steam.\nIt's a very good JRPG with some unique aspects: the fact that you awaken skills in battle at random is cool.\nSome of the achievements (namely, the one that requires you to beat the game in under ten hours) required for 100% are a bit crazy, but doable (unlike Octopath Travelers achievements..)\nGood OST, better than Dragon Quest XI S but not better than Final Fantasy or Octopath Traveler.\nDefinitely grab this!","timestamp_created":1609799592,"timestamp_updated":1609799592,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhI3i5/YCd/DDwAI="}
