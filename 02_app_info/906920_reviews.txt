It's pretty simple and, honestly, not worth money when you can get it for free pretty much everywhere. Also, the music gets annoying quickly.\nThe game claims to have 100 easy achievements, and even custom achievements. This is true, as you can idle for a while to get them all. However, you cannot showcase them on your profile yet, as the game's profile functions are restricted. So right now, all you can do is flex about having your own achievement in some random game or advertise yourself. Even if it wasn't restricted, as I stated above, achievements like this are not a selling point.\n\nWhat you get is a mediocre politics themed sliding puzzle and worthless achievements. Get that sliding puzzle somewhere else and put Trump on there. It's probably better. In fact, just print it and cut it into equally sized squares if you're desperate.","timestamp_created":1605585929,"timestamp_updated":1605586166,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj5SZ6vUCcqnwrgI="}
