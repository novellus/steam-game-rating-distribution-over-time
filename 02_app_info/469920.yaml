      in a moment. Develop your programming and hacking skills as you learn to exploit
      security flaws and protect your winnings.<br><br>Explore scripts created by

      Then, chart your own course through a multiplayer sandbox laden with risk and
      opportunity. Test real skills like cracking, coding, research and social engineering
      to thrive in a fully-scriptable, player-driven economy. Remember: wealth comes

    review: This game is hard and it makes you think. This means it's not for everyone,
      no offense. However, if you are up for a challenge or just want to poke around
      fun systems to learn what they do. Grab a copy and start interacting with the
      community. A basic grasp of JS would be nice before you get too far in and good
      luck, you'll likely need it.
