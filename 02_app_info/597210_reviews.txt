If you buy a small old-school point & click adventure by a first/one-off developer you sort of know what you are getting, and as far as I'm concerned it provides for precisely that. For a game this small nothing wrong with the voice acting either as some others are commenting. If you are an old-school point & click fan who enjoys short, easy, casual and firsts/one-offs,  and if you grab this at currently 50% or less, I'd say you'd get your money's worth.","timestamp_created":1599696997,"timestamp_updated":1599696997,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54495704174041748","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qOHXuvQCc63uoAI="}
