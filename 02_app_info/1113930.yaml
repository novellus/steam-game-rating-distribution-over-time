    review: "It's a indie survival horror game with obvious RE influences. \nThe one\
      \ thing it does different is that you upgrade your stats with money. \n[spoiler]\
      \ After you finish the default difficulty you are greeted with the old \"You\
      \ must finish this game on a harder setting to see the true ending.\" \nThere\
      \ is some grinding involved if you want to see this...which is just a different\
      \ dialog box following an extra monster fight. [/spoiler] It took me 5.5 hrs\
      \ to do this.  I had no desire to try to tackle the nightmare difficulty. Some\
      \ mobs were massive bullet sponges already. \n5 levels total, with one being\
      \ a wave/destroy all enemies stage. \nThe only bug was that after a death your\
      \ hands could/will change positions. This is solved by just going back to the\
      \ main menu.\n\nThe price was right and I had fun. If you can stomach some low\
      \ budget indie with your RE, then perhaps this is right up yer alley."
