    review: I was so excited when I heard this classic adventure game was coming to
      Steam and am so glad to finally get it. It is a classic from the early to mid
      nineties. You play a French detective trying to track down the Phantom of the
      Opera as he strikes again a century after he committed his infamous attack on
      the Paris Opera House. After some sleuthing and cluefinding, he knocks you out
      and sends you back in time to 1881! I think I played this as a kid, but barely
      got very far.
