    review: "Cubot is a game about moving blocks on a grid by pressing WSAD. You cannot\
      \ single out one block you want to move; they all move together. Different colored\
      \ blocks have different properties. The goal is to get all blocks to their corresponding\
      \ tile in as few moves as possible.\n\nI haven\u2019t completed the game yet\
      \ as of writing this; I\u2019m almost halfway through. I like how the game isn\u2019\
      t messing around when it talks about simplicity: the best solution to every\
      \ puzzle really is simple. It\u2019s too easy to overthink them, and it\u2019\
      s a lot of fun when I come back to a puzzle and see the key insight I was missing\
      \ for a while.\n\nI also like the calm music in the background. This is a happy,\
      \ relaxing game. :)\n\nI wish there was an undo button. It\u2019s kind of annoying\
      \ to have to reset the whole puzzle every time I make a mistake when I\u2019\
      m going for the minimum number of moves for a puzzle.\n\nI recommend this for\
      \ anyone who enjoys puzzle games or simply sitting down for a short while and\
      \ calmly thinking through a small conundrum. This is a casual puzzle game; so\
      \ far, it hasn\u2019t been that difficult."
