At times I really was enjoying it. The pacing isn't as good as the previous game (Hunt for the Puppeteer). The new features were interesting but in the end mostly pointless. The puzzles at times had moon logic, but that isn't a huge problem for me. I ran into some personal confusion with the set up of one of the end game puzzles. Even though I was able to figure it out eventually after looking up a video walkthrough, I was very annoyed. I ended up finishing the game and the ending is so boring. The culprit just monologues and then you win. No epilogue cutscene or explanation of what happens next. I think I got fire? Or I quit? I don't know. Nicole deserved a proper ending.","timestamp_created":1607308188,"timestamp_updated":1607376331,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j4zGn/YCctTxtwI="}
