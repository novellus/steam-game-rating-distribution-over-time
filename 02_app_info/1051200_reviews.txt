It was so funny I ended up playing and beating the game and never actually started VR-mode.  It's REALLY funny if you enjoy R&M Humor.  There is a lot of random, goofy conversation between enemies and you can tell that the people making this game were just screwing around the whole time- which I think makes it funnier.  If you are looking for a funny (but HIGHLY HIGHLY obscene) game or something to fill the void between R&M seasons- this could be your ticket.  Only took a few hours to beat the game and do the DLC but this would be a perfect game to come back to every so often to get some laughs.\n\nReminded me of how great it was to watch a R&M episode for the first time.","timestamp_created":1609990666,"timestamp_updated":1609990666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8f667fYCfYaXwQI="}
