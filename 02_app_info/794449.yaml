    short_description: In the depths of the canyon, a new match begins. But this time,
      the stakes are higher; it's Mars versus planet Earth in a contest of the species.
      With Squad 1 fragmented, one of Earth's best featherweights must take on the
      reigning champion of Mars, a colossally armored beast.
