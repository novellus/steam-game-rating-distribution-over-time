And this is brilliant that game's AI able to use weapon specs to get this advantage. The other thing I value much is when I tried to compare military assets with satellite imagery, I actually looked in Google maps and spend some time observing the cleanly noticeable over civillian structures, remains of former Red Banner Black Sea Soviet Fleet assets, noticing there was no hot or frozen war, but only 25 years passed to make them almost non-existent.\n\nI am not agree with the role of Russia in this scenario nor I see it is somehow truthworthy brief given nor I believe scenario is realistic in any point, but I pressing 'Recommend' to let people try it and to think about all that.","timestamp_created":1544795965,"timestamp_updated":1544812842,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":9,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552943527698516846","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwamB1+cCc+WktQE="}
