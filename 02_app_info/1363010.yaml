    about_the_game: Definitely Sneaky But Not Sneaky is a top-down action game with
      stealth and arcade elements. Small yet difficult levels combined with the ability
      to instantly retry a level creates a fast-paced experience.  In the end, it
      is your choice to be sneaky.. or not! The demo version includes the first 48
      levels of the classic mode!<h2 class="bb_tag">Action-Stealth gameplay</h2><br>Most
      levels allow you to approach them in different ways. You can either sneak into
      each situation and slowly take out your opponents, or you can run in and try
      to beat the level as quickly as possible.<h2 class="bb_tag">Controller support</h2><br>With
      both keyboard/mouse and controller support, you can play the game whichever
      way is more comfortable. May it be keyboard and mouse, a PS4 controller, or
      an XBOX controller, all you have to do it plug-and-play (..and go into the options
      menu)! However, it is <strong>important</strong> to note that the game will
      play better with a controller.<h2 class="bb_tag">Local multiplayer</h2><br>4-person
      local multiplayer is also supported with the ability for mixing different control
      types (one player on a keyboard, another on a PS4 controller, and a third on
      an XBox controller, etc.) in order to get as many people playing as possible.
      Use Steam's new <i>Remote Play</i> feature to play with other Steam users with
      just one copy of the game! Play the entirety of the game with some friends or
      play solo, it's up to you!
