There are many items in here that turn the game into super easy mode, but also some items that simply help with grinding without unbalancing the game.\n\nTo clarify, the game is perfectly doable at hardest difficulties without this DLC, even on the first play through, and while this DLC will make it much simpler, it is by no means required.\n\nFor helping with the grind, before beating the main game, I'd suggest double grade & gald and max item expansion. Double XP & skill booster, as well as the +HP/Levels will make the game feel less like a game and more like an interactive story which may be unwelcome to those who still wish a degree of challenge. \n\nDouble grade and gald just reduce the grind, rather than overpower you. Double XP theoretically ought to do the same, but you're unlikely to reduce battles to 50% like you'd think due to the various benefits of battle... thus, very quickly you'll out-level the pace of the game. \n\nAnd, just to for assistance of anyone reading, the less obvious items listed provide the following benefits.\n\n[b]Skill Booster[/b], literally just halves the requirements for artes which means you unlock things much sooner than you ought to. Again, in my opinion, overpowering you compared to the pace of the game; but again, fine if you are more concerned about story than any sort of minutely challenging gameplay or perhaps find world encounters monotonous. \n\n[b]Max Item Expansion[/b] Only increases the cap of consumables. I.e 30 life bottles instead of 15. Not materials or ingredients which cap at 99.\n\n[b]Growth Enhancement[/b] sets both give a selection of herbs that increase various stats Green provides the basic ones you can find (in very limited quantities) from the start of the game, and the red variant the upgraded versions you wouldn't normally find until mid-game.","timestamp_created":1609810595,"timestamp_updated":1609810595,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y4mM6PYCfePIwAI="}
