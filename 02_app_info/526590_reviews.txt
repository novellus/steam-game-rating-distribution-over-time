The boxing is sub-par, the opponents are bland and boring, hitboxes are terrible, which in a boxing game you need to have a good hitbox. Really everything in this game that you need to have good in order to be a playable boxing game, is not good. \n\nIf you liked this review [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33220185-VR-Games-and-Tools/]Click here[/url] and follow for more reviews of VR titles.
