      /><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>SUPPORTER'S EDITION IS INCLUDED</strong></h2><strong>NOTE:</strong>
      If you buy Geneshift now you'll get the Supporter's Edition DLC included for
      free. You don't need to buy them both. This is a special promotion to thank
      people who support the game during early access. The DLC includes a full singleplayer
      campaign and more.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>KEY FEATURES IN GENESHIFT</strong></h2><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Singleplayer Survival</strong><br>Fight against increasingly
      deadly enemies as you loot and level up your mutant powers. Complete missions,
      discover skill points, and strategically spend your cash on advanced weapons,
      perks and vehicles. With a mix of battle royale and roguelite mechanics, looting
      is essential, death is permanent, and you'll need to master your skills if you
      want to survive.<br></li><li><strong>Battle Royale Turbo (Multiplayer)</strong><br>The
      circle is shrinking - fast! Play in a series of turbo-fast, back to back rounds
      where each battle royale lasts only 3 minutes. No waiting around, just pure
      refined non-stop action. Grab your loot, hop into a car and floor it to the
      final showdown!<br></li><li><strong>Over 30 Tactical Skills</strong><br>Unlock
      special abilities like Invisibility, Bouncing Bullets, Fire Balls, and Teleportation.
      Create skill builds with crazy combos and counters, and grow your mutant stronger
      as you play.<br></li><li><strong>Insane Vehicle Action</strong><br>Ride with
      allies to do drive-by shootings, detonate car bombs, and fire homing missiles.<br></li><li><strong>Secret
      Base Building</strong><br>Place hidden chemicals to gain secret benefits, like
      selling weapons and spying on enemies.<br></li><li><strong>Singleplayer Bot
      Matches</strong><br>Play against intelligent, life-like bots on various difficulty
      levels. While playing offline you can still complete challenges, level up, unlock
      new items, and compete on leaderboards.<br></li><li><strong>Singleplayer Campaign
      (DLC Only)</strong><br>Save the world in the singleplayer campaign. You can
      play solo or with friends online (4 player co-op). Progress in the campaign
      is shared with progress in other modes.<br></li><li><strong>5 Bonus Multiplayer
      Game Modes</strong><br>Play Battle Royale, Capture the Flag, Team Deathmatch,
      Conquest, and Checkpoint Racing.<br></li><li><strong>Daily Leaderboards</strong><br>Compete
