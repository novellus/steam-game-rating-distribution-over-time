I am using a xbox-style gamepad controller, and it is working fine.\n\nSome technical issues running on ubuntu linux 16.04... \nI have no problem on an older computer with intel graphic drivers, but with a computer with a new AMD card and radeon mesa drivers, this is unplayable. For some strange reason, the platforms do not appear in the game levels. Another small thing is that the password keychain app came up when the game started. Not sure what was happening there.","timestamp_created":1530445644,"timestamp_updated":1530474704,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.610434651374816895","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyNXZq+QCetPspAE="}
