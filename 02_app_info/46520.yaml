      \ fun and enjoyable experience, as it takes the wastelands stories and mixes\
      \ them with a top view arcade shooter, creating a mixed bunch of fun times,\
      \ dull stories and never-ending objectives. You play as Angel, or more precisely\
      \ her truck Gypsy in the vast wastelands, defending civilians and taking on\
      \ multiple waves of bandits as they try to kidnap those civilians and kill you\
      \ at the same time. The story doesn't make much sense, as it starts off with\
      \ Angel looking for her ex boyfriend just so she can get a sense of direction\
      \ and once that is past you, you'll just move to the next location because apparently\
      \ that's where you're needed. \n\nThe main problem with the game's flow is that\
      \ it never changes its objective and direction; the game is undoubtedly fun\
      \ to play for the first 15 minutes, but after that you'll just realize that\
      \ the things you have to do and follow will never change: you will always fight\
      \ the same enemies, in the same looking wastelands while defending the same\
      \ cities in the same way you did in the previous level. There are the occasional\
      \ bonus levels and boss battles that will change things a bit for a minute or\
      \ two, but just as the normal levels, those require the same manoeuvre performed\
      \ a couple of times in a row, which really isn't hard to do once you figured\
      \ it out.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe first time you start playing Wasteland Angel\
      \ it will definitely seem like a fun experience, with promising upgrades, scores\
      \ to beat and waves of enemies that at a first glance would seem to keep you\
      \ busy for a long time, but shortly after that the first impression will be\
      \ shattered once you realize that the enemies will never change, your objective\
      \ stays the same no matter what and mechanics that sounded promising in the\
      \ beginning aren't even implemented properly. \n\nThe upgrade mechanic for instance\
      \ only works on your weapons, making them slightly more powerful, but not only\
      \ do they disappear once you move on to the next level, they sometimes make\
      \ things even worse as some upgrade stages will sometimes trigger a bug that\
      \ won't damage the incoming vehicles and techniques such as precise aiming and\
      \ the use of special weapons are left behind once you realize the best way to\
      \ deal with anything coming your way is to never let go of the right trigger.\
      \ Special weapons will probably end up being used only during the boss battles\
      \ where they are mandatory, but even so leaving some mines behind you just so\
      \ the giant tank following you will hit them isn't fun at all especially since\
      \ that's the only thing you'll have to do for the entire level.\n\n[b]Graphics[/b]\n\
      Wasteland Angel doesn't necessarily look bad, cause even if it does, the top\
      \ down camera will hide most of it, but the overall design decisions and repetitions\
      \ make it feel like a lazy attempt at a long lasting game that just isn't made\
      \ to be played for more than a couple of minutes. The enemies you'll face not\
      \ only act the same, but they look the same as well and the stages look way\
      \ too similar and not in the same wasteland themed kind of way. The visual effects\
      \ are anywhere from incredibly useless to completely missing, making the entire\
      \ stage truly feel like a wasteland even in the heat of the battle.\n\n[b]Audio[/b]\n\
      The sound effects are even worse than the visuals, sometimes missing and sometimes\
      \ so irritating that you'd wish those were missing too; on the soundtrack side,\
      \ it's pretty much the same track repeated over and over again with the bullets\
      \ that you shoot adding to the noise of it. Since there is nothing interesting\
      \ to hear around here and the story doesn't make sense enough to be worth hearing,\
      \ probably the best way to go with this one is to just leave your own music\
      \ playing in the background and mute everything inside the game.\n\n[b]Extras[/b]\n\
      It takes around 3 hours to complete the campaign, maybe add a couple more if\
      \ you're going for all the achievements since they are an easy grab if you replay\
      \ some stages, but after that there isn't anything else to do; maybe a Co-op\
      \ mode would've saved the repetitive gameplay and add a few more hours of value\
      \ to this, but there is none.\n\n[b]Verdict[/b]\nWasteland Angel is fun, for\
      \ 15 minutes, and it can take up to five hours more to finish if you want the\
      \ achievements, but as for anything else and especially anything enjoyable you\
      \ should probably look somewhere else, as Wasteland Angel has problems in way\
      \ too many areas to even list them all.\n\n[u]Rating: 3.4[/u]"
