The game can get a bit grindy but there is a great mix of lore, humor, and fun. The Quests will challenge you to complete difficult tasks, battles can seem completely unfair at times but the reward is well worth it once you can ssume your dragon form.","timestamp_created":1290192127,"timestamp_updated":1385943278,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm4Sq2MICcdyHCA=="}
