      class="bb_tag">Product History</h2><br>FRQ1: &quot;Haunted Halls of Eveningstar&quot;
      (1992), by Ed Greenwood, is the first Forgotten Realms Quest. It was published
      in May 1992.<br><br><strong>Origins (I): Library Dungeons.</strong> Ed Greenwood
      originally created the Haunted Halls of Eveningstar as a &quot;starter dungeon&quot;.
      It was used in seven different 13-session D&amp;D sessions that he ran at the
      Don Mills and Brookbanks branches of the North York Public Library, beginning
      in 1979. However, those adventures didn''t stay in Eveningstar; they later moved
      on to Cormyr and the Dales. Greenwood''s D&amp;D play was just one of the many
      teen programs run at the libraries, which also included popular options like
      babysitting training and good grooming.<br><br>The Knights of Myth Drannor were
      the most famous group to explore the Haunted Halls, starting in their second
      campaign. There they rooted out undercover agents in Eveningstar, fought against
      a Zhent agent named Whisper, and explored Whisper''s Crypt. They wandered though
      the Stonelands, traveled into Waymoot, Dhedluk, and King''s Forest, and finally
      journeyed on themselves, to the Dales and to Myth Drannor, which would give
      them their name.<br><br>Though Greenwood frequently returned to Eveningstar,
      the adventures weren''t just repeats of each other. What one adventuring party
      did could affect the dungeon dressings seen by the next group, as Greenwood
      restocked the dungeons over time.<br><br><strong>Origins (II):</strong> D&amp;D
      Adventures. Meanwhile, TSR was publishing a variety of standalone Realms adventures
      in the early ''90s. They began with the short-lived &quot;FA&quot; series of
      adventures (1990-1991) then temporarily moved over to the sub-setting of Maztica,
      which got its own trilogy of scenarios (1991-1992). Following the publication
      of the last, FMQ1: &quot;City of Gold&quot; (1992), TSR was ready to return
      to adventures set in the Heartlands.<br><br><strong>Origins (III):</strong>
      Module Plans. &quot;Haunted Halls of Eveningstar&quot; was originally pitched
      as a 128-page super-module, which would have allowed for a complete campaign
      starter -- matching what Greenwood had run in all those library sessions. It
      would have included soap-opera-like plots among the villagers of Eveningstar
      while also detailing the local temple of Lathander. There would have been a
      number of small dungeons including: the Caverns of the Claws, a troll lair in
      the cliff fissures east of Eveningstar; Whisper''s Crypt, under the Stonelands;
      and the Silent House hideaway. Finally, three full layers of the Haunted Halls
      would have been detailed, full of hacking, slashing, puzzling, andintrigue.
      Huge rosters of NPCs would have filled all these areas out. The goal was ultimately
      to involve the players in Cormyrean politics and to oppose them with the Zhentarim.
      Greenwood intended that players could spend six or seven years real-time in
      the village and environs.<br><br><strong>Origins (IV):</strong> Massive Cuts.
      Unfortunately, TSR decided to drop &quot;Haunted Halls of Eveningstar&quot;
      down to 32 pages, turning a massive campaign starter into a one-shot dungeon
      crawl. As a result, Greenwood had to massively cut back his plans. Still, he
      vigorously argued with TSR staff to ensure had as much space as he could eke
      out, even getting them to remove two pages of ads planned for the end of the
      module. <br><br>All that survives in the published &quot;Haunted Halls of Eveningstar&quot;
      is some basic information on the town and the first levels of the Haunted Halls
      dungeon. The additional levels and all the nearby mini-dungeons were cut, alongside
      most of the NPCs and monsters, including some of Greenwood''s unique undead,
      such as the Boneless and the Curst -- which had been the subject of Greenwood''s
      first Realms article, way back in The Dragon #30(October 1979). Greenwood also
      cut out dungeon locations that featured fading, flickering, ever-repeating spells
      that had lingered -- which were the true source of the name for the &quot;Haunted&quot;
      halls.<br><br><strong>Origins (V):</strong> Novelistic Returns. Though the lost
      levels of Eveningstar have never appeared in print, Greenwood has been able
      to return to the area in some of his novels. Crown of Fire(1994) spends some
      time in Eveningstar and details the Silent House while Swords of Eveningstar(2006)
      tells the story of the Knights of Myth Drannor''s beginnings, starting in Eveningstar.<br><br><strong>Adventure
