    review: 'Had this game as a kid in the 90s - while it may underwhelming today,
      the idea of having a fully 3D render of the Titanic that''s almost fully explorable
      (in the early age of dial-up internet) absolutely blew my mind as a kid (& this
      was during the hype of the James Cameron movie).

      If you''re a fan of classic point & click adventure games (like Myst) then I
      highly suggest playing this, but keep in mind it''s a PC game from the Windows
      95/98 era so it shows it''s age.


      If you want something more modern, I''d suggest looking a look at Titanic: Honor
      & Glory - a similar game in development that plans on making a *100% fully explore-able*
