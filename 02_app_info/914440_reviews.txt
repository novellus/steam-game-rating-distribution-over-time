This game is special! The premise is that you have a tech tree that allows you to mine resources and build stuff, and for some research you need unique materials that you can get by solving box-pushing puzzles that are scattered around the environment. This is all good fun except for wo things:\n1) The inventory is quite limited, and you can't discard unique resources. If you pick up puzzle rewards you don't yet need, you may find yourself unable to complete the research you need to progress (e.g. to un√∂lock a bigger inventory).\n2) The level is quite big and confusing, and you don't get a map until you've found and solved all the map pieces puzzles, which isn difficult because you have no map.\n\nApart from that, I thought the game was well made. It supports keyboard or digital gamepad as controls, and I found the world quite engaging. Some of the puzzles I've encountered are  difficult! (I've yet to find out if you can cheat by building on the playing field, but I suspect you can't.)\n\nIf puzzling and exploration are your thing, give this game a try -- it's not that big, but it's not that expensive, either!","timestamp_created":1602360819,"timestamp_updated":1602360819,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.639549553394317627","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ407eJivUCf62MpwI="}
