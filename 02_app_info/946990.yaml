      \ the Early Access version, you will take part in the Glorious Revolution in\

      \ and lose the level of influence already gained in this very country.<br><br>There\
      \ will be plenty of diplomatic, economic and military actions at your disposal.\
      \ Pay close attention to the domestic politics of each country. If the ruling\
      \ party\u2019s ideology is very different from the views of various classes\
      \ and estates, if tax levels are too high and public order too low, then expect\
      \ a revolution. Or maybe this is what you seek?<br><br>You cannot impose your\
      \ will on the rulers - your manipulations in the game are indirect. You do not\
      \ have the power to order a monarch to declare war on a neighboring country,\
      \ but you can plant your agents in the right places, provoke deterioration in\
      \ relations by indirect actions, arrange a border incident and bring the countries\
      \ to a military conflict.<br><br>We hope that you will spend many enjoyable\

    developer_response: 'Hi.


      Sorry to hear you''re experiencing issues with the game. We''ve been releasing
      regular updates and fixing issues as quickly as possible, but of course there''s
      always more to discover.


      It would really help if you could try to replicate the issue and send us an
      in-game bug report by pressing CTRL + F11. This will make it easier to identify
      what''s going wrong so we can implement a fix.


      Alternatively, you can send us your game logs directly. Here''s where you can
      find them:


      Windows:

      %userprofile%\AppData\LocalLow\GameTrek\Secret Government\

      Windows crash logs:

      %userprofile%/AppData/Local/Temp/GameTrek/Secret Government/Crashes

      Linux:

      ~/.config/unity3d/Gametrek/Secret\ Government/


      Simply put the logs in a zip file and e-mail them to info@secretgovernment.world


      Thank you for your patience and understanding.
