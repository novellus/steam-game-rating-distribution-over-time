    review: "If you enjoy sci-fi and Mid-evil times and say.. Why are they not intertwined\
      \ then this is for you.  The game is very strange to say the least but it was\
      \ compelling and i enjoyed the ride.  As far as these types of games go it was\
      \ not frustratingly difficult, but i'd put it slightly above the average but\
      \ don't let that scare you. The art was very nice, and the areas pleasant. \n\
      \nOver all thumbs up if your into hidden object adventures  and want to try\
      \ something unique."
