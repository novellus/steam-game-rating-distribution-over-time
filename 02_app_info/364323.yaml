    review: "I flew this exact plane before in real life.\n \nBut in this FSX DLC,\
      \ the power settings of the engine are inaccurate and not consistent as compared\
      \ to real life. If you set a specific engine RPM and manifold air pressure,\
      \ the engine of the DA40 should give you about the same performance, which is\
      \ definitely not the case here. And this thing climbs like a rocket, which is\
      \ also absolutely inaccurate.\n\nThe knobs and dials are horribly troublesome\
      \ to use, and are not animated. If you're adjusting the VHF frequencies and\
      \ you overshot by 0.25 hertz, guess what? You only can tune 1 way, so you gotta\
      \ tune all the way to max and back to your desired frequency again. Some of\
      \ the MFD displays are inaccurate with some information pages missing, which\
      \ should NOT be the case in the actual Garmin G1000 avionics. \n\nSome switches\
      \ in the cockpit are missing, such as the CABIN COOL and ALTERNATE AIR. The\
      \ circuit breakers are not implemented as well. The ELT switch is slightly different,\
      \ which should be the case on some models, but they did not include the ELT\
      \ indicator lights.\n\nSo overall, this DLC is quite simplified in terms of\
      \ the cockpit and flight mechanics. Not a passable representation of the real\
      \ DA40. But FSX is an old simulator, so I'll let some of it slide.\n\nI just\
      \ hope that they do not make this same mistake again in FS 2020, which I have\
      \ high hopes for. And if they do release another DA40 for FS 2020, I'll be scrutinising\
      \ it again,"
