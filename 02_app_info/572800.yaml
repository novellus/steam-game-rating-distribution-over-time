    about_the_game: "The time is pre World War II that looks like Europe in an imaginary\
      \ world. A large scale war erupts and bloody battles are taking place through\
      \ out the world. Eylstadt is a small country without a strong military force\
      \ or natural resources. Fin\xE9 who is the crown queen of Eylstadt decides to\
      \ use a secret weapon against larger countries which was unheard of at that\
      \ time to battle against larger countries. The secret weapon was using a witch\
      \ named Izetta and her magical force to fight the war. Izetta is young (same\
      \ age as Fin\xE9) and the last surviving witch with burning red hair. <br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nIzetta uses her enormous magical power to crash fighter planes and\
      \ blow up tanks. As Eylstadt starts to win battle by battle with Izetta, people\
      \ around the world start to call her &quot;Eylstadt\u2019s red witch&quot;.\
      \ However, there were reasons why witches were hidden through out the history.\
      \ Izetta\u2019s magic had a lot of dark secrets. Her forbidden power has opened\
      \ up the door of hope and destruction. This is a story of queen who wants to\
      \ save her country and young witch who fought for her best friend and people."
