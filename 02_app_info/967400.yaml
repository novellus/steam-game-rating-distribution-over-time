    review: This has become one of my favorite game soundtracks lately, which I think
      I keep repeating, but this is some high quality beats in my opinion. I'm not
      that picky with music, but then something has to stand out to grab my attention,
      and this soundtrack did just that. Highly recommended if you like pumping game
      music.
