There's a good amount of level variety, but the game really does feel best when played from 50~ yards out plinking heads. Later missions in tight spaces feel awkward, and the enemy placement gets a little extreme towards the final few levels. This game probably won't entertain you for 15 hours unless you're really into it, but I'm happy with my purchase. If H3VR's Take and Hold Mode is a little too close-quarters for you, buy this game.","timestamp_created":1588347254,"timestamp_updated":1588347254,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz/a36PECdu7ohAI="}
