    about_the_game: The Ford Focus RS Rally was introduced in late 2005, and was an
      immediate success taking its first win in Monte Carlo in 2006. In 2008 Jari-Matti
      Latvala became the youngest ever top level rally winner driving this car. This
      car was largely replaced by the smaller and more nimble Fiesta.
