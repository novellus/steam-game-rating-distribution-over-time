      \ /><br><br>This is an agonizing wintertime love song.<br>At Shoba Senior Middle\
      \ School in Shizuoka Prefecture, the stress and tension of preparing for Shoba\
      \ Senior Middle School entrance examinations affects those in their later teenage\
      \ years. <br>They might encounter a life of separation from each other. Some\
      \ of them may meet again, while others may never see other again. <br>Secrets\
      \ that are covered by rapidly falling snow are interwoven with a sorrowful rhythm.\
      \ <br><br><strong>Broken families,</strong><br><strong>Experiences of bullying,</strong><br><strong>Tears\
      \ concealed by smiles.</strong><br><br>Is the taste of first love sweet or bitter?\
      \ Who will be redeemed, and who will enter the abyss?<br>Attracted, estranged,\
      \ separated, hurt.<br><br><strong>Young men and women, three encounters, each\
      \ carries sorrowful secrets in the cold winter.</strong><br><br><strong>Embracing\
      \ each other and absorbing the earth\u2019s final, small bit of warmth.</strong><br><br>During\
      \ the last winter before Shoba Senior Middle School entrance examinations, Shoba\
      \ Senior Middle School welcomed a pretty transfer student named Miyazawa Moe.\
      \ <br>She was assigned to sit next to Fujiwara Hiro, and had a heavenly appearance\
      \ as well as an unapproachable air. She looked like an ice-cold snowflake and\
      \ indifferently floated into Fujiwara Hiro\u2019s heart. It seemed like a romantic\
      \ beginning.<br><br>Miyazawa Moe looked pretty and had outstanding grades, but\
      \ was very cold and detached. Her classmates did not welcome her, and did not\
      \ develop close relationships with her. However, her talent and beauty touched\
      \ Fujiwara Hiro, whose family had already been broken. Furthermore, she also\
      \ seemed to regard Fujiwara Hiro as someone unique. He couldn\u2019t help but\
      \ feel moved by Miyazawa Moe, but it was just that when he tried to get close\
      \ to her, he found that it was really too difficult to get close to this girl.\
      \ <br><br>At the same time, Fukihara Reika, a charming girl with a warmhearted\
      \ smile, also had a chance encounter with Fujiwara Hiro.         <br><br>She\
      \ was outgoing and magnanimous, had a warm personality, and was also a bit bizarre,\
      \ which gave Fujiwara Hiro a feeling he had never previously experienced. Fujiwara\
      \ Hiro was obviously attracted to Miyazawa Moe, while Fukihara Reika\u2019s\
      \ vitality and uninhibited personality as well as her enthusiasm may have caused\
      \ other people to see her as stubborn and unyielding. However, Fujiwara Hiro\
      \ thought that Fukihara Reika was just like an angel opening up her wings in\
      \ front of him. Fukihara Reika\u2019s warmth and radiance sparked enthusiasm\
      \ and hope within Fujiwara Hiro, who seemed to treat others with kindness, but\
      \ actually was afraid of interacting with others. Fukihara Reika was too enticing\
      \ for him. He couldn\u2019t hold himself back, and was fatally attracted to\
      \ her. <br><br><strong>On one side was the unapproachable ice-cold beauty, and\
      \ on the other was the unfathomable elfin girl.</strong><br><br><strong>His\
      \ heart drifted between these two girls and remained indecisive. </strong><br><br><strong>How\
      \ could he choose between them and make sure that it was the right decision?</strong><br><br><img\

      \ mature thinking, and was very sentimental.<br>Had good grades, was skilled\
      \ at drawing, and enjoyed reading. She was Fujiwara Hiro\u2019s classmate after\
      \ she transferred to the school.<br><br>Character Introduction:<br>People envied\
      \ her because she was perfect. She had been bullied, so she transferred to Shoba<br>Senior\
      \ Middle School. Due to problems she experienced, she was very determined and\
      \ did not like showing any signs of weakness. <br>She often scored highly on\
      \ her humanities exams and excelled in athletics. She performed well in all\
      \ aspects of her studies, but as she was too perfect, she was not skilled at\
      \ interacting with others and found it difficult to fit in. She also was consistently\
      \ misunderstood and excluded. <br>She was pretty and not very talkative, so\
      \ people viewed her as being very arrogant. She was bullied at Sanae Girls\u2019\
      \ School, so after taking a year off from school, she transferred to Shoba Senior\
      \ Middle School.      <br><br>Her parents worked in another city, and were very\
      \ proud of her due to her academic excellence and perfect appearance. However,\
      \ they did not pay enough attention to her, and even did not really understand\
      \ that she had to transfer to a new school due to bullying, as they thought\
      \ it was simply because she was unhealthy. <br>She considered seeking help from\
      \ her parents, but after she realized that they only wanted an outstanding daughter\
      \ who made them look good, she abandoned this idea. She dealt with loneliness\
      \ and exclusion by herself, and used an arrogant and determined exterior to\
      \ protect herself, at least until she met Fujiwara Hiro. <br><br>On multiple\
      \ occasions, she went walking alone, and later on, Fujiwara Hiro and Tenjin\
      \ Tatsuhiko took care of her. However, it was also because of this that even\
      \ more girls envied her.<br>She was very mature, and seemed cold and detached,\
      \ but was actually very tolerant. She also intelligently knew what her goals\
      \ were, and worked very hard because her goal was to gain admission to Tokyo\
      \ University. However, because she took herself and her life too seriously,\
      \ she seemed very cold and detached. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1185680/extras/\u5439\

      \ 84cm<br>Class: Year 2 Group C<br>Character Image: Black hair, often in a short\
      \ hairstyle. Liked using makeup, and could transform herself to reflect a variety\
      \ of styles. <br>Personality Characteristics: Extroverted, outgoing, not afraid,\
      \ and very daring. Gave people a very warm feeling, and was very sensible, but\
      \ hid behind a bizarre personality that was largely unknown to most people.\
      \ <br><br>Character Introduction:<br>She did not have a breathtakingly beautiful\
      \ appearance like that of Miyazawa Moe. However, she was self-confident, flamboyant,\
      \ vivacious, very approachable, and got along well with everyone. <br>As a child\
      \ from a reconstituted family, it is reasonable to say that she was a bit introverted.\
      \ However, Fukihara Reika seemed completely unlike someone who had experienced\
      \ sadness, and nobody else was even aware of this secret. She was very carefree\
      \ and liberated, acted boldly, and was slightly bizarre. She had close friendships\
      \ with a lot of boys, and many people protected her. <br>Fukihara Reika told\
      \ Fujiwara Hiro many times to abandon girls who did not understand how to cherish\
      \ him. However, she later found that the person he liked was her good friend\
      \ Miyazawa Moe, and she ended up being part of a painful struggle. Finally,\
      \ her heart chose Fujiwara Hiro. <br>As Fukihara Reika was well aware of Miyazawa\
      \ Moe\u2019s excellence and perfection, she did not hesitate to use her body\
      \ to remain by Fujiwara Hiro\u2019s side. She understood that this method was\
      \ a bit despicable, but but she didn\u2019t want to give up on Fujiwara Hiro\
      \ because she was too fond of his kindness. \u2018As I met you relatively late,\
      \ at least let me exist as someone who is the most unique in your life.\u2019\
      \ <br>Finally, after discovering that she had an improper relationship with\
      \ Fujiwara Hiro, she felt more painful and conflicted. At the same time, she\
      \ gradually revealed her previous pain. She cared deeply about her family\u2019\
      s opinions, and did things such as attending a cram school to make her mother\
      \ and stepfather feel happy and at ease. However, it was difficult for her to\
      \ involve herself deeply in her studies. She was impatient with her boring classes,\
      \ and wanted her freedom. <br>She was very smart, but regardless of her situation,\
      \ could not find a way to focus on her studies.<br>As her family was incomplete,\
      \ she felt a strong sense of attachment to them.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1185680/extras/\u5C0F\

      \ typically not a very good student, but actually was not as bad as she looked.<br><br>Character\
      \ Introduction: Liked to smoke, but the school prohibited smoking, so she could\
      \ only suck on a lollipop and pretend she was smoking. <br>She often caused\
      \ trouble and started fights because her grades were not very good, and the\
      \ dean of students often scolded her. Ozasa Megumi couldn\u2019t stand \u2018\
      good students\u2019 like Miyazawa Moe. After she found out about Miyazawa Moe\u2019\
      s relationship with Fujiwara Hiro, she put forth extra effort to slander and\
      \ humiliate her. <br>Ozasa Megumi had a good relationship with Naito Amane because\
      \ she didn\u2019t like that Miyazawa Moe\u2019s arrival made Naito Amane feel\

      \ Introduction:<br>Her appearance and grades were not particularly noteworthy,\
      \ and she seemed willful and talkative. However, on the inside, she was weak\
      \ and lacked self-confidence. Her family was not rich, and she was afraid of\
      \ being bullied, so she chose to ally herself with Ozasa Megumi and Nakiri Sayori\
      \ - precisely speaking, she was allying herself with Ozasa Megumi\u2019s strength\
      \ and Nakiri Sayori\u2019s popularity.<br>The first time she saw Fujiwara Hiro,\
      \ she really liked him. Each day, she unknowingly paid extra attention to him,\
      \ which caused her previously good grades to decline. <br><br>She felt very\
      \ inferior, and thought that Ozasa Megumi and Nakiri Sayori would also turn\
      \ their backs on her. As a result, she had to mend her relationship with Nakiri\
      \ Sayori.<br><br>Later on, while visiting someone at the hospital, she found\
      \ out that Miyazawa Moe and Fujiwara Hiro had a past with which nobody else\
      \ could intervene. She decided to abandon her desire for Fujiwara Hiro, and\
      \ gave up her love for him that was not meant to succeed. <br><br>Romantic Journey:<br>Liked\
      \ Fujiwara Hiro, so she envied and hated Miyazawa Moe. Later on, she found that\
      \ Fukihara Reika had also had a relationship with Fujiwara Hiro, but she did\
      \ not dare to bully her. This was because Fukihara Reika had good relationships\
      \ with all of the boys and had many friends.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1185680/extras/\u5948\

      \ 83cm<br>Class: Year 3 Group A<br>Character Image: This campus beauty was sweet\
      \ and cute, and had many supporters. <br>She was the leader of her group that\
      \ included Ozasa Megumi and Naito Amane, and was like a princess. She was the\
      \ class leader before Miyazawa Moe arrived. She ran in an election against Miyazawa\
      \ Moe, but the teacher preferred Miyazawa Moe because she had better grades.\
      \ However, Miyazawa Moe had no interest in being the class leader, and chose\
      \ to decline this position. This humiliated and embarrassed Nakiri Sayori. <br>Personality:\
      \ She knew very little about herself because of her overwhelming support. She\
      \ panicked when someone who was pretty and had good grades arrived at the school.\
      \ At the same time, because Miyazawa Moe\u2019s arrival made Tenjin Tatsuhiko\
      \ feel uncomfortable, Nakiri Sayori felt enmity towards Miyazawa Moe. However,\
      \ she never personally acted against Miyazawa Moe, but had Ozasa Megumi and\
      \ Naito Amane cause trouble for Miyazawa Moe on her behalf. <br><br>Character\
      \ Introduction: <br>She had a firm and magnanimous personality, was pretty and\
      \ had excellent grades. The entire school also chose her as their campus beauty,\
      \ and people at her school always supported her. <br><br>Romantic Journey:<br>Liked\
      \ Tenjin Tatsuhiko, but was never brave enough to express her feelings to him.\
      \ <br>When Miyazawa Moe arrived, she was vastly different from Nakiri Sayori.\
      \ This made Nakiri Sayori instantly recognize her self-identity, which was something\
      \ that she was unwilling to admit. Nakiri Sayori was devoted to being better\
      \ than Miyazawa Moe, but later had to accept the fact that Miyazawa Moe would\
      \ always be better than herself. <br><br><strong>Fujiwara Hiro</strong><br>CV:\

      \ Image: Short black hair, well-proportioned body. Melancholy when not laughing\

      \ been relatively low, he was very athletic.<br><br>This work\u2019s protagonist\
      \ and an ordinary student in Year 3 Group A at Shoba Senior Middle<br>School.\
      \ <br>His father used to have hope for Fujiwara Hiro\u2019s future, but he was\
      \ always unable to fulfill his father\u2019s expectations. When Fujiwara Hiro\
      \ was in primary school, he earned very good grades in his Culture class. However,\
      \ after his father had an affair, his parents started an intense argument, which\
      \ was when the young Fujiwara Hiro witnessed his parents\u2019 relationship\
      \ breaking apart. He discovered the ugly side of humanity, after which he found\
      \ it difficult to believe in emotions, and was also no longer dedicated to his\
      \ studies. <br>After his parents divorced, he lived with his mother, who influenced\
      \ him due to her resentment for his father. As a result, he was afraid of and\
      \ hated becoming someone like his father, and was also afraid of his mother\u2019\
      s hateful glare due to him disappointing her. Therefore, even if girls sent\
      \ him love letters, he never responded to them and was not skilled at building\
      \ relationships with other people. <br>He seemed like an optimistic person,\
      \ but was not diligent about anything, and actually felt that he was very inferior\
      \ to others. Due to his hesitation, he could not make decisions, and liked to\
      \ avoid responsibility. <br>His only true friend was Tenjin Tatsuhiko.<br>Fujiwara\
      \ Hiro was skilled at long-distance running, high jump, swimming, and shot put.\
      \ At his school\u2019s track meets, he easily broke school records in sprinting\
      \ events. He liked basketball, but because his mother hated it, he abandoned\
      \ his opportunity to play on the school\u2019s basketball team. Many girls liked\
      \ him, and every day, they sent him all kinds of love letters and snacks. He\
      \ was gentle and a meticulous thinker, and could also closely observe others\u2019\
      \ emotional changes as well as non-emotional changes. After observing others,\
      \ he adjusted his habits. In addition, he tried his best to not cause conflicts\
      \ with others, as he was afraid that arguing with them would cause him to recoil,\
      \ and also liked being someone who tried to never offend anyone. Although people\
      \ liked him, he actually was not good at dealing with girls. Emotionally, he\
      \ was a very conscientious and meticulous person. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1185680/extras/\u5929\

      \ /><br><br>This is an agonizing wintertime love song.<br>At Shoba Senior Middle\
      \ School in Shizuoka Prefecture, the stress and tension of preparing for Shoba\
      \ Senior Middle School entrance examinations affects those in their later teenage\
      \ years. <br>They might encounter a life of separation from each other. Some\
      \ of them may meet again, while others may never see other again. <br>Secrets\
      \ that are covered by rapidly falling snow are interwoven with a sorrowful rhythm.\
      \ <br><br><strong>Broken families,</strong><br><strong>Experiences of bullying,</strong><br><strong>Tears\
      \ concealed by smiles.</strong><br><br>Is the taste of first love sweet or bitter?\
      \ Who will be redeemed, and who will enter the abyss?<br>Attracted, estranged,\
      \ separated, hurt.<br><br><strong>Young men and women, three encounters, each\
      \ carries sorrowful secrets in the cold winter.</strong><br><br><strong>Embracing\
      \ each other and absorbing the earth\u2019s final, small bit of warmth.</strong><br><br>During\
      \ the last winter before Shoba Senior Middle School entrance examinations, Shoba\
      \ Senior Middle School welcomed a pretty transfer student named Miyazawa Moe.\
      \ <br>She was assigned to sit next to Fujiwara Hiro, and had a heavenly appearance\
      \ as well as an unapproachable air. She looked like an ice-cold snowflake and\
      \ indifferently floated into Fujiwara Hiro\u2019s heart. It seemed like a romantic\
      \ beginning.<br><br>Miyazawa Moe looked pretty and had outstanding grades, but\
      \ was very cold and detached. Her classmates did not welcome her, and did not\
      \ develop close relationships with her. However, her talent and beauty touched\
      \ Fujiwara Hiro, whose family had already been broken. Furthermore, she also\
      \ seemed to regard Fujiwara Hiro as someone unique. He couldn\u2019t help but\
      \ feel moved by Miyazawa Moe, but it was just that when he tried to get close\
      \ to her, he found that it was really too difficult to get close to this girl.\
      \ <br><br>At the same time, Fukihara Reika, a charming girl with a warmhearted\
      \ smile, also had a chance encounter with Fujiwara Hiro.         <br><br>She\
      \ was outgoing and magnanimous, had a warm personality, and was also a bit bizarre,\
      \ which gave Fujiwara Hiro a feeling he had never previously experienced. Fujiwara\
      \ Hiro was obviously attracted to Miyazawa Moe, while Fukihara Reika\u2019s\
      \ vitality and uninhibited personality as well as her enthusiasm may have caused\
      \ other people to see her as stubborn and unyielding. However, Fujiwara Hiro\
      \ thought that Fukihara Reika was just like an angel opening up her wings in\
      \ front of him. Fukihara Reika\u2019s warmth and radiance sparked enthusiasm\
      \ and hope within Fujiwara Hiro, who seemed to treat others with kindness, but\
      \ actually was afraid of interacting with others. Fukihara Reika was too enticing\
      \ for him. He couldn\u2019t hold himself back, and was fatally attracted to\
      \ her. <br><br><strong>On one side was the unapproachable ice-cold beauty, and\
      \ on the other was the unfathomable elfin girl.</strong><br><br><strong>His\
      \ heart drifted between these two girls and remained indecisive. </strong><br><br><strong>How\
      \ could he choose between them and make sure that it was the right decision?</strong><br><br><img\

      \ mature thinking, and was very sentimental.<br>Had good grades, was skilled\
      \ at drawing, and enjoyed reading. She was Fujiwara Hiro\u2019s classmate after\
      \ she transferred to the school.<br><br>Character Introduction:<br>People envied\
      \ her because she was perfect. She had been bullied, so she transferred to Shoba<br>Senior\
      \ Middle School. Due to problems she experienced, she was very determined and\
      \ did not like showing any signs of weakness. <br>She often scored highly on\
      \ her humanities exams and excelled in athletics. She performed well in all\
      \ aspects of her studies, but as she was too perfect, she was not skilled at\
      \ interacting with others and found it difficult to fit in. She also was consistently\
      \ misunderstood and excluded. <br>She was pretty and not very talkative, so\
      \ people viewed her as being very arrogant. She was bullied at Sanae Girls\u2019\
      \ School, so after taking a year off from school, she transferred to Shoba Senior\
      \ Middle School.      <br><br>Her parents worked in another city, and were very\
      \ proud of her due to her academic excellence and perfect appearance. However,\
      \ they did not pay enough attention to her, and even did not really understand\
      \ that she had to transfer to a new school due to bullying, as they thought\
      \ it was simply because she was unhealthy. <br>She considered seeking help from\
      \ her parents, but after she realized that they only wanted an outstanding daughter\
      \ who made them look good, she abandoned this idea. She dealt with loneliness\
      \ and exclusion by herself, and used an arrogant and determined exterior to\
      \ protect herself, at least until she met Fujiwara Hiro. <br><br>On multiple\
      \ occasions, she went walking alone, and later on, Fujiwara Hiro and Tenjin\
      \ Tatsuhiko took care of her. However, it was also because of this that even\
      \ more girls envied her.<br>She was very mature, and seemed cold and detached,\
      \ but was actually very tolerant. She also intelligently knew what her goals\
      \ were, and worked very hard because her goal was to gain admission to Tokyo\
      \ University. However, because she took herself and her life too seriously,\
      \ she seemed very cold and detached. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1185680/extras/\u5439\

      \ 84cm<br>Class: Year 2 Group C<br>Character Image: Black hair, often in a short\
      \ hairstyle. Liked using makeup, and could transform herself to reflect a variety\
      \ of styles. <br>Personality Characteristics: Extroverted, outgoing, not afraid,\
      \ and very daring. Gave people a very warm feeling, and was very sensible, but\
      \ hid behind a bizarre personality that was largely unknown to most people.\
      \ <br><br>Character Introduction:<br>She did not have a breathtakingly beautiful\
      \ appearance like that of Miyazawa Moe. However, she was self-confident, flamboyant,\
      \ vivacious, very approachable, and got along well with everyone. <br>As a child\
      \ from a reconstituted family, it is reasonable to say that she was a bit introverted.\
      \ However, Fukihara Reika seemed completely unlike someone who had experienced\
      \ sadness, and nobody else was even aware of this secret. She was very carefree\
      \ and liberated, acted boldly, and was slightly bizarre. She had close friendships\
      \ with a lot of boys, and many people protected her. <br>Fukihara Reika told\
      \ Fujiwara Hiro many times to abandon girls who did not understand how to cherish\
      \ him. However, she later found that the person he liked was her good friend\
      \ Miyazawa Moe, and she ended up being part of a painful struggle. Finally,\
      \ her heart chose Fujiwara Hiro. <br>As Fukihara Reika was well aware of Miyazawa\
      \ Moe\u2019s excellence and perfection, she did not hesitate to use her body\
      \ to remain by Fujiwara Hiro\u2019s side. She understood that this method was\
      \ a bit despicable, but but she didn\u2019t want to give up on Fujiwara Hiro\
      \ because she was too fond of his kindness. \u2018As I met you relatively late,\
      \ at least let me exist as someone who is the most unique in your life.\u2019\
      \ <br>Finally, after discovering that she had an improper relationship with\
      \ Fujiwara Hiro, she felt more painful and conflicted. At the same time, she\
      \ gradually revealed her previous pain. She cared deeply about her family\u2019\
      s opinions, and did things such as attending a cram school to make her mother\
      \ and stepfather feel happy and at ease. However, it was difficult for her to\
      \ involve herself deeply in her studies. She was impatient with her boring classes,\
      \ and wanted her freedom. <br>She was very smart, but regardless of her situation,\
      \ could not find a way to focus on her studies.<br>As her family was incomplete,\
      \ she felt a strong sense of attachment to them.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1185680/extras/\u5C0F\

      \ and a bit impulsive. Very loyal to Naito Amane and Nakiri Sayori, and was\
      \ typically not a very good student, but actually was not as bad as she looked.<br><br>Character\
      \ Introduction: Liked to smoke, but the school prohibited smoking, so she could\
      \ only suck on a lollipop and pretend she was smoking. <br>She often caused\
      \ trouble and started fights because her grades were not very good, and the\
      \ dean of students often scolded her. Ozasa Megumi couldn\u2019t stand \u2018\
      good students\u2019 like Miyazawa Moe. After she found out about Miyazawa Moe\u2019\
      s relationship with Fujiwara Hiro, she put forth extra effort to slander and\
      \ humiliate her. <br>Ozasa Megumi had a good relationship with Naito Amane because\

      \ Introduction:<br>Her appearance and grades were not particularly noteworthy,\
      \ and she seemed willful and talkative. However, on the inside, she was weak\
      \ and lacked self-confidence. Her family was not rich, and she was afraid of\
      \ being bullied, so she chose to ally herself with Ozasa Megumi and Nakiri Sayori\
      \ - precisely speaking, she was allying herself with Ozasa Megumi\u2019s strength\
      \ and Nakiri Sayori\u2019s popularity.<br>The first time she saw Fujiwara Hiro,\
      \ she really liked him. Each day, she unknowingly paid extra attention to him,\
      \ which caused her previously good grades to decline. <br><br>She felt very\
      \ inferior, and thought that Ozasa Megumi and Nakiri Sayori would also turn\
      \ their backs on her. As a result, she had to mend her relationship with Nakiri\
      \ Sayori.<br><br>Later on, while visiting someone at the hospital, she found\
      \ out that Miyazawa Moe and Fujiwara Hiro had a past with which nobody else\
      \ could intervene. She decided to abandon her desire for Fujiwara Hiro, and\
      \ gave up her love for him that was not meant to succeed. <br><br>Romantic Journey:<br>Liked\
      \ Fujiwara Hiro, so she envied and hated Miyazawa Moe. Later on, she found that\
      \ Fukihara Reika had also had a relationship with Fujiwara Hiro, but she did\
      \ not dare to bully her. This was because Fukihara Reika had good relationships\
      \ with all of the boys and had many friends.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1185680/extras/\u5948\

      \ panicked when someone who was pretty and had good grades arrived at the school.\
      \ At the same time, because Miyazawa Moe\u2019s arrival made Tenjin Tatsuhiko\
      \ feel uncomfortable, Nakiri Sayori felt enmity towards Miyazawa Moe. However,\
      \ she never personally acted against Miyazawa Moe, but had Ozasa Megumi and\
      \ Naito Amane cause trouble for Miyazawa Moe on her behalf. <br><br>Character\
      \ Introduction: <br>She had a firm and magnanimous personality, was pretty and\
      \ had excellent grades. The entire school also chose her as their campus beauty,\
      \ and people at her school always supported her. <br><br>Romantic Journey:<br>Liked\
      \ Tenjin Tatsuhiko, but was never brave enough to express her feelings to him.\
      \ <br>When Miyazawa Moe arrived, she was vastly different from Nakiri Sayori.\
      \ This made Nakiri Sayori instantly recognize her self-identity, which was something\
      \ that she was unwilling to admit. Nakiri Sayori was devoted to being better\
      \ than Miyazawa Moe, but later had to accept the fact that Miyazawa Moe would\
      \ always be better than herself. <br><br><strong>Fujiwara Hiro</strong><br>CV:\

      \ Image: Short black hair, well-proportioned body. Melancholy when not laughing\

      \ and an ordinary student in Year 3 Group A at Shoba Senior Middle<br>School.\
      \ <br>His father used to have hope for Fujiwara Hiro\u2019s future, but he was\
      \ always unable to fulfill his father\u2019s expectations. When Fujiwara Hiro\
      \ was in primary school, he earned very good grades in his Culture class. However,\
      \ after his father had an affair, his parents started an intense argument, which\
      \ was when the young Fujiwara Hiro witnessed his parents\u2019 relationship\
      \ breaking apart. He discovered the ugly side of humanity, after which he found\
      \ it difficult to believe in emotions, and was also no longer dedicated to his\
      \ studies. <br>After his parents divorced, he lived with his mother, who influenced\
      \ him due to her resentment for his father. As a result, he was afraid of and\
      \ hated becoming someone like his father, and was also afraid of his mother\u2019\
      s hateful glare due to him disappointing her. Therefore, even if girls sent\
      \ him love letters, he never responded to them and was not skilled at building\
      \ relationships with other people. <br>He seemed like an optimistic person,\
      \ but was not diligent about anything, and actually felt that he was very inferior\
      \ to others. Due to his hesitation, he could not make decisions, and liked to\
      \ avoid responsibility. <br>His only true friend was Tenjin Tatsuhiko.<br>Fujiwara\
      \ Hiro was skilled at long-distance running, high jump, swimming, and shot put.\
      \ At his school\u2019s track meets, he easily broke school records in sprinting\
      \ events. He liked basketball, but because his mother hated it, he abandoned\
      \ his opportunity to play on the school\u2019s basketball team. Many girls liked\
      \ him, and every day, they sent him all kinds of love letters and snacks. He\
      \ was gentle and a meticulous thinker, and could also closely observe others\u2019\
      \ emotional changes as well as non-emotional changes. After observing others,\
      \ he adjusted his habits. In addition, he tried his best to not cause conflicts\
      \ with others, as he was afraid that arguing with them would cause him to recoil,\
      \ and also liked being someone who tried to never offend anyone. Although people\
      \ liked him, he actually was not good at dealing with girls. Emotionally, he\
      \ was a very conscientious and meticulous person. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1185680/extras/\u5929\
