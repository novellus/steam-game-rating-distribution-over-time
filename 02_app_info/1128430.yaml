    review: "This is a valentine themed, Solitaire game where you need to match 2\
      \ of the same cards together.\n\nThere are 2 difficulty settings which are newbie\
      \ and professional mode.\nThe only difference between the two is that you can\
      \ replay every level in newbie mode, and with the professional mode you'll have\
      \ to replay the entire chapter.\nEach completed level rewards you with hearts\
      \ and you'll need a specific amount to unlock the next chapter.\n\nIn each level\
      \ you'll start with a pile of cards, and your goal is to collect the special\
      \ cards which give you the hearts.\nYou also find coin cards, and with coins\
      \ you can buy special abilities like: removing 1 card, shuffle your cards or\
      \ undo your last action.\nOnce you've collected all your special cards you completed\
      \ the level, so unlike the normal solitaire you don't have to clear all cards.\n\
      At times that did feel a bit unsatisfying.\n\nYou can customize the cards to\
      \ your own liking with 3 themed decks and 10 different card backs available.\n\
      The game looks super cute, and the colors used go easy on the eyes.\nI also\
      \ enjoyed the dreamy, soothing music, which was  very fitting to the game.\n\
      \nIn all honesty, I didn't think the game would be this addictive!\nBut with\
      \ every completed level I'm thinking \u201CJust one more...\u201D"
