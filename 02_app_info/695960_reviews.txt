It continues from where Awakening: Moonfell Wood left off with Sophia on her way to the Goblin Kingdom.\n\nAs usual, the artwork is lovely with well done, beautiful backdrops. The music is relaxing and complements the gameplay without getting in your way. The gameplay is the standard point-and-click hidden object puzzles with other various types mixed in and keeps things mostly interesting without being too frustrating or difficult. There are some puzzles that are irksome due to the mechanics, but overall, they're fairly fun to play.\n\nStory-wise, it's mostly generic high fantasy characters, creatures, and magics, although this game finally reveals the series' main villains.\n\nI've enjoyed this series a good amount, however, this game was painful to play due to the technical issues. On my system, there was constant stuttering and lag for all of the 2D animations. The very few 3D animations, which were mainly relegated to the swaying banners in a few scenes, were fine. Transitions from one scene to another, moving objects, picking up items, etc. were all choppy, stuttering, and quite slow. Despite following tips found on the Boom Zap forums and attempting to adjust compatibility options, I wasn't able to resolve this issue.\n\nThe game was frustratingly playable, however, and I was able to slog through it and complete the main story and the bonus chapter.\n\nOverall, I cautiously recommend this game as it's part of the main Awakening series' story and it's a relaxing hidden object game at its core. However, if you do decide to purchase it, I recommend running it right away to see if the stuttering/lag issues occur so you can make the decision to keep or return it.","timestamp_created":1607742302,"timestamp_updated":1607742302,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw85S6qvYCeKOpuQI="}
