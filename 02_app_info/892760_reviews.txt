So starting off with usual targets, visual goes first.\nThere's a few names that comes to mind vivid, striking, profound, and stylish.\nWhat on offer is clear cut and has little fluff and keeps things on point.  To enhance the experience get the patch. It's available on the publisher website. Next  it's all royalty free stuff but besides that what used does so to effect .\nNext gameflow topping this off at the start is investigating before you get started with any area this is what you will be doing.  Following that is expedition  which lead to  exploration  that blends in to combat or evasion and rinse and repeat. Be warned as expedition should be carefully decided on as there's little hand holding and exploration can often lead to long-term engagement with multiple bosses if you choose to not end a expedition  prepare accordingly.  Combat  without the patch is classic  turn based affairs with crush item mechanisms to mix up tedium. Changes drastically with the patch applied as new mechanics are featured that alter the experience greatly a small example is with the character herself Anna  as actions  experienced in combat will affect her for the rest of the game and alter whole entire sequences that occur later. I will not go any more than this into combat as discussion father than this will lead to spoiler territory but know what happens when in combat affect a lot of what happens in game when the patch is applied.  So now for a overview of the story you are anna a battle nun struggling with the past while trying to atone with a personal grevious and complete a mission task  as things goe from worse to horrible. I'm not gonna say no more than this regarding the story I don't rate guys so I will leave you with this for the price of admission I recommend playing this as it's enjoyable and with the patch applied there's no censorship at all you can see everything that happens to this I assume female Christian nun and the corruption that follows that is  cool as I enjoy my perspective uncensored and raw.  Without the patch you get a cool jesus loving adventure about anna and her love for god  so check out Seed of evil also tell me if I suck at reviews and punish me in my comments section  hit that like  subscribe for and share the review make memes and all the cool stuff  I forgot how much this cost so check out the store page.","timestamp_created":1609892289,"timestamp_updated":1609892289,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ntvD6vYCepruwAI="}
