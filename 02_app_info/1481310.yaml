    short_description: A team-based Indie platformer involving traversing multiple
      realities to explore and defeat bosses and enemies from all corners of the multiverse!
      From the hemoglobins of the inside out (definitely not a reference to anything),
      all the way to the end where you must face the one pulling the strings.
