    review: 'This game is a simplistic puzzle-like real time strategy. I''m not sure
      how anyone could think that adding literal 50/50 random mechanics to it is a
      good idea. Most of the new campaign is so easy that it''s irrelevant, but the
      last few levels are literally decided by random outcomes.

      Also the new sprites, and especially the main campaign map are far less readable,
      which is a pretty important point for a 1-bit game.

      Too bad - there are some good mechanics, like the spikes, and some of the levels
      are finally sufficiently difficult, but they are ruined by pointless randomness.'
