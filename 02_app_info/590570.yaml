    review: I looked forward to the game because it seemed rather unique to me. However,
      I had lots of troubles acually getting the game to function. First only the
      menu music would play, and then it closed itself whenever the main menu showed
      up. (I then asked for and recieved a refund.) I believe that the concept of
      this game has at least a little potential, if not more, but as it is now it
      has some troubling bugs that make the game unplayable.
