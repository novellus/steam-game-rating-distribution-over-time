    review: "It's really a shame the dev abandoned this title as it could have been\
      \ something. The art style might not be the hyper realism some people are looking\
      \ for, but it is genuinely pretty in some places. The exploration part, for\
      \ example, leads to areas with all sorts of nooks and crannies to explore, dolphins\
      \ to swim with, etc. \n\nI was just sort of mesmerized as the dolphins go through\
      \ different behaviors, including diving, surface feeding, corkscrews through\
      \ the water, etc. Even their calls change. It has a ton of potential that was\
      \ sadly never realized and I agree, the controls are clunky and broken.\n\n\
      You can only move forward or twist your hand in an strange way to go backward\
      \ or to the side, but you can't turn. Sometimes it felt like I was fighting\
      \ the Rift controllers. Others I was flying through the water. I'll still give\
      \ it a thumbs up as the statues let you explore even when the broken climbing\
      \ and jumping mechanic don't. \n\nAlso, swimming with dolphins and blue whales.\
      \ It's just a shame it was never completed."
