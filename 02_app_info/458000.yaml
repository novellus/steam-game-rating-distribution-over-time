    review: "\u2620[u][b]The Game[/b][/u]:\nI really like pixeled graphics, and choices,\
      \ so i decided give it a try. But what I find it\xB4s not really what i expected.\
      \ But despite that, maybe some people could have fun with the game, but not\
      \ had been mine case here.\nI also did a search to see some gameplay of it,\
      \ around youtube, and appear there's not much options for endings, something\
      \ that cripples the decision feature in my opinion.\n\n\u2620[u][b]Could had\
      \ been Better[/b][/u]:\n[b]1-[/b] The combat mechanics works based on something\
      \ i would describe as a mix of excessive micromanagement and RNG stats. Or in\
      \ other words, a lack of a better combat system i think, with the presence of\
      \ unnecessary management in the fights, results in most of the time you getting\
      \ infected or dying by zombies, even in a frenzy for make everything for the\
      \ characters, and that is a lot awful.\n[b]2-[/b] Lack of Lore into the History\
      \ of the game. Most of the characters dont receive a deep development, aside\
      \ protagonist who receive a bit, the rest appear its there just to fill space.\
      \ We also dont know much about what is around, just that is the zombie apocalypse.\n\
      \n\u2620[u][b]Conclusion[/b][/u]:\nI get tired of the game, a little fast when\
      \ playing i think, but i tried continue ahead for some more time at the hope\
      \ of the experience get better, but unfortunatelly my feeling about the game,\
      \ dont changed, so i decide ask for a refund. I also think is due my taste,\
      \ who is for games/content with more depth, like the They are Billions, Dead\
      \ Age, Dead State, etc. for examples, so if you share that same vision, i advise\
      \ look for another title, that one is for a more superficial taste."
