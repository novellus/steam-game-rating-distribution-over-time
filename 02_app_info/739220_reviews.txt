Regardless of character, the storyline is mostly the same.\n\nEdit: Clarity and grammar.","timestamp_created":1595643167,"timestamp_updated":1605714007,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4veqA7vUCceawlwI="}
