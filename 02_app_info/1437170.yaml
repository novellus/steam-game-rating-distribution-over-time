    review: I don't often use Steam as I don't have a lot of time, but I was brought
      up playing text adventures in the 1980's and this caught my eye, especially
      the fact that it comes with an original ZX Spectrum game. I'm not that far in,
      but so far the game is excellent fun, with challenging puzzles and a good sense
      of humor. The parser is strong, but it's really worth reading the manual for
      hints to get the best out of it.
