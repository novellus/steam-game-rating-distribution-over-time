I only skipped the binocle 'puzzle' because i found it uninteresting..\nThe story is rich, and has many plot twists. And that ending... wtf.. what a twist, then it made me sad, then it made be disappointed, then i cringed.\nHighly recommend to point-and-click lovers","timestamp_created":1609853050,"timestamp_updated":1609853050,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyYOu6fYCdKLZwAI="}
