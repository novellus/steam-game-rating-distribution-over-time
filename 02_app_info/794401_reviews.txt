The random nature of the possible advisors would be fine, except you have to have all 3 advisors match to the same president. That breaks the system and creates the very common situation of being forced into picking the president. There is only a choice at the start of the game, otherwise you will be forced into picking the one canidate that you have three advisors for. The worst case is when the only president with 3 advisors is the old one so you are forced to eat a stagnant government. Hopefully it was reagan or gorbachev so that you can fix the global consequence lost.\n\nThe worst part is that I am unsure if the AI actually needs to play by the politics rules. The issues with this system could be easily fixed by only needing a majority of advisors to support a canidate. The current system has little basis in real life and does not allow any player choice.","timestamp_created":1594830386,"timestamp_updated":1594830386,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtY7TqfMCdPG9lQI="}
