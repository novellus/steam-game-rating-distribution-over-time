Customize your Orb champion with gear from all over the galaxy, and paint it to fit your personal style. Share awesome plays with your friends and the world.<br><br><strong>NONLETHAL AGGRESSION<\/strong><br>There are no weapons in the sport of Orb, so players have to use physics and momentum to their advantage. With boost armor, players can ram into enemies, and with a precision strike can knock out and disable them for a short time.<br><br><strong>MAKE FRIENDS<\/strong><br>Cooperation is key as the slightest bump while carrying the ball will knock it out of your propulsion mitt. Players need to pay attention to where both enemies and teammates are and be prepared to fire off a quick pass, or quickly jump into the ball’s path for a clutch interception.<br><br><strong>SPEED IS KING<\/strong><br>Players use their boost armor alongside hover boots to jet around the arena at breakneck speed, getting from one end to the other in no time flat. Maneuverability is hindered while hovering, so players have to watch out for defenders in their way, and maybe save a little energy for that last second juke.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game Features<\/h2><br><br><strong>EXTENSIVE CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION<\/strong><br>Players can choose from wildly varying terrestrial and alien races, collect and equip various models of regulation boost armor, helmets, propulsion mitts, and hover boots, and choose from millions of color combinations to form their Orb champion. Equipment is purely cosmetic and has absolutely no effect on gameplay, unless you can’t take your eyes off of these designer boots as I scoot on past you to score.<br><br><strong>MATCHMAKING AND DEDICATED SERVERS<\/strong><br>For that quickplay experience, queue up in ranked and casual matchmaking pools that will pit you against players of a similar skill level. If you’re the type that likes to form a community around a server, browse the in-game server list and find one to your liking, or rent\/host your own private dedicated server that only you and your friends or gaming community can join. Orb Rivals will also support LAN play for those good old fashioned in-person Dorito-thons.<br><br><strong>SKILLED AI<\/strong><br>Odd number of players in your group? No problem, jump into a local match with bots that can hold their own against skilled players. New players can use it as a safe space to practice and improve before facing off against real opponents. No artificial intelligence can compare to professional players, however, so don’t expect ol' Julian Edelbot to pull off a miracle catch when you throw it 600 feet over his head, because he can only jump so high.<br><br><strong>CINEMATIC REPLAY SYSTEM<\/strong><br>Pull off an epic play during that last match? Every game is recorded, and you can play it back with the in-game replay system. Even better, you can control the camera, set up animated camera transitions, control depth-of-field, time dilation, and more, and then export that perfect video or GIF to share with Twitter, Facebook, Twitch, Instagram, Reddit, Snapchat, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and probably even your next door neighbor because holy crap did you see that catch?","about_the_game":"<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sci-fi football and jet-powered hockey collide in the intergalactic sport of Orb.<\/h2><br><br>Play online with friends and enemies alike, or offline with bots on teams of up to 6.
