    review: 'This game is a masterpiece! This whole story builds the foundation of
      yourself and how you become a villain. Your special super power is awesome and
      I absolutely love the inclusion of another main character you control, its such
      an awesome perspective and I am in love with this whole idea.


      Building up your character and learning about your past, forming rivalries,
      seeing every ones reaction to your choices as you sit in the sidelines maniacally
      laughing to yourself is so sweet and addicting. The romance is very solid, there
      is was so much emotional conflict. You truly shape the story how you want, you
      wont feel like something is going completely out of your control as your choices
      help keep the story in the line you want, its perfect.


      The whole game was very lengthy in an amazing way, i was entirely hooked and
      never felt that things were going too slow or too fast. The ending was also
      great, it did not feel like a cliffhanger and I felt like this was a proper
      ending to this first part of the story. I have no regrets on my choices and
      I am extremely excited to try the second part!'
