But as a purchasable, it's just not worth it.\n\nOn my first attempt, I beat the game in about 50 minutes. On my second less than 20, and I think this is a result of the games limited scope and over-simplicity. It has a lot of issues, like it's UI being non intuitive, or the gameplay loop being extremely repetitive. The o2 UI shows no indication when you're running out of breath, with no sound queue or anything, making it extremely easy to randomly die because you've forgotten about it. The tutorial doesn't make much sense, and the game's end goal is extremely easy to reach once you know what you're doing. There's no reason to replay the game, and the features are repetitive and uninteresting for the most part.\n\nWith gameplay and UI changes, this game would be good, and if you were to add some new features or change the gameplay loop it could almost be great, but in it's current state it hasn't received a major patch for a long time and it doesn't seem like it'll receive anything but bug fixes from here.  Long story short, this game is fun for about an hour at most before you realize how limited the game truly is. After that point, you'll never have a reason to come back, and it's unfortunate too, because the idea has lots of potential.","timestamp_created":1591993057,"timestamp_updated":1591993057,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557296574115753174","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47seL1fICeo/VjQI="}
