    review: "I like this HOG a lot since it is quite fun and different from the typical\
      \ games of this genre. \n\nEven though the objects to search for are very typical,\
      \ each hidden object scene has several animated thingies in it and many creative\
      \ objects as well; like awesomely designed spooky furniture. The ghosts that\
      \ you can collect have their own little fun stories, each floor of the house\
      \ consisting of 4 rooms has an overall theme with a connected minigame at the\
      \ end that you will be able to participate in with the tools you automatically\
      \ create by finding enough stuff in the house.\n\nI liked \"hunting\" the ghosts\
      \ in each room with the magic magnifyier glass, but found the best part to be\
      \ the \"coded\" riddles for each floor that can be put together with some of\
      \ the findings.\n\nThe screenshots of some reviews that you can find on the\
      \ net don't do this nice game justice at all, because they often concentrate\
      \ on the intentionally weird portraits that will only pop up as some sort of\
      \ \"jump scare\" parody as a \"punishment\" whenever you have misclicked too\
      \ often."
