I need to find time to start on the other two games.\n\nLong story short, another awesome pack of 3 songs and 3 associated arena challenges (with 3 new equipment pieces) here, showing love to other indie friends. Compared to [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/K3W3L/recommended/522650/]Chiptune Challenge Pack 1[/url], these songs are slightly less challenging, but I feel that on Hard mode they are again slightly more difficult than their similarly-rated counterparts due to their technicality.\n\n[h1]When to buy[/h1]\nAgain, for the highscorers, this is terrific value for money. \n\n[h1]9.5/10[/h1]","timestamp_created":1480066766,"timestamp_updated":1480066860,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.613654673099517822","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvoC3zdgCcqzKaA=="}
