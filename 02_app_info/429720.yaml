    review: 'Imscared is the original pixellated horror game, and to this day it still
      holds up as a great experience. The game has many great ideas, and you really
      have to think outside the box to figure out what to do next. If you can''t figure
      out what to do next in the game, check the files, or maybe restart it: you might
      be surprised what''s there. This game takes many creative liberties, and I love
      it for that. While it doesn''t have much playtime, check it out, it''s well
      worth the time and price.'
