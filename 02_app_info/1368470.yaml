      \ Endless Night casts you in the role of the commander of a 19th-century relief\
      \ expedition whose ship is trapped in the Arctic ice. Managing dwindling resources\
      \ is the least of your problems once perpetual night descends on your crew,\
      \ drawing them slowly into the clutching embrace of insanity...<br><br>As the\

      \ you call for God or on science? And when the dance of the dead starts, will\
      \ you be able to bear your own reflection in the mirror?<br><br><img src=\"\
