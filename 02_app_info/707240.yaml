    review: 'The developers forgot to add the scenario where Valeros has to hunt down
      the game''s programmer after an unruly bug results in him not getting paid 5000
      gold for completing the adventure.


      The DLC doesn''t really add much much and the scenarios aren''t really exciting
      (though they were a nice challenge). I don''t know if the bug was a result of
      the DLC or the original game but it didn''t give out the 5000g reward after
      finishing the adventure. If you don''t care about gold gain or are particularily
      fond of Valeros, the DLC might be worth buying. In fairness, I probably still
      would have bought it for the extra cards and character, but I wouldn''t recommend
      it given that they managed to mess up what should have been a pretty simple
      if statement. That''s 10 treasure chests I was shorted in addition to the chests
      that I keep getting shorted when the treasure chest menu bugs out while opening
      chests. Just enough to subtract a chest from my inventory but not quite enough
      to actually give me the contents. AND ANOTHER THING! *Rabble rabble rabble*


      Y''all make it so difficult to love a game that would be nearly perfect without
      the bugs.'
