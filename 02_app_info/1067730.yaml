    review: "Good:\n\n-Animations evoke 70's anime and Mega Man X4 simultaneously\n\
      \n-Music is composed well even if it's always the same instrumentation\n\n-Some\
      \ enemy designs are well done and very cute\n\nBad:\n\n-All environments look\
      \ like recolors\n\n-Game is painfully easy until it pulls out multiple bosses\
      \ with obnoxious \ndisappearing/reappearing platform difficulty spike\n\n-Infinite\
      \ dash mechanic feels cheap rather than rewarding or visceral\n\n-Nailgun feels\
      \ like shit, automatically bursts for you then puts the classic Mega '3 shots\
      \ on screen at all times' rule on you\n\nAll in all this is something that I\
      \ really wanted to like and was excited for, my buddy sent me a link to this\
      \ and I thought I was going to have a good few hours, I couldn't even stand\
      \ 30 minutes. Sorry devs, I know you guys care about this project but it's...\
      \ really barebones and unfun."
