The game is very difficult but it is not fast-paced. In fact, the entire game requires some strategic thinking and a little bit of luck. First, regarding the genre of the game, it is a blobber. Specifically, it is a blobber where you are alone and there's no party turn-based battle system like Etrian Odyssey. Instead, the battle system is turn based on the square movement grid. You move around, you bump into monsters, and you hit them and they hit you back. Each square you move consists of a turn. Even more, the entire game is almost completely randomly generated except for maybe the starting area. For the programming expert, the random generation is basically a \"seeded\" random generator. That is how the world is persistent. So is the game decent? It really depends on your taste. If you like blobber games where you delve into dungeons, look for loot while avoiding and disarming traps, fight monsters turn-based and have to think a little and ration your potion supplies, and want an infinite gameplay version of that, this game is for you. The amount of dungeons and places to clear is simply huge and all of your level ups will feel like you have achieved them. The downside, however, is that once you understand this game and know what to do, the game can sometimes be a bit monotonous. The game suffers from a lack of monster variety, and the randomly generated quests needs more variety as well. The game is not vast and filled with different mechanics and build abilities like some rogue-like games such as Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup. However, I believe it does a good job in creating the first \"infinite\" blobber and I can see huge potential for this game. For me, I personally enjoy this game and I would rate it an 7/10. Your experiences will differ from mine depending on what you like. However, I find it astounding that this game is developed really by 1 person and that there is still an upcoming expansion for it. I hope the expansion can really make the game much better and add in the necessary content to make the game more interesting.","timestamp_created":1606380445,"timestamp_updated":1606380445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41IvvgfYCfPb2sQI="}
