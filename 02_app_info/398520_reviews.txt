Not only does this help define the game outside of the other skate games (a la THPS and Skate), it also helps that it keeps up the game pacing. You're doing dozens of tries to nail that full combo run, and it's nice to have something not quite so aggressive and upfront, especially since each run could be anywhere from 10s to 40s. \n\nBut overall, how good is the music? A solid 8-9/10. Honestly could've benefited from maybe a couple more tracks, as you'll no doubt listen to all of it multiple times in a few short sessions, but I do realise this is a smaller game with a correspondingly smaller team. Everything is suitably chilled out, helping you reach a calmer state. The soundtrack's also pretty dang consistent too, something I really do appreciate. While I do realise this is a compilation of previously released tracks, nothing here is atrociously mixed, nor is anything of subpar quality. Nice mix of house, chill, minimal. \n\nIf you're into music collecting however, the tracks are unfortunately in 160 kbps MP3. No FLAC lossless for you, but it's also annoying that a lot of the tags aren't filled in. Mp3tag is your friend. On decent headphones the loss in quality is noticeable, but again, it's nothing atrocious. \n\nFavourite track: [i]Lust-StarRo[/i]","timestamp_created":1601972515,"timestamp_updated":1601972515,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i5bA/vQCcdKWpgI="}
