Really want to like this game and with a few tweaks, that could come true. Changing to the chosen player on defence is an issue. I like the look of the game though. The pace of the game may be a little slower than some may like but I'm good with it. Last thing is the AI. With these issues I'm still gonna' give it a \"thumbs up\" hoping for improvements.------------This is a later review. It is getting better. Good job so far. Oh' ya'. I wish there was a hockey game that looked and played like this;)-updated review: Game won't start. I'm sure this will be addressed. Still a thumbs up.","timestamp_created":1600042948,"timestamp_updated":1609909026,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.582167148590087891","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwzceD6/YCd9jVoQI="}
