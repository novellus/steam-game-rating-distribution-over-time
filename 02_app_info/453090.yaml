    review: 'If you enjoy designing a park there are tons of things to do and be creative
      with. You can spend hours upon hours making one water ride looking magical.
      There are also great user created mods to remove some of the restrictions the
      game puts up.

      The management aspect of the game is not what I come for, but it feels similar
      to the old Roller Coaster Tycoon games. It doesn''t feel very balanced in terms
      of what you need to create in order to make money. But you can go sandbox mode
      without money or research to enable the creative flow.

      They are lacking some basic things like undo button, copy and paste, which can
      be frustrating but you learn to live with out it.'
