I quite enjoy the black mist that the game gets its name from.  It adds suspense to what would otherwise be a very bland game.\nThe lives system is also quite nice.  Instead of having a certain amount of lives and ammo, the two are combined.  Shooting uses Energy, which can be regained from falling enemies.  Energy also acts as a life force, so when you run out, it's game over.  You lose Energy when hit by enemies too.\nIt's clearly a game that was made with love, but without too much ambition.  It's a nice time killer if you want something more in-depth than cookie clicker, and brings some new ideas to the genre.\n7/10","timestamp_created":1505868435,"timestamp_updated":1505868435,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534755229949951172","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ445mwzt4Cc7XmhQE="}
