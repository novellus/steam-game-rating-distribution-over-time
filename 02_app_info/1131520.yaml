      is a trial and error game, the &quot;terror&quot; being having to worry about
      those little moving stars. Great Job!</li> <li>Really enjoyable game! I actually
      didn't mind the music either, probably because I was concentrating so hard on

      in! Good job!</li></ul>

    review: Quite an addictive game. Not just puzzle solving, but you also need to
      have quick reflexes. So satisfying when you beat a level, too!
