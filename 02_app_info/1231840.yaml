    about_the_game: 'Climber: Sky is the Limit is a game with a unique mixture of
      survival and simulation. As a player, you are a climber who takes on the most
      difficult and dangerous peaks on earth. To succeed you need to plan your journey
      carefully by preparing appropriate equipment, choosing a suitable trail, facing
      extreme weather conditions and surviving. Conquer your limits, overcome your
      fear and reach the sky.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Reach the summit</strong></h2><img

      /><br>Each expedition is different, and the journey to the top is a great challenge.
      Conquer your fear, face your limits and reach the summit. In order to do that:
      traverse dangerous trails using specialized equipment such as ice axe, lifelines
      or carabiners.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Face numerous dangers</strong></h2><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1231840/extras/2.gif?t=1607690337"
      /><br>During the journey, you must face dangers such as blizzards, chasms, vertical
      walls, steep traverses, avalanches, and crevasses. The key to success is to
      plan your next steps wisely and use the appropriate equipment at the right time.<h2
      class="bb_tag"><strong>Plan your expedition</strong></h2><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1231840/extras/3.gif?t=1607690337"
      /><br>Before setting off, plan which trail is best to the top taking into account
      weather conditions and the weather windows. Sometimes it''s better to take a
      chance and choose a more difficult route, but thanks to this you will be able
      to reach the summit before a snowstorm.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Survival</strong></h2><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1231840/extras/4.gif?t=1607690337"
      /><br>The key to survival is to have appropriate tools when you need one. Each
      piece of equipment has its weight but also makes your next step harder. Ensure
      you have enough food to recover your strengths, or you have a warm jacket and
      sleeping bag to warm up after a full-day climb. <br>Good timing also plays a
      great role during the expedition. In the high mountains, where weather changes
      quickly and night falls very fast, plan ahead to set up camp in the right place
      that gives you wind cover making easier to survive.'
