      \ Quarter is a VR survival horror game focused on what made survival horror\
      \ great:</strong> labyrinthine environments, resource management and well-balanced\
      \ puzzling. An homage to the slow, methodical survival horror experiences of\
      \ the '90s, explore the compelling nightmare world of the Organ Quarter and\
      \ enjoy the most intimate horror experience yet.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Why VR?</h2><strong>Horror\
      \ in your personal space, as well as in the world outside. Horror you have to\
      \ reach out to and touch.</strong> Organ Quarter leverages hand-tracked and\
      \ room-scale VR to provide the most intense and unsettling experience possible.The\
      \ sense of physical space and presence unique to the VR medium is carefully\
      \ leveraged, pushing players past their comfort zone, bringing them into tight,\
      \ claustrophobic environments and making them get up close and personal with\
      \ monsters (who may not always be hostile...).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How is Organ\
      \ Quarter Unique?</h2><strong>This is not a wave shooter or a walking simulator\
      \ \u2013 Organ Quarter is a long-form horror adventure.</strong> This is an\
      \ experience that plays out over a large area <strong>over 5-8 hours</strong>,\
      \ with intricately connected levels, gun combat, resources and tools at the\
      \ player's disposal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story?</h2><strong>Uncover what has\
      \ gripped and twisted the Organ Quarter.</strong> Over weeks and months of isolation\
      \ in your apartment, something has happened to the city. It has become infected.\
      \ Its places. Its people. Everything has become twisted by a disease that may\
      \ or may not have a motive. Explore a city that has become a wasteland and body-horror\
      \ nightmare, full of surreal puzzles and grotesque beings.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
