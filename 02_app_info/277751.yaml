    review: 'Bought this game on the recommendation, nay the insistence, of a friend
      who has become a huge Train Simulator enthusiast. It was half-off during the
      Halloween sale, and even at full-price it is much less than the original game.
      It is a great introduction to the unique gameplay. As my friend said, explaining
      the gameplay makes it sound boring, so suffice to say, it is a fairly relaxed
      experience, with the simple controls, simple objectives, and observation of
      the camera angles and maps. It is not exactly easy, with different resources
      to manage, but it is a slow paced game that gives you time to ponder the nature
      of transportation by rails.


      I played this game on Ubuntu Linux with the Steam Play tools. With the advice
      from ProtonDB, I manually unpacked some data-files, so that the game could load
      the levels correctly. The game ran fine, with great framerates, afterward. The
      game uses mouse-only or keyboard controls, and it includes a lengthy PDF manual.
      Even while this DLC is a fun-hearted theme, the gameplay is still serious, which
      gives a good idea for the full game (I suppose). This DLC has many scenarios
      to play, which range from very easy to very difficult. I highly recommend this
      game; I think there are many hours of fun to be had here, for train enthusiasts,
      simulation gamers, or gamers looking for a chillaxed experience.'
