I'm planning on using this app in combination with LIV to create tutorials in mixed reality. This is a project that I've had for a long time, but I hadn't been able to find the right tool. This program has everything I need, but it is clear that this is still in an Early Access stage. It crashed a couple of times during my first test drive and I got a little sick after a while probably due to a low framerate. \nI really hope the developer is aware some of us will use this app not specifically to collaborate with others in the same environment, but to create material in mixed reality. There is no other whiteboard app with these capabilities (like an import picture feature that actually works) and in such amazing environments. The summer house is simply fantastic.","timestamp_created":1594949723,"timestamp_updated":1594949723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4t6yarfMCfIrjlQI="}
