The moving around in the game is very weird and confusing. I moved around for a long time with nowhere to go until I finally had to give up and use a hint to find my way and it pointed through a wall. I was like, really? What kind of portal or magic is this? Turned out it took me back downstairs. It literally looks like moving through a wall.\nThe second thing I hated about the game is the ending. And I am one of the few who even bothered finishing the game... all for nothing just to see that...","timestamp_created":1607349206,"timestamp_updated":1607349206,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv8/envYCdPz8twI="}
