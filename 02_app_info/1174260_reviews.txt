The framerate is really too low and it's not really playable on my integrated GFX laptop. Next time the dev should chose a game engine that doesn't suck, and maybe not use a ton of particles and light effects on every screen, because there is no reason I should use a\" gamer-PC\" to run this game.","timestamp_created":1602553064,"timestamp_updated":1602553064,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.457589268684387207","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpOXmj/UCedDGpwI="}
