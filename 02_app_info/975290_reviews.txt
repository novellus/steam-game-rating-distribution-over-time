I love the simplistic ASCII-art graphics combined with the strange universe, music and characters. \n\nI recommend this game to everybody who likes point'n'click adventures and also something different from the mainstream.\n\nAlso big plus for the developer who helped me when I was stuck without giving me the solution but instead gave me enough hints so I could feel the satisfaction of finally being able to solve the next part of the journey myself!","timestamp_created":1586211346,"timestamp_updated":1586211346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5YrkqPECc9Xf/gE="}
