      notes: "The Shadow never underestimates the power of her beauty.\r\n\r\nNakedness\
        \ as a sign of helplessness is her other weapon. For northerners grown in\
        \ frosts the naked body is not a sign of lewdness, but a call for help. Brothers\
        \ saw frozen refugees and shaking paupers much more than alluring courtesans,\
        \ and the urge to cover someone naked is natural for them. "
