    review: 'This car is one of the weakest rallycross vehicles available in the game.
      It has a very mediocre acceleration rating and its performance caps out a 446
      despite being a category 3 car. For comparison, the Honda Civic already in the
      game, which is a category 2 car, caps out at 494.


      This Citroen stops being competitive in level 3 or above events, even when maxed
      out.


      Unless you want to spend $5 to give yourself a handicap I''d stick with any
      of the rallycross cars in the base game.'
