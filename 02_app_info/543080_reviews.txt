Gameplay looks simple at first glance, but  as the story unfolds, the game becomes more and more absorbing. Basically, in the demo, you investigate a bombing case and build a psychologica portrait of a suspect based on different kinds of media and other evidences.  The game has interesting graphics and music which change when you find new important information about the suspect. But the main value of the game is that it provokes thoughts.  It is not science fiction like Orwell's book. It is set here and now. Look at all little details which point at the real world. Even the date is significant, it's ery near future. The game reminds us that we are in a potsprivate world surrounded by technology which collects data about us, online but also on the streets. Will we trade liberty for security?","timestamp_created":1487365604,"timestamp_updated":1487365604,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqsD5ptoCdZy1cg=="}
