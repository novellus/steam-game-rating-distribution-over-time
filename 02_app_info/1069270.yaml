    review: 'At the time of this review there are 20 levels to play. This took me
      around 30 minutes to beat. I spent some extra time trying to get achievements
      which seemed either locked or broken. Only the first achievement seemed to work.


      I played the game with a mouse and the controls were very simple. The level
      rotates either left or right based on which side of the level you are on. The
      game design is novel and levels are moderately fun, though some levels feel
      like they have unintended solutions.


      Currently the user interface is cryptic with very few words. Navigating the
      menu seems harder than it should. Additionally, in the area for level select
      there seems to be space for many new levels to be made. This along with oddly
      named achievements (placeholders I assume) make the game seem like it is either
      unfinished or in the process of being updated.


      Ultimately this game is mostly fun, but due to being short and the issues listed
      above I would not recommend this game. If these issues do not bother you then
      feel free to check this out.'
