    about_the_game: <strong>GAMEPLAY</strong><br>SHAPESHOOTER is literally an on-rail
      shooter, you'll have to clear colonies across 4 planets from a little creatures
      infestation called polygoneers. But that's not important, you'll not get a story
      here. You'll get frenetic action, insane music and a super hard challenge!<br><br><img

      /><br><br><strong>WEAPONS</strong><br>In SHAPESHOOTER you'll have 5 different
      weapons, all of them have 3 levels. Gatter OCTARINGS to upgrade them, and trust
      me, you'll need it.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1143900/extras/store_image2.gif?t=1604090469"
      /><br><br><strong>TRAPS</strong><br>Besides a the polygoneers, you must watch
      out for traps, A LOT OF THEM. Look at the size of this saw, I bet it has at
      least 200px wide.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1143900/extras/store_image4.gif?t=1604090469"
      /><br><br><strong>UPGRADES</strong><br>Improve your tank to survive, there are
      weapons, shield, magnet, wheels and of course skins, because you need to be
      shining while destroying everything in front of you.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1143900/extras/store_image3.gif?t=1604090469"
