    review: 'It''s easy to get an idea of whether or not you''ll like this game by
      watching the trailer, but the truth is even that doesn''t fully convey just
      how addicting this game is, what with the use of a 3 star ranking system, instantaneous
      retries, and that nagging feeling you get when you could do something JUST A
      BIT better. Even stopping briefly to write up this review, I''m kinda wanting
      to just jump back in and retry beaten stages to Gold Star them. This is clearly
      made by someone who knows his way around old-school arcadey game design. Thankfully
      you don''t actually have to put quarters in to keep playing.


      Also that soundtrack is freaking fantastic.'
