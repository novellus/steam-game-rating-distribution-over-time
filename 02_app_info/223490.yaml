    review: "N\xE3o adquira esse jogo nem se oferecerem uma f\xF3rmula m\xE1gica para\
      \ que voc\xEA consiga chupar seu pr\xF3prio p*u!\nO jogo \xE9 extremamente incompleto\
      \ e desconexo, al\xE9m do fato que n\xE3o h\xE1 um objetivo concreto; voc\xEA\
      \ simplesmente constr\xF3i e coloca camas para \"spawnarem\" alguns NPCs completamente\
      \ aleat\xF3rios e sem vida que s\xE3o mais in\xFAteis que os fillers do Naruto;\
      \ uma pedra corredora conseguiria mais sucesso do que esse jogo em toda a exist\xEA\
      ncia, al\xE9m do fato, claro, que deram um tiro de sniper na testa do desenvolvedor\
      \ e por isso ele esqueceu de voltar a atualizar o game.\nEu repito: mesmo que\
      \ lhe ofere\xE7am todas as m*m*das do mundo, N\xC3O COMPRE. Al\xE9m do fato\
      \ de que, claro, os gr\xE1ficos s\xE3o mais feios que os desenhos que eu fazia\
      \ na pr\xE9-escola. A modelagem das personagens com certeza \xE9 inferior a\
