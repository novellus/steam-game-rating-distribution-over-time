And as far as its format, it's easy to get into and have fun with despite the boardgame mechanic. If you already enjoy games like GO or Reversi, then this game is a must.  I feel that a lot of people gets turned off by this especially during a period where games are more \"direct\" and \"action oriented\" rather than cerebral and at times abstract. \n\nThis game is absolutely worth that. And for someone like me who's rented games like Ogre Battle, JRPGs and thought FFT was the second coming of Odin, its sense of aesthetic and play was a refreshing discovery.  There's a lot to be found in the classic mechanics of the game it was based on that this game has accomplished in its attempt to dress it up for a retro crowd:\n\n+ Gear ,Equipment, Loot ! \n+ \"Deck building\" your armies and pieces as they get placed on the board and perform various tricks. \n+  Interesting limits and parameters that aren't just reduced to \"hit them until they die\" \n+ Colorful Spritework, Animations, and a classical art style \n+ High intensity reversi violence ! \n\nOften have I wondered if RPGs would have been more interesting if they were based on Chess or distilled the anxiety of choice like poker did. It's good to know that there are daring devs out there that pulls off works of art like this one.  \n\nCons: \n-As of now I've yet to finish the game but I'm glad it exists and I can pick it up whenever I get the itch for fantasy / tactics games again \n- I honestly went into this blind and was surprised at how good it actually was. I know some people will be caught off guard by the abstracted game space but it's all worth it if you don't mind the grind. \n- The challenge will probably piss people off too, but I'm not a weak piece of shit so ... \n","timestamp_created":1609342699,"timestamp_updated":1609342699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ435iT2vYCfbfnvgI="}
