The wait time isn't hard to get used to, but in most of the other GameHouse time management games, customers know what they want immediately upon arrival. The gold heart issue doesn't seriously hinder your ability to easily earn the highest \"grade\" on each level, but it does complicate the ability to earn the \"Purrfect\" combo (checking out four customers at once). Doing this, in my experience, basically required you to allow a customer or two to lose hearts.\n\nHowever, the game still has the same engrossing feel as the other GameHouse time management titles. It's still engaging to keep track of your stock of items, prepare the most time-consuming items in advance, and to quickly complete the mini-games. It felt like it took a bit too long to restock items, even after you'd bought the associated upgrade, but this wasn't a huge deal.\n\nThe biggest changes in Family Practice are the \"daily challenge\" system and the system of pet ownership. I didn't necessarily dislike these systems, but they did feel more like \"game as service\" features, encouraging you to log on frequently in order to \"get the most\" out of these features. From time-to-time, your pets will ask for something, and their neediness meter counts down even when you're not actively playing the game. If it's been a while since you've played the game, your pets will have these scowls on their faces when you visit them as though you've betrayed them in some way.\n\nThe other big change is the \"choice\" system. At certain times during the story, you'll have the opportunity to make a choice for one of the characters that has some impact on the overall story arc. I had no problems with the system itself and welcomed the change to the formula.\n\nI have mixed feelings about the story overall, however. Alice (Amy's mother) evoked strong emotions in me. If you would've told me beforehand that Amy was estranged from her mother, I would have imagined that perhaps her mother left when she was very young to pursue a lucrative career or something to this effect. Many saccharine stories like these feature this sort of set-up. I was then very surprised to find Alice to be a genuinely toxic person, and I wouldn't be surprised at all if you were to tell me that she has Borderline Personality Disorder (I believe that she meets some of the diagnostic criteria).\n\nAfter I finished the game, I was pleased with how each story arc resolved. However, when I looked at the achievement list, I found that I had missed the achievement for getting the \"best\" endings. [spoiler] Apparently, the developers would prefer that Amy allow her mother to continue poisoning her life instead of creating meaningful and healthy boundaries. [/spoiler] This soured me a little bit on the title, but I think it's noteworthy that the game even elicited this kind of reaction in me. I've run through many of these GameHouse games not thinking overmuch about the storyline, so it was refreshing to find this one so engaging.\n\nIf you like GameHouse time management titles, you'll probably like this one as well. I liked the \"choice\" feature (which I haven't seen in any other GameHouse game), but wasn't as big a fan of pet management and daily challenges.","timestamp_created":1595950998,"timestamp_updated":1595950998,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.459110468626022339","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn/SFy/MCdqaKmAI="}
