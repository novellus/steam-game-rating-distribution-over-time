It is a direct continuation of the narrative, but instead of trying to tell a cohesive story it reaches into the grab bag of the usual clich√©s of the genre.\n\nEverything is mediocre. Uninteresting and boring characters, nonsensical point-and-click puzzles, and easy hidden-object scenes. Nothing is bad, but nothing is very good, either.\n\nThe best aspect of the game is the imp's animation. Super cute and lively! But it's mostly window dressing.\n\nA half-hearted thumbs up.","timestamp_created":1594357166,"timestamp_updated":1594357926,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh+nIm/MCfLmdlAI="}
