    review: 'It has some potential, but it''s absolutely raw and undercooked. I only
      bought it at discount price and couldn''t even bring myself up to keep it.

      I like no hand-holding, when it comes to figuring out the rules of the game
      world - it''s just unfortunate that both the game world and gameplay mechanics
      lack any sort of variety (as the other user correctly pointed out - this game
      is a blatant tech demo), as the levels progress.


      In each level you do the same thing. The world consists of two stances - one
      is static another is dynamic (need to enter it through a card-portal), in which
      you can shift the height of platforms to traverse the simplistic landscape to
      your goal. Reach a mcguffin and kill another mcguffin with it (use a scope).


      Expect for the mouse clicks to not work in main menu (use keyboard + Enter).

      Default kb controls are:

      WASD - movement;

      Shift - run;

      Z - overworld map (shows your goals);

      Q,E - shifting the platforms height up and down;

      X - scope (for when you obtain the mcguffin bullet).


      Try it out at your own risk (recommended to wait for a discount, because it''s
      hardly worth one full dollar at this stage of development)'
