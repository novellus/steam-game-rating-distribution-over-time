After completing the game on the \"defensive scale\" I found:\n- Achievements won't always activate when completed while others only activate when you have beaten the campaign.\n- The ending is anticlimactic (at least on the defensive scale), while the rest of the story is largely forgettable.\n- The controls for ship energy output and weapons priority targeting can be tedious at times (more so if you have a larger fleet).\n- While the soundtracks are engaging at the start, there is approximately only 9 soundtracks including the main menu (totalling at 30 minutes). After 4 hours of playing it can become somewhat repetitive.\n\nHowever there are some things that Star Hammer offers which are positive.\n- Character interactions during mission selection add much needed depth to the story.\n- Camera controls are precise and can be altered with a large degree of freedom (i.e free cam, top down, tracking on ships and the ability to review the last turn made).\n- Sound effects in large firefights are fairly immersive.","timestamp_created":1577082006,"timestamp_updated":1606204844,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/pzR/PUCcvCk5gE="}
