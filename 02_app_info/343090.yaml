    short_description: I am excited to release my first game on Steam! SimpleRockets
      was released in 2013 for mobile and I've put a ton of work into it to get it
      ready for PC and Mac. It was inspired by KSP, and it offers a simpler 2D experience
      for building rockets and exploring space with realistic orbital mechanics.

    review: It's a good game but not worth buying. If it's free or very cheap go ahead,
      but if you have money just buy KSP.
