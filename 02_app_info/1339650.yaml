    about_the_game: 'The Car Hacking Village (CHV)''s Trunk Escape experience is based
      on the real Trunk Escape CTF challenge hosted at DefCon.  In the traditional
      meatspace challenge, contestants would sign up and pick items they wanted in
      the trunk.  We would then bind them and toss them in the trunk with a 30 minute
      timer to escape.  There were flags along the way for additional points.<br><br>We
      have converted that challenge to a VR Experience.  This year, 2020, due to the
      Covid-19 pandemic we are playing it safe and converting the Defcon Car Hacking
      Village into a virtual event.  This is just one of the challenges for that event.  In
      this game you will pick a loadout for youself and be placed in the back of a
      van.  You will then have to either solve physical puzzles or hack into the CAN
      bus in order to escape.  If played during Defcon, you can connect to the CTF
      servers to compete against other hackers.<br><br>Outside of Defcon these challenges
      will randomly create new solutions.  This will give you additional play even
      outside of the conference.<br><br><strong>Developers Note:</strong> This is
      a solo-dev volunteer-time developed game.  Please be patient.  Occulus should
      work as I''m using OpenXR but I won''t update the steam supported VR headsets
      until I have had time to fully test it.<br><br><strong>Defcon Safemode Release</strong><br>Defcon
      28 is the initial release and the first VR game (or any game for that matter)
      that the Car Hacking Village has ever released.  It was a 1 person, nights and
      weekend project so lots of things didn''t make the final cut.  Some bugs still
      survived but should be pretty minor (the points on the watch are wrong).  Please
      use the Community forums to let me know what worked, didn''t work and what you
      would like to see in future versions or other game ideas.  If you are on the
      Defcon discord look for [CHV] zombieCraig in #chv-vr-support-text channel.'

    review: "+ it starts? \n\n-so crappy it's unplayable\n-horrible controls\n-buggy\n\
      \n1/5\n\nStay away from this it's not even close to being worth $3. Even at\
      \ free I probably wouldn't touch it. It's so bad it's unplayable. \n\n[Quote]\
