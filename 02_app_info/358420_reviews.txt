The graphics are okay. They looked a bit better than I was expecting given the screenshots but still nothing compared to the games that this is derivative of. The gameplay is the issue here. I have started getting into the fighting game genre a bit more recently so I wanted to give this a go to see Apogee's version of a Mortal Kombat game would look/play like. Well, I played six minutes of it and that was enough for me (consisted of three matches, the first of which crashed the game). The gameplay is very clunky and feels awful to play. I only played with Toad and Selena so if there is a character that feels more natural to play, I don't know.\n\nI would recommend remapping your keys to something a bit better than the default controls and turning off camera zoom which made the game look much worse in my opinion. There is potential here but the execution left a lot to be desired.","timestamp_created":1608659367,"timestamp_updated":1608659367,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xb7kxfYCcd6cvAI="}
