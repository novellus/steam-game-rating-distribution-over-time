Thank you! :) [/code] \n\nWhy this game is not more popular is beyond me. Maybe it´s the price tag, maybe it has to do with a saturation of the market regarding pixel art games. Independently of that, the game is FUN and it´s a blast to play locally with friends. \n\nThe game throws you into different stages were you have to use your ninja skills to survive, killing everything that moves and reaching the next stage. The gameplay is responsive and you can notice that the developers took their time to refine it. The sprites of our heroes are nice with cool details and pretty to look at.\n\nFair warning: the game is tough as nails but cmon! It´s called NINJA SHOWDOWN; you did not expect the Ninja life to be easy, didn't you?","timestamp_created":1525136938,"timestamp_updated":1593901166,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563518643379211426","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw27X6jfMCdNmynwE="}
