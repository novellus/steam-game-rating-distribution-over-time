(With one slightly more \"driving\" track, just to pluck things up a little.)\n\n   I liked it. Then again, I'm a pretty miserable b*stard at the best of times.\n\n   Verdict: 8/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1518643580,"timestamp_updated":1518801128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.60131305456161499","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpMHmz+ECeo7xmAE="}
