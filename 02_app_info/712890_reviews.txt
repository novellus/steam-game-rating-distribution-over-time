There is a steady progression to the main character and plot with freedom to 'explore'.  Most of the exploration is implied by text narration; so you'll like this game better if you like to read.  The artwork is colourful and cute despite the post-apocalyptic setting.  What struck me the most though, is how this cute pc game echoed many of my own opinions about society :/.  \n\nThe game is a good distraction for an evening.","timestamp_created":1601131608,"timestamp_updated":1601131608,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/K645fQCdt+apAI="}
