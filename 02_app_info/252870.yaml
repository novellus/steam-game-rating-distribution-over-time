    review: all around, this game is 10/10 for me. the lore is excellent and one of
      the main attractions for me, and i have never seen any game simulate a space
      environment like this one. the game is simple at heart yet there is so much
      to see and do, and without paying attention to everything you will fail. i would
      personally say the game only goes at the pace you want it to, because you can
      choose when to warp to a different sector and pick another fight, you can usually
      have as much downtime as you want in between fights to recover and prepare.
      i personally find the ship combat of the game too easy, however; all i need
      to do to take out a ship is damage its shields then board it to kill its crew.
      as for drones, i feel they can be too intimidating to a newer crew but can make
      for a decent fight mid-game (late-game they become pretty easy as well). so;
      overall, the game itself is easy to play and master, maybe too easy at times,
      but there is a lot of things to explore in the galaxy, a lot of things to do,
      and the game has good replayability. i'd say definitely at least try the game.
