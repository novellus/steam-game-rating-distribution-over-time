The number of glitches with this game is few. Controls are exactly like those in The Sims 3. There are many weapons/armor and clothing choices for your medieval Sims. However, I wish that you could edit the kingdom further in this game, rather than just being able to edit individual locations/rooms, so that the kingdom wouldn't always be the same. I also wish there were more quests, so the replay value would be significantly increased.\n\nI like the Pirates & Nobles expansion, too. You can get different types of birds, name them, and care for them. You also get to be involved in the middle of a war between two territories. If you help either side win, there are advantages that you can have, and certain items you can get. If you choose to stay neutral, there can also be advantages.\n\nIf you need to fix the game, try going to thesims3.com. If you have an account, log in. If you don't, sign up. Next, go to the 'My Page' tab and down at the bottom hit 'My Account'. Then hit 'Register A Game'. Now, when your CD Key pops up in Steam, enter the code into the boxes you see on the page (You may also need to install Origin beforehand since it registers with it). When you're done, it should automatically install when you open Origin, and then you should even be able to start it through Steam. I apologize if this does not work for you and wish you luck.\n\nOverall Rating: 8/10","timestamp_created":1373846963,"timestamp_updated":1562454551,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nY3j5OsCeIDGEQ=="}
