    review: Actually, this is were I have to disagree with a prior youtube blurb.
      This is somewhat slim pickin's for 5$ of VR art museum. It's mostly ladies on
      postage stamps and some photo scanned objects and that's it. Sure, the Shepard
      Fairey fella narrates, but he sounded a tinge pretentious if I don't say so
      myself. [spoiler]You can consume alot of free VR museums and endless amounts
      of arts of culture stuff before you should be made to shell out more than 3
      quid for this. [/spoiler] https://youtu.be/0CT1awcaXjM
