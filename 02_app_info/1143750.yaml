    about_the_game: "VRocker is a movement app that enables you to enjoy your VR games\
      \ with more lifelike player movement. With VRocker you \u2018walk\u2019 or \u2018\
      run\u2019 in games by moving your body without the need for any external gadgets.\
      \ To move you can:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Run In Place<br></li><li>Sway<br></li><li>Step<br></li><li>Squat<br></li><li>Rock<br></li><li>Lunge</li></ul><br>How\
      \ you move is up to you!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">How to use</h2><br>To use VRocker,\
      \ simply start VRocker first and then the game of your choosing. VRocker runs\
      \ parallel to other SteamVR games and overrides in-game joystick/pad \u2018\
      smooth locomotion\u2019. The player can still use the game\u2019s own movement\
      \ as well, seamlessly changing between VRocker and in-game movement without\
      \ a need to interrupt playing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Stay Active</h2><br>VRocker\
      \ includes broad customization options to allow for a wide variety of play styles\
      \ - from stepping or gentle swaying to jogging in place, doing squats or even\
      \ lunges. You can fine-tune the movement \u2018feel\u2019 for your liking or\
      \ you can choose one from the pre-defined options. You can also save user-defined\
      \ presets for each game. VRocker\u2019s intuitive tutorial will help to get\
      \ you started!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Motion Sickness</h2><br>There is some evidence\
      \ that 'stepping' while moving in VR can reduced perceived motion sickness,\
      \ and some users have reported back that using VRocker has helped them. Motion\
      \ sickness varies from person to person but if you do suffer you can try the\
      \ demo to see if VRocking helps<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Try the demo first</h2><br>You\
      \ can test VRocker with any game using the demo<br><br>*<strong>it runs for\
      \ 120 seconds before a 20 second cool down period is set</strong>*<br><br>The\
      \ demo also includes a tutorial without limits so you can try the the various\
      \ movement techniques yourself, as well as to see how it performs with the games\
      \ you play. Some VR games might not combine well with VRocker, although it works\
      \ well with most SteamVR games.<br><br>If you own it, <strong>Half Life Alyx</strong>\
      \ will give you a good idea of what VRocking is all about!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Driver</h2><br>Note that upon installing VRocker, a SteamVR driver is also\
      \ installed requiring SteamVR to restart.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Discord</h2><br>If\

    short_description: Use your body to move in any SteamVR game that uses joystick/pad
      'smooth locomotion'. VRock to increase immersion, keep active, free up your
      hands or just to fulfil that desire to look (even more) silly in VR!

    review: "TL;DR I highly recommend VRocker as a walk in place solution for your\
      \ VR locomotion. \n\nHow I Came To This Conclusion: In preparation for my index,\
      \ I was researching the best options online for immersion. Based on my income\
      \ it made sense to find a walk in place solution while gaming in VR chat, Rec\
      \ Room, Pavlov, Alyx and Skryim. My first search led me to Kat Loco and while\
      \ the price wasn't too steep, the system was out of stock. This led to a recommendation\
      \ of Natural Locomotion and the intriguing possibility of walk in place via\
      \ joy cons and an android smartphone. I picked up ankle straps for the joy cons\
      \ and a little pouch for the andriod phone off of Amazon. I strapped everything\
      \ in, calibrated the devices and it simply did not work the way I wanted it\
      \ to. The hand movement option was great but walk in place was unusable. That's\
      \ when i did some deeper digging and found VRocker. The hope I had in terms\
      \ of movement in game was perfectly met. I sent back my straps and pouch to\
      \ amazon and ended up spending far less that i anticipated to have my ideal\
      \ experience.\n\nThe Good: Once calibrated, everything feels intuitive. The\
      \ ui for settings is basic but easy to navigate. The demo/tutorial is fantastic.\
      \ It's nice to have presets for popular games. I picked up a bhaptic vest and\
      \ they pair flawlessly while both running. It's worth every penny of asking\
      \ price.\n\nHope of Future: A way to navigate calibration settings in VR would\
      \ be cool/ an automatic calibration  based on how you individually walk and\
      \ run would set things over the edge. As of now there isn't an option to have\
      \ your head turned one way while your feet continue in a different direction,\
      \ some way to do this would be the cherry on the sundae."
