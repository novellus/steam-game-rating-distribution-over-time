Lately it crashes just minutes into the game.  It locks up everything so that I have to reboot my computer.  Do not pay money for this game.  You might not be able to play it.  If they were to fix it, it is a fun older type game to play.","timestamp_created":1602509275,"timestamp_updated":1602509275,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ499+/jvUCd8e4pwI="}
