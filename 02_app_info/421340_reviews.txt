This is quite possibly my favourite. It has everything going for it, action, suspense, humour, clever writing and great acting. If you've never seen this one before and enjoy Tarantino's works, check this one out. You won't be disappointed.","timestamp_created":1530726334,"timestamp_updated":1531385571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551724135875701904","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ466zsxuQCevaXpQE="}
