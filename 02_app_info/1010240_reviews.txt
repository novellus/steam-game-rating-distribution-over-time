Seriously, I'm glad that the game is long enough so that I don't have to end this interesting journey soon :3 The story is engaging and I can't help but continuing to read till the end. As far as I know, Ewan and Elliot routes have very different plots (not just change the guys you're with) so you can enjoy all the routes completely without getting bored (I'm playing Elliot's route now). Besides, the game functions well and it has all the things I need in an otome game.\n\n","timestamp_created":1609044526,"timestamp_updated":1609044526,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwu+Ch0fYCcerQvQI="}
