    review: "Some nice sounds and they create some cool loops.\n\nOverall this seems\
      \ like it has a lot of potential but I've been running into a variety of issues\
      \ I hope will be resolved in future updates I will list all of them here.\n\n\
      1) I can't seem to control where the different effects get inserted into the\
      \ sound loops the program chooses for me\n2) I can't choose which sound to create,\
      \ I have to just create a bunch until the one I want appears\n3) I can't make\
      \ separate loops everything goes into a single loop, this makes it hard to properly\
      \ create a custom soundscape / music etc\n4) I can't tune the speed at which\
      \ the loop goes through the nodes\n\nIf anyone knows how to do these things\
      \ I'd really like to know, or if the devs intend to add this functionality at\
      \ a later date.\n\nIn conclusion, fun toy, with great potential, but currently\
      \ not a lot of depth. But hey it's free and for that price it's pretty cool\
      \ already. I've spent about 10 minutes on this game thus far, and so far I seem\
      \ to be liking it. I appreiciate how different it is from all the other VR titles;\
      \ I personally don't know any other game that let's you create your own tune\
      \ in VR! I'll update this when I have a chance to play more. But overall, I\
      \ recommend this, as it's creative and unique in it's own right. AN\xC1LISE\
      \ DE ACESSO ANTECIPADO PUBLICADA: 4 DE SETEMBRO DE 2016\nFun free music experience.\
      \ The 7.1, I think, is used great. You create different music crystals with\
      \ the trigger finger, make them come into contact with each other, they start\
      \ creating a beat already chosen by the game, then you can grab them and throw\
      \ them in any direction to make that sound come from that direction. Then pull\
      \ out more crystals and do the same thing. If you don't like the sound of one\
      \ of them, you can pop them by stabbing them with your controller. There aren't\
      \ too many different sounds created, hopefully that will expand. It does seem\
      \ like the same song can be recreated. What I had fun with is just using 1 or\
      \ maybe a small dose of a second crystal and placing the crystals like they\
      \ are the instrument. For example, there was one sound that sounded like someone\
      \ humming something briefly, and another sound that sounded like someone snapping\
      \ their fingers. So I placed the crystals where a persons mouth would be for\
      \ humming and a persons hands would be for snapping. Then the drum sounds I\
      \ placed behind me where a drum set often is located on stage. I put water droplet\
      \ sounds on the floor. I enjoyed it and since its free, nothing but thumbs up!\n"
