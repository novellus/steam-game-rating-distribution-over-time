Slightly bullet-hell. Autoscroll\nIs the price right? : Yes\nWho is this for? : Action platformer fans, all ages.\nDoes the multiplayer work well? : Yes, Shared lives\n\nHow is the game lenght and pace? : The game give you the option to start with more lives as you keep playing, ensuring steady progress and motivation.\nHow are the graphics? : Clean. Responsive. Some platforming hasards (like spikes) are hard to spot.\nHow is the UI? : Simple and fast.\n\n-----\n\nI played this in multiplayer with a friend and it was a fun challenge. The different powerups were a nice touch.\nI encountered no glitches at all.\nThe difficulty was a bit inconsistent, with some platforming sections being extremely tight later on-- and some bosses being quite easy.\nThe flamethrower controlled aerial movement is fun and well executed.\nWhile it is not a game for everyone, at this price, it's definitly worth a try for any fan of action plaformer games looking for something to keep em busy for a couple days. \n\n[7.5/10]","timestamp_created":1590346290,"timestamp_updated":1590361207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jca6pPICfpaFigI="}
