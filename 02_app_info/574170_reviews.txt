I really enjoyed this game. I found myself breezing through the puzzles pretty quickly; however, a few of them stumped me for a bit. \n\nThe game is incredibly fun to play overall, but is it worth the money? If you don't mind paying for only 2 hours worth of content, the answer is yes. The game is cute, easy to pick up, and a great way to burn a couple of hours.\n\n\nPros- Beautiful music\n-----        Easy to play\n-----         Somewhat challenging puzzles\n         \n\n\nCons-       No option to pick specific levels\n------              Game length","timestamp_created":1490816563,"timestamp_updated":1510490154,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510309278964996338","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwdSO2N8Ceu7IdQ=="}
