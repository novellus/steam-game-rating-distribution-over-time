I am learning to fly microlights and our club sometime fly out to some of these field strips. Unfortunately there are several issues that I can't overlook. Firstly, adding just one pack hugely increases the loading time. Adding all four increased the loading time before a flight to around five minutes. The workaround is to go into the 'Scenery' setting and temporarily disable the packs that are not relevant to your flight.\n\nMore significantly, once FSX has finally loaded your flight, instead of being on the 'Active Runway' as per the settings, I am actually parked in some random spot. One airfield puts me in the middle of a tree, and another immediately in front of a caravan. In many cases the aircraft instantly crashes because it's parked in a piece of terrain. You can get around it by disabling crash detection, but you shouldn't have to do that.\n\nI am using the packs in conjunction with UK2000 VFR Airfields, which is superb by the way, and doesn't cause massive loading times. Farm Strips duplicates some of the UK2000 airfields and doesn't have a facility to disable the duplicate.\n\nIf it worked, this would be a fantastic addon. Unfortunately the loading times and incorrect aircraft placement mean this is not a recommended purchase.\n","timestamp_created":1569324480,"timestamp_updated":1569324480,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.506578981876373291","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4ObBse0Cf7/l0gE="}
