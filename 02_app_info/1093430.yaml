    review: "I'm not very impressed with this DLC addition to Talisman:Origins.  While\
      \ there are 5 added chapters, some of the game play is so short or insignificant\
      \ that it doesn't feel like it's worth the $4 DLC.  \n\nThe particular beef\
      \ I have with it is the chapter where you play the reaper.  There is really\
      \ no game play here.\n[h1]SPOILER ALERT: [/h1] \n[spoiler]  You spend the whole\
      \ chapter chasing after characters so that you can land on them and kill them.\
      \  Kind of boring.  On the other hand, to complete the challenges, you have\
      \ to make certain characters gain gold or strength.  Well, you spend 5 or 6\
      \ turns just trying to land on the character, then when you do and try to help\
      \ him, he chooses the option to gain that doesn't meet your goal.  So 60 or\
      \ more rounds of \"skip to my next turn\" just so you can TRY to land on someone\
      \ is not my idea of fun.  What a wasted chapter.  Playing an NPC in a game is\
      \ not what you play a game for.[/spoiler]\n[h1] End spoiler[/h1]\n\nI did learn\
      \ about the ghost characters and how the Veil works, so that was good.  However,\
      \ there are some challenges I don't understand how to achieve and it is not\
      \ explained well.\n\nStill and all, I will recommend it just because I like\
      \ the overall game.  I would hope that with the next paid DLC you would get\
      \ at least 2 books worth of game play - by that I mean REAL game play, not just\
      \ rolling the dice as an NPC."
