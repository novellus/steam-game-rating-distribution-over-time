I played the middle one first, the last one second and the first one last.  My gaming pattern with his stuff is practically modeled after a ps1 survival horror game puzzle.  It's convoluted, you might fake yourself out on the solution but you'll come up with an answer somehow.  The bottom line is; The Swine was a decent short horror piece and Harthorn was pretty awesome n' unified experience, at least that's how I felt.  So, how did Deathbloom Chapter 1 stack-up?  It's pretty solid and even more impressive for a first effort into the genre from Lade.  \n\nAfter a short prologue of past events in a dreary mansion, our hero arrives at the looming Bachman Manor based on a letter he received in the mail.  It's a familiar sort of set-up the dreaded letter device (Silent Hill 2, the somewhat underrated Lethe, etc.); you've got history with someone at this strange place and you've got the sense that things just aren't right and might need some exploring.  You traverse your way through the gardens and sneak into the place with all manner of hell breaking loose after that.  For whatever reason, after playing so many games set in strange, massive Mansions (or similar monstrous buildings), I'll always have a thing for that finding this item to get to that room and slowly, deliberately going into the darker recesses of whatever evil secret that these edifices hold.  It worked in the Resident Evils, I enjoyed it in White Night, etc. etc. etc.\n\nOnce inside the manor, you more or less end up in the midst of a cult mistaking psychosis for psychotherapy brainwash and you have to search the place top to bottom, solve puzzles and even fight to stay alive.  The exploration was satisfying with enough pick-ups to survive scattered around if you take the time to look for them.  You'll be fetch questing like Fido, arming yourself with different weapons from firearms to bow n' arrow to hand-to-hand weapons, going up against the Manor's small variety of dedicated s.o.b.s who want to give you a home underneath Bachman's flower garden.\n\nFor the unity engine the environments look really good while atmospheric sound really gets in your head with a good set of noise-cancellers.  It's sound that renders your opponents scary because their animations aren't really up to snuff (especially their deaths), taking some immersion away when you fell your foes to see them ragdoll bounce like rubber or have their heads go full n' funny Jacob's Ladder at the very last moment.  Another downside is a few of the areas seem to lag into existence and it got me frustratingly and furiously killed unfairly twice by some mean-arse lil' masked entities.  It's not a constant problem the lag, so it wasn't too out of control though be prepared to recover some ground ol' skewl survival horror style if this happens because the game only saves at the beginning of new areas.  So keep that in mind.  Quick-witted players should be able to set these foes up to feed the death machine but you might need to adjust your settings just a bit to get the lag down in tight spots.  \n\nThe shooting and control on mouse/keyboard worked pretty well.  A touch more challenge would have been welcome but you do need to make your shots count in the early going or there is a good chance you could run out of ammo.  Later on all bets are off which made the more sinister late game areas a little too easy to plow through, though I actually appreciated the reward of better equipment the further you got to Bachman Manor's ugly, rotten core.  I've heard some complaints about the bow n' arrow but I ripped it up with that thing and was able to conserve a fair amount of ammunition to bring out the big guns later on.  Despite tacking this on at the end of the paragraph here I wanted to mention the map system; think it's a surprising highlight that helps you figure out where you need to go without feeding you all of the details on how to get there.  \n\nYour story is told through your character's inner text-based monologue and notes that solidly convey what's going on, especially for an indie title that is the developer's very first work.  A few of the areas, especially when you're unarmed in flooded basement maze are very harrowing and show a keen, advanced eye for tension that a lot of devs can't shove out the gate on that first title.  \n\nDeathbloom's not perfect and I hope that I conveyed the things that might turn off some players.  I feel old school survival horror players that have been around the block and prefer a fight instead of hiding in a locker full of gym shorts will have fun with this one.  This was definitely a good time and I wanted to play it every night till I finished it, once I finally booted it up.  I'll certainly be taking on Chapter 2 in the very near future.  A solid first effort all around.\n\n","timestamp_created":1608611557,"timestamp_updated":1608611557,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544364511966705322","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46I2uxPYCfaaMvAI="}
