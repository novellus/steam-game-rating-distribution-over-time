    review: 'This game had a number of pro''s: good graphics, nice gameplay (and certainly
      not boring), Nice story, strong environmental message. Unfortunately, there
      are too many bugs. There is a problem with double clicking: Sometimes the character
      starts to run (as is the intention), sometimes not.  After the third episode
      the game goes back to the map, without any options to go forward, so that''s
      it for the game. Support from the devs is slow.

      Got a nice mail from the devs to apologize, but apparently they haven''t got
      much time.'
