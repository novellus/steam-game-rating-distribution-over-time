I would refund it if I could.","timestamp_created":1606162901,"timestamp_updated":1606162901,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551020383834838867","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gJ2x+/UCcIaQsAI="}
