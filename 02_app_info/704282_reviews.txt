I am not sure if there was a patch to address some things in the 2 years that have passed since. So thats nice at least. \n\nStill a not recommended due to the weird traction behavior and sounds are lacking\n\n------------------------------\n\nI am a big aficionado of this locomotive.. collecting them in physical Ho an N scales, also all sorts of publications and what not about them. Only natural i get this in virtual form as well.\n\nPros\n- Interior looks ok. Not fantastic but ok for something that came out in 2018, even with TS engine limitations its just ok looking. \n- its a 1014\n\nCons\n- operation is a combination of clickable buttons and keyboard shortcuts\n- sounds are either too loud or too silent.  alerter? whats that? cant hear it.. zing e brake for you!\n- has decent amount of bugs. it loves to just not go. as if the throttle is not always communicating \n- wheel slip. dear holy trinity! on snowy weather this thing cant pull itself. it will literally lose traction and go from 80 to 0 in no gradient places and just get stuck there. it will not restart. you cannot move it when it stalls. not backward, not forward. remember the throttle thing? yeah... it just goes south and you have to reset the scenario.\n- sander seems to have no impact whatsoever\n- the dynamic throttle/brake lever that OBB is so famous for using on all tractive power is completely screwed up too. so is loco brake and even train brake. basically lots wrong with all control systems on this one. \n- nothing moves in the cab. no windows, no shades, no mirrors (you dont model the pop out mirrors on these? really? wow)... \n- the radio screens are black squares (left side of the panel) that are superimposed atop other textures.... jesus\n\n\nbuggy as sin. only buy if you really just want the 1014 in the game. and if you really really really want it. otherwise RUN AWAY FROM THIS GARBAGE","timestamp_created":1545471363,"timestamp_updated":1591159923,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526315808296203613","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k7ShvPICd4j8tQE="}
