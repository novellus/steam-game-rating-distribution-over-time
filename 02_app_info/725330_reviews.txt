I actually didnt expected that much qualify. it feels \n deep and melancholic. recommended strongly. but I actually dont like final scene. it wasnt serious and realistic unlike all the game. I believe it should end bad or with infinite suffer topic. despite it , worth to buy actually. also special thanks to a lot of language translation dev ! 9/10","timestamp_created":1598379266,"timestamp_updated":1609560524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzpDS4PYCcaHdnQI="}
