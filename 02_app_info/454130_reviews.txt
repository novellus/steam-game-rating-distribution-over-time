Also the hp bar added in the second game doesn't exist too - so it back to the \"one-hit-ko\" mode present in the first game. \nWhile the other protagonists share some \"agility\", the one here has a low-high jump that EASILY can make fall when trying to cross a pit. Also the enemies here are SMART and can counter - killing you EASILY! the ONLY good (useful) feature is the climbing/walking wall ability from the previous (second) game of the series.\n\nIf you don't played or know the prequel games I don't recomend this one! But if you like the hard-as-nail types of games, its your choice.\n\nI may say I was enticed to play it by the pixel art and the ninja appealing, but in the end it only bring me stressing moments due the extreme difficulty if compared to the other Ninjahtic games.","timestamp_created":1558568777,"timestamp_updated":1558646557,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lOGk8+oCdrTXwQE="}
