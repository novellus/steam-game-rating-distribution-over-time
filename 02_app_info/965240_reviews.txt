Its a solid game from start to finish in one of my favorite settings (Vampires, gothic) and only lacks one small, insignificant feature a majority of players expect today.\n\nIn the game you play as Liel a vampire who was betrayed by the King and your goal of course, is revenge. A very simple synopsis and it works well for context. All locations center around the Kingâ€™s castle in which you will move along a defined grid. If you have played games such as the Hitman or Lara Craft Go series it is the exact same. As you move one space, all(some) enemies will move. There are only 3 enemy types, one of which you cannot kill, but it all works as planned. If you kill 2 enemies you will be given the ability to turn into a swarm of bats(i think) that is able to move through an enemy. This will be vital in order to get to some exits. There are only 15 levels and it can feel like you are just getting started but it ends the story and journey properly.\n\nAnytime you purchase a game very cheap($2) you have a chance it can be a mess but this is actually, dare i say, polished? It works as intended, good animations, good graphics, solid musical score from start to finish which is so rare today. The only negative from players in discussion is the lack of achievements. That's not really a big deal to me but i guess that's a thing players i guess expect for any game today.\n\nPositives\n\nGood tactics game \nPerfect laptop game\nSolid game execution in all areas\n\n\n\nNegatives\n\nNo achievements\nA little short\nNot very challenging","timestamp_created":1593345858,"timestamp_updated":1593345858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnYu0/fICdNGAkQI="}
