    review: "music.   the music is in a weird spot. it walks a line between pleasant,\
      \ and boring. when I entered the park, the music was louder. and some times\
      \ I talked with characters, the music stopped.\n\ngameplay.   the little bits\
      \ we see of the world are nice. it does feel a little small, though, given every\
      \ one area has one picture. be pretty great if every place had different angles\
      \ to explore. the choice mechanic is nice. even if the choices are low, the\
      \ player still does choose to be with a specific character, to get a wanted\
      \ ending. it just needs a reputation meter. and a way to have more choices,\
      \ but not undermine the idea of spending time with one person to get that ending.\n\
      \nstory and setting.   the world building is so good! I love the idea of the\
      \ school being made from old wizards, teaching people about magic. having multiple\
      \ realms is a nice touch. the main character being from midguard, helps the\
      \ player feel like a lack of belonging. the magitech thing is amazing! they\
      \ just use magic to upgrade technology. given they have magic, so, of course\
      \ the tech would be decades behind! \n\ncharacters.   ooooh yeah. the characters\
      \ are so good! somehow, the game gives all of the main characters a lot of personality.\
      \ they all have breathing room to show who they are, which makes the moments\
      \ they talk with each other more believable.\n\nart.   the art is a strength\
      \ of this game. the character designs are vibrant, well crafted cartoons. they\
      \ look cute, and cool. it does make the people a bit predictable. for example...\
      \ Nill, is a gentle giant. (a cute one.) that's good for a cartoon. \n\noverall,\
      \ the game is great. even with some bugs, the story and characters make it a\
      \ fun world to be in. with some polishing, the game can reach it's full potential!"
