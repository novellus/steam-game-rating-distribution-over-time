It allows you to create an interactive book that sparks that little area we have neglected since childhood; imagination. Playing this game I reflect on the scene from the 1991 fantasy film ‘Hook’ were Pan, played by Robin Williams, learns to imagine the unseen world. I highly recommend this game to those seeking to read an interactive book or create adventures for others to enjoy. There is a lot to look forward to.","timestamp_created":1498615024,"timestamp_updated":1498615024,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.698526382446289063","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwmNGa9twCeczCfQ=="}
