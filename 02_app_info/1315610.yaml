    about_the_game: "Source of Madness takes place in an alternative reality where\
      \ the world did not go into the age of enlightenment, where magic and the monsters\
      \ of Lovecraft exist or rather allow you to exist. The world is steered and\
      \ controlled by cosmic entities where the human race hangs on in foolish attempts\
      \ to survive for yet another sunrise. You play as newly initiated acolytes at\
      \ the tower of knowledge, where people of Loam have taken shelter from the disturbing\
      \ hordes of monsters currently infesting the Loam Lands.<br><br>Your voyage\
      \ will not only be one of the depths in terra nor only the depths of treacherous\
      \ forests but to the grand non-euclidean citadel R\u2019Lyeh, to the moon, and\
      \ the celestial bodies on the rims of the universe!<br><br>These worlds warp\
      \ and distort with the current unstable space time leaving things each day different\
      \ and inhabited by deformed and grotesque beings of celestial origins. You are\
      \ only protected from the warp by the powers of the Tower of Knowledge, yet\
      \ now you have to voyage out, to find the twin tower, the Tower of Madness.<br><br><br><img\
