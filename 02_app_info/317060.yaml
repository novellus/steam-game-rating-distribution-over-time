    review: 'This one is unexpectedly good and satisfying puzzle platformer, not completely
      original in its basics, sure, but it successfully using well-known features
      of its famous predecessors the clever way.

      The game mechanics works fine, the characters are emotionally expressive and
      cooperate nicely, the sound and voice acting is a bit cartoony, but it only
      helps the game''s design. Lastly, the story here is exciting and the ending
      is excellent.'
