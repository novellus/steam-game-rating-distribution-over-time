What's not to love? Well, the fact that I can't get it to run, for one. \n\nI was looking forward to a bit of casual swashbuckling mayhem but the game won't launch, and there has been close to zero forum activity for the game since its release - 10 years ago. One of the few forum posts did mention a possible fix by downloading an un-named something which worked for some and not others, but I just don't feel like going through the effort when there are so many other games to play... So sadly I won't be recommending this one.","timestamp_created":1590115277,"timestamp_updated":1590115277,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.574435114860534668","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jLOQnfICffu1iQI="}
