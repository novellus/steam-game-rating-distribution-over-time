Not only you have decision-making that can turn the metalhead into a scholar (or a MORE HARDCORE METALHEAD) and a scholar girl into a metalhead (or a MORE HARDCORE SCHOLAR), you also have a schedule for each week in which you manage your energy, money, skills and activities for that week, pretty complete for visual novel standards.\n-The college ambience is greatly achieved, even though my personal college life was garbage I could still feel into the ambience of an exciting new college life when playing this.\n-The soundtrack is surprisingly good and satisfying! Way much better than I would expect from this type of game.\n-The art looks a bit average, but I personally liked it, it's not inconsistent with the rest of the game either.\n-The interaction with the characters feel wholesome in several points (although not all of them).\n-You can pick either a female protagonist or a male protagonist, and even date the one you do not pick.\n-Different to other visual novels that have characters with diverse sexualities and force them upon ALL CHARACTERS, this one has characters you will be able to date despite being the same gender, but others that you won't because they are straight. This makes the characters more consistent and the game less goofy.\n\nCons:\n-It's a nice detail that they added the +18 content enabling option, but if you see the cg you can clearly tell that's not what they were aiming for. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it can turn some people off.\n-I haven't actually tried a full playthrough on hard mode, but I'm pretty sure it makes some of the routes impossible to achieve.\n-There was an issue where the non-achievable routes didn't tell you they were not achievable so I had to try several times until realising it on my own, but it got fixed later on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-Anne best girl.","timestamp_created":1607702003,"timestamp_updated":1607702003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ407egqfYCeemQuQI="}
