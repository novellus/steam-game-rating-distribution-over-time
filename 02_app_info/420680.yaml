      Module</strong> brings the amazing Live2D Cubism technology to FaceRig, enabling
      hand-drawn avatars that move and behave as if they were 3D while keeping all
      the aspects that make hand-drawn 2D avatars special. Use the provided brand-new
      2D avatars (seven new ones!) or create your very own  (by using the Live2D Cubism
      Editor) and import them in FaceRig! <br>Read on to find out more details!<h2
      class="bb_tag">What is Live2D?</h2>Live2D is an amazing external technology
      developed by very talented and passionate people from Tokyo, Japan. It allows
      for 2D artwork to be animated as if it were 3D.<br>With the optional FaceRig
      Live2D Module, Live2D models can be imported in FaceRig as avatars.<br>If you
      are an artist you''ll be happy to know that the Live2D Cubism Editor for creating
      new Live2D models is available for FREE for individuals or small business entities
      (as defined by Live2D in their EULA), for both leisure and  commercial uses!
      For legal details (especially if you are a business) please read the Live2D
      Cubism Editor EULA.<h2 class="bb_tag">How do I create Live2D avatars for FaceRig?</h2>You
      simply create a regular Live2D model by using the Cubism Editor and tutorials
      provided by Live2D, and then you tweak it using the FaceRig documentation and
      import it in FaceRig as a user-made Live2D Avatar. You can even upload them
