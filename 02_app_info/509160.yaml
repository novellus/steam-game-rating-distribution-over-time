    review: "It's criminal this game has just 13 reviews, so I'm going to do my part\
      \ to fix that. \n\nGebub's Adventure is a delightful light platformer that lasts\
      \ about 60-90 minutes. You play as Gebub, an orb-egg thing, who needs to explore\
      \ the world and collect orbs and make friends with various animals. The whole\
      \ game is hand drawn, there are a bunch of different areas, the platforming\
      \ is quite light and friendly, and there are no enemies. This is the perfect\
      \ palate cleanser after a long or tough game. The art is adorable, the music\
      \ is lovely, the environments are fun, there are lots of different little things\
      \ to discover (I loved the roach catapult, I loved the mole family portrait,\
      \ I loved the little guy who rescues you when you fall off a ledge in purple\
      \ zone). Just a dense, fun, little thing! \n\nHighly recommended, and at $2.99\
      \ on sale ($4.99 regular), you could even buy a couple copies for friends!"
