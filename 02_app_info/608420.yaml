      her imminent death, she realizes that she will leave this world having no significant

      Akari, a young woman who has spent the past ten years alone in a hospital, the

      of regrets about what happened, she wishes only to live &quot;in the world of
      closed eyes&quot; and sleep -- forever.<br><br>But one day, the two lost souls
      cross paths, and in that chance meeting their journey begins...
