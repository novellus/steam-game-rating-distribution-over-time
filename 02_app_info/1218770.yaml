    review: I love the card game of Canasta. This one  offered has not worked our
      the kinks.  One of the basic things is does not do is sometimes it doesn't let
      you pick up the pile. you want.  Sometimes too many cards laid down get in the
      way of others. You can try to ignore the problems and play on through, but it
      is not really very satisfying. I would recommend Carcassonne and Ticket to Ride
      as good games.
