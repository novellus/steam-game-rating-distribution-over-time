But i felt the game was lacking in story and the ending was a little anti climatic and could of used a little more story and intensity to it instead of \"yay you got away!\" if it had a little more it'll be awesome, But that's just my opinion.","timestamp_created":1609901038,"timestamp_updated":1609901038,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm4vl6vYCe9XxwAI="}
