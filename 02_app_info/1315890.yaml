    review: 'This seems to be a rerelease of an older game. It doesn''t support modern
      resolutions and generally looks old and clunky.


      It''s kind of not what I was expecting, in that it''s not much of a simulator;
      driving the truck doesn''t feel realistic and isn''t even a big part of the
      game. It''s mostly focused on collecting garbage, taking it to the truck and
      then taking the bin back. Controls are unintuitive, making you press space to
      hop off the truck even though it feels like trying to move should do that automatically.


      This is really a classic "thumb sideways" recommendation. I can''t praise this
      game, but it fills a unique niche and for the price it''s pretty fun. I feel
      like if you''re looking at this, you probably know if you''re interested in
      this kind of game or not.'
