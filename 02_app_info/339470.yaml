    reviews: "\u201CWhile Retention doesn't last long it is a worthwhile experience,\
      \ and you'll need to play through three times to see all the photographs. I\
      \ found it to be intriguing and engaging during my short time with it.\u201D\

      \ is the only game I have ever seen try to create an experience consisting only\
      \ of photos, it does so remarkably well, and creates an interesting game out\

      \ is a stylish staging of hundreds of photos, turning the collection into a\
      \ character building exercise somewhere between \u201CMemento\u201D and \u201C\
      Choose Your Own Adventure\u201D titles. Can a man be truly defined by frozen\
      \ moments of his history? Is identity really just a question of perspective?\u201D\

    review: "well, i'm really mad cause of the potential that's wasted here. \n\n\
      retracing back memories is a solid idea indeed. but i cannot find any correlation\
      \ between most photos between the character and what they may represent. Most\
      \ of the time i am choosing a photo just randomly. I do sincerely want the creators\
      \ to remake a game with a similar concept with consistent photos/memories between\
      \ the main character and game's endings."
