    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">This is a remake of a popular game that was
      released more than 30 years ago and has been updated and improved.</h2>This
      game is based on the game first released in 1988 on the PC called &quot;First
      Queen&quot;. (Later, it was also released on home console machines)<br>The game
      screen has been made larger, battles allowing using a 2nd battalion of troops,
      and the overall game play has been upgraded to improve playability!<h2 class="bb_tag">The
      First Queen Born in Ornic.</h2>The Queen was full of ambition to control the
      world and began marching south.<br>However, countries that faced her were not
      unified and fell before her army marching towards Ornic.<br>With the fall of
      his country, Count Richmont begins a counterattack with Crucible soldiers.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Original Game System</h2>Your subordinates will usually attack
      and retreat according to orders, but they will do so based on their individual
      personalities.<br>There are also characters and items that were not in the original,
      such as nurses who are dedicated to treat the wounded without any regard to
      danger and also soldiers who are able to fully use special items.<br>The tribes
      that make up the nation may become enemies or allies as the game progresses.<br>Defeating
      an enemy leader can turn the concerning enemy troops into allies.<br><br>Players
      can take control of a character and move them out of dire situations. In other
      words, basically, you are their &quot;guardian&quot;.<br>If the characters are
      in a battle they can win, you can leave them alone. When fighting against a
      stronger foe, use of items and other abilities might be required.<br>A weak
      character will quickly retreat when their &quot;LIFE&quot; decreases.<br>If
      they leave the battle and stay away from enemies, they can quickly recover to
      fight again.<br>This has resulted in a system where &quot;even strong soldiers
      will be in danger if surrounded&quot;.<br>It is a system for heroes to fight
      in groups instead of facing battles alone.<br><br>In the same manner as a typical
      simulation game, many units are spread throughout the country.<br>Over time,
      some enemy units will march towards your castle.<br>You also need a strategy
      on where to stop powerful units.
