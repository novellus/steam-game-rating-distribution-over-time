As for myself, I loved the game!\n\nThe background is set in a dystopian future where FTL travel, and more importantly, instantaneous communication across unlimited distances have changed everything. Human built AI have surpassed and eclipsed humanity, and Tolva is occupied by competing AI factions to determine the source and purpose of a mysterious signal. The included manual provides a very well thought-out prelude to the environment, and if you are old school like myself and like manuals, this game has you well covered.\n\nTSFT will not hold your hand, it is obtuse. Figuring out how it works is half the fun, but essentially, you have to blast your way across Tolva, scanning for resources and data as a hacked AI host and taking over bases. Gunplay is where this game shines, it looks cool, it sounds cool, and blowing robots to hell never gets old (for me anyway).\n\nI'll break this into pros and cons, and will say that this game, while definitely up my alley, may not be to your tastes.\n\nPros:\nGunplay is fun. Battles between factions, when they occur, are beautiful to watch.\nAtmospheric and immersive.\nMysterious.\nEXCELLENT artwork all around (sound, graphics, animations, all very well done!)\nDecent music.\nWorld is well built, has a very creative back-story.\nOnce you understand how it works, it does not take long to get back into it and have fun. It is simple, in a good way.\n\nCons (in order of severity, worst first):\nGame is not well optimized, I'm seeing marginal framerates on high-end PC's, and terrible framerates on low-end systems.\nWorld is too open for the amount of AI that inhabit it. You will spend a lot of time running. If the title were to be optimized and the AI population doubled, my guess is that the \"Mixed\" review status would change to \"Mostly Positive\".\nCould use more variety, more enemy types, more weapons, more special equipment.\nGame has a \"capture-the-flag\" feel (a core mechanic is that different AI factions can assault and take over bases), but there is really no way to fortify the bases you take. Bases you assault generally never have more than 4 bots defending, could definitely use more (perhaps a result of the sub-par optimization).\nGame is short, can be completed in 7-10 hours for someone with mediocre FPS skills like myself, though I like the occasional short game in my library that I can play through over and over, so for me this is not a big issue.\nThe storyline that you are feed from the signals you retrieve is too obtuse. I played through the game, read most of the manual, and still don't quite understand it.\n\nI'm going to give away my age here, but this game reminds me of a game I loved as a child, Lucasart's \"Koronis Rift\". I don't know why this game reminds me of that title so much, but it is a good thing!\n\nIn conclusion, watch a few videos before you purchase this. \"Worth a buy\" on YouTube has a pretty good review, though I disagree with his thumb-down, it is a fair review that I believe is a fairly accurate description of the pros and cons of this game, and is pretty close to my own review here. Big Robot also has another great title, \"Sir You are Being Hunted\", that is worth a look (I am not paid or employed by them, just a fan of their work so far). I grabbed this on the Steam winter sale for about $5, at that price it was an absolute steal.\n","timestamp_created":1609385723,"timestamp_updated":1609385723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x6i32/YCeLP+vgI="}
