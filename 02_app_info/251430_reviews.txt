Maybe it's due to it's age and/or running on Proton?! Would only work in windowed mode in Linux, so had to go to Proton. But the game is really neat, with great animation and great story! The dialog is something else, they really put a lot of thought and imagination into it and the story. \n\nJust make sure you save the saveFile-1.tiw (the number is the slot) a lot in a separate folder and rename so can pick which one want to restart with. Especially when meet Steve/Pete! You don't want to go too far back if making the dough doesn't work correctly.  Also save a lot cause if you alt-tab, it might not come back and you will have to stop and restart the game. Sometime the videos lock-up. Fun game, but do the above and you won't get so frustrated you rage quit.","timestamp_created":1609812468,"timestamp_updated":1609812689,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hoiU6PYCfMTJwAI="}
