The ending sequence was epic and jaw-dropping. If you are choosing games based on the \"casualness\" of them, this one tends toward a more challenging (and rewarding) experience! Hidden Object puzzles were also a cut above in detail and depth. This was one of the better games i've played in recent months and the effects and difficulty of puzzles were intriguing.  The game has withstood the test of time, as relevant today as it was at its release years ago. Highly recommended!","timestamp_created":1604018254,"timestamp_updated":1604018254,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi4a8u/UCcdn6qgI="}
