Got the \"game\" almost as soon as it came out, I was really excited about it. Nothing happened at all for a while. Then I thought I'd check it out again after a few months to see what was new and worse, this time it asked me to sign in / register and my account didn't work anymore. I tried to make a new one but it's not possible anymore. The website has been completely abandoned and their forums (which have like 30 legit posts from the first month it came out) and taken over by spammers and scammers. I asked Steam for a refund like a month ago but it was too late already since I've had this \"game\" for a year now.","timestamp_created":1609760269,"timestamp_updated":1609760269,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4rIzM5vYCeMquwAI="}
