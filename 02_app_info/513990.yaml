    review: 'Completed the game on expert all missions 3xStar. Achievements are broken,
      devs will probably wont bother fixin them(as seen on discussion panel - "game
      is too old"). Had few holds on missions due to bad design, but they are all
      passable. A lot of bugs(Tip: don''t alt+tab during mission or game will just
      close and you will lose mission progress). Pacing in missions is wrong too,
      sometimes had to afk for few minutes for resoureces to gather at the end of
      mission. overall its not "Happy Empire" its "Sad empire". Cheers'
