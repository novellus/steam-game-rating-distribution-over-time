It may seem like a huge hurdle, but once you get your mind past the unlocks and just concentrate on the leaderboard, it becomes all or nothing.\n\nSet in a retro 90's look with it's vibrant landscapes and scan lines, you feel right at home. (Well I do). \n\nThe chiptune music sets the scene for the 3 stages the game throws at you. First a light tune as the first wave of enemy ships spawn in, then a faster arrangement as the flying centipedes swoop around and finally the boss music kicks, and you know by then, things are gonna go down.\n\nIn no way does it sound annoying or repetitive (I'm currently 10hrs in), the only annoyance is when you die and have to start again from scratch...but which you do immediately :D\n\nRage quitting is easy to do too, but like all rage quitting games, like Super Hexagon... you always feel the need to give it one more try.\n\nAnother awesome thing is that the dev is constantly engaging with the fan base and developing the game based on feedback.\nWe've seen more worlds to fly around in and new ways to reach new heights on the board.\n\nThe controls are tight too and no death feels cheap.\n\nIf you love highscorers, there's no better title than Skycadia to fullfill your need.\n\nDo I reccomend this game?\n\nHELL YEAH!!! :D","timestamp_created":1609421172,"timestamp_updated":1609422138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqZ3C3PYCdPOMvwI="}
