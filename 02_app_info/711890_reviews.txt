The mini games are not all run of the mill which I found quite brilliant. The variety is one unlike any other H.O.G. I have played as of yet. The only tiny negative I have is I found the story line a bit on the boring side. But hey, that is just my opinion. Great game and as always well worth the money, Thanx","timestamp_created":1603092006,"timestamp_updated":1603092006,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx9jun/UCeZrkqAI="}
