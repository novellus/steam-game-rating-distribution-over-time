It really depends what type game you like. This is a relaxing game of adjusting sails on your sailboat and cruising around the water and honestly that is all..  I'm not even sure if I can recommend this game. It would have been nice if the wind changes occasionally, maybe a music player or just SOMETHING/ANYTHING to do while cruising around but there isn't. Once you adjust sails and start moving, you are done....\nI can handle a relaxing experience but I cannot even vouch for that. Put more islands in the game, an occasional boat somewhere, something to see, changing wind, big waves from time to time, anything would be good in this game except just sitting there and looking at water...  I cannot recommend for anything more than a few dollars although a group of friends may be okay just to go out and chat..... \n","timestamp_created":1608966155,"timestamp_updated":1608966155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r+X2zvYCc76mvQI="}
