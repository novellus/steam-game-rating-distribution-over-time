    review: 'This is a fun game don''t get me wrong, the main thing that makes me
      suggest not getting this game is 1. its price for a dollar even for 50 cents
      it is way too little content to validate that pricetag. 2. the game has no save
      feature so each time you play, your progress will NOT BE SAVED. 3. the game
      needs more customization and options 4. the bugs (there are a lot of bugs) 5.
      last but not least the game is just bare, it needs more context and a tutorial
      and maybe a day and night system.

      I suggest playing it but do not expect something you can play for a long time,
      maybe if you are up late at night and cannot sleep and wanna kill some time.
      Otherwise, save your money for something that saves your progress.'
