I miss the skate 3 memories because this is skate 4 but the positives is that the game has very good graphics it's easy to run and a good game to play when your board would like to see some more maps and MULTIPLAYER but other than that it is great to play they challenges and I mean a lot of challenges and I'm happy they added a super ultra mega park like it's called the big ramp and it's a sick park to skate on they should release more updates on this game and definitely add MULTIPLAYER PLEASE !!!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1609937035,"timestamp_updated":1609937035,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ477Pu6/YCcdb+wAI="}
