Ignore my running time as the game was left open and not played for prolonged periods of time. My actual completion time was about 9 hours and I didnt use any walkthrough assistance. The puzzles were good although a few required some thinking outside the box. There were only two negatives in my opinion. First Kelvin moves very slowly and there is often backtracking required (especially if you dont use hints). Also I would have liked the final chapter to be a little longer and harder.  I highly recommend this game especially if you can get it on sale.","timestamp_created":1609707023,"timestamp_updated":1609707083,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4z5qB5fYCd7KYwAI="}
