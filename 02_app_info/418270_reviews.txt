Amazing that this simple, cheap game makes you feel more like a badass ninja than many triple A games do. \nThe game can get fiddly, and there were a few bosses in the story mode that made my blood pressure rise pretty fast. But the game's irreverent humour, gorgeous audio, excellent visuals and solid slashy gameplay kept me pushing forward to the end. \nHighly recommended. For the 2-3 hours of fun this'll likely give you, it's well worth the price. üëç","timestamp_created":1605317479,"timestamp_updated":1605317479,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pZmY4vUCcJmdrgI="}
