However, it neither contains the Ju-87 nor the He-111. Please add them to this pack, Eagle Dynamics. \nThis pack should really be free, so more virtual pilots can enjoy WWII airplanes. In my opinion, the warbirds in DCS provides us with a very authentic experience. How can I be sure of that? Because I read quite some books written by real fighter pilots of world war 2, British, American, and German. Their stories match with DCS warbirds! \nDue to the reason above, I recommend this pack with a little bit of hesitation. I wish it had carriers, Japanese Zeros, and Pensacola's map because so many allied pilots trained in that base.","timestamp_created":1607869637,"timestamp_updated":1607869637,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mPSfrvYCcpPsuQI="}
