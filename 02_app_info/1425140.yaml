    review: "This game has all of the bones of an amazing game! A few patches and\
      \ it'll be something I could sink some hours into.\n\nWith that being said,\
      \ this game has some major bugs in its current state. Pressing ESC key hard\
      \ closed the game. My HUD all appears cut off so I can't see my ammo or points\
      \ to unlock things. \n\nI would still recommend this game given that it was\
      \ created by one person and a few patches could really improve the game."
