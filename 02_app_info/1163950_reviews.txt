Two of the mini games in it kept glitching out.  One time I had a timer that just stopped at 65 seconds and could no longer do anything else.  Dropping cows made them disappear instead of dropping.  The burn down trees minigame didn't register any tree being burned down, and I burned down all three different types of them in the game.  Which brings me to how little there is in the game.  There's just a handful of assets in the game so it has a painful cut/paste feel to it.  And there is a lot of nothing.  The island feels like a low effort generic island from a budget 90's game.  The intro video shows almost the entire game.  I've circled and checked the island and I'm decently sure I've seen all content there is in about half an hour.  Some textures will load sooner in one eye than the other and that gives you the feeling that you have vision problems.  I've never had that issue in any other vr game.  There's no landing, you slide and that may result in strange launches around the area which makes reading the instructions for the minigames it's own challenge. \n\nThe flying mechanic IS interesting and it's one of those easy to do but challenging to master movement systems.  I've gotten motion sickness in other games but I was fine in this one.  That's the only redeeming feature in this game.  It is fun, but there's just not much to do with it.","timestamp_created":1571887848,"timestamp_updated":1571887848,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.576923072338104248","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1571957377,"developer_response":"We are sorry you've had this experience, would you mind telling us which sort of headset/controllers you were using as we've not seen these bugs during testing.\n\nAs for the lack of content, we've got a lot of content that is already finished and will be coming through on patch 1.1 including 3 more npc types, 2 more minigames and some visual overhauls.\n\nThank you for the critique, it is useful to catch these things early, this is our first release so we are still learning."}],"cursor":"AoJwpKP0/e0Cf8PQ1AE="}
