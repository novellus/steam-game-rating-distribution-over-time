I try not to negatively judge something because it's old. I'm in my mid-50's and I don't think myself less because my body is aging. Actually quite the opposite, I'm a much better person now than I ever was. Steel Fury Kharkov 1942 is like that. The youthful flesh has wrinkled and aged but underneath is some solid gameplay. \n\nI own IL-2 Tank Crew (I love IL-2:GB) and Steel Fury should be the example of how to make it more enjoyable. Tanks with infantry support, historical missions, sounds of war all around. SF feels like you're in an important battle to fight in the \"Meat Grinder\" in and around Kharkov. \n\nFrom the starting line you've three choices of tanks, but if you take a few minutes to add the mod, STA (Steel Tank Addon) it'll add many more tanks and missions, and give a minor facelift to the graphics.\n\nThis's a simulation so you'll be able to take whatever tank position you desire, give orders as the commander, or drive it, or load the shells, or look down the sight searching for armor and infantry as the gunner. This's a tough game and it'll require patience and strategy. \n\nA few folks have complained of the resolution on newer computers, so be aware of that. However there's a fix. I had that issue from the Gamersgate's Steel Fury edition I bought ten years ago, and I found a fix. SF works just fine for me on the Steam edition.\n\nIf you can step aside from wanting the shiniest toy that doesn't have much substance, to the worn, but true, toy that does, SF will give you many hours of difficult but very fun tank battles in a unique setting.","timestamp_created":1599161544,"timestamp_updated":1609294070,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.762521564960479736","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj9jZ2PYCcbzLnwI="}
