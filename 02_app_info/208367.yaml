    review: "The SW1500 pack was a pretty mixed bag back when it was $20. \n\ntldr:\
      \ If you are a scenario creator, you'll want this. If you download American\
      \ rail scenarios from the workshop you'll want this. If you don't do either\
      \ of the above, give a skip. There's little of value if you aren't into workshop\
      \ content. \n\nFirst he bad... And content creators likely won't care about\
      \ it. There are only two scenarios. Back when it was full price that was pretty\
      \ flimsy - especially since it comes with 10 liveries. Now that it's so cheap?\
      \ Not a big deal in my book. The worst part is, one of them is completely broken.\
      \ You can finish it, but it'll take about 10-15 minutes longer than the scenario\
      \ allows giving you several thousand neg points. Loading it up in the editor,\
      \ it says everything is completely broken to the point that it should not even\
      \ start - yet it does. The two scenarios utilize the Union Pacific and BNSF\
      \ variant. (The BNSF scenario is the broken one.)\n\nThe neutral is that it's\
      \ a very old pack. From a distance they look just fine. Up close, you'll notice\
      \ their age. Like some of the really old TS locomotives they suffer from Stretchy\
      \ Coupler Syndrome but at the lower speeds you'll be using it and the shorter\
      \ consists... It's pretty manageable and of course they'll work fine running\
      \ around slowly as AI trains in scenarios.\n\nThe good is that these make outstanding\
      \ yard duty AI switchers for scenarios. They look at home in most any American\
      \ yard and they certainly add to the realism. I feel that if you're driving\
      \ a train past a yard and you see one or two of these moving freight around,\
      \ it just adds so much! \n\n+ Famous switches that were yard work horses for\
      \ decades. Great for workshop content. \n+ Very inexpensive price for a plethora\
      \ of liveries. (it'll fit most US railroads)\n+ Sounds are a bit dated, but\
      \ they do the job well enough. The engine sound is quite good.\n\n- Only 2 scenarios,\
      \ one of which is broken. \n- The physics need updating/fixing and have been\
      \ ignored like so much of the old content\n\nAs I stated above, if you're into\
      \ workshop content, it's a must have. If not, skip it. You're not missing much."
