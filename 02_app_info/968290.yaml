    review: "[h1] Genre [/h1] Ein Pac-Man Klon\n\n[h1] Story [/h1] Wie auch im Vorg\xE4\
      nger wollen Aliens Illegal durch ein Portal auf die Erde kommen, das m\xFCssen\
      \ wir erneut verhindern indem wir ihr Portal schliessen\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\
      \ Ein simpler Pac Man Klon. Es spielt sich genau wie der Vorg\xE4nger. Wir laufen\
      \ umher und m\xFCssen alle Sumpf/Gras Felder entfernen indem wir einfach dar\xFC\
      ber laufen. Es gibt verschiedene Aliens die uns daran hindern m\xF6chten, manche\
      \ sind schnell, manche verfolgen uns gezielt. Wenn wir 3 mal getroffen werden,\
      \ heisst es \"Game Over\" und wir m\xFCssen von vorne anfangen bzw. das Level\
      \ wiederholen. Es gibt nat\xFCrlich auch Power Ups die uns helfen z.B. um schneller\
      \ zu werden, um Aliens zu vernichten oder um uns zu Heilen. Nach gut 20-30 Minuten\
      \ hat man es dann auch schon durch gespielt\n\n[h1] Pro/Contra [/h1]\n+ Kurz\n\
      + Humorvoll\n+ Musik OK\n+ XBox 360 Controller Support\n\n- Leider Keine Achievements\n\
      \n[h1] Fazit [/h1] Ein Netter Humorvoller Pac Man Klon. Durchaus einen Blick\
      \ Wert"
