    review: "OK let's start with the good aspects of the game.\nPros:\n- This is what\
      \ it could be if Dirt Rally with Dirt 4 had one pure arcade rally child.\nThe\
      \ game is difficult enough, it has good physic, preloads, inertia, aquasplaning,\
      \ \npendulum effect, etc are all there, plus great terrain implementation. There\
      \ are all the usual\nrally mods, Rally, RX, Baha buggies (landrush), Hillclimb\
      \ and extreme Khana (Joyride).\nEven the career is quite similar to Dirt Rally's\
      \ one.\n- Physic is quite good for an arcade title. Maybe too good for an arcade\
      \ title.\n- Exterior sounds, like gravel, crashes on metal parts, snow, car\
      \ landing are excellent.\n- Graphics are OK, passable, and the locations are\
      \ nice enough.\n- Random Generated rally stages is better implemented here than\
      \ Dirt 4.\n- Interiors are very nicely done.\n- All the Rally modes are interesting\
      \ enough.\n- There is a healthy pool of cars and tracks, even if there are about\
      \ 6 locations.\n- Split screen is always welcome.\n- Test Area is included.\n\
      \nAnd now the ugly one.\nCons: \n- Game is a huge grind.\n- Music is unbearable\n\
      - Tutorial is about a hour long, boring and unskippable. \n- Colors of the cars\
      \ looks faded.\n- Co-Driver calls are debated. Sometimes he is so slow, even\
      \ with \"too early\" setting, \nthat in the time he makes the call you are already\
      \ into the turn. So you are forced \nto use the chase view.\n- Performance is\
      \ all over the place, with 30 to 40 fps drop in some areas.\n- Collision boxes\
      \ of some road objects are frustrating. You could end crashing into one, \n\
      even if there was definitely enough distance in between, and they have a glue\
      \ effect.\n- AI records in some rally stages are questionable. On the other\
      \ hand AI is pathetic in \nV-Rally Cross.\n- Engines sound are all over the\
      \ place.\n- There is no point of rain and wipers. There is no rain effect on\
      \ windscreen.\n- It feels like a tech demo just before the WRC 8 title.\n\n\n\
      I enjoy V-Rally and can recommend it, with a disclaimer. This game is a weird\
      \ one, it is not pure arcade rally like e.g. Sega Rally or maybe Gravel, and\
      \ it is definitely not a sim one, and I don't know if I can classify it as simcade\
      \ too. From my point of view I like it because it feels like a Dirt \"Lite\"\
      \ and I can see someone that can't  use to Dirt Rally, trying this one."
