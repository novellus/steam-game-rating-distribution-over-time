    review: 'Although I like quite a few songs from this game, the soundtrack release
      is hit and miss with what I wanted. On several songs, they added dialogue from
      the game that shouldn''t have been added like Odin''s Theme, Kill You Through
      Sound, Loot Loot Loot, and HMS Serpentantic. Whoever approved this release couldn''t
      make up their minds if this was an instrumental release or one with moments
      of the game added to each song.


      That isn''t to say no one should buy it. The main menu theme and a few other
      songs are released as intended for a soundtrack to be. I''m mostly salty the
      songs I didn''t want voice work had voice overs added to them. That and most
      of the songs are obnoxious, so anyone buying this will typically be buying it
      for only themselves to listen to, or to counter protests on their streets. :
      ) You''ll clear a crowd very fast on full blast, as my own family can attest.'
