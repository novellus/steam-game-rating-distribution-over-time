This looks like a high school project that could've gone through a bit more polishing before attempting to sell it. Here's some good and some bad points that I've experienced while playing:\n\nPros: \n* Art is pleasant on the eyes\n* Gameplay is simple and easy to understand\n* Overall balance is spot on\n* Story is unique and intriguing\n\nCons:\n* Not enough character interactions! I'd like to see more between this odd party of people. Perhaps make inns/rest points have little cut scenes periodically when resting at one.\n* Too much grinding. Yes, i get you want the characters to be ready for the big bad but that's literally all that makes up the game play. Fight after fight after fight. It gets tedious, boring, and annoying.\n* Exploration is very limited. There aren't many npcs to interact with, nor puzzles, nor lore. I want more adventure! I want more dialog! I want to know more about this world!","timestamp_created":1599768545,"timestamp_updated":1599768545,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.598466336727142334","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47tjovPQCc/+BoQI="}
