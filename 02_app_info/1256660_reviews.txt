I'd equate the hardest bosses in this game with the hard difficulty of Touhou 6.  The low difficulty does make the game accessible to beginners, but a mode with a much higher difficulty would've been neat.  If you're on the fence about the game, but enjoy bullet hells, I'd recommend getting this game when it's on sale.  More thoughts below.\n\nYou're basically open to fight most of the bosses in whatever order you want, with no minor enemies in between them; a huge plus in my opinion.  It also makes the game quite short which isn't too much a big deal since re-fighting the bosses is a pretty good time, though like I said earlier, it would've benefited from having a mode with higher difficulty.\n\nThere's polish to be had; the music isn't terribly memorable, some fights have really janky mechanics, certain cutscenes softlocking you in walls, and so forth.  These don't occur terribly often in my time replaying the game, but they happen often enough that it might irritate someone playing through the game casually.  Hebi's roar comes to mind.","timestamp_created":1608263791,"timestamp_updated":1609210041,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qpKZ1vYCf7GMuwI="}
