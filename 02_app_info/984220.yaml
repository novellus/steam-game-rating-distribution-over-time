    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">OVERVIEW</h2>Alien 911 is a hybrid 3rd person
      shooter and tower defense game. You can play it solo or team up for local or
      online multiplayer. We took our inspiration from Orcs Must Die, Dungeon Defenders,
      and Sanctum which are games we loved to play together as a family. This is our
      first game and we're excited to bring it to the Steam community.<h2 class="bb_tag">BACKGROUND</h2>Development
      of this game started more than 5 years ago as a way to teach my two sons and
      my daughter about programming. As a family, we were hooked on the hybrid shooter
      + tower defense genre and my son was obsessed with drawing alien creatures.
      We mashed them together with a father's desire to show his kids that they could
      not only play video games, but they could also learn to create them, and that
      was the original genesis of our game. Fast-forward to present day and with my
      kids off to college I decided to dust off the old game idea and enlist the help
      of some great indie-friendly artists, animators, and developers bring it to
      life.<h2 class="bb_tag">KEY FEATURES</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>MULTIPLE

    review: The only reason I'm giving this game a negative review is because they
      lied about being out of early access.  I had this game on my wishlist for a
      while now, because when the game comes out of early access it sends you an email.  I
      received this email and immediately purchased it with excitement, because I
      love this genre.  Upon loading up the game however, I get a giant message says
      "we're still in early access" Only 2 of the planets are available for playing,
      and there's lots of things that are clearly unpolished.  I'm incredibly annoyed
      that they would advertise themselves on steam as being a fully released game
      when they clearly are not.
