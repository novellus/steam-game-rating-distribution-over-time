The base game runs completely stable for me. Haven't had a single crash in the ~68 hrs of main campaign and conquering the universe so far. \n\nThen I made the mistake of starting the DLC. Crashes constantly, the weird (and almost completely unexplained) battle system is bugged and freaky - battles restarting instead of being won, battles being lost when you have overwhelming advantage if you're not there personally (then why bother with the focus on warfleets?), battles being aborted when you arrive, and some more crashes. Did I mention the battles spawn out of nowhere with a VERY short timer, so you better drop everything and get there as soon as you can? But wait, they're story missions, which means you can't T-Drive into them, you have to sublight from some distance away. Joy.\n\nBetter forget doing ANYTHING else if you start this DLC, is what I'm saying.\n\nThe large fleet battles also seem to feature enemies not firing consistently, leading to them being slaughtered en masse - which might be a byproduct of the immense amount of enemies the game throws at you. Constant spam of dreadnaughts, carriers, DOZENS of battleships. I don't even notice anything smaller anymore. It's boring, repetitive and bugged to boot. Just a slog to get through for the next story checkpoint. \n\nThe Titans themselves are okay, if you like massive overpowered warships that feel like godmode and handle like a brick through molasses. The game was easy enough with the Deadly Perun (or any well-appointed carrier, really), but Titans are invincible and since the enemy doesn't have Titans of their own outside the buggy and boring DLC, there is no challenge to their superiority. \n\nStory-wise, it's just as inane and lacking context as the rest of Warlords, but Starpoint Gemini was always like that, from the first game on: A richly appointed universe with lots of backstory that is never actually explained anywhere. It SEEMS like there is more going on, but unless you are the devs, you wouldn't ever know.\n\nSupposedly, there is an option at the beginning of the DLC to basically say \"screw this, I'm outta here\" and just get the TItans as buyable ships in the HQ. There is a choice, but it is a story one - I suppose I will be reverting to an older save and taking the other option (\"path of conquest\"), hoping it will spare me the story.\n","timestamp_created":1606652744,"timestamp_updated":1606652744,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlOr9ifYCd+KVtQI="}
