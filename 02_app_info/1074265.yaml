    review: "These pantyhose textures look like this is not a fighting game from year\
      \ 2019 but MMORPG from 2004. And season passes for this game still not only\
      \ cost more than the base game, but they also are literally one season of a\
      \ year.\n I wish I worked at the modeling/texturing departament at koei tecmo,\
      \ and under my control there was no such a shameless content rehash with zero\
      \ quality control. And also I would bring back core values. Just look at that\
      \ awful texture on her hip! IT IS CURRENT F****NG YEAR, KOEI TECMO, THESE TEXTURES\
      \ ARE HALF-LIFE 2! This does NOT represent or highlight the quality of textures\
      \ and models that your engine can show not in a musou but in a FIGHTING GAME\
      \ where there are only TWO high quality characters on the screen at the same\
      \ time.\n Honestly this and many other character costume packs need a massive\
      \ rework and quality control, and not only they look very dated but they are\
      \ generally ugly and tasteless.\n I wanted to purchase this game's full DLC\
      \ list but watching how this looks up close and how other unoriginal, uninspired,\
      \ tasteless, rehashed and straight up copied character costumes look, I don't\
      \ want to support this game and it's developer/distributor with any money. Unfortunately\
      \ I already payed a ton. Ah who am I kidding, I will probably spend more.\n\n\
      \ Ah yes, they say that \"this game's content might be inappropriate for some\
      \ ages blah blah blah\", well WHERE IS INAPPROPRIATE CONTENT? This game has\
      \ red flags and security guards with assault rifles standing all around the\
      \ perimeter of it's steam store page warning my mom that this game has sexual\
      \ content, and I am too young to play this game, and yet when I'm finally alone\
      \ and I sneak to computer, take out the battery cell from motherboard to override\
      \ the BIOS password and start the game to breath heavy while staring at the\
      \ screen, there is nothing to see!"
