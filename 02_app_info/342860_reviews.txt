If you select a hero, and that hero is on a pile of gold, he'll waste his action picking up the gold instead of doing what you were planning to do. That's just one example; about one quarter of the clicks do something that I do not want. I am fighting the game designers instead of the creatures in the dungeon, it's horrible. I thought Dark Quest 2 was bad on this front, but 1 is waaaaay worse.","timestamp_created":1609777430,"timestamp_updated":1609777430,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw38eN5/YCcNO3wAI="}
