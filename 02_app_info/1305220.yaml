    review: 'I gave this a chance in the sale as it seems that nobody else wanted
      to, its been out since May...


      I had fun playing this game, I was pleasantly surprised by the game-play.


      Yes it has simplistic graphics, but it makes up for it with quality fun moments.


      I this a series of, mini-game challenges with progressively harder levels which
      I will be playing again.


      See below for my first impressions and a review score.
