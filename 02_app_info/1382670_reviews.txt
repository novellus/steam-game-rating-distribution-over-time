The price of this game is really worth it. The take-off of the game is like an aircraft carrier, and there is no problem with keyboard operation. More of it is shooting scenes, which is not the kind of entry-level flight. You can see Trump. It's playing with relatively degassing. It's realistic and difficult to control it. Air combat shooting needs to get used to speed. The main reason is that my VR glasses are too poor. It's very good to experience it.
