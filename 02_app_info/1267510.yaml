    review: 'The game itself is amazing, I love it. It needs a lot of thinking, strategy
      and you have to adapt all the time to what other people are doing. I play this
      cardboard game IRL a lot with my friends :)


      [b] HOWEVER [/b], the online game is FULL of bugs, crashes, and since the last
      update some games are just unplayable, you need to quit and come back on the
      game [b]ALL THE TIME[/b] to try and debug, some people can''t reconnect to the
      game and so run out of time etc etc...


      [b] IT IS A SHAME [/b], because these bugs/crashes ruin the game online, it
      is so frustrating that this game is so good and SO BAD at the same time.


      PLEASE DO SOMETHING AND FIX THE GAME!'
