    review: "I can't say enough great things about this add-on. This magnificent 10-wheeler\
      \ is a loving look at the rise of powerful steam locomotives in America. No\
      \ detail has been omitted here! I am continually delighted by the beauty and\
      \ accuracy of this engine, and needless to say its well worth the asking price!\
      \ As for the driving experience, this engine is both challenging and rewarding.\
      \ There is a tactility to operating the Buffalo that just isn't present in any\
      \ of the other train sim add ons I've played (spare for the other Smokebox add\
      \ ons!) From the car-to-car sway, to the rattling of the linkages everything\
      \ present seeks to immerse you. \n\nMy only gripes are minor, such as the whistle\
      \ sample being a tad low quality (slight grain, cuts off just a moment too soon),\
      \ and the engine not being able to be configured with a diamond stack (however\
      \ I hear this might soon become a feature!) \n\nIf you are into steam motive\
      \ power, do yourself a favor and jump on this pack! Support the developer and\
      \ maybe we can expect more early american engines ;D"
