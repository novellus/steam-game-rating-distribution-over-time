    review: "Bought this curious as to what it would contain, since the game doesn't\
      \ have music, and it was touted as an ASMR soundtrack.\n\nThis is just a recording\
      \ of the game being played. You'll hear the bike jump and skid around, as well\
      \ as the environmental sounds of the stages. To be honest, I find the sounds\
      \ of the game incredibly relaxing, but in this format, they seem a little overwhelming--a\
      \ little more hectic than soothing. \n\nThe Story Mode tracks are the exact\
      \ same audio as the normal tracks, but add skits about the cyclist ending up\
      \ at the hospital at the end of each track. Not particularly worth it past the\
      \ novelty of a first listen.\n\nThe files are presented as 128kbps MP3s and\
      \ 24bit/44.1Hz WAVs. There is no metadata, the labeling of the tracks is inconsistent,\
      \ and most importantly, the Story Mode tracks are supposed to be gapless/transitioning\
      \ from one to the other (as the skits happen at the end and beginning of the\
      \ tracks), but the beginning of each file has a gap of silence that breaks up\
      \ the sound. I had to remove the gaps in an audio editor to cope with my OCD.\
      \ This should not have been released like this.\n\nPositive review... but be\
      \ aware of what this is. You can probably just play the game for the same effect,\
      \ or play around by pairing this with other calming music or background sounds."
