      2</strong> is an experimental dodge-em-up music game that turns every song into
      a choreographed dance of bullets, lasers, and challenges to weave through in
      order to survive. The sequel to 2013's award-winning Soundodger+, <strong>Soundodger

      to use your own music, you'll never run out of things to dodge.<br><br><img
