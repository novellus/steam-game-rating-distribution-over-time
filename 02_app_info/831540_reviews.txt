There's not enough development in any of them to want to pick them. The game only has one choice at the end to pick who you want to date, but it feels like there are plenty of places where they could have had branches with different choices and just decided not to do that.\n\nYou spend like 2 seconds of time with the guy and the weird girl and then for some reason date them anyway if you choose them. And then the other two are just insufferable. The closest to a three dimensional character is Karina and even that's a bit much, but most of her dimension shows up when you pick someone else. Since she's the only one that cares enough about the MC [for some reason] to want him to be happy even if it's not with her. \n\nYou'd think that would be the \"best friend\" from childhood, but nope. Just the random girl who when you first meet her is yelling at you for parking in her spot. And then just says she likes you even though your only interactions thus far were her being mean to you. \n\nThere's also just no reason any of the characters like you. It's just very tropey and boring overall. It's just not worth it. If it were free, it would have been fine. I've played better free kinetic novels and visual novels.","timestamp_created":1609453689,"timestamp_updated":1609453689,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4isu63fYCfaadvwI="}
