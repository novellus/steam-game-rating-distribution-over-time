    review: 'This train was once the welcome addition to both the Midland Main LIne
      and the London to Brighton route, supplemented with the AP 319 Sound Pack (now
      offsale).


      However, times past, and since AP released their own 319 pack, I wouldn''t buy
      this because AP''s pack provides a more realistic Train Simulator experience
      with multiple liveries, accurate sounds, acceleration and braking as well as
      an improved passenger view.


      This 319, without the sound pack, suffers from many issues, mainly the recycled
      sounds off the 455 and unrealistic acceleration and braking.


      Unless you need this train for Workshop scenarios, avoid this pack completely
      and buy the AP Class 319 off their website. It''s more expensive and is sold
      as two products for different decades but it''s much better value overall and
      you won''t regret it.'
