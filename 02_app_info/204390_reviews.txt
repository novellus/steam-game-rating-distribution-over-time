What's the game like i hear you ask.\nWell in terms of gameplay it stays true to that retro feel i mentioned earlier. Though i don't see that as a bad thing (and i'm never wrong), the mechanics that are here feel more polished because of it. The roguelike crew-management mechanics are a nice touch too and incentivise you to actually think and strategize rather than going in guns a blazing, though there is still more than enough opportunity for that don't worry.\n\nClosely tied to this aforementioned strategising is the grenade mechanic. In the game each of your soldiers can carry a grenade, these 'nades come in many different types with each having their own unique behaviour. This is in my humble gamer opinion one of the most important mechanics in the game, as it not only directly affects the way you play this game but also allows you to quickly switch up your style of gameplay if things aren't really working out. Wanna take things more slow? Take the shield and heal grenade. Need some more firepower? Use the laser and missile grenades. You get the point.\n\nIs all of this worth 10 bucks though? If you'd ask me i'd probably say why not? I don't mind supporting indie developers and to me that more than makes up for the extra costs. But if you're short on money i'd suggest you put this on your wishlist and wait for the next steam sale. Because if you like top-down retro shooters, i think this should be right up your alley.\n\nOh and P.S: Game's got a dope soundtrack","timestamp_created":1609765719,"timestamp_updated":1609765719,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526627242565155029","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vfHg5vYCeY6xwAI="}
