It's hard to call it a game...it really is a set of toy blocks, like the ones you played with as a young kid. At that age, you didn't care if things were a game or not. But you still spent hours putting square blocks through square holes, or tried to force square blocks through round holes. You had fun because learning itself is intrinsically fun and engaging.\n4D Toys teaches we adults to extend our perception, our intuition into four spatial dimensions. I've been looking for software like this for the past few years, so when I got a tip about its existence I didn't hesitate to buy. It's everything I've been looking for...except maybe for an option to create a 2nd orthogonal vector for time.","timestamp_created":1609911864,"timestamp_updated":1609911864,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrLGO6/YCfrL1wAI="}
