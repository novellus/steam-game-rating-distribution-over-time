      us!<br><br>Created by Murray Atkinson from VGM Library, Medieval Warfare is
      a musical odyssey into battle and war. Inspired by both classic films such as
      Lord of the Rings and modern favorites such as Game of Thrones, with a couple
      bonus Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim flavored ambient, icy, other-worldly drones, the
      themes in this pack visit the idea of war - from intense action-packed battles
      to brief respites of calm and beyond. This pack features 25 songs, including
      alternative versions of several key themes. Murray Atkinson''s masterful blend
      of melody and vocalizations adds an extra layer of intensity to several themes,
      making them fitting for a variety of settings and moods.<br><br>Features:<br><br><ul
