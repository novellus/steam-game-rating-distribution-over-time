    about_the_game: Lost Flame is a modern roguelike game featuring unique and challenging
      turn-based combat. Explore the ruined kingdom of Hiraeth, fight against legendary
      warriors of the past and discover the reasons of the cataclysm.<br><br>The game
      takes lots of inspiration from classical roguelikes and includes stuff such
      as turn-based, permadeath, lots of procedural content.<br><br>There is a number
      of features which are something new in the genre, the most important one being
      a unique take on the turn based combat.<br>Melee combat focuses a lot on positioning
      and movement, it's not the typical bump into enemy until it dies. <br><br><strong>Dodging
      attacks</strong><br>Most of the enemy attacks are slow and you can usually dodge
      them by simply walking away:<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/856570/extras/ivar.gif?t=1578892683"

      /><br>It's simple at first area or two, but gets more difficult very quickly!<br><br><strong>Big

      /><br>Most of the enemies have some unique traits or abilities and you cannot
      just apply the same approach to everything you meet.<br><br><strong>Different
      weapons</strong><br>Depending on which weapon you carry, you have access to,
      usually, 3 or 4 different special attacks.<br>For example <br><br>with long
      sword you can slash 3 grid tiles in one turn:<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/856570/extras/longsword_slash.gif?t=1578892683"
      /><br><br>with short sword you can lunge - jump one grid and attack in one turn<br><img

      /><br><br>There are also other weapon types, such as spears, greatswords, all
      kind of axes and maces and a few more. Each with their own set of attacks.<br>Some
      unique weapons have completely new, unique attack types.<br><br>Each type of
      weapon requires a different strategy in combat, for example with short swords
      you are extremely mobile and can land quick hits on single targets, while dodging
      enemy strikes, with big weapons such as great axes or halberds, you usually
      want to position well and attack multiple enemies at once, because your attacks,
      while powerful, are slow.<br><br><strong>Customization of character builds</strong><br>Your
      character is completely defined by the items he carries.<br><br>You can empower
      your weapons by selecting which rings you want to wear, their effects are unique
      and usually it's not obvious which ring will suit best for your current build,
      below are a few ring types you can find:<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/856570/extras/rings.gif?t=1578892683"
      /><br><br>Right now there 60 ring types possible to be found. Your character
      has 4 ring fingers.<br><br>There are multiple magical item enchants (prefixes
      and suffixes), for example:<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/856570/extras/magic_spear.png?t=1578892683"
      /><br><br>Another layer of customization are scrolls of enchant items. They
      are quite plentiful and you can use them almost on any non-consumable item -
      you can enchant weapons, armor, but also rings, wands and other usable magical
      items. What you will want to enchant depends on you and there are no clear-cut
      correct answers here.<br><br><strong>SFX</strong><br>Lost Flame features cinematic
      music, rich sound effects and recorded voice overs for NPCs.<br><br><strong>Gameplay

      is quite flat - while with proper equipment your character can dish out significant
      damage, he still remains quite fragile and getting too cocky results in a quick
      death<br></li><li>There is a small id game - there are unidentified potions
      and scrolls you can find, however they get identified every time you gain a

    review: 'From what I''ve played so far I really like the game and it has a ton
      of promise.  Skills depend on your weapon loadout, most attacks are telegraphed,
      it''s a pretty fun game.  I only have a few things to note:

      1) When I first launched the game on both my desktop and laptop for the first
      time my inventory was opened and could not be closed.  After closing the game
      and relaunching it I didn''t experience it again, but I did see it on both desktop
      and laptop the first time I booted it up on either.

      2) Multi-tile enemy AI can be kinda dumb when trying to get through a door,
      I''ve had instances where they should walk up or down a  tile or two to go through
      a door to get to me but won''t unless I move in that direction

      3) Huge pet peeve of mine though it should be simple to fix, sometimes the numpad
      cannot navigate through a menu and I have to use the arrow keys like the starting
      screen, it''d be really nice to be able to use the numpad there too


      Other than those three minor issues this game shows a lot of promise :)'
