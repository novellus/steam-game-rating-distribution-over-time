    review: 'As bare-bones as a RPG maker game can be.


      I think the main problem with Girls and Dungeons its the fact that there is
      only one save point in the entire game, it is at the very entrance of the dungeon
      and you can''t save your game anywhere else. So if you die in the dungeon you
      will get back at the entrance with all your progress lost.


      Not to mention that the game lacks achievements or trading cards, also lacks
      controller and screenshot support, so if you''re playing the game for the lewd,
      which is very scarse BTW, you only get like 6 pictures that you could easly
      miss in your first walkthough, you can''t even same or screencap them, so pretty
      much there is no point in playing this over something like Melty''s Quest.


      If you for some reason feel you NEED to play Girls and Dungeons because you
      like the sprite art of the girls, pretty much this game''s only saving grace,
      buy it on sale.'
