Everything is static except the routes you build, and there are some restrictions on how you can build them. It's very simple and there's no progression. The game is solid but not exciting imo.\n\nThere are 3 modes:\n1 - Campaign where you have to move X people/goods in Y time. There's no penalties for people/goods waiting, nor for ignoring stations completely.\n2 - Survival where you can't let more than X people/goods stack up at a station. Achievement is granted after 20 minutes (you can accelerate time up to 8x). I found this mode needlessly difficult to the point of frustration.\n3 - Evacuation where you have to get X people/goods to an \"exit\" station in Y time. You only get exactly enough people to finish, so you have to empty all stations.\nThere's also hard mode for Campaign and Evacuation, and \"Relaxation\" mode where you can just watch the game run itself if that's your thing.\n\nThe major limitations to building are that tracks can only go one way, and you have no way of crossing perpendicular (no intersections or bridges allowed). Not realistic but works in the sense of it being a puzzle.\n\nOther than Survival mode I found the game to be decently fun. If you're looking for a simple train tracks timed puzzle then there's a lot of content here, but if you are hoping for things like financial simulation or town growth or realistic train behavior look elsewhere.","timestamp_created":1609809047,"timestamp_updated":1609809341,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pKWH6PYCf47IwAI="}
