    about_the_game: I did not see a marching simulator on the market, so I made one!  This
      is a 2D, sprite based marching simulator.  It is intended to give the user what
      it would feel like to march a military formation, as well as see how well they
      can do!  You will give commands by keyboard or mouse to a flight of 12.  These
      12 must execute 10 commands from a list of 27 within a 70 ft by 70 ft area.  Your
      score depends on how fast your flight can execute your commands, and how well
      you stay in your are.  Do you have what it takes?  This is a constant work in
      progress so any feedback is appreciated.
