But the only achievements you will be able to earn normally are the achievements for completing level 1, 2 and 3 (as the others all automatically unlock).\n- When playing through the levels for the first time, they will show no stars. To get stars to appear next to the levels, you will have to play each level at least twice.\n\nOther than these annoying things, the game works fine and is as enjoyable as the first,","timestamp_created":1607757600,"timestamp_updated":1607757600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519867539405822754","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0ML0qvYCecGxuQI="}
