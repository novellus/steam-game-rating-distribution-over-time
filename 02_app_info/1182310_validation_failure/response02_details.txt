Explore the isolated moors of rural Victorian England as you uncover the mysteries of Hob's Barrow. The answers lie in the soil...","supported_languages":"English","reviews":"“That the demo only offers us the brief segment of arriving at the inn, speaking with the people drinking there, and eventually heading to bed, really underlines just how well it introduces an adventure I now very much want to play. There’s some great scene-setting here, lots of foreshadowing of dangers to come, and a strong foundation of “We don’t like outsiders ‘ere missy,” type alienation. This is due out early 2021, and I cannot wait.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/buried-treasure.org\/2020\/10\/incredible-free-demos-to-try-in-steams-autumn-games-festival\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Buried Treasure<\/a><br><br>“The combination of beautifully utilised lighting and details coupled with the stellar writing and pacing evoke the atmosphere of those tales told in hushed voices over a tankard, making even the bravest feel uneasy.”<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/vulturehound.co.uk\/2020\/10\/steams-autumnal-offerings-the-power-of-three\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >VultureHound<\/a><br><br>“The INCANTAMENTUM demo build takes around 20 minutes to play through and really impresses with its high quality pixel art animation, eerie atmosphere and interesting characters.
