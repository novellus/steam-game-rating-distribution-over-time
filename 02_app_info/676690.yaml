    review: Half an hour of basic escape room. The physics are really twitchy and
      it was really difficult to pick things up from floor level. There are a few
      puzzles to figure out and they are OK. Overall it just feels really generic.
      It's not expensive, but at the same time it's fiddly and not massively satisfying.
      If you see it on sale then maybe, but there are a bunch of far better examples
      of the genre available, especially if you spend a little more money.
