    review: "The game is incomplete, with better tutorials (though they still could\
      \ use work), and there are still issues with the gameplay. The developer does\
      \ seem commited to improving it, and has fixed some of the issues I've highlighted.\
      \ \n\nHowever there is still a lot of stuff that needs addressing. It is almost\
      \ like they decided to make a game like FTL, without ever playing FTL. So it\
      \ looks like FTL, but doesn't play much like FTL at all. Hopefully this changes,\
      \ to some extent. I'm not expecting a clone of FTL, but if you are going to\
      \ do the art style, overall gameplay of FTL, and feel of FTL's combat, then\
      \ they should at least start with those things as a minimum. \n\nI'll continue\
      \ to provide feedback to the developer, as they release new patches and features.\
      \ \n\nMaybe in a year, it might be worth buying, but it certainly is not now.\
      \ The developer gave me a review key, to continue to provide feedback, and I\
      \ do appreciate the opportunity to test the game."
