    review: 'The central idea of this game is pretty cool - you have the ability to
      reset the level except for your current position, and then a copy of you does
      all the same movements you did. Using this you can get the copy to activate
      things that you need to be somewhere else to make use of. A lot of the levels
      require you to move in such a way that when the copy makes the same movements
      the effects or context will be different, like crossing a bridge that you can
      destroy or performing movements after you''ve moved the copy to a different
      location.


      The main problem I have with this game is the emphasis on timing. Almost all
      of the puzzles require you to move in a very precise way so that when your copy
      makes the same movements it will be in the right position for the right amount
      of time, and I just don''t find it fun to deal with a theoretical object at
      that level of precision. Furthermore the emphasis on timing means that you spend
      a lot of time in puzzles just sitting around to make sure your copy will give
      you enough time later, this breaks the cardinal rule of puzzle games in that
      once you figure out the solution the actual ceremony of solving the puzzle should
      be fast.


      There''s another issue on top of the timing and that''s the visuals. With the
      isometric viewpoint it can be very hard to tell where objects and platforms
      are in relation to each other, and that will definitely cause you to mess up
      and wreck your puzzle solution from time to time.


      If you like the idea of a puzzle game built around time mechanics I recommend
      Braid. In fact one of the worlds in Braid has pretty much the exact same central
      copy gimmick as this game.'
