    review: "for 30 bucks, this is a not a recommendation.\n\nThe primary gameplay\
      \ loop isn't unsatisfying - but it's also not much to begin with.\nSelect next\
      \ level, shoot enemies, loot environment, return with net-bonus - so far so\
      \ standard. \nIt does occasionally spice up, when shooting enemies is suddenly\
      \ not an option. \n\nThe upgrade tree is generally disappointing if I'm honest.\
      \ For a rogue-like, the selection is hardly noteworthy. One pistol, one shotgun,\
      \ one SMG, a decoy, a grenade, a grenade launcher etc etc. They all have kooky\
      \ names & fancy looks, but their use-case is like every gun in every shooter\
      \ ever.\nThere's only straight stat upgrades - no random variants, nothing to\
      \ break up the monotony.\n Try playing Synthetik: Legion Rising, if you're looking\
      \ for a huge variety of guns, guns with gimmicks & fun meachanics, and random\
      \ variants & upgrades of such. \n\nThe environments are generally well stylized\
      \ and I like the artstyle, but again, there's kind of too little of it (especially\
      \ for the \"budget AAA\" pricetag).\nThere's a bare handful of shiptypes, all\
      \ with their own tile-sets that used get over and over and over again - well\
      \ past the point of providing anything unique.  The 'random' levels aren't much\
      \ help - seen two or three examples of a ship-type (which is [i]nothing[/i]\
      \ in terms of total game progess), and you'll recognize the pattern in all of\
      \ them.\n\nAlso, the humour isn't nearly as clever or repeatedly funny as it\
      \ believes it is. There's like a handful of good jokes presented through the\
      \ environment, but not much else. Enemies reuse the same, \"funny-voice\" callouts\
      \ constantly. The Story-Missions are all the same: 'Collect scrap item de jour\
      \ - repeat ad nauseum'\n\nThis may be [i]inspired[/i] by Bioshock, but it forgot\
      \ that - past the zany, wacky, art-deco surface - Bioshock actually had writing\
      \ more complex than \"funny english accents, haha\".\nAnd comparing it to System\
      \ Shock is almost an insult for the venerable old games bearing that title.\n\
      \nAt the end, I don't see how this game is supposed to work as a rogue-lite/like,\
      \ because there's basically no replay value...\nAt the end of my 12h playtime,\
      \ I decided to finish what little 'story' there is - not to come to a thrilling\
      \ conclusion, but to just put the nail in the coffin and stop milling about."
