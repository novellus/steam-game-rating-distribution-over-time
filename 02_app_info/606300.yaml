      Ascent is a single and local-multiplayer strategy-puzzle game. The goal is to
      be the first to build towers, and to reach their tops to place temples.<br><br>Six

      moves:<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>If squares are free and orthogonally adjacent
      to each other, and form stairs of which the lower piece can be climbed by our
      pawn, we can directly climb to their top.<br></li><li>If a square is located
      in front of ours orthogonally, our pawn can jump on it provided that it''s one
      floor higher, and that every floor between is lower.<br></li><li>If the four
      squares around our pawn are blocked by whether pawns, temples, pieces that are
      at least two floors higher, or the edge of the board, you can place a new piece
      under it.</li></ul><br>There are squares with special properties for each location.

    review: 'Very simple puzzle game with a very simple but interesting aesthetic
      to it. Good for about an hour of solo gameplay and half an hour more of the
      other modes offered if you want to explore those.


      I always judge games based on their price and I would say that there are definitely
      other titles at the same price range that will give you more bang for your buck.
      Not a bad game, just a bit too pricey for what it offers.'
