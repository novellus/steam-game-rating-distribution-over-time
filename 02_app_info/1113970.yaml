    about_the_game: 'Paul''s little brother Jim passed away a year ago today. Now
      Paul goes for a walk up to the hill where they spent their last night, watching
      the fireworks around the city. On the way there, he stops by some randomly placed
      magical mailboxes filled with notes from his gone brother Jim, from the other
      side. Jim loved a jeep parking video game in his life but got stuck at its final
      level.<br><br>Little Brother Jim alternates between the jeep parking game, and
      Paul''s journey up to the hill. Note that the jeep parking levels can be challenging
      to some, but they are skippable after each few fails. On the other hand, if
