    review: "I think it is safe to say almost anyone playing this 30+ year old game\
      \ is either reliving their youth, doing research or lost a bet. But it IS remarkable\
      \ how far ahead of its time this game was: Space exploration across 8 star systems,\
      \ the ability to land on planets, speak to inhabitants, make money through trade,\
      \ upgrade your ship, play video games within a video game (hive). Not to mention\
      \ space based combat featuring optional newtonian physics and a good story/opportunity\
      \ to be found where you get to be the hero. All in a DOS based game that didn't\
      \ assume users had a mouse or even a sound card.\n\nThis is the spiritual parent\
      \ of so many modern games... Elite Dangerous, X4: Foundations, Stellaris, No\
      \ Mans Sky, Avorion. But despite the fancy graphics, I find most modern space\
      \ games too complicated.  The magic of Space Rogue was its simplicity and the\
      \ fact that it was equal parts space exploration, space combat and ground based\
      \ interactions. \n\nSome hints: \n\nDon't use the games original save/load system.\
      \  Instead, start up the game using \"Play Space Rogue Classic in DOSBox Daum\"\
      . DOS BOX has the ability to take a snapshot of the game state at any time by\
      \ hitting ALT + F5. This allows you to save anytime you want without having\
      \ to be in the cockpit. More important you can load your last save at anytime\
      \ by hitting ALT + F9 (even during the startup video). Thus you can continue\
      \ where you left off without having to go find an online copy of the manual\
      \ to get past the ownership verification question. \n\nHit ALT + ENTER to toggle\
      \ between fullscreen and windowed. You need the window if you want to access\
      \ DOS Box's Menu. Using the menu, you can have up to 8 save slots. \n\nDOSBox\
      \ can also let you limit the CPU speed using the CPU menu. At certain points\
      \ in the game, you may need to lower the cycles in order to run from guards\
      \ and monsters. I used \"fixed 150\". Once those moments pass, you can set it\
      \ back to 3000."
