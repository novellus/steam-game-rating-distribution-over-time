It's not great, but I don't think it's the worst thing ever either. The art is mostly pretty bad ms paint level. Largely the CGs that appear during the game itself, while the ending CGs are better quality. And the character sprites are fine, although all the female characters share the same body.\n\nThe 'story' is more about the characters than the overall plot, and it's a bit rushed to get to where you're going. I thought the endings were pretty cute for each character, I'm gay so only really bought it for the one m/m romance. But figured I'd try the rest out.\n\nThe writing is not great, everybody talks similarly. Meaning the writer didn't really approach each character with a unique voice. Tossing a few \"sweeties\" or \"hun\" [or whatever cute thing Mai said] doesn't make a unique character. And at times there's some repetitious dialog, particularly when doing the \"fun vs serious\" super hero discussion and choosing the fun option. And there are some grammar problems here and there. \n\nThe CG menu is oddly organized, the CGs aren't grouped by character they're just randomly tossed in there it's weird. \n\nThe 'suspicious man' subplot is weird and the ending of it is bizarre and kind of funny in how stupid it is. That ending is the same regardless of your choices, every choice is entirely about your relationship ending and nothing else changes. Including forgetting that you went on this trip with a friend and if you choose any other character the story forgets that and doesn't address what happens to her when you end up shacking up with one of the other three. I guess she's in Europe alone. lol\n\nBut for $1 it was fine, I enjoyed my time with it. If you're looking for a good game, there are certainly better uses of your time before you try this one out. But as a risky buy, I was pleasantly surprised it wasn't complete trash like everyone was saying. \n\nAnd I personally experienced very minimal bugs, the only real one is the skip would get stuck at times and sometimes clicking an option wouldn't be responsive right away and I'd have to click again. But getting through all endings was easy and painless for me.","timestamp_created":1604247841,"timestamp_updated":1604247841,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ju2nwvUCfuvLqwI="}
