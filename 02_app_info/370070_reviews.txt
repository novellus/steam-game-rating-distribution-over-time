I used to enjoy it a lot more when it was simpler, more to the point, but it's a big bloat right now, without the base gameplay to back it up any more. Units are so very tiny but they still drop items, gain levels, must be micromanaged like if they were as big and beefy as in Warcraft 3, which doesn't feel good at all. You're constantly struggling to micro and at the same time deal with way too many resources, research and meaningless features that only detract from the main game. \n","timestamp_created":1570736672,"timestamp_updated":1570736672,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.606402993202209473","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0PHM2+0CcbDw0wE="}
