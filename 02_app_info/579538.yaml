    review: 'if those bugs in power up kit chinese version did not fixed before 2016/02/18,


      i dont think i will buy a koei game ever again, this will be the worst experience
      since i joined steam.


      we chinese player really want to support those game developers that can provide
      maverllous product


      and we will take right action to against those developers that do not show respect
      to us


      i despise you,koei


      you are a fraud'
