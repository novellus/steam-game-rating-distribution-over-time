The developers learned from their first game and that's a positive -- the map alone is a big improvement from the first generation. Certainly plays like a roguelike, progression is earned, and winning is hard (I haven't done it in my first three playthroughs, but hopefully soon).\n\nThe only thing that gets a thumbs-down from me is the UI. It should not be as hard as it is in this game to do a simple mouse drag and drop of a card onto a target. I have had continual issues with the card resizing and \"slipping out\" of the mouse's grip so it can't be dragged, sometimes needing three and four clicks to get a single card played. That needs fixing because if I get POed just by trying to play a card, that's going to affect my desire to play in the long run. Hopefully this is fixed in Early Access.\n\nYou do need to think through your build in this game, perhaps more so than with others I've played in this genre.  I think it's going to be a good game over time and I hope it's moddable to allow for more character classes. A solid start, but with room for improvement.","timestamp_created":1609451237,"timestamp_updated":1609451237,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ46J2x3fYCcpmcvwI="}
