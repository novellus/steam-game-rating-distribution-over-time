    review: 'This game should be called (THE FOX) or something closer to what the
      game is about,this game needs fixing because it glitches and you become either
      falling through the ground non stop or flying non stop and there is a cat that
      follows you around meowing and there is no killing i thought when deciding to
      buy this game i would get to hunt game animals and kill birds and an objective
      to what needs to be done or a goal for the whole purpose of the game,please
      can you fix the game so it is like a lone wolf that has to survive by hunting
      and replenishes health and makes it more interesting,overall bad game please
      fix
