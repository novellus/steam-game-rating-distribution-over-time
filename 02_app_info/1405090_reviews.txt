Not worth the price at all.\n\nAll the factions are identical, just different skin / theme.\nOnly 2 units, builder and soldier.\nOnly 4 buildings. HQ, Barracks, Resource and Tower.\n\nBecause of this, gameplay is always just \"make more dudes than the other guy faster\". No unit synergies or strategies.","timestamp_created":1604474688,"timestamp_updated":1604474688,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.536100089550018311","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoJqJyfUCdceZrAI="}
