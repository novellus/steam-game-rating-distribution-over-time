    developer_response: 'I am really sad about your analysis, but I will do my best
      to make it change someday. It is very difficult to develop a game alone, but
      that is no excuse.

      I would just like to know in more depth what is the reason for considering the
      game bad, could you make contact in our discord, which is in the description
      of early access? Grateful for the feedback.'

    review: 'Well, this is alpha early access, really rough.  The game has not been
      enjoyable as it is; however, it has all the potential to become a lot of fun
      if the developer continues to improve (imagine if this is at v.0.3, then v.1.2
      would probably be excellent).


      It IS really cheap, so you may want to take a gamble to purchase it now on the
      hope that development continues.  You can play if for a while.


      I am giving it a thumbs down because, to me, it plays like an alpha (not a beta
      - early access is supposed to be for tested betas) - but I''ll give it a DEFINITE
      thumbs-up if the developer continues with development (for that reason, I''ll
      keep the game instead of refunding it).'
