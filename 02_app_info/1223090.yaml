    review: 'Got this game on a bundle of "Hidden Object" games. My expectations were
      very low for this but was thoroughly entertained. The hidden object sections
      were mostly easy but I did use the "hint" option a few times because certain
      items were too well hidden. Since English is not my native language I had to
      look up a few words I was unfamiliar with (like spanner and clef), which I consider
      a plus because I love adding new terms to my vocabulary.

      Besides the "hidden object" scenes there''s several other logic minigames that
      I enjoyed and was challenged by more than I would have expected, even having
      to look up online the answer to one.

      A good casual option to kill some time and use your problem solving skills.'
