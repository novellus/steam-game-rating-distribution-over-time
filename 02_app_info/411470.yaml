    review: I've been playing wargame simulations since the 80's and In my opinion,
      this is the best hex based wargame of the past 30 years. The wego system beautifully
      represents the NATO and WP doctrine systems and It sits in that sweet spot between
      simulation and game. Suspect its a labour of love.... which all things of genius
      usually are!
