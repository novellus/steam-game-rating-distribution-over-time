I feel like Burn the Witch has been priced out of impulse buy range, and especially out of \"buy a copy for a friend\" range which would have benefited it hugely.\nAfter a while I found a lobby with two other players, and it was a fun ten minute diversion. I'm not sure if the sense of paranoia causes people to just attack on sight, or if they just didn't understand the objective. The game doesn't seem to work well with small groups, since killing at random is a 50/50 chance of a win anyway.\n(I'm also not sure the game is working as intended. One game where I was the witch, I was stalking around and then heard one person killing another - presumably a peasant killing another peasant. The game ended with \"Peasants Win\" on screen.)\nThis could be a fun little game, but it really needs to find a playerbase first, and I feel like that's not happening at the current price point (14.99 USD).","timestamp_created":1609190260,"timestamp_updated":1609190260,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.584905624389648438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw0tfN1fYCfNydvgI="}
