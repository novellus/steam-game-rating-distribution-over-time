    review: 'I enjoyed it enough at first but there is too much repetiton and it''s
      a touch unrealistic for my tastes (though I have no problem with super-natural
      elements). It was a good idea with great atmosphere but the game portion needs
      some improvement. I was going to give the game a positive review because it
      is free (and that counts for something, even though I have played similar free
      apocaylse virtual novels that I enjoyed more) but I am now running into a lot
      of bugs and my crowbar has been removed as an option.



      Speaking of crowbars... I don''t get what the big deal was. I wouldn''t call
      them a "specialy" tool: we always had one growing up and at the current moment
      I have two or three different types. But the game treated owning one as a huge
      deal... But it''s just like owning a hammer - at least, where I live in the
      USA, it is.'
