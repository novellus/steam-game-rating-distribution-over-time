    review: '[prepare bit of heated review(which i never really type reviews, also
      slash warning/spoilers to heisuke''s route)] So this is being written after
      doing like 1.8 story. finished okita (which was short and overly simple but
      fine as it was) and tried heisuke with only 3 options left before the end but
      i just full on shut it off. I LOVE hakuoki, iv played the psp version years
      ago and played all of the first kinda remake and a bit of the 2nd part of that.
      If you are looking at this and hakuoki do yourself a huge favor and get hakuoki.
      The stories are really lengthy so def bang for your buck and has lots of historical
      points and info inside it. It goes on sale for a lot ususaly so its cheap to
      get both. But back to this game. I get phone visual novels and such lot of the
      time are short or cliche or have weird angles they try to justify the story
      they play. But while playing heisuke''s story (well try to) just now, i just
      cant. I cant at all give a pass or any justification for practically forced
      sexual acts/rape, It is a a sad excuse of "live in the moment, could die tomorrow!"
      ppl are dying all around its not sexy time. And its not even sexy time with
      it all forced even after struggle. A person acting as a kid and "innocent" does
      not make that ok. I was so hoping it would let you slap him to get him to wake
      up but no, the "correct" answer is its fine or you actually want it too when
      it shows her trying to struggle and he keeps forcing it. I am just baffled by
      how it tried to do his story to point i just cant read that bull of his story
      any further. I may try the others to see if they have any hope of having some
      ounce of substance but god. I figured i wouldn''t like heisuke''s story most
      due to his personality compared to the rest but no way was I prepared for the
      shitfire i read.'
