    review: "I can recommend this game since it costs almost nothing. I saw free games\
      \ last longer, but the fun I got was worth the 1$. It's a very short game, but\
      \ intense.\n\nHere's the deal: you are given the least manoeuvrable module ever\
      \ \u2013 it is propelled by firing little balls which don't damage anything\
      \ \u2013 in a small level and you must reach the exit. Did I forget to mention\
      \ the sadistic traps and wicked weapons shooting at you? All of these are a\
      \ perfect combination to get on your nerves, without which you won't succeed.\n\
      \nThe game is not that hard. If you want more challenge, you can try to get\
      \ the achievements, which are obtained by taking the bonus in each level, and\
      \ pass each sector without dying once. But it still took me less than 90 minutes\
      \ to beat the game completely. It's too short. It needs more levels and challenges,\
      \ for instance time-based ones.\n\nI'll just point out that it needs to be a\
      \ little more polished. The level selection screen could have been nicer. No\
      \ need to give you a \"grade\" after each sector, the number of deaths would\
      \ have been better. Some screens require to chose options using keyboard while\
      \ the rest of the game use the mouse only. Since it's a game that's supposed\
      \ to be played rather fast, restart buttons for level and sector would have\
      \ been appreciated."
