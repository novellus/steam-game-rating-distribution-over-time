    review: "To get an idea of the gameplay, just check out the videos as i think\
      \ they represent it fairly well. It's a cartoonish VR Shooter with some twists\
      \ and cool boss battles. \n\nI got this game on sale. I was keeping an eye on\
      \ it after many zombie shooter, horror games, war games, fight games etc..I\
      \ needed something more happy and positive. I think it's actually good.. Thumbs\
      \ up for the cartoonish world inspired by Pokemon. Graphics are simple but neat\
      \ in VR. Runs flawlessly with 1.8 Super Sampling (on g1 1080), i guess it could\
      \ be even more. As far as i played i didn't notice mayor flaws in the gameplay\
      \ nor in the presentation. The other way around: i've been beating a couple\
      \ of bosses and they were nicely done. I enjoyed the positive vibes and the\
      \ funny translations. It's trippy stuff overall, so if you are into trippy VR\
      \ games you will like this one as well. Makes me want to get back inthere later\
      \ on. In case i will change my mind about something I will edit this review."
