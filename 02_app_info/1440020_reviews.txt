This is all very linear since you follow the story step by step. There's no replaying of any level as far as I could determine.\n\nThere are 95 levels to go through to finish the game. Each level is graded and you can earn up to three stars. I'm not sure what triggers 3 stars or not - probably the timing. Also, I'm not sure about the purpose of grading levels since there's no ranking or \"points\" of any sort.\n\nPlaying a level earns you a predetermined amount of gold that becomes part of an artifact. Said artifact is used to progress in the adventure.\n\nThere are bonuses, as expected for the genre. They are unlocked over time (at certain levels) and they are filed by making matches of a specific tile.\n\nNote that you can play the levels with or without a timer. The timed version becomes very hard for the last 10 levels or so.\n\nNo achievement in this game (Steam or in-game)\n\nThe playability could benefit from a little speed. I found the response to clicks a bit slow - the cascading matches as well.\n\nLast, you have to start playing a level to be able to access the menu ! It's simply impossible elsewhere. I found that one a bit strange, but ..\n\nI've played without any issue on Win7 64bit.","timestamp_created":1604876600,"timestamp_updated":1605470177,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47tje5vUCd5ufrQI="}
