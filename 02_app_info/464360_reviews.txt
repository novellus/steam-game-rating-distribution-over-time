It's not the best space shooter I have played, nor is it the worst.  It's simplistic.  So why am I recommending it?  Because I think it's a good game for what it's trying to do, especially for the price point.  I purchased it on sale and don't regret supporting the developer.  If it's on sale, I'd say give it a try.  You may end up liking it.  If you breeze through the story in the beginning of the game, you can try out the combat before the 2 hour mark so you can get a refund if you really don't think it's for you.\n\n[b] What I Did Not Like [/b]\n\nI am someone who likes complicated systems when it comes to designing a ship.  While this one does have different ways to upgrade your ship, I didn't find it fulfilling enough.  It also had a mix of click-based story telling.  Those aren't my strong suit,\n\n[b] Why I Stopped Playing [/b]\n\nI made multiple purchases during a sale that was happening, including this game, so I moved on to another game I had purchased.  I doubt I will re-visit this game unless I want a simple space shooter with text-based story telling.\n\n[b] Disclaimer [/b]\n\nI have been a gamer for over 30 years.  I tend to play mostly PC games.  I also bounce around between games A LOT.  I may purchase a $60 game and play it for 2 hours or spend $10 on a game and spend 50 hours on it.  Even if I played a game a short time, it does not mean it is bad.  It just means another game caught my attention.  I also complain about flaws in games a lot, even about the littlest of things.  Keep that in mind when reading my reviews.  If I do not have a complaint, then the game must be special!","timestamp_created":1609346927,"timestamp_updated":1609370183,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41YT82vYCd+/pvgI="}
