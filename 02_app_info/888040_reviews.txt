This game is perfect for those who like commanding armies of customizable giant robots alongside more conventional armor and aircraft. The single player campaigns are awesome narrative gameplay that illustrates the nuances in the lore and personality of each playable corponation through the perspective of a trio of brothers. The narrative campaigns are unique in the sense that you can upgrade your pilots and forces between missions to improve their performance. Gameplay provides extra nuance in the ability to engage in orbital and subterranean warfare while fighting on a terrestrial battlefield. The playable corponations all have their strategic and tactical strengths and weaknesses that are best suited to most people's specific gameplay styles. Each corponation also has a unique personality and character that is best illustrated in the single player narrative campaigns from the perspective of the Angelus brothers, with Rimtech being the archetypical, self-righteous(if not outright obnoxious), liberal-democratic crusaders very much analogous to the cultural mentality and self-image of postwar America, The British Empire under the supremacy of the house of commons, and Revolutionary/Napoleonic France. MilAgro, by contrast, is the ultra-authoritarian, autocratic, brutal, heartless, absolutist regime, with the Cobb family being a proverbial absolute monarchy with extreme practices of nepotism. Milagro is very much analogous to Tsarist/Imperial Russia under the late Rurikovitch and Romanov dynasties, with the campaign ending with the youngest Angelus brother leading a bolshevik, marxist-style republican revolution of emancipation for the corponation. Neuropa on the other hand, is the puritan, evangelical, fundamentalist, firebrand religious xenotheocracy very much analogous to Jewish Zionism, Islamic Extremism, or the popular conceptions surrounding the scientologist community. The cultural, social, and political constitutions of each corponation are reflective in their gameplay style. With rimtech favouring a strong balance of ranged, close combat, and defensive abilities, MilAgro favouring attrition, numbers, expendability, and close combat capabilities, and Neuropa favouring ranged warfare, speed, stealth, and unconventional tactics. If you are a nostalgic pining for the old Mobile Suit Gundam strategy games for Dreamcast and Playstation 2 like Blood of Zeon and Gihrens Greed, or the old Battletech/Mechwarrior/Mechassault tabletop miniatures game, this game is perfect for you.","timestamp_created":1609644950,"timestamp_updated":1609644950,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511627912521362305","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn5iU4/YCdpf5vwI="}
