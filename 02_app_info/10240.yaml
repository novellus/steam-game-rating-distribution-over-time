    review: I did like the game quite a bit, as I'm a fan of point n click games.
      There were  few parts i didnt like, for example, then constant backtracking,
      going back n forth btw old places and the poker game took me longer than i wanted
      to get through, but apart from that, I thought the game was top notch
