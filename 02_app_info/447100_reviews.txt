Purchased in July of last year, it was the first game I played where you can see your body. It's basically a multiplayer shooter (hard to do with the VR player base being what it was/is), in a space station kind of setting. It has some robot bug bots you can still shoot, though. It's a bit too dark, but overall, the aesthetic is very alien, and I like that.\n\nThere was, and is a fair amount of work put into this. I seem to have only paid a dollar for it when it was on sale. So, if I was a review-writer at the time, I would have responded positively. Now, you're looking at an early access title that has been 300 days since an update.
