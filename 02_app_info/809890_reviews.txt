Very hokey and childish.  If you've never played an RPG before in your life, this might have something new and exciting for you.  the story isn't groundbreaking or even original.  so maybe it's about the characters.\n\nThe characters are bland and deliver their lines like they're in a school play.  \"i am the shining battlefield maiden of the purple orchid of the bloom in the grove of ancient mystery, which uses forbidden techniques passed down through the corpowitz family for 100 generations.\" or some such nonsense.  The characters try to seem cool and confident, but it is a shallow facade as every one seems to be surprised at any small developement they hadn't accounted for.  \"i am certain i will emerge victorious at the hotdog eating contest, but what's this?! they are using ketchup and not mustard?!  impossible!!!\"  \n\nStory's not great, the characters are flat, but what about the verisimilude? well, in the opening section of the game, the lady introduces herself as a knight of someplace to a guard, after he fails to recognize her or her heraldry.  after he is killed and the next cutscene begins, having no witnesses remaining, the offscreen guard says that's her the knight from the obscure place where no one recognized her.  shortly after we meet the main character who is reluctant to use his \"power.\"  Not because it comes with a price, but because he is a cowardly baby.  we see his resolve crumble as he is in a most dire situation.  \"just this one time...i'll use my maximum force, because it's hopeless and my life depends on it.\"  paraphrased, of course.  then you proceed to fight 4 enemies with 2 people on your team.  so a 2 vs 1 fight is enough to make his will crumble.  zero respect earned.  having moments earlier fought in a 7vs1 fight as another character.\n\nThe graphics are low end, but not trash.  imagine a PSP game's graphics.  That's the quality here.  empty corridors with pretty walls.\n\nthe audio is nothing special, but twice within an hour of play, i encountered alarms that triggered in dialog where the annoying sounds repeated for as long as dialog was on screen.\n\nIf you love cheesy dialog, nonsensical logic, and much ado about nothing, this game is for you.  Otherwise, steer clear of this steaming pile.","timestamp_created":1609568548,"timestamp_updated":1609568548,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.448920845985412598","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyt7w4PYCdbjRvwI="}
