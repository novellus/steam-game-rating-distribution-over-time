As you conclude your introductory training, fires and other mischief begins breaking out around the city. It is your job to save the cardboard beings from hazards and uncover the source of the current disasters.\n\nThe movement in Paperville Panic is done by teleportation with no other alternatives options available in the settings menu. The most notable settings available are individual knobs for adjusting different volume option, the ability to enable or disable room scale, and a single knob to adjust all the graphics options. With the settings menu addressed let's get into the game.\n     \nPaperville Panic barely takes over 2 hours to complete. These two hours are composed of a brief tutorial, exploring the main hub area - which is a delightful looking cardboard town, and completing a total of five missions. \n\nThe story is quite simple and is mainly delivered as a voice-over during various missions and in the hub world. These story updates often consist of your new boss altering you about recent events and telling you where to find the next mission. There is just enough of a plot to piece together the rather random events and the way the mystery unfolds is humours enough to be entertaining while allowing for the gameplay to take priority.\n\nThe main cardboard town acts as a menu for selecting the various missions. Between the cars zipping around the roads,  vendors at their stalls, and individuals casually playing cards in the park there is always something visually engaging to look at within the main section of the town. Yet, when you arrive at some of the areas further along the outer edges there is a distinct lack of activity in them. They particularly stood out to me as seeming incomplete since they take up a good chunk of space and seem like an ideal place for adding on another mission which are a tad lacking in the game. \n\nThe five missions available are the heart of the game and provide a good amount of variety with decently-well crafted bosses at the end of each of them. Each mission has a completely different thematic problem to address and a unique water-based fire-arm to assist in tackling that situation with. You begin by doing standard firefighter duties such as putting out flames with your squirt gun and uncovering individuals who are buried beneath piles of rubble, you later find yourself sorting toys and taking down criminals. This allows for the pacing and engagement from mission to mission to be exceptional as you find yourself encountering new objectives and new tools constantly. \n\nThe quality of the combat substantially fluctuates based on the weapon that you are using, ranging from bland to good. The one that stands out as being the worst is the ax which is, unfortunately, the only melee weapon that you have for the entirety of the game. The impact that this ax has when comes to cutting down doors or breaking object is solid as the impact is visually shown and audio cues back up the action. The biggest issue is using the ax on enemies. For flying enemies you merely have to touch them they will simply fall onto the ground. While standard enemies will usually let out a mild grunt or moan when decapitated. There is also no requirement to hold the ax with the sharp side facing the enemies, you can just slap them with the side of it and somehow de-head them. The lack of meaningful audio cues, visual feedback, or required precision results in a noticeable lack of impact which makes the ax, especially for being the one melee weapon that you have during the entire game, lame to use.\n\nOn the other hand, most of the water-based weapons are enjoyable to use thanks to them having a solid visual splash and sound effect. The double-barrel shotgun stands out as being particularly enjoyable since it requires you to constantly load up new ammo in the form of water-balloons into its chambers. The steady requirement of quick player inputs in order to successfully operate the weapon is highly engaging. The same can also be said for the pump-action gun as it requires accurate rapid movement in order to refuel it. The three remaining weapons which are: the squirt gun, timed pistol, and water balloons are all decent enough but lack the constant engagement that the other guns provide.\n\nThe artistic design is cheerful, bright, and charming despite the unfortunate events that are taking place. The game looks like a kids arts and craft projects and is visually joyful to experience. I particularly like the simple hand-drawn style of the faces for the cardboard characters and the design of the major who has toilet paper for his head. While it visually conveys a childish demeanor there is also a bit of edginess mixed within the story and gameplay. This is demonstrated by how you can decapitate civilians and the raunchy jokes that mixed in throughout the story. An artistic area that is a bit neglected is the animation of the characters. Even the main characters often have overly simple animation loops that look passable at times and rather bad in other cases. There are also some rather jarring animation shortcuts are taken at times.\n\nLastly, a lot of the game’s humor relies on referencing other media or games which I personally did not care for. But there is some lowbrow humor which is entertaining for just how dumb it can be.\n\nOverall, Paperville Panic is a tolerable title. The main portion of the city is lively and the game’s world is creatively wonderful. But, the empty parts of the open world sections should have included two more mission to better fill both the hub area and the overall game. However, the missions that are included do a good job of frequently keeping the player interested with different themes, guns, and bosses. Yet, the fluctuation of the game’s combat depending on the weapon of choice prevent the game from being a fair title.","timestamp_created":1562080935,"timestamp_updated":1600465453,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.457589268684387207","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/JfL0fQCfLfrygE="}
