    review: "I've played this game for about an hour, and while I feel like there\
      \ is still a lot I don't quite understand, it's just a lot of mindless, addictive\
      \ fun. \nThe core mechanism of the game is match-three, but with three dimensions.\
      \ The colors are clear and distinct, and there is a beam coming out of your\
      \ block showing where it will go, which I suspect avoids a lot of frustration.\n\
      The one slight downside is the inability to tilt the camera, so sometimes I\
      \ think I have a match when I do not, but this is really minor. \nThere are\
      \ a few power-ups that show up, a bomb, one that destroys all of a color and\
      \ a heart. If there are more I haven't seen them. They are really rare though,\
      \ so aren't really much of a factor. \nBut two thumbs up, for people looking\
      \ for a casual arcade-like simple addictive game."
