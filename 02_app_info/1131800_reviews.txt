The puzzles were not overly difficult but were always relevant to the story. Lots of humor in the storytelling. The ending was not at all what I expected  and I really liked where it went.  The game only saves at the end of each location which can sometimes be frustrating if you need to quit but don't want to lose progress. The characters were generally silly but the end had a bit of seriousness to it that made for a very enjoyable effect overall. I can't really call it a dating sim but it would be fun to romance all the characters again.\nIf you enjoy humor, romance, picross puzzles, and a good story then absolutely buy this game.","timestamp_created":1608723500,"timestamp_updated":1608723500,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvpHZx/YCdrm2vAI="}
