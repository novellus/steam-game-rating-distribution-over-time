      \ /><br><br>Ether One is a first person adventure that deals with the fragility\
      \ of the human mind. <br><br>There are two paths in the world you can choose\
      \ from. At its core is a story exploration path free from puzzles where you\
      \ can unfold the story at your own pace.<br><br>There is also a deeper, more\
      \ adventurous path in which you can complete complex puzzles to restore life\
      \ changing events of the patients history in order to help the validation of\
      \ their life.<br><br>Parallel paths make Ether One accessible to a range of\
      \ skilled players. Invite your friends and family around to pick their brains\
      \ for help taking on challenging environmental puzzles, or soak in the atmosphere\
      \ of Pinwheel at leisure. From a young age we enjoyed the first person puzzle\
      \ games that required you to write cryptic notes on spare pieces of paper to\
      \ unravel mysteries. Ether One aims to bring back pen and paper puzzle solving,\
      \ whilst still being accessible and optional for people not wanting to get stuck\
      \ and frustrated on the harder puzzles.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">features</h2><ul\
