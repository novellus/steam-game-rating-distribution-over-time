In this way, the film presents the story in an almost 'believable' way and avoids many of the cheesy mistakes made by other films.\n\nIf you enjoy the occult, demonic, and religious imagery/themes, then this is a great film for you.\n\n","timestamp_created":1509489484,"timestamp_updated":1509489484,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510191798210144043","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjrSlut8Cd/qAigE="}
