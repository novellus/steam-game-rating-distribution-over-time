    review: 'It''s good enough for this kind of a short game.

      And it''s cheap enough to not be mad about it.

      The music really does fit nicely into the game.

      I don''t have anything negative to say about it.

      This deserves a positive review in my opinion.

      It sadly features only a tiny handful of songs.

      Buy this only if you want to support the devs.'
