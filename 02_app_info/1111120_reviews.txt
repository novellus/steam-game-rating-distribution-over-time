Once again ace detective Hank Anderson and his trusty partner Gwen head up an investigation this time in the city of Malrith to track down a mysterious serial killer who is leaving a trail of bodies all throughout the metropolis. The gangs all here as you will also team up with pivotal characters from the first title. Dr. Alzyra, a brilliant vampire scientist, Medina, a compassionate nurse and last but not least Miroslava, a strong-willed one-woman wrecking crew. Also, two new people will join the investigation as Hank and his team attempt to put an end to the killing spree that is terrorizing the city. \n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\n\nLike the first title this is a roleplaying game with your character earning skill points for completing various objectives. Said skill points can then be used to upgrade a skill tree consisting of Athletics for physical feats, Charisma used to coerce or gain information from other people and Erudition which is knowledge that can be applied to the use of science and computers. You can use these skill points to tailor your version of Hank Anderson as you see fit by investing all points into one ability or spreading them out for a more balanced character...the choice is yours. Choose carefully though as the skills that Hank possesses will allow him to handle situations in varying ways of success or failure. Another new addition to the series which I absolutely enjoyed is the city map which allows you to actually drive your car to different locations around town. This really adds to the feeling of being a detective as you move around to various crime scenes and search for clues. \n\nThere are also sidequests available in the form of \"Missing Persons\" whom you can choose to pursue on your off-time or while conducting the main investigation if you decide to take on the extra work. Locating these people, preferably alive, will net you additional skill points and currency to spend and it will have an effect on the overall safety and well being of the entire city. As with the original title you have the opportunity to pursue one or more romances with a number of female friends and co-workers over the course of the game if you should choose to do so. Exploration of the locations that you investigate is encouraged as you'll sometimes find useful items that can aid you in some way if you're resourceful and keep your eyes open. \n\n[h1]VISUALS[/h1]\n\nThis is a RPGMaker title that makes terrific use of the programs assets. The locations are wonderfully laid out, nicely detailed and filled with bright and beautiful colors when appropriate like in the suburbs for example and dreary tones when necessary for say...an abandoned warehouse or the sewers beneath the city. There's alot of variety to the many different areas that you visit over the course of the story. As opposed to Snares Of Ruin and Snares Of Ruin Zero, this title went in a completely different direction with some of the visuals and I for one really enjoyed the new aesthetics very much. The environments have a similar look to the previous games but the in-game sprites and character art used during dialogue sequences has changed altogether. The new cutscene artwork has a grittier look to it in my opinion and it really fits in nicely with the gumshoe narrative of this terrific game. The characters also move their lips during dialogue which definitely helps with immersion as you read. \n\nMoving on, once again you'll visit a myriad of different locations throughout the city as you conduct your investigations from the City Center to the business district and the suburbs as well as the more affluent areas of town. You'll also get a chance to spend some leisure time with your co-workers at a restaurant, a bowling alley, the city park or a bar just to name a few examples. Overall, I really enjoyed the changes made in the visual presentation between this latest title and the previous entries.\n\n[h1]SOUND[/h1]\n\nThe aural presentation of this game is terrific from the sounds of the user interface to various in-game sound effects such as cell phones ringing, combat as well as many others. The soundtrack is also fantastic and I really wish it was available for download but sadly like the previous games it is not. Such a shame though as many of those songs are quite memorable and have a catchy beat. \n\n[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]\n\nI enjoyed this game so much dare I say even moreso than the original title perhaps? The story was intriguing, the gameplay alot of fun with even some new elements introduced and a terrific new visual style that I adored. As always you can create the type of detective that you envision and there are a bevy of choices to make throughout the narrative that have an impact on current events as well as the ending. Replayability is high, again due to the decisions that you can make and for acquiring all the achievements if that's your thing. Also if you're fans of Astronomic Games and you pay close attention you might spot a couple of \"easter eggs\" hidden over the course of the narrative. \n\nOn the technical side, I didn't have many issues but did start to suffer some lag and a crash to desktop towards the end of the title but nothing game breaking. As far as extra content goes, there are an abundance of Steam Achievements to hunt down but sadly no Steam Trading Cards to collect. In summary, I loved this next title in the franchise and really look forward to more sleuthing adventures with detective Hank Anderson and his crew so Snares Of Ruin 2 is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to story-rich roleplaying gamers who also like the fact that choice matters.","timestamp_created":1575105485,"timestamp_updated":1575105485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.706295490264892578","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jMvm3e4Ceqv43wE="}
