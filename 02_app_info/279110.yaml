    review: "Surprisingly, among other \"Sacred 3\" DLCs, this one feels like a gem.\
      \ \n\nMalakhim character is basically a solid hybrid of blood mage and the master\
      \ of poisoning, so he feels like originated from Dark Elf from \"Sacred 1\"\
      \ and Inquisitor from \"Sacred 2\". Despite Kython can't use his wings, he is\
      \ really fast both in action or on a walk. His weapons are fast, and magic is\
      \ strong even withour a proper build, he require much less time to hit someone.\
      \ Also, he has arguably the best voice action: combined with story of harsh\
      \ untolkative warrior, who want just to save Ancaria and then to vanish from\
      \ its history, and mature model, it gives the feeling that he is the true saviour\
      \ of that land. Seraphim, Khukuri, Safiri and Ancarian look more cartoonish,\
      \ and act more like children. Moreover, the exact fighting style of Malakhim\
      \ is one of the few things that really help \"Sacred 3\" to feel like something\
      \ new and unique.\n\nBut I should mention, that Deep Silver definately chose\
      \ the strategy to make more money from this character. He was planned to be\
      \ in \"Sacred 3\" from the beginning of, at least, stages when the concept was\
      \ completely done. But when the game was released, Malakhim was scrapped into\
      \ DLC; despite it's cheap, you had to pay for that independently. Or, you should\
      \ have been pre-ordered \"Sacred 3\", it was a bonus for customers. I wouldn't\
      \ mind, but the four characters, presented in a base game, were of much weaker\
      \ gameplay and concept compared to Malakhim, hence it might be considered as\
      \ a wery light form of \"pay to play\" strategy. I don't see it as a reason\
      \ to vote negatively for that part of game, it's just for the full picture.\n\
