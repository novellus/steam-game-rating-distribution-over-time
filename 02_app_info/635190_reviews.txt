You get three pups, I'm going to be generous here and say corgi, husky and white mutt. It's all a reskin of the same pup, but I didn't expect more than that for the price. So you pick your pup, sounds or not and you can feed, pet or play with puppers. \n\nPlay is tossing the ball which has really broken physics, unfortunately. Get it for the meme factor or the cute puppers to pet, just don't expect more than what you see. If the puppers were expanded and some relaxing music added it wouldn't be a bad title. \n\nStrangely I noticed the puppies are more active in meme mode and will sit up nicely. It's kind of a shame they don't do more.","timestamp_created":1575757775,"timestamp_updated":1575757775,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ifCe8e4Ce4jm4gE="}
