I am a big fan of pixelated games, and Dog Sled Saga definitely delivers on that front. It honestly reminds me a bit of Oregon Trail, which was one of my favorite games when I was younger. \n\nThe game play itself is also fun, as it is challenging enough to not be boring, but also not so hard that it makes me want quit playing (although you definitely need a mouse to successfully perform the sledding actions). \n\nThe \"characters\" in the game can also be compelling and I personally got attached to my dog sled teams because I projected my own pets' personalities onto them. I even didn't mind the rival story line, but my one complaint is that the overall story of the game was rather lackluster and pretty much non-existent. \n\nBut, if you aren't looking for an intense or story driven game and just want to have some fun making a dog sledding team, this game is perfect for you.","timestamp_created":1609786460,"timestamp_updated":1609786460,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9oCw5/YCeeK8wAI="}
