It is NOT \"pure Jewel matching experience\"  it is more mini challenges.  \nThis game plays and lays like a phone app game.  There is no volume control on the sound, just on and off.   The game is very loud.  The puzzles are very small and o not get bigger.  The wheels in the images are random, no control.   Each of the \"hundreds' of puzzles are about 9 x 9 in size which leaves no room for setting up moves.  There are limits of 1 to 2 minutes or 15 - 40 moves so the puzzles are not the standard 5 minute runs.\n\nIf you love Jewel Quest 1 - 3, especially the tournament mode at the end of JQ3, this is not that game.","timestamp_created":1608228012,"timestamp_updated":1608228012,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/v/2uPYCesf/ugI="}
