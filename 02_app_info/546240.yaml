    review: '[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers [/h1]


      I actually spent .99 cents USD on this a while back on July 2017. I finally
      got around to playing this. Was it worth it? Nope, I would have been better
      never playing this game and leaving it in my backlog. I would have been better
      never having spent these .99 cents. C''est la vie. This is a great concept game,
      with very bad execution. As many people mention in the reviews, the controls
      are horrible and indeed they are. I questioned my sanity several times. Where
      am I going? Is my ship moving? Should I keep going? What am I doing?


      The answer to all those questions is losing my sanity. This may be an educational
      game about the human body, but it''s really an educational game on patience.
      How much are you willing to put up with to learn some tidbits about the human
      body. It may very well be a cleverly disguised psychological experiment. How
      far will the rat go to get this promise of a cheese in the face of many reasons
      to quit? A true test of the Sunken Costs Fallacy.


      [i]You come in through the mouth and hopefully leave in the butt hole if you''re
      lucky. And I saw things, things that shouldn''t be seen. Yes, turds. Talk about
      PTSD. Neil Armstrong may have gone to the moon and risked life and limb for
      human discovery, but I saw things that no man should see in VR.[/i]
