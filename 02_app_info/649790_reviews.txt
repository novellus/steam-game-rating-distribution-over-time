I had a couple dollars credit that was burning a hole in my pocket and said screw it and bought the game.  It's really cute and I'm glad I did.  Not a fan of games with this mini fishing game but it's not too bad in this one.  It's worth the cheap price tag for sure even at full price.  edit: ouch ok not worth $15, didn't realize the price tag was so high.  For some reason I thought it was like $10.  Yah, buy it on sale.","timestamp_created":1609346130,"timestamp_updated":1609346234,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6dag2vYCcrXpvgI="}
