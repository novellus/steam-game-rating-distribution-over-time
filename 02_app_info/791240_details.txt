We're currently working with a publisher to rerelease with some new content and improved performance. We intend for Lumote to be available again with a bunch of new stuff on PC along side a console launch in 2021. I can't give you any more details quite yet but there will be an announcement soon. Hopefully we'll be able to make a bigger splash releasing with more stuff on more platforms all at the same time!<br><br>Be sure to give us a wishlist and pop by our <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/discord.gg\/lumote\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >discord<\/a>and say hello!<br><br>If you really need Lumote in your life right now, try your hand at crochet!

Blue power controlled by Lumote and red by the Mastermote. You play as Lumote, whose only abilities are to jump and to possess. You must take control of the world's inhabitants, the Motes, and use their abilities to progress. Depending on whose power controls a Mote, their behaviour will either help or hinder you on your journey into the depths as you search for the Mastermote.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>That's one big world!<\/strong><\/h2><br>The world of Lumote is a single massive environment containing six towers and fifty puzzles. Each tower marks your mastery of a specific Mote and unlocks a new set of puzzles to explore.
