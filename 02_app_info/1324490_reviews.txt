[i]I hate this.[/i] Anywho, let's get into it.\n\nThere are two major parts to this game, visual novel-like cutscenes and battle. Each battle is separated by a chapter of dialogue, and you may save between chapters or turns (during battle). Battle is turnbased, and fought from an overhead view. All units have an attack and movement range, and wide variety of skills and stats which affect their capabilites. Units gain advantages based on terrain and height. It's in your best interest to strategically position troops, rather than charging enemies and spamming \"attack\". In addition to terrain and abilities, some units provide \"tactics\", which offer useful buffs and special attacks for nearby units.\n\nTo be honest, the battle is actually pretty fun — it's the highlight of this title. I found battle to be difficult enough where it'll keep you on your toes, but not so hard you'll slam the \"Esc\" key faster than you can scream [i]feck.[/i]\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nCaptain Prosper is on his way to Suthar. He is joined by Vyla, his right-hand navigation woman. They are to deliver smuggled goods to Old Man Pierro, a famous chemist known for his \"special\" medicine. Following the exchange, Leah barges in with urgent news — Ispar is overun with pirates. Old Man Pierro offers Prosper a healthy sum in exchange for his crew's help defeating the Pirates. They encounter and defeat Pyrka, the pirate captain whom swears revenge on Prosper.\n\nHuh, I wonder when she'll be back.\n\nThe next day Prosper is tasked with smuggling an anonymous woman from the island of Archi to Siaru. They set sail, and on their way to Archi they are intercepted by Pyrka.\n\nOh hey! She's back!\n\nCaptain Prosper defeats her (again) and retrieves his woman. They leave town, [i]and[/i] that's as far as I could get for the night.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe titlescreen is boring — it appears to be a low-resolution photo with a filter slapped over it, though the interface was stylistically appropriate. This will be a common theme for the remainder of the game. From \"Config\", you may adjust audio and a variety of gameplay preferences. I could not see any options for display or resolution. Characters are represented by portraits, and they look [b]awful.[/b] They look like they were made in MS Paint, and in some cases appear to be \"frankensteined\" using multiple images. There is no gallery, which I feel should be a staple for any lewd game worth its salt. \n\n[b]- The Goods -[/b]\nSex-scenes are rendered via text and one or more static CGs. Despite the shortcomings of the artwork, I liked the way the characters were drawn. However, it is in my opinion that the CGs are of poor quality, and the text accompanying them equally shoddy. I was not a fan of the backdrops used against the characters. To my knowledge, CGs cannot be fullscreened. Expect male-on-female intercourse.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nI recommend this game provided that it is (A) on sale and (B) you're willing to look past its glaring flaws. The artwork leaves [b]a lot[/b] to be desired, and the story telling was far from riveting. I was not a fan of the chapter-by-chapter gameplay, and I would liked something more akin to an RPG or point-n'-clicker, where I could explore towns or upgrade my crew between battles. This is a flawed, but nonetheless fun game. \n \n[h1]Support the Wombat[/h1]\nIf you enjoy my reviews, please follow my Curator page.
