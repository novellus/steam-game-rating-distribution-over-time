It was one of those games that I wasn't sure if id like it or not but I took a chance and im so glad I did. After watching a few YouTube videos and learning how to play it  I absolutely love this game. Im a Total war series veteran but this is where the real war gaming is. There is great satisfaction in getting your strategy right and winning battles. The Ai is really good and im finding it a real challenge. I played with toy soldiers when I was a boy ,those Airfix ones and this is like a huge tabletop toy soldiers battle. The units look fantastic and there are so many factions to play with. Just a fantastic game I highly recommend it.","timestamp_created":1609629603,"timestamp_updated":1609629603,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51881331205368042","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y9LZ4vYCcezxvwI="}
