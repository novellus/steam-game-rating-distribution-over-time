    about_the_game: "Mr. Trump! Mr. Trump! You have 5 minutes until your big speech.\
      \ Don't forget your To-Do List! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe weight of the world\
      \ rests in your tiny little hands. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n***Profits will go to\
      \ support the refugee crisis at Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS)***<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nWe created this game to poke political fun while also calling attention\
      \ to serious issues. Frustrated with the election and how so many controversies\
      \ seemed to pile up and be forgotten, the jokes in the game are intended to\
      \ inspire outside research - for example, what's with the hands circled in gold\
      \ sharpie about? Are those real tweets he actually wrote?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      \ We are passionate about finding ways to engage our peers with our political\
      \ system, and we thought a virtual reality game would be a novel, entertaining\
      \ medium to learn more about the Republican candidate. That being said, Trump\
      \ Simulator does not comment on everything and should not be taken too seriously,\
      \ but rather to remind everyone there is nothing serious about Trump as a candidate.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA PostModem game- made entirely under 50 hours by\
      \ a single developer. Distributed by The Family. Exclusively on HTC Vive."
