    review: "[i]This review is part of my mini-project to review all four of the Johnny\
      \ games.  The Revenge of Johnny Bonasera is a 4-part episodic series by independent\
      \ developer Rafael Garc\xEDa.  The series began in late 2016 and concluded in\
      \ early 2020.  The developer has floated the possibility of doing a fifth game\
      \ at some point in the future, but the series is currently finished; The four\
      \ games that are out tell a complete story with no loose ends.  Each game in\
      \ the series takes about two to three hours to complete, and each successive\
      \ game is a bit larger and more ambitious than the previous entries.\n\nThe\
      \ series follows a physically weak but terribly ruthless young boy.  In the\
      \ first game, which works as a standalone title, Johnny takes revenge on some\
      \ teenaged punks who ruin his sandwich.  The second, third, and forth games\
      \ change course a little bit and follow a whole story arc as Johnny takes revenge\
      \ on some aliens who have abducted his mother.\n\nMy overall impression of the\
      \ series as a whole is positive.  Johnny is not as big or as flashy as many\
      \ other games; but it doesn't feel like it is even trying to compete with those.\
      \  I am writing these reviews on Jan 2, 2020, the day after Adobe Flash officially\
      \ died.  Johnny feels like exactly the kind of game that would have existed\
      \ and thrived as a mega-hit on a site like Newgrounds or Kongregate had it come\
      \ out 15 years earlier.  With the basic cartoonish art style, large and crudely\
      \ animated sprites, vaguely adolescent humor, and simplicity of design, the\
      \ series brings me a certain nostalgia for that era of gaming.[/i]\n\nThis is\
      \ the final (for now) entry in the Johnny series, and is the best one.  In this\
      \ final game, we finally get the payoff we have been building up to, where Johnny\
      \ reaches the alien ship and takes it down.  This is the longest and most complex\
      \ of the four Johnny games.\n\nIn this game, there are a staggering seven playable\
      \ characters, a series first.  We also get a new switching mechanic, where we\
      \ can toggle control between multiple characters to solve a single puzzle. \
      \ While we play as Johnny for most of the game, we also play as a superhero\
      \ also on board the spaceship, three captives of the aliens who are trying to\
      \ get free, and there is a long flashback sequence in which we play as two government\
      \ agents on one of their earlier cases.\n\nI recommend playing the other three\
      \ Johnny games before playing this one, but I think the payoff is worth it.\
      \  Here's hoping for a Johnny 5!\n"
