    review: "Having played this game for more than six hours before it was even released\
      \ on Stem, I was excited to hear it was being green lit.  The story is somewhat\
      \ reminiscent of Mario looking for the princess but the action is different.\
      \  There is far more intrigue to be found in the messages along the way than\
      \ you ever experienced in Mario.  There is also a \"Link-like\" flavor for those\
      \ that remember that classic.  Really when you think about it, this game is\
      \ a conglomeration of a lot of the favorites from the past. \n\nIf you only\
      \ play the game an hour or so, you can hardly even begin to experience the intense\
      \ battles that ensue; as with almost any game, the first few levels are easy\
      \ so that you can get accustomed to the game play (or maybe that is just to\
      \ make you feel like \"you can do this!\").  Of course, if you are someone that\
      \ doesn't like a challenge, you will be put off by having to back track when\
      \ you come to a level unprepared.  This facet of the game reminds me a lot of\
      \ Link...if you were not ready to go to a certain part (or land) of the game,\
      \ no way were you getting in.  Had to go back and get what you needed!  Just\
      \ thought about Boy and His Blob!  That's the way it is with this game. \n\n\
      Of course, any serious gamer wants to experience hours and hours of entertainment,\
      \ frustrating moments (trying to get through all the laser beams or going back\
      \ to get bombs because you blew up too many needlessly), intrigue and bewilderment\
      \ (exactly how do I get out of here???? moments).  Definitely a game worth your\
      \ time.  Thumbs up!"
