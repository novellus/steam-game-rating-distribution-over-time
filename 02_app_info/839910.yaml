      \ /><br><br>Mythgard is set in a modern world where mythical creatures and gods\
      \ roam among mere mortals. A world where winged beasts battle commercial jets\
      \ for dominance of the skies and magic rivals the everyday use of technology.\
      \ Harnessing these powers and utilizing the unique mechanics of Mythgard is\
      \ the only way to prove your worth and claim your mark among the legends of\
      \ Mythgard.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/839910/extras/gameplay.png?t=1609285626\"\
      \ /><br><br>Mythgard is a game built from the ground up with gameplay and board\
      \ interactions in mind. The unique mana-burn system puts you in control of your\
      \ resources while adding a strategic depth yet to be seen in any other CCG.\
      \ The process is simple, burn a card to create a mana gem of that color, the\
      \ burnt card is then cycled back into your deck and cannot be burnt again, but\
      \ can be played.<br><br>The battle board is broken up into seven lanes, which\
      \ allows for even more player ownership in a match. Casting spells, placing\
      \ creatures and positioning your magical enchantments are all decisions you\u2019\
      ll face every turn. The sheer amount of both versatility and player agency opens\
      \ Mythgard up for some of the most tense match-ups you\u2019ll play in any CCG.<br><br><img\
