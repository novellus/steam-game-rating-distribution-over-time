I haven't got to play the local co-op, the reason I bought it, because one controller controls both characters.  I've tried Xinput and Dinput, neither work.  Every other game I play in Steam, Gog or Epic that uses a controller, works.  This sucks, this has actually dissuaded me from supporting up and comers.","timestamp_created":1597796618,"timestamp_updated":1597796618,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50205761194229126","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1600136402,"developer_response":"Hello mbigler13, thank you for trying out Colossal Saga! \nWe apologize for the poor experience you had with the local co-op part of the game. As the game is in Early Access, we've been working tirelessly to finish the new features we've implemented into the game as well as polishing existing material. Since we're implementing rapid changes very often, we have not updated the Early Access game with the massive new patch. That being said, we don't want you to feel like you've made a mistake by supporting up and comers so we'd like to make it up to you by deploying the latest version of the build shortly, which includes a fully revamped controller system (for both solo and local co-op). \n\nWe are very close to finalizing this new build; we can safely say it will be available by the end of next week. We apologize for the poor experience and we hope the update will provide a much more enjoyable time."}],"cursor":"AoJw8bGGgvQCeqOpnAI="}
