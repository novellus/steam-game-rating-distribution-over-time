The compatibility with the vive controller is a bit poor.The object of my CPR is to put a pillow in a mountaineering bag and tighten it.\nWhen CPR on the ground, pressing your hand on the cotroller will loss position.\nThe CPR process cannot be stop / exited. [realy?]\nI seem to be able to rotate / reset the position, but I'm not prompted to do anything at all.And slightly more expensive.A the process base on AHA CPR Guidelines 2005?[or older?]\nThe action \"see + listen and feel the breath for ten seconds\" has been removed in the AHA CPR Guidelines 2010.\n\nAs a 2019 VR work hope to keep up with the latest standards,maybe AHA CPR Guidelines 2015 or 2020?\n\nlooking forward to better ux","timestamp_created":1576865053,"timestamp_updated":1577189824,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.640522897243499756","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4Nr1m+8CcaPM5QE="}
