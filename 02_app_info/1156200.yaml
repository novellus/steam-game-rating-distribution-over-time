    about_the_game: "Welcome to our virtual yoga practice. The session we\u2019ve\
      \ built is suitable for everyone, both beginners and those already on the yoga\
      \ path. <br />\r\nDuring the practice we want to strengthen our attentiveness.\
      \  We practice to the exact extent of our abilities at this moment, and from\
      \ the principle of non-injury, or AHIMSA.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the practice\
      \ we are attentive to our bodies, especially our breathing, it directs us. Practice\
      \ is performed unhurriedly, quietly. <br />\r\nYoga is restraining the fluctuating\
      \ consciousness,  without tension and without strength. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      If during the VR session you experience dizziness, discomfort or pain, it\u2019\
      s always possible to stop and take off the headset. The session will stop automatically\
      \ and will resume when the headset is put on again. The more we recruit our\
      \ awareness during the session, the more the practice will be complete and deeper.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe VirtuaLiron yoga practice package includes 3 sessions\
      \ of different length. 30, 60 and 90 minutes. You can choose the form of the\
      \ teacher from 3 different avatars: A female body avatar where subtle changes\
      \ in the body colors indicate the breathing sequence. A muscle model avatar\
      \ where you can see during the practice which muscles are exerting force, and\
      \ a skeleton avatar that shows the bones structure, engulfed in a transparent\
      \ body envelope.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe teacher will always be in your field\
      \ of view, regardless where your head is pointing to. This is a fundamental\
      \ advantage over practice in the real world. You do not need to exit the posture\
      \ or the flow of movement in order to see what the teacher is doing. While you\
      \ practice, your head rotation also determines the angle you will see the teacher\
      \ from."
