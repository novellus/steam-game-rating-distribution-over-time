Instead the scammer bankrupt the developers and the game stopped updating and died. \n\nDon't buy this game, its unfinished, buggy and unbalanced. It looks awesome but you get maybe 4-5 hours playtime and some enemies one shot you while others you one shot. You clip into walls, fall through the world, get lit up by invisible foe's, and many more irritating problems. \n\nIf you have to play it get it for 2$ or less","timestamp_created":1606008827,"timestamp_updated":1606008827,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x73l9vUCcsfkrwI="}
