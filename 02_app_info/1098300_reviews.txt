Master level is fine in this DLC, everything else is just... meh.\n\nBattlemode was honestly a forgettable experience for me so this DLC aside from maybe the shotgun is entirely meaningless to me.\n\nDo what you want, buy it or not for the doots or the nostalgia vibe, at least you don't gain unfair advantages like with Chinese/Korean free-to-play-but-has-microtransactions-up-the-ass.\n\nI am saying no to this DLC simply because the Doot Revenant is a tired, overdone meme, bundled with a bland, generic and really uninspiring shotgun skin with the only reason I myself would buy the Deluxe edition or this DLC is for the master level (and The Ancient Gods DLC if Deluxe edition), that's it.","timestamp_created":1608744929,"timestamp_updated":1609928726,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.4408760666847229","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw39rO6/YCcdbEvAI="}
