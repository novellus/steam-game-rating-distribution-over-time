    review: 'I am going to give a recommendation although I am on the fence with this
      one. It is very very rough, with quite a collection of bugs and glitches and
      a translation that is not the best written English around, but the location
      is unique (though, and I risk it saying this without being from there, I feel
      a lot of anachronisms going on) and that actually gives a lot of interest to
      a point n click game that feels, again, like Still Life and Mystery of the Druids
      mixed together.


      Music is nice but glitches make that two tunes are playing at the same time.
      The backgrounds and animations are ok but there are moments where the perspective
      is lost because the collision is not well designed. The investigation is interesting,
      though it is weird to have the cutscenes portraying a different main character
      than the one you have in the normal game. It is barely comfortable to play,
      but it has TWO hint systems plus the hotspot detection, something I consider
