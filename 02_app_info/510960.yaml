    review: Pretty amazing value and a tonne of variety! I played with Windows Mixed
      Reality headset and controllers, and a play area that was barely big enough,
      so some things were tougher than they should have been (or occasionally, due
      to the different controller design, impossible?). And a few of the puzzles are
      just frustrating, even with a useful hint system. But for the price, who cares?
