    review: Even though the price is steep I bought this because it's the only other
      female character in the game.  Some of her abilities are interesting, but not
      that different than the others.    The big disappointment is the voice acting.  She
      mumbles half her lines, the volume is low and you can't hear half of what she
      says. The game doesn't have a separate volume slider for voices so there's no
      fixing it. I would pass on this class.
