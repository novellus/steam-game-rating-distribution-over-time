    review: Still working on 1cc'ing the original normal mode, so I got to check out
      the arranged OST in game for the first time. It's just as good as the orginal
      FM stuff for the most part. It kinda sounds like Hyakutaro Tsukumo's version
      of the soundtrack with all the synth rocking, but that's not a bad thing at
      all. I like how my favorite track "Survive" sounds in this version in particular.
      Also "Stellar Light". Kudos to Degica for going out of their way to make this
      available.
