    review: I purchased this Early Access of Dungeon Paradox for $15 because i saw
      a video on YouTube with upcoming Turn Based Tactic Games and they had the trailer
      to this game so i was very intrigued.  I am in my late 50's and my first dungeon
      game i played was Wizardry 1 on a 48K  Apple Computer back in the early 80's
      and this game stole alot of hours of my life. Followed by Ultima and then the
      FTL Games "Dungeon Master & Chaos Strike Back" on a Amiga.  Now its years later
      and many Dungeon games later this game peaked my interest. It brings back the
      old flavor of Turn Based Dungeon Crawler but with a Tactical Turn Based Maneuvers,  I
      am glad i purchased this game and cant wait for it be finished.  looking forward
      to see how they develop the combat system further and how the Ai on the advanced
      monsters will look also.
