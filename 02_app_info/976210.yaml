    review: The review written by ColorsFade says it all.  I agree completely.  If
      you buy this expansion, you are paying good money to have the game ruined for
      you.  It takes more than two hours to see the extent of the destruction and
      the absence of anything "good", so don't buy it thinking you will return it
      quickly if you don't like it.  There is not a single change or feature of this
      expansion that I can say is clever or interesting or an improvement.  It is
      appalling.  And they want money for doing this to us.  If you bought the base
      game with this included, disable it for a while and you'll be playing a game
      where your choices in the first 200 turns actually matter.
