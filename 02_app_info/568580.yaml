    review: 'As Phlydaily said, it has been a long time since we had a good game with
      submarines. I think that this game has lot of potential, but also a lot of flaws.
      Here are some of the flaws:

      1.Unbalanced. Why is it, that the russian tier 2 G5 is so op? And, also Japaneese
      submarines. They are way better than others.

      2.Physics. If two ships ram eachother, one of them shouldn''t fly 10 meters
      into the sky and the other one shouldn''t sink to the bottom.

      3.Connection. If you leave the training just as you get connected to a game,
      your connection will crash. Quick restart of the game fixes this issue.

      4.Weird torpedo spawns. On my Krabbe, which has one torpedo tube in the middle,
      a torpedo spawned on the left. And, some submarines can hug the enemy and the
      torp will hit ,while others must be at least 50 meters away, or the torpedo
      will just bounce off the ship (saw a torpedo bounce off a ship and fly 80 meters
      into the sky before falling down.

      5.Some models. For example, on the tier 2 or maybe tier 3 american ship,the
      guns in the glass domes on the top don''t turn.

      6.Glitched damage counter. You know how when you damage an enemy, bunch of numbers
      show up telling you how much damage have you dealt? Well, when I''m sailing
      somewhere,and my team is fighting far away from me, 1 out of 3 numbers don''t
      show up above the damaged ship, but rather somewhere totally randomly on the
      map.

      7. Amount of xp needed for the heavy ships.18 000 XP?! Really? Didn''t you add
      one too many zero''s?

      8.Weird prices. Price of a Biber? 180 000 or something. Price of a new engine?
      150 000. I don''t think that''s how it works irl.

      9. The servers have been down for years, although I''ve been checking in here
      and there to see if there is any change. This could''ve been a great game, but
      the amount of flaws it had and the p2w killed it. It still makes me sad though,
      because most of you reading this won''t be able to ever experience the (in my
      opinion) great submarine gameplay that no other game managed to replicate to
      this day.'
