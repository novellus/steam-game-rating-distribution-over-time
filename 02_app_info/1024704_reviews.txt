Read Pierre Clostermann's book about the missions he flew then experience them in DCS.\n\nA number of reviews are negative regarding the performance DCS not the campaign.  DCS is currently very CPU intensive (2.5.6) as much as it is GPU.  It is not optimized for VR, although that is how I prefer to experience it.  I'm getting 30-60 FPS  except for when 70+ B-17s drop their bombs.  That brings the FPS down into the teens.  Eagle Dynamics is working to improve things but if you expect the fluidity of War Thunder, hold off.  For me, I prefer the interactive cockpits and more realistic flight models.","timestamp_created":1609116442,"timestamp_updated":1609116442,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2Yu00/YCc4r4vQI="}
