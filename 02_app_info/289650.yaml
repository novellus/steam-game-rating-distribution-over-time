    review: "Bought on release on the Xbox one. My real time played overall is 274\
      \ hours and 14 min. \n\nImo the best AC game overall. But the release really\
      \ hurt this game. \n\nIf you're sick of the RPG style and or want to try an\
      \ older AC game this is the one to play. Co-op is also a blast when it works...\
      \ that said you can do it solo for an immense challenge. \n\nCombat is also\
      \ skilful , engaging and challenging (at least until you reach the max weapons).\
      \ \n\nFor me it's a 9/10, however realistically it's an 8/10."
