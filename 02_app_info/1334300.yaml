    about_the_game: Charge Kid is a game where each jump is a puzzle. You can compare
      it to Portal, where you have to find clever uses of the mechanics and physics
      to &quot;solve&quot; each location by reaching the desired location. You have
      limited resources to make each jump, comparable to Celeste. But instead of focusing
      on precision-platforming, the game focuses on the puzzle aspect. Unlike Celeste,
      the hard part is figuring out how to use your resources to make each jump instead
      of the execution. But don't get fooled; the execution is also hard, which means
      finding each solution is even harder!<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>

      source (and free!)</h2>You can see the source code by clicking at the website
      link at the right of the page. It was made with the Godot Engine, and you will
      need to download it in order to access the code or to make a playable build,
      in case you want to play it before paying anything. While the game is free,
      you can still buy it here to show us your appreciation ;)
