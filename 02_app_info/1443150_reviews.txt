In my review of Wonderverse I wrote about wanting to see the spotlight on underexposed characters, and here we are...\n\nFirst, this is the Bendis Legion. I don't want to go all \"not muh Legion\", but this is what we've got. There's few, if any, nods to classic iterations of the LoSH, and the characterisation is questionable and, well, Bendis-y. Also the Teen Titans are here, because this game really needed more Titans content.\n\nI've done one playthrough of the content, on Normal. The alert and raid are fine, difficulty feels about right. The final Mordru battle has an annoying mechanic where you can be knocked off the platform and I haven't fully figured it out yet.\n\nBut, biggest issue, the open world \"raid bosses\" are back. I was optimistic about this in Wonderverse, but it became apparent that these fights are absolutely essential to gearing up, forcing players to fight them over and over... and over and over... The currency from instanced content quickly becomes worthless once you start getting Elite gear, all that matters is the raid bosses. And they're not fun. It's just the same fight again and again with no variation. Small groups don't work, large groups make them trivially easy, anything in between just isn't happening. We're down to one alert and one raid, with no solo or duo instance, apparently because the raid bosses are considered to be enough content. It feels like getting much less in an episode DLC, at the same price. And I can already tell how the long hours of farming these things are going to feel.\n\nAs I always end up saying in these reviews, a yes/no recommendation doesn't really apply to DCUO DLC, since you need it for endgame progress (unless you're subscribing, etc.). But, final verdict, I just wasn't impressed by this. It's a poor showing for the Legion and represents an ongoing issue with the focus of the game, which I hope will be reconsidered for the next episode.","timestamp_created":1604618712,"timestamp_updated":1604618712,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":65,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.860217154026031494","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvM6uzfUCfunIrAI="}
