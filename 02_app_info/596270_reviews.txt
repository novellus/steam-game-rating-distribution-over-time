The game was  developed by Deep Shadows and published by Big Fish Games Studio.\n\n\"Crimson Dawn\" is the first episode of \"Tales of Terror.\"\n\n[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]\n\nGame Visuals\n\nI want to mention that the visuals for the game are nicely done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGame Audio\n\nI want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are three different game difficulty modes to choose from: Casual; Expert and Professional.\n\nThe notebook keeps track of the progression in the game. Such as story events and clues.\n\nThere is an interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly. It also indicates that there are certain tasks that need to be completed at certain locations within the game. The interactive map is automatically given at the start of the game.\n\nThere is no padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in place. The inventory panel is stationary.\n\nThere are some interactive items in the game. Some of the interactive items may require extra components before they can be interacted with. All interactive items are marked with a symbol at one of the corners.\n\nThe hidden object scenes consist of the following: Fragmented items; Shadow items; Find 'x' amount; Traditional word lists. Some of these hidden object scenes may require little or no interaction. Most of the hidden object scenes can be replayed in the game's extra feature section.\n\nThere is an optional mini-game: Associated Pairs. It is only available during hidden object scenes.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them. Most of the puzzles can be replayed in the game's extra feature section as well.\n\nThere is a collectible in the game: Scrolls. They are scattered throughout the game for the player to find.\n\nThere are morphing objects (beyond objects) in the game. They are scattered throughout the game for the player to find as well.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nFinal thoughts; I have found the game enjoyable to certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.","timestamp_created":1602460612,"timestamp_updated":1602460686,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538159668445587158","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw67KGjfUCeM+spwI="}
