      of Easy Anti-Cheat</u>.</strong><br><br>BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU AGREE TO
      THE FOLLOWING TERMS:<br><br>1. Easy Anti-Cheat eSports is not compatible with
      any anti-cheat programs other than VAC, therefore you must not run Easy Anti-Cheat
      eSports if you wish to play with any other anti-cheat at the same time. The

      or refused by the game, Easy Anti-Cheat eSports or any other anti-cheat.<br><br>2.
      Easy Anti-Cheat eSports finds game cheats by scanning games' memory, the system
      memory and verifying original game files on disk to ensure they have not been
      modified. Only games' folders (and subfolders) are verified to contain original
      game data. Easy Anti-Cheat eSports may replace or remove permanently any modified
      or custom game files found in games' folders (and subfolders). The use of any
      custom models, textures, sprites or other modified game files may lead to permanent
      ban if they can be considered to give the player an unfair advantage over other
      players.<br><br>3. Easy Anti-Cheat eSports will during the runtime of Counter-Strike
      scan system registry to detect forbidden modifications, settings or other features
      enabled to the game or graphic card drivers.<br><br>4. This software is distributed

    review: EasyAntiCheat is the leading third-party anti-cheat client for Counter-Strike.
      It is unique by being pro-active, keeping focus on countering cheat mechanisms
      rather than on detecting them. This way you can have peace of mind that your
      opponents play clean, and won't be banned only days after having ruined your
      stats. [b]MASTERPIECE![/b]
