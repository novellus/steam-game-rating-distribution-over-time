There is no story, and there's not much to say since the campaign can be completed in 10-20 minutes, so let's just jump into why you shouldn't waste your money here, even if the game is on sale. For those looking for a scary experience, the only \"horror\" element to the game is some reaper guy that can one-hit kill you when he shows up, but the majority of your gameplay will be spent slightly moving shields back and forth to project beams of light to open up the door to the next level. \n\nWhat you're really getting here for $8 CAD is something that feels like a bunch of scrapped ideas and levels from  the alpha version of an abstract/surreal puzzle-platformer, think along the lines of Kairo, that were not good enough to make it into the final product. Furthermore, there are more missing sound effects than ones that are actually included, and overall you'll be unable to shake the feeling that you're just playing a freshman's C- mid-year project. It's certainly not worth the base price, and the $1.99 CAD I paid for it on sale isn't even justifiable. At worst, it should be a buck. At best, it should be free. In an ideal world, the developer would care enough to even add some sound effects, if they're asking such a large price for such a short title.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]1.0/5.0[/b] - It's Bad.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore","timestamp_created":1598022318,"timestamp_updated":1598022318,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.613130033016204834","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+67jiPQCc77snAI="}
