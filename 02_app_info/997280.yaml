      You find yourself in a game where you play VHS tapes as games: each tape shows
      a grainy black-and-white world and is, well a little creepy. Definitely adjust
      your tracking.

      The world within the VHS exists in two-realms, both of which are interconnected.
      The decor is a little satanic and the guests a little unruly. Good luck!


      [b]Hook[/b]

      After his girl became a witch and he lost his job at Fazbear''s Pizza, Jack
      Fortuna''s luck was about to change: being paid to watch TV! Little did he know
      that the TV was also watching him...


      [b]Mechanic[/b]

      A series of puzzles played in first-person

      - each room contains a real world and an invsible world: turing off the light
      allows you to walk in the phased world

      - the phase-space contains keys to solving puzzles in the real-world

      - phase space also contains monsters and demons... some visible, some not

      - real-world items can still have an invisible prescence in the phase-space,
      causing invisible blockers...

      - all rooms need to be solved to open the next room

      - the final room has you downloading important data while scaring away a monster
      invasion by using light once more...


      [b]Accessibility[/b]

      - nothing to overtly offensive, but the tone is scary-horror

      - no real options to control video or audio settings

      - some sections rely on audio to resolve, but with no visual tells to go with
      audio, this poses a real issue for those with hearing sensitivities

      - the controls are fairly standard, though change radically near the endearing

      - navigating the 3D world is clumsy: the collsion bozes around items are too
      big, causing you to often snag on nothing.


      [b]Universe[/b]

      - you enter a black-and-white world of VHS-addled madness

      - death is very frequent: get used to it

      - it is a dark, spooky and alien place


      [b]Delivery[/b]

      - a great sense of peril throughout

      - the horror element is initially very good

      - the level design is awful in places however; this detracts from the horrifying
      core: causing you instead to focus on the bugs rather than the plot

      [h1]Summary[/h1]

      [quote]

      [h1]Stay in the light. This scary game takes you to another dimension: pay close
      attention. Sorely let down by really minor issues, but a compelling world nontheless.[/h1]


      Pros:

      - the universe and designs are strong

      - the VHS gimmick is well-applied


      Cons:

      - some really awful collisions and bugs mean you spend a lot of time frantically
      trying to work around the game than actually fear anything within it.

      - the uneven level-progression and lack of polish, coupled with some real rage-quit
      sections, mean this game though pretty, will most-likely remain unfinished in
      your collection.
