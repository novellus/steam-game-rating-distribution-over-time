    review: Gonna quickly just say that Beat Saber BTS Music Pack is a bit overhyped
      and a bit disorientating to a extent, the map on it takes place above the clouds
      and can really fuck with your eyes. Expert is a bit unjustified in my opinion,
      1000 Notes on a 3 minute song in this pack is a bit too much. I'm not one to
      judge but have fun and enjoy the pack.
