    review: If only these lazy creators had tried at least a little. It would be a
      computer game. But this is literally a copy of the phone game. You don't need
      strategy here, you need luck. In three hours you pass and then a new one. There
      is no drop of balance. And there is potential pity. I don't know why Steam doesn't
      check these games.
