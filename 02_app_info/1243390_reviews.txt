You do lose the feeling of earning, since your gold is always directly gathered, but without it, you would get an extra job to do, you won't see the need to Attack Click or HP Heal Click until a bit later on the game, but if you need to farm you gold coin by coin, it gets overwhelmingly hard to keep up with your health/attacks.\n\nYou should only buy this if it is discounted.","timestamp_created":1582379477,"timestamp_updated":1582379477,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gNXKtvACf9vx8wE="}
