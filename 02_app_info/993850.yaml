    review: "This game is a cute and fun battle puzzle game. In it, you match blocks\
      \ to summon units. Whoever loses all their health first loses. It has decent\
      \ voice acting, graphics, and music. \n\nMy only real complaint with this game\
      \ is that it is a little light on content. After the story mode, which is short,\
      \ there is not much left to do aside from multiplayer. Other than that, though,\
      \ this game is a nice puzzle game that's worth a look. :)"
