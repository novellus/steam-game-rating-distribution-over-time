The assets are generic and mismatched, and the gameplay is equally generic. There is next to no content. When I made the mistake of playing this game, it felt less like it should cost money and more like I should be paid to put up with it; it's incredibly grating.\n\nI wouldn't even recommend this thing to someone I hate. If you want to play a game where you press the arrow keys when prompted, then play Melody's Escape or something and avoid this trash.","timestamp_created":1607584348,"timestamp_updated":1607584348,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9s7fpfYCeaXNuAI="}
