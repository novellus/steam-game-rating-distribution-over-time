Putting it in quotes, because it's not so much of a game as an interactive experience. Like watching a movie, but being able to have complete control to follow whatever characters you want. \n\nThe story was well told, the voice acting believable, and the once I started catching on to clues, was very engrossed. \n\nI only hope there's more where this came from - VR needs more content like this!","timestamp_created":1610029626,"timestamp_updated":1610029626,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqc7P7vYCe7qkwQI="}
