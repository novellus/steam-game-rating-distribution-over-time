    review: "I picked Particle Wars up on a whim months ago during a Steam sale (I\
      \ think), and it has been sitting in my library ever since. Today I decided\
      \ to download and play it.\n\nIs it fun? Yeah, it's a decent experience. It's\
      \ about as fun as it looks in the videos, and the level of challenge is pretty\
      \ balanced. The weapon variety isn't much. I found myself gravitating towards\
      \ the three-bullet shot while I played, since it provided the most spread given\
      \ how inaccurate the bullets seem to be. I might have had more incentive to\
      \ use the other weapons had they been given as upgrades during the game rather\
      \ than just selected in a menu before each level.\n\nYou can definitely tell\
      \ that this game is cheaply made, likely by someone still learning how to create\
      \ games. It's cool that they've reached the point where they can make something\
      \ like this, but there is definitely a lot of room for them to grow as a developer.\
      \ In this game in particular, the performance is pretty shaky. There were a\
      \ lot of moments where the game slowed nearly to a stop for me, about once every\
      \ few minutes. The game is still playable given what it is, and since it slows\
      \ the entire game rather than skipping frames entirely it doesn't impact your\
      \ performance, but it is a bit irritating.\n\nThe music comes across as royalty-free\
      \ electronic music that was downloaded off of some database somewhere. I'm not\
      \ sure if that's actually true, but it got a bit grating after a bit. Thankfully\
      \ there's an option to turn it off, so it's not too big of an issue. Luckily,\
      \ the rest of the sound design is decent, with some crunchy sound effects that\
      \ make it pretty satisfying to shoot enemies.\n\nThe graphics are nothing special.\
      \ There is a LOT of particle usage here, to the point where it gets distracting.\
      \ Whenever you shoot an enemy, a whole wave of shiny particles comes flying\
      \ off of them, and at first it can be really hard to distinguish between these\
      \ harmless particles and actual projectiles or enemies flying toward you. Thankfully,\
      \ it doesn't get too long to get into the groove of the game and learn how to\
      \ tell them apart.\n\nThis game is SHORT. There are six levels and an infinite\
      \ mode, with no other content as far as I can tell. Technically there are 15\
      \ achievements, but I unlocked all of these by simply playing through the six\
      \ main levels and attempting the infinite mode once. All in all, it took me\
      \ about half an hour to play to completion. \n\nThis is including my first playthrough,\
      \ during which I got to level four or five, then went back to the main menu\
      \ briefly to look for options, only to find that I had lost all my progress\
      \ because I hadn't clicked the big \"Save Game\" button on the level select\
      \ menu. During my second playthrough, I clicked it a few times, just to see\
      \ if it worked, but got no feedback. I'm still not sure it actually did anything,\
      \ since I beat the game and closed it. That said, losing my save data wasn't\
      \ such a big deal since it doesn't take very long to beat the first few levels\
      \ again.\n\nSo, is this game worth buying? Well, probably not. There are many\
      \ other games out there that you could get for the same price and play for a\
      \ lot longer. That said, do I regret buying this game? Not really. It's fun\
      \ for what it is, and if you think it looks cool then you'll probably have some\
      \ fun with it for a little bit. If you really want to get this game, go ahead.\
      \ It's a dollar, so it's not like you're throwing away money. This game is decent,\
      \ and I don't regret playing it.\n\nFinal rating: 3 out of 5 stars."
