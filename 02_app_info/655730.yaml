      \ retro-cosy and unique\u201D<br>8/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.gamereactor.se/recensioner/500273/This+Strange+Realm+of+Mine/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Gamereactor</a><br><br>\u201CLots of\
      \ thoughtful design and art here, and it changes up environments in unexpected\
      \ and sinister ways. Despite expecting another throwaway cod-retro FPS, within\
      \ minutes I was sitting up straight and paying attention, and it only got better\
      \ from there.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/07/26/best-new-releases-steam/#more-463703\"\

      One of my favorite things about the wonderful world of indies is the range of\
      \ style and topics small developers can play with. While larger companies tend\
      \ to stick with a formula, truly independent developers can do odd things to\
      \ make a weird point, and leave it up to the players to decide whether the story\
      \ works. Enter This Strange Realm of Mine, a 2D pixelated adventure in psychological\
      \ horror. If you\u2019ve ever wanted to play an old-school first person shooter\
      \ that inexplicably involves a sloth lounging on a rooftop, this is the game\
      \ for you. a game the developers describe as both horror and \u2018feel-good\u2019\
