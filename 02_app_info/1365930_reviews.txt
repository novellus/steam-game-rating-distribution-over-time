I enjoyed the minimal, monochrome level design, and familiarizing myself with each of the game's enemies along with the number of bullets each takes before going down. \n\nIf you've got a little kiting room, you can do quite a bit of work with the mace and save bullets for the most troublesome enemies. In addition, you can sometimes get enemies caught at the entrances of the game's narrow corridors, allowing you to put a hurt on them while out of harm's way.\n\nUnfortunately, the game did not play well with my PC. The one I am using during the holidays is a 3.3 GHz w/ 16 GB ram, coupled with a GTX 960. On two occasions, the game chugged to a standstill. I was barely able to move my character and my system became almost unresponsive. There was nothing to do but quit the game and restart it. Since the game does not save checkpoint information, I was forced to restart a level each time. The game isn't long at all, so it's not that big of a deal, but it was annoying enough to note here.\n\nEven with the game's uninspired story, I still would've given it a recommendation if not for the significant technical issues. Perhaps developer Saulo Rosart will create other moody top-down shooters in the future that play better with my rig.","timestamp_created":1608435949,"timestamp_updated":1608436046,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1608473187,"developer_response":"First of all, thank you so much for playing Shadow Walls means a lot to me.
