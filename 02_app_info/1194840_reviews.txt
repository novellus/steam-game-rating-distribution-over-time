This remastered HD update is perfect since Flash is now on the way out. Plus achievements! The additional DLC is also amazing since it captures and expands on the original concepts while providing a ton of new content.","timestamp_created":1607716141,"timestamp_updated":1607716141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/K7WqfYCfrGZuQI="}
