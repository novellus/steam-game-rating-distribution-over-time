You have a pistol, though you can buy a few more guns as things progress, and eventually a few defensive devices like mines and turrets.\nIn addition your character gets to increase his few stats, and earn perks to personalize the play style. \nNot much more to it than that, but it all seems pretty solid. Nothing fancy, just fun simple and straightforward. \nEasy to recommend.\nADDENDUM: Finished it on the easiest setting in 7.5 hours. I think I got my moneys worth. Want to go back and try again harder.","timestamp_created":1607139945,"timestamp_updated":1607589454,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi4zzpfYCfe6ztwI="}
