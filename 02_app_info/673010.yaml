    review: 'Positive:


      + Good music

      + Colorful graphics

      + Some levels are well designed


      Negative:


      - Story is weird

      - Unfair placement of "special coins" sometimes

      - Bad power ups, except the bee (and the turtle for world 3)

      - No attack except jumping on heads

      - You can''t beat a fish?

      - Enemies look REALLY familiar

      - Bosses are way too easy with the bee upgrade

      - Sometimes your way is obscured by the fron layer

      - You can''t continue your savegame after beating the last level to collect
      more coins



      Everytime i was beginning to enjoy the game, it threw another bummer at me.
      I feel like it has some wasted potential. Some things have changed since i last
      played it, so maybe i will give another shot some day.'
