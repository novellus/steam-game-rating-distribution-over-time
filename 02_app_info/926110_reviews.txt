I mean really good. I had a lot of fun and, what's best, it keeps you going. It's a story about swapped identities, love triangles, honorable knights and beautiful ladies, betrayal and death (hence the title) and the eye of Iago (the way someone sees is not what it seems). \n\nIt's a Middle Age romance set in Romania, more specificially around the Bran Castle which can be seen in the majority of scenes. I have adored the backgrounds of this game! It mixes Medieval architecture with traditional Romanian household items and regional costumes. \n\nAside from the praise I give to the backgrounds and to the soundtrack, I must say that the puzzles are absolutely different from one another. Some of them resemble the ones found in other games of this genre; however, the vast majority are so diverse that you need to think outside the box to solve a puzzle. \n\nFor instance, you have to click on the hand of your protagonist in order to shed light in different spots to retrieve parts of a broken goblet. You'll find out more when you'll purchase and play this game which I definitely recommend! Let's now go over the Pros and Cons for this game.\n\nPROS:\n- Catchy story;\n- Beautiful scenes;\n- Fitting soundtracks;\n- Fast-travelling map;\n- Diverse puzzles and Hidden Objects minigames;\n- In-game achievements unveiled at the end of game;\n- Sidekick funny-looking dog called Bandit;\n\nNEUTRE:\n- I didn't know up until the end of the game that the pink dog rose is the Hint button;\n- I would have wanted to belly rub Bandit;\n- I didn't see a Romanian in the credits, so now I understand why some words written in the Romanian language are grammatically and ortographically wrong.\n- It's alright, thought. The words don't hinder the game in anyway. Plus it makes the player feel an authentic experience of the Romanian culture and tongue.\n\nCONS: \n- Even if it has Steam Overlay, I still couldn't take any screenshots. So no screenshots.\n- No Trading cards;\n- No Steam achievements (as we usually know them);\n- The Guide book doesn't give you clear instructions on how to solve a HO minigame or a puzzle;\n- No Journal entries.\n\nAll in all, I recommend it to anyone looking for a romance story and a good adventure. I just love Nicolae! Kudos to the developers for creating such a character! I would love to see more of these games from this developer. \n\nI would like to hear your opinion as well. How did you find the story? How did you think about the mechanics of the game? And so on. Please write and let me know. Until next game!","timestamp_created":1603056960,"timestamp_updated":1603056960,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoIDpnvUCe6DcqAI="}
