It is worth its asking price. Its a good looking game, a little wonky on controls. Its customization is adequate.  In other words its not like you are buying a $60.00 game. So if you are new to VR and want to get an idea of what this type of game is like, this is a great start. Its sets a standard high enough to know anything less is not quality, while  giving you an idea of what to look for when upgrading to the more expensive games.","timestamp_created":1608224219,"timestamp_updated":1608224219,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ498PouPYCcu/9ugI="}
