It is a mini city building game with elements of an idle game. The most of the time I played this game was during class. It is worth buying for a few euro at the steam sale.\n\nI recommend the game.\n\n+ Happy art style/graphics.\n+ Easy steam achievements.\n\n- No difficulty setting.\n- Some anoying bugs.\n- low replay value.","timestamp_created":1607952560,"timestamp_updated":1607952560,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+J3csPYCe5eQugI="}
