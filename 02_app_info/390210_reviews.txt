I wanted to like this game so much, but I just can't. Even when I changed the controls to match more to what I'd prefer, it still just felt too off. great effort though. Also I've glitched the game out without even trying in some cases. I would rate as neutral if that was an option, as it is very close to good enough.","timestamp_created":1543679142,"timestamp_updated":1598912523,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r52no/QCe/+XtAE="}
