I feel that the game has potential......but it crashed repeatedly forcing me into a hard reboot, and just was not worth the effort.  So I returned it.   While I realize that the game is an early release, there should be some basic standards before expecting people to drop some cash down.  \n\nAs for the game: The best way I could describe the game is a hybrid of \"marble madness warriors with King of the Hill\".  Knock the others off the board and be the last one standing (or rolling).  The game has some fun moments, and I think it has some creative aspects to try and mix things up a bit.  It is fun to have four players rolling around which can lead to some laughter.  The game can, however get a bit stale.  One suggestion I have for the developers:  See if you can offer a mix of players \"powers\", so that players don't get fed up with the same old \"cheese move\" over and over again.\n\nWhile I wish I could recommend this game, I just can't.  I feel that until the developers hammer out the bugs a bit more, this game it just not ready for the community.","timestamp_created":1545618256,"timestamp_updated":1545618256,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469964683055877686","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1545688708,"developer_response":"Uncle Grievious,\n\nThank you for bringing this to our attention.
