Apparently, I was a particularly stupid child as I couldn't even get past the first scene where you have to run away from the beast! It's funny, I always remembered the game though. There is something weird and beautiful about the low-pixel art style and the design of the world; I was always intrigued to know what was going on!\n\nSo I've returned to complete the game as an adult, and I have to say that there are some extremely un-intuitive puzzles in there, it made me feel a little less bad for how little I managed to complete when I was younger! I would say that the art style holds up remarkably well and would recommend going through it if you're a fan of modern games like Limbo and Inside and want to experience a classic of that genre.","timestamp_created":1609849090,"timestamp_updated":1609849090,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/fWe6fYCf6rXwAI="}
