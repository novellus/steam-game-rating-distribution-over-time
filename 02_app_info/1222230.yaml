    review: " TL;DR: I was a beta tester, single player mode OK, multiplayer mode\
      \ awesome. \n\n\nBiased review here\nI was one of the beta testers for Space\
      \ Ranger. mainly the multiplayer mode\nI am not paid to review this game and\
      \ it is not part of my job.\n\nI Was never a big fan of space games or flight\
      \ sims so I was a bit skeptic for the amount of fun I could produce from playing\
      \ this game.\nThe single-player mode as it exists in it's current form today\
      \ (in early access stage), is OK, It's not awesome, It's not greatness, It's\
      \ OK. I think I finished the campaign in about 2 hours.\nHave nothing much to\
      \ say about the single player, maybe if you're a flight sim fan you will dig\
      \ it. it was not really my cup of tea.\n\nThe true source of happiness in this\
      \ game is reveled when you go online to the multiplayer mode.\nYou actually\
      \ have to gain true experience as a pilot to be able to dogfight anyone else\
      \ on multiplayer and I friking love it.\nI found myself spending hours in the\
      \ game trying to find new maneuvers  to surprise my opponent from the back,\
      \ or from the front in a head on encounter.\nThere are a lot of variables to\
      \ take into account while chasing someone in a dogfight or running away from\
      \ them in one (warping, speed, distance, engine trail, gravity of other ships\
      \ etc...) so, there is always some way for you to either kill the other guy\
      \ or out maneuver him when he is chasing you.\nIt's like every time you kill\
      \ or get killed, you learn a new skill or a new way of action that you could\
      \ not think of before.\n\nThis true gain in experience you get from each dogfight\
      \ is worth the entire game for me."
