      game features a very deep, truly physics based combat system. This is not just
      some animation feature, it is a fundamental difference that is central to gameplay.
      Real momentum, forces and collisions are always at play here, every nuance of
      your inputs is crucial to the outcome. This will likely be unlike anything you''ve
      played before and may take some practice, but can be hugely rewarding and the
      skill cap is virtually infinite. It is not particularly fast paced or difficult
      but it does require you to pay attention, it is very tactical and just casually
      pressing buttons won''t get you very far!</strong><br><br>Our goal is to create
      a deep and immersive RPG world based on a more advanced simulation supporting
      an unprecedented level of dynamic and emergent gameplay. All of the technology
      we use including the game engine is our own, developed from the ground up to
      realise this vision.<br><br>Exanima is born as a prelude to Sui Generis (SG),
      our ambitious open world RPG that has been in development for over two years
      following a successful Kickstarter campaign. Exanima is a smaller yet complete
      game in its own right, a dungeon crawler that takes place in SG''s Underworld
      some twenty years prior to its events. Both games are being developed in concert,
      many of SG''s more ambitious features will make an appearance in Exanima as
      development continues.<br><br>Exanima provides a reasonably complete and meaningful
      game experience, but many more features are on their way! We have met our most
      challenging and significant development goals, now we are ready to bring new
      features to light and make an even more fun and compelling adventure. Here are
      some of the planned features, with many already being close to completion:<br><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Per session and global character skill progression<br></li><li>Large
      non-linear main game following early content<br></li><li>Build and permanently
