This is the DLC to [i]Annotation of Love[/i].)\n\n[h1]You'll be getting this if you want to 100% this game![/h1]\n\nYep, this enables the missing achievement for this game.  Support the developers with this DLC to their free game if you loved their base game.\n\nIt promises text, audio (to download), and video gameplay of the developers playing the game... yeah, I know it sounds disappointing and like something that you could expect from your own gameplay.  So, what's the reason to get this DLC?Aside from what I just mentioned, it's to support the developer (if you enjoyed the game) and to unlock an achievement.\n\nThat said, do I recommend it?  Outside of supporting the developer and unlocking 1 achievement, I wouldn't recommend it.   So...why did I do it?  I thought the developer did a decent job with the music and the lack of completion was bugging me.  Whether you get this DLC or not is entirely up to you, but I'd advise against it.\n\n1/10  Basic dev support DLC.  (Leniency for a decent job on the base game)","timestamp_created":1522555663,"timestamp_updated":1522642623,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575708508491516113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4odOkwuICf/mSnQE="}
