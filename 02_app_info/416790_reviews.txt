Having to switch back and forth between different party members as you play is very awkward and messes up my rhythm. I also really don't like how you get kicked out of a song if you run out of hp. There really needs to be an option to play for fun/workout purposes so that you can keep going until the end of the song. I was hoping to play this with a small child, but she can't last 15 seconds at the easiest difficulty level, so it is unplayable for someone who isn't any good at it. Seems very geared toward a skill gamer who is playing using a keyboard, which feels like it defeats the purpose of releasing a dance pad game like this.","timestamp_created":1609543212,"timestamp_updated":1609543212,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvouQ4PYCd5nGvwI="}
