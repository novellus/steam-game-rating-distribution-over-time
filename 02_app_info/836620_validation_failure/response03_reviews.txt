I walked away from playing this game for two hours feeling like I had just written a 10 page research paper on how tap water is made.\nFor one, there is an ABSURD amount of things on the screen while playing. Most RPG's have a health bar, abilities, minimap, and maybe a chat. This has so many things I didn't even care to try and take the time to figure them all out. Secondly, the game is so freaking confusing, it didn't give me a tutorial of any kind and most of the cut scenes are insanely long and you have to read them, which is stupid. I played this game for two hours, and I still had almost no idea what I was doing or where I was going. It would take a very large amount of hours to really have a good understanding of the game, and any game that takes that long to figure out is far from worth it. \nDon't buy this game. Seriously. There are so many better games out there that are actually worth your time and money. I would even recommend you play Overwatch over this. If you're looking to throw ten bucks at a game, go buy Stardew Valley. That game may be dumb, but at least it's fun.","timestamp_created":1610308805,"timestamp_updated":1610308805,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mMz49vYCe9KTwgI="}
