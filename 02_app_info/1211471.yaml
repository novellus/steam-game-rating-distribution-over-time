    review: I truly can recommend this route, absolutely stunning and very well done.
      When I buy a route then I buy it for the route alone, not for the locomotives
      or assets included. I do have my own Pro version trains and so have many others
      as well. I must say that the route and scenery is very well done, as a huge
      collector of Railworks routes and assets, from Steam and all other third party
      Devs I must rate this route far above 80 to 90% of the available routes out
      there. I love the distant scenery in this route, I can see how every detail
      was done to perfection and distant scenery is mostly absent in many routes,
      this route is standing out far above the most. I don't want to offend someone
      but this route surely does not deserve the rubbish status as in the reviews
      here, I am actually upset because it almost caused me not to buy this route
      but I took a chance and must say that reviews like rubbish status keep people
      from buying a very good route. There is not a boring moment and I like this
      route a lot. I almost missed a very good route. My rating for this route 9.8
      out of 10. Well done JT, you dis a great job !
