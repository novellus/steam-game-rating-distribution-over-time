    review: 'I really enjoy these minimalistic puzzle games. So good for relaxing
      with some music and just chilling out. qop is made by the same Dev as ZUP probably
      the most well known of these games. Unlike ZUP there is no timing or luck involved
      here. Just find the correct route and take your time. No reason to rush. I really
      like the inclusion of a Dark Mode as i do find heavy white backgrounds quite
      harsh on my eyes so that was appreciated.


      Like all of these games it comes with the usual load of nicely made achievements
      icons designed to be used in a profile showcase. A nice bonus for an already
      good game.


      I got it in a very good bundle deal for all 4 qop games with Shoot, Push, Portals
      and Shoot, Push, Repeat also from the same developer.


      I just completed the first qop and look forward to playing the others and seeing
      what else Quiet River Games release in the future.'
