    review: 'It was a short and fun little game.

      For the horror element, there are not really jumpscares (for me at least). But
      it does put you on edge. I jumped a bit when someone had touched my neck while
      playing.

      Gameplay is easy in the beginning but can quickly get harder. I needed to replay
      the thirth song a couple of times before i could complete it. Arcade song 2
      seems a bit impossible for me.

      The story is shown to you in bits and pieces before, during and after the song.
      It''s easy to figure out what happend after completing the fourth song. But
      it was a nice short little mystery.


      I''ll give this game a 7/10: it''s not the best game that exist, but i also
      don''t hate it. it''s a nice concept to mix horror with rhythm. You can certainly
      finish this game within an hour, but you can keep it on your desktop in case
      your in the mood again for some horror rhythm.'
