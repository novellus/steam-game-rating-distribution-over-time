Yes there is a BIG difference in the scenery. More complex Hills in a sense, I checked out the place I stay in and it seems much much more realistic but the problem is the texturing. The heights of hills and number of hills etc are realistic to about 50-80 %. But the textures for steep drop offs are so horrible. There are a few good textures here and there but good lord the textures of some areas are horrible. I'd recommend when it's on sale but on full price it's not recommended.","timestamp_created":1516103443,"timestamp_updated":1516103443,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523173987865447998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o9Sz/+ACd6SglgE="}
