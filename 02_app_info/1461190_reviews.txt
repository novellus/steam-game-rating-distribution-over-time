This is very disappointing, and I hope my review shows how much I wanted to like this game. But when it's often not possible to see both the ball off the flipper and the target at the same time, it's quite difficult to gauge shots. And gauging shots is critical in jetPIN, due to the time element involved. (An option to zoom in and out might help greatly.) The great probability to lose all progress in an instant makes this the most frustrating PC pinball I've yet played, and I say this as an original moderator of one of Steam's more popular pinball titles. (Somewhat the feeling of climbing a mountain in a bucket using only a hammer, if you know what I mean.)\n\nStill, with some changes I think this could be a LOT of fun. And I currently intend to keep it, if changes are made within the refund period.\n\n-------------------------------------------\nFriends, I think we’ve all played some pinball “gimmick” games. Some are fun…..for a bit. Some are well thought out but aren’t quite “there”. Some really aren’t pinball at all.\n\nAdmittedly, I’ve only been playing jetPIN for a few minutes, but I wish to relate my first impressions. \n\nFirst, yes, jetPIN is indeed pinball, and I confess I’m challenged from the first seconds. The goal is to send the ball up through what is basically a flooding gully while evading the rising waters and collecting points from bumpers and targets. I'm speaking as a decent pinball player with four #1 (strictly) pinball scores in ZP. Yet in three tries, I’ve still not completed the first level of jetPIN. Aiming is such a critical aspect, I question if this is a game that beginners will have success with. Just whacking the ball is definitely a losing strategy (if, indeed, a strategy at all.)\n\nPlaying more, I can see that much of my difficulty has been in playing in portrait mode. Because of the nature of jetPIN, portrait mode appears to actually show LESS of the table at any moment than does landscape. I'd suggest trying both to determine your preference.\n\nAn issue that will stop many pinballers in their tracks is the lack of option to rebind keys. In fact, there are really no options at all for gameplay. As well, the physics aspect is acceptable, but nothing special. (About what one might expect at this price, and w/o other options.) Considering the \"one size fits all\" feel of jetPIN, I suppose it's not unexpected for difficulty levels to lack inclusion. (Even something as simple as a larger ball and longer flippers for beginners, for example.) But unfortunately, there is no provision for the vast range of skills displayed by Steam pinball players.\n\nObviously, I’ve not learned strategy or nuance yet, and knowing the table(?) seems perhaps even more critical in this game than most, as only a quite small section of the map is shown at any one moment. And all it takes is one mistake, and you can lose every bit of your progress (and more, since the water is rising as you play. The starting point is underwater very early on in the game.)\n\njetPIN can be played with a controller or a keyboard. Also, in either landscape or portrait mode. Obviously, no one should “sit” right out and buy jetPIN on my recommendation alone (and I’m not yet sure exactly what my recommendation will ultimately be.) Still, if you have $5 to spend, and are interested in a new-ish and challenging pinball experience, I’ve paid more for less more than once.\n\nThank you.","timestamp_created":1606426534,"timestamp_updated":1606528554,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.608100712299346924","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwYqkhvYCf933sgI="}
