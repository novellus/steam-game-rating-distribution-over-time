    about_the_game: Redefining Strategy in RTS games.<br><br><strong>Foresight</strong>
      is an <strong>epic</strong> space-based RTS game that throws you, the player,
      into the thick of the battle as a commander. Lead huge fleets, armed with fighters
      and bombers across <i>wormholes</i> to fight it out with your enemy. Launch
      bombing missions, fighter patrols, plant observation posts or fire support base
      with reconnaissance units. Intelligence is key.<br><br>Recruit capable commanders
      as your fleet commanders; they'll not just obey your orders, they'll also talk
      to you, give you suggestions, raise requests and report on their progress. Fleets
      are semi-autonomous and therefore have their own command, which is separate
      from yours though they're under your command. This allows you to expand your
      forces beyond what you can control. They also progress alongside you, gaining
      experience and improving their abilities. As they get promoted in rank, so does
      your command; allow you to control more ships.<br><br>Foresight redefines the
      strategy component of RTS games by rewarding players for executing correct strategic
      decisions and not punishing players for a single mis-click or being less dexterous.
      Build order complexity is minimized to allow players to focus on what matters;
      building the right thing.<br><br>Need to arm a capital ship with fighters and
      bombers? No problem - simply make a request with that ship. Foresight's AI will
      automate the entire process - between picking the nearest shipyard with the
      lowest load and deployment to the designated ship.<br><br>So, what's your battle
      plan? Blitzkrieg? Flank attack? Even in space, such plans are possible because
      Foresight is built to deliver an reasonably accurate outcome. A large navy may

    review: "[b][quote]Check out our [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/31389798/]Steam\
      \ Curator Page[/url] and [url=https://bluntlyhonestreviews.com/]Website[/url]\
      \ for even more reviews and exclusive content![/quote][/b]\n\nForesight is a\
      \ traditional strategy game in the vein of Startrek Armada.\n\nGraphically its\
      \ a very indie affair, but the models are in no way distracting and the gameplay\
      \ mechanics more than make up for their shortcomings, the 2D artwork is hit\
      \ and miss, and at times the voice acting is atrocious.\n\nI enjoyed the narrative\
      \ well enough but must admit I didn\u2019t enjoy hopping between factions, just\
      \ as I got used to a faction I was forced to play another.\n\nIts a very strategic\
      \ game that allows for more strategic depth than many RTS games, and smaller\
      \ armies acting in a concise manner could easily beat a far larger force.\n\n\
      I must admit when I played the campaign, it was bug-ridden, and I faced many\
      \ unpassable bugs and crashes to the desktop, however, the developer has made\
      \ dozens of patches since then and is very open to feedback, so I assume they\
      \ are now fixed.\n\nThere never was much of a multiplayer community, and what\
      \ little there was is long gone.\n\nWorth a play for the singleplayer alone,\
      \ especially as its a $5 title.\n\nThis mini review is part of \"Top Ten RTS\
      \ Games Worth Playing in 2020\"\nhttps://bluntlyhonestreviews.com/2020/01/17/top-10-rts-in-2020/"
