    review: Really fun, kinda hard, but a lot of great concepts. Base-building, action
      combat, light and easy to use stealth, and lots of looting/survival aspects.
      Over all done well, I am only still in chapter one (kept restarting like an
      old-school RPG once I knew the game better), but VERY FUN!
