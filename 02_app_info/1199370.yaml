    review: In my view, people tend to be a little too hard on this game. Sure, it's
      not perfect. But when you look more deeply at the game, there's a lot here that
      is pretty cool. While the animations could use some work, the art style itself
      is quite nice and atmospheric. And I thought that the mysterious story worked
      well, too. It's interesting to see a game that leaves as much open to the player's
      interpretation as this. Lastly, the soundtrack, while generally subdued, creates
      a nice ambiance. All in all, I'd say to check this game out if you're interested.
      I got it for $9.99 on sale, and it was worth it.
