It's a chill game and I don't know of others like it. The stacking feels good and the theme is nice. There are gameplay settings and some alternative modes after the campaign too. I would definitely recommend this one.\n\nThe issue I had was performance. On my 1080ti (Index running at 80hz) I was reprojecting. There is one graphics setting, HD or SD, which does fix it but it would be nice to be able to tweak shadows or some other setting to get a steady framerate rather than lowering the resolution.","timestamp_created":1597888693,"timestamp_updated":1597888693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50715935230255127","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4sNDlhPQCetTFnAI="}
