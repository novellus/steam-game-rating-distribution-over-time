    review: 'Goes alright and has a lot of potential, but a few pointers:

      1. please actually put into english, was very disorientating for a non-chinese
      player

      2. add online play. Wasnt sure if i was playing online or not, felt like bots
      so I''m going to assume they were

      3. different maps and a revamp of the movement controls would add to the appeal
      of this game


      apart from that good job, please continue updating and it''ll definetly be worth
      the money!'
