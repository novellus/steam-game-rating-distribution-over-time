It introduces takeovers, which basically is invasion of player's planets. Takeovers can be executed through takeover cards which you have to get via the draw pile. Miltary count acts as offense and defense. A new 2-player scenario has been added which let you start with one takeover card. Takeovers are optional though, you can play without this mechanic. Note: R vs I requires Gathering Storm.\n\nPros:\n+ Military strategies are now competitive \n+ Take over planets from players\n+ New powerfull military cards >9 VP\n+ New synergies which are theme based (rebel and imperium cards)\n+ Green cards (gene worlds) are getting some love in terms of synergies (+Gene world goal)\n+ New goals\n+ New starting worlds and cards\n\nCons:\n- If you do not follow a military build then you will encounter a lot of useless cards. This DLC adds a significant amount of military cards to the game.\n- I feel that the AI doesn't make optimal use of the new DLC mechanics as opposed to Gathering Storm.","timestamp_created":1606758910,"timestamp_updated":1606762459,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4962gjfYCfdj7tQI="}
