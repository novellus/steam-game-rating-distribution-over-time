    review: 'I want to like this, but its just so frustrating. No decent explanation
      of why things are happening. The opposing team seems to be able to to do things
      you can''t and there is no explanation for why. You hit a wall and just lose
      repeatedly with no feeling of "well maybe I did something wrong". Its a losing
      simulation. You play, you lose.

      This is just a very poorly made game. I want to believe there is a way to progress
      but the game is so opaque and bland that I just can''t be bothered. FYI, I tend
      to play very hard core games on the highest difficulties. Those games are interesting
      and there is SOME method of discerning why I lose. This provides none of that.
      Its just horrible.'
