The game is basic but enjoyable. The fights seem a little difficult right now, but hopefully will get easier with practice. The only flaw thus far is the use of Shift Tab to go back which doesn't work as it is a Steam function. It is not a game breaker as pressing Shift will get you back, eventually, to where you need to be.\nFor the price you should get a decent value for money.\nAn enjoyable basic RPG lite game, audio is okay, don't expect AAA and you won't be disappointed.","timestamp_created":1584738253,"timestamp_updated":1584738253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.610533654689788818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1584872016,"developer_response":"Hi Nokando!\nThanks for your honest review and feedback!\nWe'll fix that \"shift + tab\" problem in the next update ;)\nBest"}],"cursor":"AoJ4jNfw/PACdb3J+QE="}
