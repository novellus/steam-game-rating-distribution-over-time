    review: 'I''m sure this is an enjoyable little puzzler, especially for the price.
      It has a programming theme, similar to SpaceChem.


      But the forced tutorials! Where you can do nothing but click where the game
      tells you to click! Hate that! They ruin the discoverability; you feel the game
      treats you like you are unable to explore, to try, to learn, to experiment (bad
      game design in my opinion). Between that, and the lack of achievements I don''t
      feel like playing this game anymore.
