I have to say this game is very good and heading in the right direction. I knew this after 5 minutes of playing and truck got stuck in the mud and wouldn't move....I have been waiting for the longest time for sim games to get this right....make it hard and difficult and risky to just drive off anywhere. Winches now have a purpose and so many other game could learn from this. \n\nChallenging equals not only fun and a sense of accomplishment, but as well longevity. I am truly hoping for continued support and development of this game. \n\nThe devs are very quick to respond as well and very supportive. \n\nIf you like actual simulation more than just the word this is the game for you!","timestamp_created":1609431922,"timestamp_updated":1609431922,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw1cbn3PYCfcuSvwI="}
