After playing one of my favourite games, The Cat Lady, I had to try Downfall out. I was not disappointed. \n\n A good old point & click game, with gore and psychological horror to it. I loved seeing references to The Cat Lady, as Joe himself, the protagonist of Downfall, is one of the parasites Susan deals with in The Cat Lady. It was very interesting to see his own story and problems in the crazy world these characters live in. What started as a relationship problem quickly develops into horror and choices; to get the one he loves back, Ivy, he must kill the 4 Sophies, but it's not that simple. Sacrifices will have to be made. And, in the end, it doesn't always pay off. \n\n(Spoilers) The game does a good job in deceiving you; I didn't realise Agnes was who she was, a most likely form of expression of the good sides of Ivy that Joe (and I) didn't realise until the very end, as can be seen when she walks through the hallway full of mirrors, in which her reflection is Ivy. But that is just another great aspect of the game. Mystery and uncertainty, millions of problems to solve, and morals. Morality does affect Harvester Games creations a lot. But I myself find it very enjoyable. \n\n(Spoilers) What I didn't see was the most obvious point of the story. The game shows you several corrupted creatures and beings, but the utmost parasite being Joe himself. You get so involved in the role of being Ivy's saviour that you don't realise, in reality, you've become just like everyone else: a monster. I think that's because of the ending I got, but, in the end, Joe is the psychopath (that I've failed to recognise). \n\nI was very excited to see Susan and Mitzi at the end. This game will most likely affect you emotionally, with great story telling and deep involvement with characters. It did make me quite emotional, and I can't wait to play the next Harvester Games.","timestamp_created":1609715564,"timestamp_updated":1609715564,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3seh5fYCcIKdwAI="}
