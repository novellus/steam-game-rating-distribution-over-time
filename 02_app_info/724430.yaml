    review: It is worth the sale price of 49c U.S.  The beginning is confusing at
      first and the second level of single player is the same as the first with solid
      walls.  The grenade firework-lights are fricking annoying!  The developer's
      other games are better from what i have read and played.  2001 achievements
      - took me 86 minutes.  The achievements are worth 0 each on astats.
