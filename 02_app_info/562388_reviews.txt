Really fun to drive, very manual procedure to hold your speed.  You need to let the circuit click up to the desired amperage, then switch to drive to hold, and when you approach your desired driving speed you need to reduce the amperage and then hold again.  Dynamic brake going downhill is pretty straightforward.  The cab looks really good, nice patina on all the controls, passenger view is pretty basic, but who looks a that while you are VERY busy driving the thing.  Highly recommended for fans of classic Teutonic electric EMUs.","timestamp_created":1563041176,"timestamp_updated":1563041176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559748470783233643","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnPOg9usCfaGlzgE="}
