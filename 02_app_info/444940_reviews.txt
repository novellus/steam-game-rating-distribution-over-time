Once you have the best gun it's a clap every few seconds. That's the hardest part about overmosh black vs the original. Once you have the best gun you're golden, but for the first 20 sec or so the enemies that drop them don't spawn in, so it's just a matter of not losing all your lives within the first 20sec so you have a chance at the rest. Still fun, like the first, but I prefer the first. It's simpler and isn't a rush to get a certain gun.","timestamp_created":1609717727,"timestamp_updated":1609717727,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48eep5fYCd4WewAI="}
