      with the mouse: aim, fire with the left button, thrust with the right button
      and <strong>hold your fire to repair</strong>. Thats it.<br><br>You can also
      use a more familiar twin-stick control scheme with your Gamepad OR Mouse + WASD.<h2

      enemy to pieces your ship will transform and upgrade automatically. There are
      four upgrade stages, each with its own unique weapon. Upgrades can level up

    review: 'Its worth a couple of hours of entertainment if you are into dog fighting.
      That''s is all there is to it.

      flying into makes it tedious fast.'
