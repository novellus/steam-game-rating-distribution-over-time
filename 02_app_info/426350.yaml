    review: "I'll start by saying that I am a big fan of Jason Statham. I really liked\
      \ his performance in The Transporter. Took notice of him from then on, from\
      \ films such as Cellular, The Bank Job, and then there's this film, Crank. I\
      \ saw it in theaters and have the DVD, but gave it a rental viewing here for\
      \ convenience sake (and to try out watching movies with Steam...bizarre to think\
      \ that a game app outlet has come this far, that they are offering films for\
      \ purchase now). When I did grab it, it was only available for rental. Now I\
      \ see there's an offer to buy. Anyway I'm getting off-track here.\n\nTo summarize,\
      \ Crank is an adrenaline-pumping, action-packed, crazy and comedic film. It's\
      \ over the top silly, with Statham running around town like a madman, causing\
      \ havoc and killing plenty of men to stay alive. At the beginning of the film,\
      \ we see him get injected with some kind of poison. The poison is meant to slow\
      \ down his heart until it gives out and he dies. To counter this, Statham's\
      \ character, Chev Chelios, has to keep his adrenaline pumping. In doing that,\
      \ he can prolong the effects of the drug that was given to him and he does so\
      \ with one goal in mind: To kill the men who backstabbed him. \n\nIt's hysterical,\
      \ to see this actor who is typcasted into usual tough-guy agent-like roles,\
      \ usually silent and bad-ass, to this more wild and curse-happy individual,\
      \ screaming at the top of his lungs and be percieved as psychotic. Even better,\
      \ it's done well! It's a little gore-y and very over-the-top, the idea is rather\
      \ silly to begin with so it's not for everyone, but I'm recommending it. High\
      \ entertainment value, no holds-barred action flick. It's got cliches thrown\
      \ in like a car chase, but the focal point of the movie is always in the lead,\
      \ never losing focus. It's actually brilliant how many ways the writers thought\
      \ up how to keep the flow of adrenaline running in someomen. Don't try this\
      \ at home, though, plenty of feats on here would kill. \n\nIf you're looking\
      \ for a good popcorn flick (that's rated R), look no further!"
