    review: '... have actually played almost an hour - not sure why it doesn''t register
      correctly.  For 5 bucks it''s a fine game.  You shoot waves of blocks of red
      and blue with a blue 1911 in the left hand and a red 1911 in the right. Even
      on "easy" some of the waves become overwhelming, nevertheless it''s enjoyable
      and repeatable.  Don''t expect any more than what the vid shows - this is not
      Beat Saber after all.


      The graphics are blurry unfortunately.  I''m running a 2080 ti with a Rift S
      on a very good gaming system but it still looks quite blurry.  I wasn''t expecting
      4k or anything but hopefully the dev corrects this.


      As of yet you cannot add your own music but the music presented is enjoyable.


      For me, the 5 bucks was worth it!'
