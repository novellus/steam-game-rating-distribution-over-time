    review: 'This is, by far, my favorite expansion to Stellaris. It diversifies interaction
      with other stellar powers so substantially that diplomacy feels like an entirely
      different playstyle.


      This only becomes more obvious when diplomacy is neglected (say, by playing
      as Fanatical Purifiers). Whereas genociding all of the filthy xenos is cool,
      what''s even cooler is seeing the fruits of your strategy culminate in political
      supremacy--whether it be through having effectively dominated the galaxy by
      overpowering diplomatic weight, or by federating the majority of the galaxy.
      And the types of federations too! Truly tremendous are the changes made to Stellaris
      with this expansion, and it is easily a 10/10 addition.'
