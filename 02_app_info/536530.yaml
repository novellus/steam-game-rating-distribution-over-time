    review: 'This will be a vague, scratchy review. I had played through this many
      months ago, and beat the episode, but it has been some time since then, and
      when I made the video, the game seemed slightly updated, but it glitched, and
      I could not complete it or show you the cool scene. That''s more or less is
      the gist of my review. This game is a decent experience, maybe even a bit spooky,
      but the choreography is bad, and the game is a big buggy, so you might get frustrated
      and lose the vibe, or worse: have to restart it because something screwed up
      and you lost the key through the floor. The puzzle-age isn''t that great either.
      It''s basically pixel hunting. Look inside the vase in the office scene, and
      behind the blank prior to that in the shed scene. [i]It equally sucks to have
      to quit the game to find the spoilers because they hide stuff to make you use
      up your 2 hour refund window.[/i] The item you need is prolly in the corner,
      which isn''t really a puzzle. Well worth the price, for sure. A gem if on sale
      or in a bundle. [spoiler]Overall, it compares well to Trespass Episode 1, which
      is another similar and buggy experience, but here, you are not being ripped
      off. There is no lady in this VR game though, just these giant eyeballs.[/spoiler]
