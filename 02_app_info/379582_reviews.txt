Straight up stick and rudder. No A/P but easily trimmed to maintain stable flight in good weather. There’s not much to this plane, and it’s very simple. That makes for for nice VFR flying, especially sightseeing. Great plane, and such a classic.","timestamp_created":1570305526,"timestamp_updated":1570305526,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj5ngzu0CcJHL0wE="}
