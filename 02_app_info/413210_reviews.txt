Now, I'm trying to speak objectively here, as you probably already know whether the subject might interest you enough to sit through an hour-and-fifteen-minute long documentary about it. On an objective level, this is a solidly-crafted documentary film, even if it doesn't quite reach the heights of Some Kind of Monster or Indie Game: The Movie. Think an extremely well-made TV documentary and you're getting warmer.\n\n   So how does it handle the subject matter? Um, I would say frankly, but not indelicately, and most certainly not sensationally. Suffice it to say, if you're even remotely vanilla in your sexual outlook (like Yours Truly), you're gonna find aspects of this kinda creepy. That said, the video doesn't go out of its way to make its subjects [i]seem[/i] creepy. That bit's up to you. Like I say: objectively-speaking, it holds up pretty well. \n\n   Take \"Davecat\", for example: the guy is clearly very intelligent, and seems fairly self-aware about having one or more screws loose upstairs. But the doco doesn't underscore his interview footage with eerie music, or cut away to a psychoanalyst telling us how much of a fruitcake Dave is. The subject speaks for himself, and it's up to the viewer to draw their own conclusions. (That said, the fact that he \"plays\" video games with his doll gf, and she sometimes manages to [i]beat[/i] him in said games, is clearly cause for concern by anyone's standards.)\n\n   If this still sounds like an \"interesting\" video to you, then it's fair to say it probably will be. Me, I've always been fascinated by the weirder side of things, and this clearly qualifies. The price is also perfectly reasonable, and all the more so on sale. The rest, as always, is up to you.\n\n  Verdict: 8.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1530704425,"timestamp_updated":1597313953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.628697752952575684","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zpXV8/MCe/uTpQE="}
