It is kind of like a weird mixture of Silent Hill and Witch's House (plays like RPG-maker but it has 2 worlds). This game has some serious technical issues and very cryptic puzzles. You definitely have to enjoy a campy experience to tolerate its flaws. Nevertheless, Your Star is a relatively unique for a horror adventure. I have played a crap load of RPG-Maker horror, but this game is weirder than all of them. Now there is a free version of this game on the internet, which is actually available from the developer. However, the Steam version has more polish,new puzzles and improved effects. If you having second thoughts, you can always use the free version as a \"demo\", to see if you want to buy the Steam alternative. Unlike most of the games in this genre, Your Star is completely hand drawn, which is always better than assets if you ask me.\n\nThe gameplay includes combat, resource management, and lots of puzzles. I had to use pencil and paper for some of the riddles that require math, so don't expect it to be straight forward. About 60% of the game is logical and the other 40% is convoluted, to say the least. There is a neat alternate world mechanic where things are different (sort of like Silent Hill or Fran Bow). You will also find different kinds of power-ups, some of which hidden in secrets and side-quest. When you kill enough enemies you will even level up your attributes and get items. Perhaps my favorite thing about Your Star is a psychological aspect of the game design. Your character has 3 resources which are mind, light, and will (basically health, ammo and armor aura). I think Mind is the one that drains overtime as in your character is going insane (even if you just stay still). The game sort of implies that crazy events have the effect on the character and it also impacts gameplay. Your Star has a very unsettling atmosphere, as a horror game should. I experienced loneliness and sadness playing this game, with some relief toward the end. It is very easy to get lost in the mood.\n\nYour star has a mature story that was well paced and explained toward the end . There are side quests, secrets, and even several endings. I am a little skeptical that someone would make the effort to beat this game several times, just because it is so hard. It took me 8 hours to beat the game without a guide, but do to glitches it was closer to 14 . So with several endings, I would say game has about 15 to 20 hours worth of content .\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ a lot of content (8 hours+multiple endings and NG+)\n+ alternate world mechanic (Silent Hill style)\n+ very campy and spooky narrative\n+ hand drawn environment \n+ many challenging puzzles\n+ a lot of different gameplay mechanic\n+ psychological events have impact on the character\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\n- very glitchy\n- some music does not complement the game\n- can be very hard due to cryptic logic\n\n[b] Final Thoughts 7/10 [/b]\n\nYour Star is not for everyone. It is very unique horror game, but you have to forgive its many problems. I personally value creativity more than just a generic game with good quality. Playing this game is almost a masochistic experience, a few can truly appreciate it, or have the patience to get through it. You can always try the free version instead (Steam version is better though).\n\n\n[code]For more hidden gems: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/ [/code]","timestamp_created":1491449499,"timestamp_updated":1525924563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.599268138408660889","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g6GMpOMCfKeTdg=="}
