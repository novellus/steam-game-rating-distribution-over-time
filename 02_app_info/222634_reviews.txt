This one of the more highly detailed DLCs in the game and thats because it was made by DTM. There is a lot details and sounds with this DLC. \n\nPros:\nOperable windows, doors and mirrors\nFunctioning lighting inside the cab.\nFunctioning step lights and numberboard lights.\nThe horn sounds great, very realistic.\n2  different units.\nAccurate and good bell sounds\nVery realistic engine sounds\nWhen you release or apply the brakes, the brakes acctually move when you look outside\n\nCons:\nPrice, you only 2 models, there is no rolling stock\nHorn cuts out a lit bit.\nHeadlights are ok (It should have the same headlight effect as the UP SD60M, F59PH, F59PHI, P42DC, Dash 8-BWH where you can see the headlight from a far distance) \n\nOverral Opinion:\nNot worth its price so only by when there is a sale but I can definately recommend it because of how detailed it is and because its from DTM which means it will be really good.\nScore 9/10\n","timestamp_created":1528589673,"timestamp_updated":1528589673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ouzC8+MCer3IogE="}
