      \ However, without magic, a fantasy game is little more than a toothless lion\

    review: 'Sadly the game is really bad. Very low quality Tower Defense, good intentions
      but poor execution. It is just not fun to play. Art is alright, but graphics,
      music, gameplay... everything is simply terrible. Sorry for the devs.
