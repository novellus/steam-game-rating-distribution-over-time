I have hard times calling this a game, but whatever. Flaws in it are multifold, lets just go down a list.\nFirst, there is no handling of physical evidence. Everything is done by dialogues.\nSecond, there is no hint of action. Be it chase, escape from locked room or trap, fight with perpetrator... These are part of Holmes universe! Yes, I know, the whole budget was consumed by shooting FMV sequences with live actors, I have no problem with that. But that leads to most catastrophic flaw: The goal of this game, inasmuch there is one, is to solve the crime with least possible amount of actual investigating! If you go around and interrogate people in your directory, you are presented with extremely condescending end, calling you \"armchair detective\". Which is EXACT OPPOSITE of what it should mean!\nA.C.Doyle created Sherlock Holmes as tireless investigator, going around days and weeks, investigating, interrogatin and staking out suspects and witnesses, and closing cases with severe sleep deficiency and physical exhaustion. Here, the \"correct\" end is closing case without any work done!  Speedrun of this game would take literary seconds! I believe the game can be finished with maybe dozen mouseclicks (did not try). \nI am sucker for all things Sherlock and this has NOTHING to do with this character. I am going back to games from Frogware.","timestamp_created":1594571284,"timestamp_updated":1594571284,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559245049953460693","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4tv2ofMCc93rlAI="}
