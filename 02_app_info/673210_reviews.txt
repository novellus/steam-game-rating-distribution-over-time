It's challenging to figure out how much distance you can get out of your batteries, figuring out the best trade routes, and even landing (I haven't even attempted trying to land on runways because I'm fairly confident I'll crash and burn, so I just land in vtol). You almost have to be... strategic about everything, which is nice.\n\nThere aren't many downsides so far... However, they need to figure out how to fully balance the burn rate for batteries/engines. One of my quests in the beginning was to go buy a ship on an island 70 km away, and my scarab, even with upgraded batteries, wasn't able to make that distance (I even played around with thrust strength to make it last longer). Again, it'll all come down to balance and other key factors.\n\nAll in all, a really awesome early access and I'm looking forward to more updates.","timestamp_created":1609565374,"timestamp_updated":1609565374,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw49Dk4PYCdpPQvwI="}
