One more character with 3 more stages. Its like Deathsmiles in space to me. Seems as tho Taito / Degica is out for a money grab at first sight, but its actually a pretty decent DLC, the $5 isn't really too bad, if you must though, just wait for it to come on sale. Generally speaking DARIUSBURST CS is quite expensive for a shmup, but has tons of content. Sadly there are no continues, so as a casual gamer whos merely average with shmups, i may actually never get to the end on this one, so sad really.... \n\nPS. anyone considering an DLC on D:CS, each pack gives you a unique ship with its own strengths and weaknesses and also you can choose any installed DLC stages or D:CS stage, you can really mix things up! very unique concept to me...","timestamp_created":1483334405,"timestamp_updated":1483334405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.665503382682800293","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uNnnrtkCcqStbg=="}
