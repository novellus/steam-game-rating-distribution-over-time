    review: The game was beautiful and the music makes it very atmospheric however,
      the actual game controls were very frustrating. I'm not a god of platformers
      by any means, but the platforming distance shifted with jumps so the character
      herself was one of the most difficult to control I've ever played with. In terms
      of concept, I think the game is awesome and I would recommend it on that basis,
      but in terms of controls - it leaves something to be desired.
