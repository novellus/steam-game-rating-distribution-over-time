    review: 'Too many bugs when using the undo button, such as some tiles becoming
      inaccessible, and sometimes it seems to undo a few moves at once at once (I''m
      not certain of this, but I sometimes notice that a few of my knights have somehow
      moved backwards on their own, which I assume was caused by me while undoing
      a different move), and when you move a piece onto a tile with a button and then
      undo the move, the effect of the button is reversed but the piece remains on
      the button. This game only allows you to undo one move per turn, so you can
      imagine how frustrating it can be when the undo button is as wonky as it is.
      This isn''t a problem for most levels, as this is a relatively easy puzzle game,
      but there is one particular level near the end that is significantly more complicated
      than the rest which I''ve been trying hard to solve, but the wonkiness of the
      undo button keeps forcing me to restart the whole level, which eventually led
      to me giving up on it.


      EDIT: Just want to add that I gave that level another go, and managed to beat
      it and the rest of the game afterwards! However, I stand by my negative review
      of the game as I didn''t enjoy this game as much as I did the other chess puzzles
      by the same developer, not just because of the bugs, but also because I feel
      the rules for this game aren''t as well-defined. I had to trial-and-error my
      way to see how things and work, and the buggy undo button just added unnecessary
      frustration.'
