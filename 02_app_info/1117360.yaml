    review: You have to like word games and have good English vocabulary to get the
      most out of a game like Word Forward. The interface is simple and reasonably
      well done, but dragging diagonally between the squares on the board can sometimes
      take more than one attempt. If I could wish for one thing it would be Steam
      achievements, because without it, the game can become quite monotonous.
