Overall, my feelings are mixed but this comes with the caveat that the game is not finished and things will likely change in future updates. As such, please take my criticisms with a grain of salt.   \n\n\n\n[h1]STORY[/h1]\nThe story is told in a rather disjointed manner. You fight through 5-6 stages as a particular character in order to complete their respective campaign, unlock the next one, and learn a bit about the world in the process. Here is what I gleamed from all of them:\n[list]\n[*]There are two rival factions- the Crimson Force and Azure Shield. Both seem to have fairly nebulous goals as you only get a few text boxes’ worth of info at the beginning and end of every stage. \n[*]The world is full of Noises- dangerous creatures made from data that attack the people of this world.\n[*]The Azure Shield are suspected of creating Noises and have successfully tamed some Noises for use in battle. However, they also seem to be able to \"provide infinite food and water to everyone,\" or at least they claim to. \n[*]The Crimson Force seem to be the ones actively protecting normal people from both the Shields and Noises.[/list]\n\nOverall, this is all interesting. Nonetheless, the lack of coherent storytelling definitely hurts the  impact of the story. To date, there are only 4 campaigns available with another in the works. You do get some sense of what each character is about while playing as them and there is some humorous banter present. However, no one really stood out to me as being super interesting. Likewise, there are some weird phrasings in some text boxes that made me have to reread things. As a dedicated \"story\" mode, I would've like things to be a bit more concrete. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2334179611\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\nThis game focuses on combat which is all grid-based. Your character can move freely in their colored area (blue by default) and walk across neutral tiles (grey). You get access to three sets of 4 VOCS which are your spells/ attacks (for a total of 12 available VOCS). Casting a VOC makes it go on cooldown and each VOC has an individual timer. You can freely cycle between each set of VOCS in battle. There are 4 types of VOCS and each serves a different purpose in battle.\n[list]\n[*]Strike- for damage and Crushing\n[*]Protect- heals and shield/ protection\n[*]Effect- status effects/ changes\n[*]Control- affects the field and panels[/list]\nSuccessfully connecting with an offensive VOC causes the enemies’ Crush gauge to fill. Upon filling, the character is stunned and the opponents’ VOCS’ cooldowns are immediately reset. Thus, keeping pressure is highly incentivized to disadvantage your opponent. Nonetheless, you are also able to get Crushed by your enemies. Your Crush gauge slowly depletes over time, so learning how to skillfully dodge attacks is tantamount to surviving after a bad move. There are more nuances to the Crush gauge, but this is the gist of things.  \n\nAdditionally, there are 5 elemental types; each has its own strengths and weakness to the others. There are also various status effects that can be utilized to get the upper hand. That being said, only a handful are explicitly explained by the in-game tutorial. The rest are fairly nebulous in their effects (e.g. what does “meek” do?). Likewise, upgrade prefixes aren't explained anywhere; what do \"cyber\" and \"tough\" do? Each VOC has a level; you can only equip a VOC of a certain level in a certain slot. These upgrades usually add 0 or 1 to the VOCS' level so you may have 2 VOCS competing for the same slot.\n\nMoving onto how actual gameplay feels, movement is rather stiff. This is likely intentional to avoid dodge spamming, but enemy projectiles and movements are rather quick and some VOCS anchor you in place as you cast and/or have a charge up animation. Although enemies have rather obvious patterns, getting into position and then actually hitting them is rather annoying. This is compounded by the fact that there is no way to check your VOCS’ effects in the field which made me very frustrated on several occasions due to not remembering what a VOC did. Likewise, once you fight 2 or even 3 enemies at once, things get very spammy.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2334171863 \n\nThe second solo mode is Adventure mode which is a rogue-like survival mode where you keep exploring and fighting until you die. I enjoyed this mode a lot but there are some issues. First, you cannot skip boss intro cutscenes. It gets to be a bit annoying having to wait 5 seconds every time before a fight. Additionally, bosses feel a bit overtuned in terms of difficulty. Since your drops and the map are all randomized, I often went into a boss fight undergeared and lost since I didn't find anything I wanted from the rewards list or, more importantly, I didn't find anything to counter the boss' gimmick (e.g. Annoyed Bombarabara's lava field). \n\nThat being said, there are definitely things I really like in the game. For example, there is a pretty wide cast of playable characters. Each has their own stats, Adventure mode deck and unique look. I also really like the VOCS currently available. Although some are pretty basic, there are some really fun ones such as \"Jumperjet\" which spawns a controllable aircraft to charge into your enemies with.  There's even mod support now! All in all, I honestly think it’s mostly the roughness of the game that is rubbing me the wrong way as I still feel compelled to keep playing.\n\nThere is a multiplayer Battle mode for both online and offline. However, I had no one to play with offline. Likewise, online was dead whenever I checked. It would appear that all matchmaking is handled on the dedicated Discord channel due to the small player base. Thus, even causal online matches need to be scheduled properly. \n\n\n\n[h1]VISUALS[/h1]\nThe game has pixel graphics and I feel that everything is well-done. The character sprites have a lot of character to them and reflect their full-art forms well. They all also have a nice amount of movement of them to compliment their character. Backgrounds are a bit basic, but there is an appreciable amount of detail included upon closer inspection. VOC art is nice and readable at a glance. Their in-battle effects are even better. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2334187488\n\n\n[h1]AUDIO[/h1]\nOverall, I liked the soundtrack for the game. The synthetic notes work well for this type of game. Sound effects were great as well and combat felt more gratifying because of it. Granted, I spent most of my time focusing on the gameplay. \n\n\n\n[h1]PERFORMANCE[/h1]\nThe game worked perfectly well for me. There are some graphical options, but the game is far from graphically intensive to necessitate more. However, there are some welcome accessibility options available such as disabling screen shake and flickering and colorblind mode for those who need it. \n\n\n\n[h1]OVERALL[/h1]\nAs it stands, EndCycle VS is a game I feel has great potential. However, I definitely felt a bit frustrated during my playtime despite wanting to continue. While I have my issues with it, make no mistake: this is a fun game. As an Early Access title, I definitely feel that this is good enough to warrant a purchase depending on your tastes. \n\nIf you enjoy tactical and highly customizable grid-based combat, give it a whirl. The devs also seem active in updating the game and listening to the community with is a very big plus as well. Consider supporting their endeavor with this game. I definitely eagerly await future updates as I continue to play this on my own time. \n\n\n\n[h1][b]7.5/10\nWORTH A LOOK[/b][/h1]\n\n\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/7871885/]Follow our curator page,[b] OCG-Curations[/b], if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.[/url][/quote]","timestamp_created":1608918546,"timestamp_updated":1608919168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.719967126846313477","comment_count":12,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1608935134,"developer_response":"Hi MaverickZealot!\n\nThank you so so much for your thorough review. We really appreciate every single bit of feedback you had for us.\n\nStory: This is definitely very valuable for us. Your analysis and look at the story gave us a lot to think about and we might rework a few lines and expand on how we portray it. It's hard to achieve a good mix of story and gameplay content with the way our campaign mode works, that's why we have been focusing on the Adventure Mode more lately!\n\nGameplay: The movement feeling stiff is definitely an issue we have been working on for hours and hours to improve on. It is so so hard to achieve the right feeling, and we have some plans on making it feel more tight! Thank you for your observations. We'll also be working on adjusting battle speed in bigger battles. This area is where fan feedback is appreciated enormously! After all, balancing the game is extremely hard as a dev that has played the game for thousands of hours.\nWe'll also be adding more QoL to Adventure Mode with further patches, such as better boss balancing, being able to skip dialogues and skippable boss intros. \nAdditionally, we hope that when we reach more active players the online PvP will also light up a bit more!\n\nTo cap our response off, we want to wish you happy holidays! Thank you again for your review and we hope you'll follow the game's further development! :)\n- Gal & Daniel (12B3 Games)"}],"cursor":"AoJwwMbDzfYCe5aPvQI="}
