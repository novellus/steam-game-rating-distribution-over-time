    review: 'The first Act is a bit boring but sets the mood of the era appropriately
      and frequently demonstrates good ways of thinking about tense circumstances
      a young lady might find herself in, the second act pumps up the sympathy for
      whichever girl''s story you choose. Lavinia''s redemption was interesting.

      The gameplay itself is token, and probably only exists because the creator didn''t
      want to write "and then she had tea all week before anything else interesting
      happened," so call it a mood thing.'
