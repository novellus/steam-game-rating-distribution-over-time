      \ Garrett is the best that ever was. Able to sneak past any guard, pick any\

      \ from the wealthy and gives to himself, making his living in the dark and foreboding\
      \ City. Here crime and corruption are commonplace, wealthy nobles prey on the\
      \ poor and each other, and magic and machinery coexist uneasily. World weary\
      \ and cynical, Garrett wants nothing more than to be left alone to ply his trade.\
