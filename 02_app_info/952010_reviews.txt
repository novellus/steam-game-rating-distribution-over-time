It's a science fiction story about a heist, with drama and romance elements. The included characters are diverse with regards to genders, sexual orientation and ethnicity, and you are free to choose your own gender and sexual orientation for the romance elements of the story. I really appreciate that, but I have seen that it has caused a lot of bad reviews. So if you prefer games that are only for white males with mainly white male characters (and some sexy females for the guys to ogle), you might not like this game.","timestamp_created":1597928604,"timestamp_updated":1597928984,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3Kn/hfQCepTQnAI="}
