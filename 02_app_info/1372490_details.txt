So at layer 3, with 1 premium upgrade bought it would be 2^3^1 = x8.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPremium gold gain and soft-prestige: 2 ^ multipliers bought with real money. So with 1 upgrade bought it would be 2^1 = x2. This multiplier is added before exponential floor scaling is applied. Keep in mind that the soft-prestige multiplier is applied to points gained, not (directly) to stats gained, as they increase in price.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn short, the upgrade increases in effect during your playthrough.
