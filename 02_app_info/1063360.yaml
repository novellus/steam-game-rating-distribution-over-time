    review: "I have mixed feelings about Necronomistore. Technically, it's a mediocre\
      \ game that can be finished in 15 minutes, but at the same time it's a nice\
      \ short art project that looks like a prologue to a bunch of upcoming releases\
      \ from Oddfellows Software that are expected to be launched on Steam next year\
      \ (and I hope that they will be much stronger than this one).\n\nNecronomistore's\
      \ gameplay mechanics is even too simple: working as a cashier, player have to\
      \ sort the objects appearing on the screen by two categories: good (\"goes to\
      \ the bag\") and bad (\"goes to the bin\"). The process of sorting consists\
      \ in exposing the objects to the sorting monitor which shows their mentioned\
      \ quality (you have to drag the objects to the specific spot on the screen).\
      \ Every successful act of sorting brings points to the player, and to proceed\
      \ to the next level they have to surpass the specific number of points under\
      \ pressure of time. And that's all, like in some kind of Flash game from the\
      \ mid-2000's.\n\nFrankly, there is not enough of content in Necronomistore to\
      \ cost $1.39 - it got only four levels with repetitive gameplay that are fused\
      \ together by unclear plotline (that fells like a first chapter of a bigger\
      \ story). On the other hand, if you like chaotic expressionistic art-style from\
      \ the screenshots, you won't be disappointed if you'll buy the game on a Steam\
      \ sale - clunky but stylish visual design is the main attraction of the project\
      \ (together with the atmosphere of surreal randomness - alas, the game is too\
      \ short to fully reveal the potential of it). \n\nVerdict: if you're looking\
      \ for a \"good game\", I can't recommend it, but as a test project before something\
      \ bigger Necronomistore looks great. If you're searching for weird Steam releases\
      \ with casual gameplay, that's the one you may like - at least for its wacky\
      \ yet stylish visual design."
