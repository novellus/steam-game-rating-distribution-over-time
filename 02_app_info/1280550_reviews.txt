I've had so few tower defense games where my immediate reaction is to uninstall it and request a refund. If it was marked as an early access game, it'd be fair enough and I'd wait for more polish, but it's not.\n\nThe user interface is so underdeveloped it makes playing this game a chore. It lacks basic functionality.\n\nTo be fair, it's a recent release so I plan to keep it and give the developer the chance to put more work into it and turn it into a good game. I'll change this review in the future if the game improves.\n\n6 months later: It's still bad. It's safe to assume the developer has abandoned this turd.","timestamp_created":1587796243,"timestamp_updated":1604986003,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.745667219161987305","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ449un2PUCeoaogwI="}
