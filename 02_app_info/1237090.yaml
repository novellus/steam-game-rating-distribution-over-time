    review: 'Bought this game for a YT channel.


      Overall, this game is really good for $1. It''s super simple, which i feel helps
      and hurts it. It''s great in the way that it doesn''t try to hide what it is,
      a simple defense game where you kill sharks with varying difficulty. But it
      looses points for having no menu (that i could find) and some things like the
      sharks being able to go through solid objects. Overall, I can recommend this
      game for what it is and what it costs. It definitely had fun playing it, which
      all that matters in the end.


      You can check out the video on YT at Foolsgold'
