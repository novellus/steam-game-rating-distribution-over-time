    review: 'Very very simple. Has a wonderful artstyle and a cute, innocent sort
      of attitude like a gameboy RPG. I do find myself wishing it was a little more
      in-depth, and that there was more you could do with *your* character in specific
      besides just adding him to the small population of meandering townsfolk. Ultimately,
      the NPCs come across as little more than set pieces with a few lines, and the
      game itself feels more like a browser idler game than the cardio-fueled Stardew
      Valley I was (admittedly unrealistically) kinda'' hoping for.


      Still adds a fun component to my daily runs, it synced quickly and nicely to
      the free Strava phone app, and it has a solid sense of progression that promises
      I''ll have to do a *lot* of exercising before I can consider myself having ''beat''
      it. I really do appreciate it.'
