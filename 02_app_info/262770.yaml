    short_description: Freedom Fall is a diabolical down-scrolling platformer set
      in a prison tower so tall it touches the clouds. Presented with hand painted
      art, its old school vibe mixes with fast-paced free falling action and a story
      with both dark wit and heart.

    review: soooo amazed by the quality and how enjoyable this game ended up to be!
      wasn't expecting too much coming in but it was a BLAST from start to finish!
      thank you again for creating such excellent platformer to all of us to play
      through and through ;) wouldn't mind seeing a sequel of this game in the near
      future..!
