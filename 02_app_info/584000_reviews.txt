It’s difficult to explain how a sequel can be so divisive of quality while also standing up alongside the original on its own merits. It’s largely within the smallest of details that show the greatest deviations between these two seasons, and if I had to choose which season was better I would say the original; if I had to choose which season had more memorable episodes, I would definitely select season 2. Whether or not you find one season of higher quality does not diminish each season’s merits, and that is why 2nd Gig is perhaps only second to the greatness of the original.\n\n[h1]This Wasn’t from 2017…?[/h1]\n\nHowever, of all the differences between each season, it’s perhaps the show’s relevance to the present that makes 2nd Gig more controversial to present times, especially within the past year. As an English major, I am always wary of imposing current events onto works with no relevance other than the subject matter itself, yet its similarities border on the surreal if you try to separate the small differences between fantasy and reality.\n\nThe set-up of the season is a large-scale postwar refugee crisis in Japan.  Asian refugees are being taken in at such a large rate that the government abides by its immigration crisis of economic instability as a moral duty while taxing taxpayers to fund these initiatives. The result of this larger issue fuels the ire of Japanese nationalists acting as a stand-alone complex known as The Individual Eleven and a secret government intelligence agency known as the C.I.S. These leads into random terrorist acts such as nail-bombs and international attacks across the globe to affect the refugee bills in Japan while a leader is orchestrated by the C.I.S. to become “a voice of the people” while the government body is the producer of this hero. \n\nThere are even less subtle implications such as Japan’s first female prime minister and the episode about the delusions of a war veteran about his distrust with the media to report on these refugee attacks without obfuscating the truth. Compared to the first season, 2nd Gig is more involved with its political affairs than the transhumanism topics, which can be both good and bad depending on how you think they are handled. Most episodes still remain focused on the ramifications of technology on humanity, yet the emphasis is definitely placed on its politics within the scope of the whole season.\n\nIf the first season only had topics more relevant to the present with internet culture attitudes, the season borders on self-reflection of the current political landscape of the States. The ending itself doesn’t address the issue other than it remains divisive, which is probably the only fair way the show could have ended yet it also lacks that sense of finality that makes the original so beloved.  \n\n[h1]True Grit with Less Wit[/h1]\n\nSome of the other changes that are easy to witness and harder to describe are small details made in every episode. Characters we know already are quickly established and they are given less episodes to flesh out their backstories any further. Violence, one of the more tamer aspects of the original, is more gratuitous at any opportunity to showcase the increased animation. Deaths in the first season were often implied or obscured tastefully whereas the 2nd Gig will often show heads exploding from gunshots or blood being shot out of a soldier. These little changes don’t affect the overall season but they do establish the show as a darker transition from simple under-the-government-cover operatives of the former Section 9 into the more bureaucratic, manipulated Section 9 of 2nd Gig. \n\nAs a whole, these changes are beneficial for 2nd Gig as the scenarios and obstacles Section 9 has to overcome are more politically motivated and greyer than their previous operatives. It’s a shame then that the villains within 2nd Gig are too blatantly obvious for their own benefit; Gouza, the head of the C.I.S., has a facial scar that screams Skullface from Metal Gear Solid V. Kuze, a more morally gray character with more sympathy, has more development as the face of the refugees that is undermined by a convoluted connection to “Major” Motoko. The only benefit is the narrative doesn’t deliberate on a very schmaltzy revelation with Major and Kuze, so the connection remains as much of a mystery as the lore about ghosts, AI, etc. \n\nIt’s these little defects within the larger narrative of 2nd Gig that makes it the lesser of two great seasons as had they polished the tone-changes as well as flesh out the villains to be more believable the storyline could easily be the greater of the two. Now whether it was these changes and the shift from transhumanism into humanitarian political affairs as to why there has not been an official third season remains to be seen with Solid State Society.","timestamp_created":1508105068,"timestamp_updated":1508105068,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":9,"weighted_vote_score":"0.591268002986907959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3qOEkd8CfN20iAE="}
