      about a dog wielding a magic brush! Use the painting powers to explore, solve
      puzzles, help your animal friends and restore color to the world.<br><br><strong>The
      Brush</strong> is a one-of-a-kind artifact that can color the world. Naturally,
      it needs a wielder, a master artist responsible for all colors and for passing
      the brush down. The current wielder, Chicory, is immensely talented and beloved
      by all... until all the color in the land vanishes, and her with it! I guess
      that leaves it up to you, her <strong>number one fan</strong>, to take up the
      brush and fill in for her. Hmm... good luck!<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Explore
