Instead, you can go back in time and reconsider every decision. Making notes (page number for interesting desicion) were useful to me, but unnecessary and for most people probably exaggerated.","timestamp_created":1492984413,"timestamp_updated":1599090460,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1oDOqPQCdLjBdw=="}
