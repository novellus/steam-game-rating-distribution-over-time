    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Movavi Slideshow Maker</h2> is the fastest\
      \ and easiest way to make a stunning slideshow for any purpose: a birthday gift,\
      \ a compilation of your best gaming moments, a work presentation, and more.<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Let Your Creativity Flow</h2>Upload any footage you have:\
      \ holiday pictures, funny videos, or even game screenshots.  Move, split and\
      \ cut slides, join them with spectacular transitions. Make as many adjustments\
      \ as you need: crop and rotate pictures, boost colors, normalize sound in clips,\
      \ and more. Add the music of your choice and have the slides advance following\
      \ the rhythm of that music. You can also add a voice-over and record images\
      \ from your webcam or an external device.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Start with the\
      \ Slideshow Wizard</h2>Try the Slideshow Wizard if you\u2019re just starting\
      \ to use the program. It\u2019s an automated approach that helps you create\
      \ videos in no time. All you need to do is import your files and choose a theme.\
      \ The program will create a presentation in the blink of an eye. You can also\
      \ set the target video length and change the titles. Already have a favorite\
      \ transition style? Create a custom theme and use it whenever you want.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Give It the Perfect Look</h2>Try zooming in and out of pictures, use\
      \ the fade-to-black effect, or make your slides roll over. Use filters to sharpen\
      \ details, reduce camera shake, and make your images brighter and more colorful.\
      \ Use the Transition Wizard to join all clips at once and smooth out the flow\
      \ of your presentation. You can make it even more dynamic by adding transitions\
      \ to both main and supplementaryl tracks!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Try Hollywood-Style\
      \ Directing</h2>Add a Hollywood touch to your visuals and throw in some special\
      \ effects. Use Chroma Key to change the background and place your characters\
      \ in completely different surroundings. Add dynamic elements with the Pan &amp;\
      \ Zoom tool. Slow-motion will create suspense and have your viewers on the edge\
      \ of their seats. If you want to cut out scenes with a particular character,\
      \ try the Scene Detection.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Save and Show!</h2>After the\
      \ presentation is complete, save it in a popular format like AVI, MOV, or MP4,\
      \ or use a device-specific conversion profile. You can also easily share your\
      \ video with friends and instantly upload it to YouTube right from within the\
      \ program."
