    review: "I already reviewed Episode the first 3 episodes on the Steam page of\
      \ each episode, so here, I am going to talk only about episode 4 only. \n[list][/list]\
      \ I want to mention, as I did before, some key factors that will be present\
      \ throughout the whole game, that concern graphics and soundtrack! For a 2018\
      \ game the graphics are pretty OK, I can notice a glimpse of a very peculiar\
      \ art style, given a caricaturistic look to the characters and highlighting\
      \ a lot of facial traces and details. In regard to the soundtrack, it is quite\
      \ immersive and it fits like a glove in the game and contributes to this atmosphere\
      \ of mystery, suspense and occultism.\n[list][/list] But let's get back to the\
      \ episode! Since from here forward everything has changed. We are embracing\
      \ a story that I did not expect, yes I had some clues that this could be the\
      \ way to go, but I was not expecting all the details of it...\n[list][/list]\
      \ This episode was incredibly fast, don\u2019t know if it was because it is\
      \ really short or if it is only because with so many things happening it passed\
      \ really fast. \nThe puzzles available were fun and very challenging, and that\
      \ has been the most cohesive aspect throughout the game. \n[list][/list] Please\
      \ don\u2019t get me wrong, the story has been great, but is not very cohesive,\
      \ sometimes it takes a long time to get anywhere, so other times you get there\
      \ faster than you expect, and when you are processing one outcome, bang you\
      \ are hit by another major event. \n[list][/list] But I don\u2019t want to get\
      \ into details, the game is history driven so any detail could be a spoiler\
      \ to someone. So far I really enjoyed it! Fully recommend this game! \n[list][/list](Don't\
      \ forget to check my review of the other episodes on the Steam page of each\
      \ one of them)."
