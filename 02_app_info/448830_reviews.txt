I get it, but I don't.\n\nInstead of being a game, this is a program for whatever reason.\nIt is a simulator, if anything.\n\nIt is a... [i]program[/i]... where you select different sounds, individually change their volume, pitch and speed.\nOnce you're done you save that and you can load it and play it.\n[b]That's it.[/b]\n\nAlso, why does the list of sounds include screaming noises, baby crying etc...?\nThese are not ASMR sounds.\nAnd as for the actual ASMR sounds that are in the game, I mean program, there are barely any.\nIt needs a larger library of sounds.\n\nI get what it's supposed to do, and I guess it does it; I.E induce ASMR.\nBut you can just search for [i]Tapping ASMR[/i], for example, on YouTube and get a thousands times more content for a thousand times less effort.\n\nNot worth the money or effort.\n\n[i]*Oh, and the opening screen of the game includes seizure inducing flashing colours.\nGreat for ASMR.\nJust thought I'd let you know.[/i]\n\n\n[h1]Curator page[/h1]\n\n[i]If you liked this review or otherwise found it helpful in deciding whether or not to buy this game, feel free to follow [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/29162366/]my Curator page[/url].[/i]","timestamp_created":1483464346,"timestamp_updated":1573388109,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.599842488765716553","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zKjPqu4CfrHHbg=="}
