For a 2018 game the graphics are pretty OK, I can notice a glimpse of a very peculiar art style, given a caricaturistic look to the characters and highlighting a lot of facial traces and details. In regard to the soundtrack, it is quite immersive and it fits like a glove in the game and contributes to this atmosphere of mystery, suspense and occultism.\n[list][/list] But let's get back to the episode! And so far so good, like the other episodes, Episode 3 did not disappoint. My main concern is that the episode is small and like happened on Episode 2 you are mainly revisiting the same places all over again. But luckily the history do not disappoint and the puzzles available were fun and very challenging, as always. The game is getting darker and strange, in a good way, and honestly I do not know what to expect anymore.\n[list][/list] But I donâ€™t want to get into details, the game is history driven so any detail could be a spoiler to someone. So far I really enjoyed it! Fully recommend this game!
