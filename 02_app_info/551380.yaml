    review: '[b][u]Game Information[/u][/b]


      "Danse Macabre: The Last Adagio" Collector''s Edition is a Hidden Object Puzzle
      Adventure game. The game was developed by Eipix Entertainment and published
      by Big Fish Games Studio.


      "The Last Adagio" is the first episode of "Danse Macabre."


      Since this is a collector''s edition, it comes with extra features that are
      not available in its counterpart; the standard edition.


      [b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]


      Game Visuals


      I want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely done. The visuals
      can be adjusted in the game''s option menu.


      Game Audio


      I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio
      is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game''s
      option menu as well.


      Gameplay


      There are four different game difficulty modes to choose from: Casual; Expert;
      Insane and Custom.


      There is an interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel
      between each location quickly. It also indicates that there are tasks that can
      be completed at certain locations. The interactive map is automatically given
      at the start of the game.


      There is a padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in
      place to make it stationary.


      There are interactive items in the game. Some of these interactive items may
      require extra components before they can be interacted with. All interactive
      items are marked with a symbol in one of the corners.


      The hidden object scenes consist of the following: Traditional word lists; Shadow
      items; Find ''x'' amount items. Some of these hidden object scenes may require
      little or no interactions. Most of the hidden object scenes can be replayed
      in the game''s extra feature section.


      Bubble Popper is an optional mini game that is only available during hidden
      object scenes.


      The puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of
      the themes. Most of the puzzles can be replayed in the game''s extra feature
      section.


      There is a collectible in the game: Flower. They are scattered throughout the
      game for the player to find.


      There are beyond objects (morphing objects.) They are scattered throughout the
      game for the player to find as well.


      There is a bonus chapter in the game. But it can be accessed only after the
      main story is completed.


      There are eighteen different achievements that can be unlocked from playing
      the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need
      to be completed before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game
      only.


      Miscellaneous


      There are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Bonus Hidden Object Scenes;
      Bonus Puzzles; Soundtracks; Wallpapers; Concept Art; Souvenir Room and Game''s
      Strategy Guide. Most of these extra features can be accessed only after the
      entire game is completed.


      Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay
      value for the game is low. I would recommend the game but not at the game''s
      full price value.'
