    review: "I just finished a complete run-through of the game and I have to say-\
      \ I really enjoyed it! \n\nThere were a few issues along the way, but nothing\
      \ that would make the game unplayable in my opinion. The time skips in the second\
      \ half felt rushed and broke up what was originally a very flowing and immersive\
      \ setting. I also had a technical issue where the character I was romancing\
      \ was suddenly replaced by someone who had approached us (it resolved after\
      \ one choice click). And although I originally had planned to pursue the mining\
      \ route, after chapter 2 I stopped getting options to address mining at all.\
      \ Some choices and options seemed to vanish into thin air- never to be mentioned\
      \ or offered again.\n\nDespite these minor issues, game play was enjoyable.\
      \ In the vast array of choices and options I think there was only one or two\
      \ times where I couldn't find a choice I agreed with. There were numerous times\
      \ where I was torn between two very good options! This opens the door to multiple\
      \ plays and I will certainly try the game again with a different approach.\n\
      \nWhile I have played many choice-based games, was my first game in this particular\
      \ style and I really enjoyed it. I feel like this experience is a wonderful\
      \ blend of creative reading and modern technology- you get the best of both\
      \ worlds! I'll definitely be looking into other games by this company."
