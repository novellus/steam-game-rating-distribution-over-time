    review: Again a game where you have to pay for a full game, but you only can play
      1/3 due to the very bad game design that blocks your progress until you get
      an impossible objective done for the previous level. Only for masochist who
      like to play the same levels over and over. Spend your money on another good
      solitaire game, and ignore this one.
