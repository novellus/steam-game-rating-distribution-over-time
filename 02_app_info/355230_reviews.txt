The pad controls are perfect though.\n\nThe GFX and sound are old-school, but that's what I like. The 3D immersion is fantastic, you can really make use of full cockpit view when you need to roll, loop and else in order to catch balls. It's a genuine pleasure to swerve between trees, and to feel sick when you manoeuver close to a mountain. You really feel volumes, that's what VR was meant for, and few VR games give you such good feelings.\n\nThe early access part is the big drawback for this game. You may either fly freely in a few maps, or 'race' in some others. The race part seems unfinished and pointless for now, let's hope it will develop, and the whole game as well.\n\nFor this price, I'm still happy to have what I have, but let's hope it will grow on this very encouraging basis.","timestamp_created":1546815122,"timestamp_updated":1546894403,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ42+yFlegCd8LatwE="}
