It's exactly what it sounds like, a collection of various boss battles that you have to tackle with your little robot. The bosses have a variety of mechanics and abilities that you have to learn to do well. And after each failed attempt you get to keep one upgrade for your next runs so you always feel like you're making progress. I beat it once by focusing on passive upgrades for my bot, and next I'll see if I can beat my high score by going for new weapons. It's not easy, so good luck","timestamp_created":1557264345,"timestamp_updated":1557264345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+oSMyuoCcLPiwAE="}
