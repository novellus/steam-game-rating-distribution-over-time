    short_description: The ability to discern hidden connections is both a gift and

    review: 'I am left wondering if I have completed the game. Nothing indicates that
      it is over, surely the dev did not just stop building at this point ?

      I wanted this puzzle game to be great considering the intriguing name of it
      but did not meet my expectations. It does work as a puzzle game as far as it
      goes but its too short for my satisfaction and I was hoping for some new concepts/game
      mechanics to play out here but I feel that I have not learnt or experienced
      anything new that has not already been done in other games. Cubes and lasers.

      If you can get it on special offer, its worth a punt, but it just feels I got
      going before it suddenly ended...I think. Im entirely happy not having a story
      - just solve puzzles but needs more.'
