    review: "Pirates AND zombies? What's not to love? Well, the fact that I can't\
      \ get it to run, for one. \n\nI was looking forward to a bit of casual swashbuckling\
      \ mayhem but the game won't launch, and there has been close to zero forum activity\
      \ for the game since its release - 10 years ago. One of the few forum posts\
      \ did mention a possible fix by downloading an un-named something which worked\
      \ for some and not others, but I just don't feel like going through the effort\
      \ when there are so many other games to play... So sadly I won't be recommending\
      \ this one."
