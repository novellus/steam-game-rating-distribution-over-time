Don't take this as a negative thought, as my computer can't even run a game from 2007 without some lag. But funny thing is that even with the graphics at the lowest, it still looked amazing. The artstyle is just amazing, whish they made a show about this. Gameplay is also fun. Early lvls from what I've seen in my 1st game are pretty casual. Can't actually \"speak\", but they do have little voice lines that are pre written for every character. Idk about higher lvls but just also hear this. I played a match today at lvl 1. 3 out of the 4 (including me) were less than lvl 10. But we also had a lvl fucking 100 playing with us. Despite this from what I saw (even with the limited chat) everyone seemed chill, and me a lvl 1 beat the lvl 100. As long as you play well, with the right cards. You can beat anyone, the lvl difference is just to show how many games played. Imo that doesn't = to skill. Thats because at the end of each game. Stars are filled up to lvl you up, you fill them by getting titles like presteige master. Thus as long as someone grinds they could easily play to lvl 100 without getting a single win. So don't be intimidated by big numbers. Just focus on winning and having a good time while doing so.","timestamp_created":1610167742,"timestamp_updated":1610167742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw473e8vYCdPjbwQI="}
