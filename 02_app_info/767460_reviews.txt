It seems to work, with a few odd bugs (For example, I have never gotten a score, even though I have beaten quite a few levels) and from the look of it, no support. \nTo be fair, I am not returning this game, and expect to play it thru to the end, TD games are too few and far between.\nThat said, the look is nice, mimicking the vector graphics of some arcade games from the eighties.  (Battle Zone comes to mind, easy to imagine them being in the same universe.)  The techo-music is pretty cool as well.\nThere is pathing, though so far the options are pretty basic. There are flying units, and I guess there will be cloaked ones as well, as there is a tower that reveals them. \nOne interesting idea is that the blocks you use for pathing, which are often simply cheap and do nothing, can be upgraded to do a few things, see cloaked, zone of slow, zone of buffing other towers and one other that slips my mind. \nTower upgrades are lackluster, up a time or two with no options or choices. You don't get the option to decide how the towers targets the enemies, none of the bells and whistles that should be standard by now. \nThat said, I am enjoying it, can't give it a thumbs down. Get it on sale if you can, but worth a play.","timestamp_created":1604439207,"timestamp_updated":1604439207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xe2ByPUCc6OQrAI="}
