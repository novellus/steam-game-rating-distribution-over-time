    review: 'I''m really questioning the hate for this DLC, because it was frankly
      my favorite of the bunch. Krieg is one of my favorite characters, and I went
      into this expecting to find just a rollercoaster ride of absurdity and weirdness.
      What I got was honestly a fascinating and emotionally impactful story. Maybe
      the mechanics of the DLC were lacking, but I value the story more. It fleshed
      Krieg out, made him utterly fascinating. I was paying complete attention the
      entire time. The banter between the two Kriegs was amusing, but the really interesting
      part was his relationship with Maya, and his origins. If you take the time to
      listen to the dialogue, and to find the echo logs scattered throughout, you
      discover just how complex Krieg is.


      In short, I feel this DLC took a DLC character that was made, originally, as
      sort of a joke (Big crazy man screams weird and funny things), and turned him
      into one of the most complex characters in the series. Whole lot of duality
      going on. So if you''re thinking of playing it, don''t make your decision based
      off of people whining about the mechanics. It''s Borderlands, you shoot, kill,
      loot, repeat. Play it if you want a deeper look into one of the most entertaining
      characters written in the series.'
