I don't know if maybe my issues were because I'm on the Oculus and only the Vive is officially supported. I seriously wanted to quit before 5 minutes, but I stuck with it just so I can give you guys an honest review. \n\nThe graphics in this game don't look anything like the store page photos or video. Serious downgrade. No options other than play, manual, or exit. The manual is basically just a list of the controls. You teleport around. You carry a flashlight. It's supposed to be dark. And it kind of is, but I couldn't even tell if the flashlight was illuminating anything. I did see light coming from it, but it's not like the store page video. \n\nColors are all washed out. Muddy textures. It's like looking at a Van Gogh. Stuff just blends together. And so you get to the generator. There's no puzzle. You just press a bunch of levers, spin a wheel, press a button and voila the thing turns on. Then that thing comes towards you. You shine your flashlight at it. The freaking thing gets up close and screams in your face. Very annoying. I wasn't scared, I was petrified of this thing yelling in my ear. It's very uncomfortable. I tried holding the flashlight in all kinds of positions to see how I could stop it and nothing. It always screamed in my face. \n\nRate 3/10. This is garbage on the Oculus. Maybe it's better on the Vive. Maybe, but I doubt it. I only recommend this game for Twitch streamers or YouTube Let's play for some douchey type person to scream and try to get views or whatever. I really hate those guys/gals and the people who watch them.","timestamp_created":1530427753,"timestamp_updated":1530427753,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581331491470336914","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4osimquQCedzppAE="}
