      Thank you for your time in reviewing MC


      As you know, the game has just been released in Early Access to let us understand
      how to improve it and, of course, polish it! Would be great if you can report
      the bug you''ve found into the official discussion topic we''ve set-up to collect
      such important feeds as yours!


      Thank you :)'

    review: This game has an awesome concept, but the overall execution isn't all
      there, and I'm going to blame that on the game still being in early access.
      I played this for a couple of hours and loved the decision making and in depth
      story/characters, but I did have a few issues. I had to reload my save multiple
      times because the game wouldn't load the next day, I also had to start a new
      game as I couldn't progress based off the previous choices I had made. The art
      style is amazing and it has a lot of attention to detail, I really like how
      so far all of the characters seem very diverse. Overall for the price I would
      say its worth checking out, its a fun experience, just needs a lot of polish
      and maybe some less repetition when starting a new game.
