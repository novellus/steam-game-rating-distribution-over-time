Why am I not recommending this Light Novel Standard music you may ask? Well, if you read the EULA carefully, it states that  this resource pack is \"meant for use in Visual Novel Maker only\" with an RPG Maker condition that \"conditionally used with RPG Maker products as long as the user owns both Visual Novel and RPG Maker product licenses.\", This means that you gotta own both Visual Novel Maker and RPG Maker in order to fully use this on the RPG Maker engine. At the very least, change the EULA if you wanna sell it. SMH bitter sweet entertainment, you're just bitter... would rather use other music packs than this. Until bitter sweet readjust EULA this dlc is garbage.","timestamp_created":1575334294,"timestamp_updated":1575334294,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.594419717788696289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn7bP5O4CcPaw4QE="}
