Went in with an open mind on this one, but it didn't quite pan out.\n\nFor one thing, there's no option to change control inputs, which is frustrating especially since one of the default gamepad inputs on 1P overlaps with an input on 2P. Since there's no training mode, you have to go into versus 2P mode if you wish to lab/try things out, and as you can guess that can make things a chore. Even an option to just disable 2P inputs would've helped things a bit.\n\nThe game itself has a basic fighter system, and while I can forgive jank, sometimes it gets intrusive in this game. Sometimes there's moves that just whiff completely, like Driver's stand LK missing on 1P side on some characters. It's also a bit cumbersome that very little of the games controls are explained to you. There's a menu that lists special moves, but it's only for one character in the game, Mike; Everybody else you have to just wing it. There's two characters, Boxer and Ethan, who have a strange control/assist system, and Boxer jumps with a button(?). And three Chun-Li clones who I assume have other moves but all I could figure out was Lightning Legs. Other than Mike, Driver/Robo Kyle (they're the same character swapped basically) I could figure out a bit of, and they were actually pretty fun.\n\nThis game actually has a few fun ideas going for it, and I found myself labbing some Driver/Kyle combos for a bit. As a program it ran well all things considered, even for my less than stellar setup right now. But the problems in the game just get too much in the way to recommend. Even some small fixes could help this game a lot.","timestamp_created":1609023002,"timestamp_updated":1609023002,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2dLP0PYCcPbFvQI="}
