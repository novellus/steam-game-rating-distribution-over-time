    review: 'Great game!


      It plays like Fairune (another fantastic game, check it out).


      Combat in this and Fairune is like in Ys I&II where you just walk over the enemies
      and your level decides if you get hurt, how much do you get hurt and whether
      the enemy dies or not. So some places have enemies impossible to kill but who
      hurt you a lot, some places have enemies that you can kill but who hurt you
      for 1 or 2 HP and some places have enemies that you kill with them giving you
      no damage.


      The combat is not the main attraction of the game. It''s mostly about solving
      puzzles and figuring out secret paths. There are vague hints to things but the
      game doesn''t hold your hand almost at all, ever, and that''s what''s so great
      about it. You will feel you are stuck, but when you end up finding a new hidden
      path or solving a puzzle it feels really good.


      Now, at this current moment I finally feel like I''m actually really stuck so
      it could be that''s the end for my game :D

      Tried to get some help from the forum but let''s see if the dev or someone else
      helps.

      But even in this situation, while wandering around aimlessly, just going through
      as many screens as possible trying to see what I have missed, I was able to
      find a couple of new things I had missed, but neither of them helped with what
      I was trying to achieve. Still it did make me feel that maybe there is a way.


      It''s relatively fast to go around the world, and you will even end up unlocking
      some teleporters that help you going through the world faster.


      The game does look and sound a bit cheap and unpolished and amateurish especially
      compared to the likes of Fairune, but make no mistake, there''s a lot of love
      poured in to this game. It''s fantastic gameplaywise and the puzzles end up
      getting quite tough the further you go and you have to give attention to what
      you see in the world or you will end up getting stuck in no time.


      The music sounds like MIDI music, and it perhaps is. While the initial gameplay
      music gets a bit too repetitive after a while, there are some very good songs
      playing during the game. Each new area has its own music and a few of them are
      REALLY good. And again, there''s a bit of "unpolished amateurness" in the music
      but many of them are actually very good compositions and you''ll probably end
      up humming some of them when you are not playing the game.


      Deaths are pretty rare in this game. Just be patient, grind a bit, use save/heal
      points efficiently with grinding and you have no problem. In later game there
      will be some enemies that are impossible to kill and who kill you immediately
      upon touch, but you are warned about it. Those are the places you end up seeing
      the Game Over screen, but those screens are really fun to try to get through
      (and the game over tune is great!). As said, the main challenge in the game
      is to figure out puzzles and secret paths completely on your own.


      I''m playing this with and Xbox360 controller and it works well with it. Sometimes
      you have to tinker around a bit in the menu screen before the controller is
      fully working, but it works well after that. And the controller only uses the
      directional and one action button while menu/map/inventory/etc buttons are usable
      only on the keyboard, so that design seems odd. If you play with the keyboard
      only then there obviously aren''t any problems with that.


      tl;dr

      The game looks and sounds a bit unpolished and amateurish but don''t let it
      fool you, it''s a FANTASTIC game and if you love games that don''t hold your
      hand you will love this.'
