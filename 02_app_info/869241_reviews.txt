Unfortunately, Tabletopia version is clunky at best. First of all and the my main grief about the Tabletopia version is the inability to remove player boards and tokens of nonplayers from the game. If I want to play solo, I choose the solo option which adds the Chronobot to the game but doesn't allow me to pick a faction and have the rest of the factions removed from the table. It's very irritating. Also the water tokens and the resource tokens are tiny on the table and when you drop them in your inventory bar they become huge and don't stack correctly. This is the main reason why I am giving this DLC a thumbs down.","timestamp_created":1564151467,"timestamp_updated":1564151467,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.591268002986907959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v6msl+wCfJeUzwE="}
