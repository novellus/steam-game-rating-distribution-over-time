That being said I'm sad to see that the interest in the game is waning. I'd love to see it expanded more. The gameplay is a little rough but pretty straightforward. A basic tutorial would be nice but fiddling around with it you can easily figure stuff out after accidentally throwing a few villagers lol. \n","timestamp_created":1605646103,"timestamp_updated":1605646103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4neb96/UCec+ArwI="}
