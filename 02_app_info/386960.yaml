    short_description: With the gods of the planescape threatening eternal punishment,
      it is up to Doctor Charles Malcom and his overseer from the gods, Fallore, to
      fix the wrongs of his experiments. At the heart of his last clean-up is a core
      being fought over by an elven thief, a stoic mage, and a loyal handmaiden!
