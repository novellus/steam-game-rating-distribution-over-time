    review: 'For a game made completely from purchased Unity assets, it''s understandable
      why this developer wants to ask $20 USD for this...  But when you see that the
      entire game at this point can be played in about six minutes, it''s laughable
      at best.  - And when I say six minutes, I mean just that.  Most of that six
      minutes is boring, idle game play or waiting for the game to load the next scene
      of assets he''s place together.


      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwJB7wVwQiM


      What is here is terrible and boring and not even worth a dollar at this point.  I
      hate to go here, but this developer REALLY needs to think of this game from
      a customers point of view.. A customer could go buy TellTales "A Wolf Among
      Us" or "The Walking Dead" for $15.. or they could buy the first episode of Life
      Is Strange 2 for $8.  The first two options are entire seasons offering over
      10 hours of epic, engaging and interesting gameplay for less money.  The first
      episode of Life Is Strange 2 offers more than two hours of gameplay for less
      than half the price this developer wants for this pile of Unity asset boring
      trash.  ..What I''m saying is that even if this developer pulls through with
      his early access promises and turns this into a two hour game, there is NO WAY
      IN HELL this will ever compete with other games 1,000 better for less money.


      All this is in the end sadly is a new indie developer striving wayyyyyyy too
      high with their first Steam game.  For some reason, they think they are just
      "too good" to think "small" for their first project and make something that
      they can actually finish and that might be interesting.


      To the developer...  My challenge for you is to actually CODE YOURSELF a game
      where the player can play against the computer a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe
      before striving for anything more complex.  Teach the computer yourself with
      code you write yourself how to play Tic-Tac-Toe and beat the player.  Teach
      the AI to play itself.  NO ASSETS.  No assets are needed.  I''m NOT joking either.  If
      the developer can''t even code well enough to make a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game,
      that what on Earth is he thinking out there spending hundreds of dollars on
      Unity assets trying to assemble this Madela game?!?     ...Just sayin'''
