Takashi is a lot more charming of a partner character imo than the first volumes guy. I also really like the chemistry of him and Sakuya and how they both struggle a bit with gender identity. I feel like him and Sakuya have a history which makes it easier for me to ship him with Sakuya and gets rid of the Romeo and Juliet syndrome of falling in love with someone within a few hours. It felt like this game gave a lot more insight into Sakuyas past and how she became the way she is. I appreciated how Takashi reinforces that he loves Sakuya whether Sakuya identifies as a guy or girl, saying he fell in love with Sakuya both when he thought she was a guy and a girl. As a trans male myself seeing a character being supportive of a person going through problems with gender identity and telling them they love them regardless is something really powerful to see.  \n\nIf you played the first and liked it I view the second as pretty much nothing but improvements. Considering some of the things Kuon says in this volume were a little eyebrow raising so i'm personally looking forward to playing the 3rd volume myself.","timestamp_created":1589236197,"timestamp_updated":1589236411,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526989459991455078","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p+X3gvICca2RhwI="}
