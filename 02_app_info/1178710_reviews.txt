I have to say that I was excited to try this game out when I played the demo, but I feel like the game went the complete opposite direction. It felt strange to me that I enjoyed the Demo more than the full game. I'm a fan of this kind of art style, but it felt like it was cut way too short. Boom, you get transported into the game. Have a chat with some people and *BAM* the Final Boss wants to fight you and you one shot her. I'm not trying to be harsh, but I see why Steam offered the bundle. That game by itself wasn't really worth it. Also, I felt like the story was going somewhere but it ended all too sudden. Anyways, even though I may not recommend it, that doesn't mean you don't have to get it. I was honestly hoping there to be more, or at least a secret input or some sort of Easter Egg.","timestamp_created":1590331380,"timestamp_updated":1590331380,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkuLIo/ICfrj/iQI="}
