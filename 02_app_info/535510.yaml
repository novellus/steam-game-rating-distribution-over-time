    review: You see my money? Take it. Take it all. These guys are great, and make
      an awesome, awesome product. It's gotten to the point where I'll buy basically
      every DLC Dragom puts out. This, combined with the landscapes DLC will get you
      just about everything you need to make 90% of the maps you need - with a little
      creativity.  Ijust wish I hadn't spent two weeks painstakingly crafting a Yartar
      harbor map, because this is clearly the better way to go. Thanks for making
      my work redundant Dragom!
