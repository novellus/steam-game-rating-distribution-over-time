    short_description: Fractured Soul takes the classic platformers of the 80s and
      doubles the action! Your unique ability to shift between two parallel dimensions
      allows you to weave through enemy fire, catch opponents by surprise, and leap
      over impossibly wide gaps by using platforms in both realities.

    review: A terrible port which has simply not been optimized properly to work with
      the XBox 360 controller. Rebinding keys does not work; navigating menus is a
      nightmare; working out what button does what is an exercise in pure frustration.
      This game will waste your time and money.
