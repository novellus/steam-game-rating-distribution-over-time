As a temporary solution, restarting the level should remedy it. The game is most certainly beatable.\n\nThe AI is a much more subjective discussion, but it does indeed follow its own rules, and there is a reason they behave the way the do. This is primarily a horror game rather than a \"traditional\" platformer."}],"cursor":"AoJw59Dv0OYCf5SbrQE="}
