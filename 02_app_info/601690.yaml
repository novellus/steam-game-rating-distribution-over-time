    review: "''Private, report for duty, you have been selected for a special mission,\
      \ courtesy of your boss so don't forget to thank him later for taking consideration\
      \ of your skills from your previous mission. Everything you need to know is\
      \ inside within the files, but long story short, you are going to participate\
      \ in a ''cleaning'' mission for quite some time. The boss sees you as a great\
      \ asset in order to finish the mission, we have fueled your spaceship and powered\
      \ its weaponry, the mission will start today so report to the deck and be ready,\
      \ we wish you good luck soldier...''\n\n[h1] Story: [/h1]\n\nBeing the role\
      \ of an underpaid space trooper, your mission is to do a ''cleaning'' in some\
      \ spotted sectors suspected of alien activity in the name of your boss's Capitalism,\
      \ do a good job and get back, you might receive a bonus in your salary... or\
      \ something else.\n\n[h1] Gameplay: [/h1]\n\nStill following the genre of an\
      \ arcade, shoot 'em up type of game, this DLC is a prequel of the events that\
      \ led to the main game in which your objective is to erradicate any alien life\
      \ form of the sectors you were sent by your boss, starting with only one character,\
      \ in which later you unlock more through the achievements you achieve, including\
      \ as well multiple abilities and different weaponry for each character. Powerups\
      \ continues to be a presence with some new defences and attack updates such\
      \ examples of it are ''one more HP'' which gives you another life while ''mega\
      \ beam'' and ''mirrored shooting'' are only acquired on the third segment of\
      \ the game.\n\nIn terms of controls, still continues to be the same but with\
      \ some new advancements and for those who dislike the keyboard, it features\
      \ a controller setup just like in the main game and on the menu, the ''palettes''\
      \ have been replaced by ''achievements'', now you can keep track on your statistics\
      \ as well the stunts completed by performing certain tasks.  The option menu\
      \ is still minimalistic and now you get a new option of changing your play style,\
      \ wether it being keyboard plus mouse or just controller.\n\nWhat about the\
      \ visuals of the game? My only answer is, it finally simulates that arcade feel\
      \ to it, the pixels are perfect in every form and shapes on screen while the\
      \ velocity of the AI and the rate of fire plays a small contribution to it.\
      \ As I mentionned regarding the palettes, sadly there isn't, to my perspective\
      \ would be cool but I don't think it would be needed.\n\nIt is cool for the\
      \ DLC having achievements, cooler when I discovered I could unlock different\
      \ characters with it, even though it isn't a challenge, some are time consuming\
      \ while the rest you can achieve right on your first gameplay. Maybe if it were\
      \ a bit more pleasing in terms of unlocking a character, lets say for example,\
      \ the ''Kill 900 gellatine | AAZ'' switches places with ''Die 50 times | AAZ''.\n\
      \n[h1] Glitches/Bugs/Errors report: [/h1]\n\nIt barely shows any bugs and glitches\
      \ in the game besides one of the unlockable characters when he gets a weaponry\
      \ powerup, it doesn't show the type it has improved, but anything else from\
      \ that, no problems whatsoever.\n\n[h1] Overall: [/h1]\n\nI quite frankly enjoyed\
      \ this DLC, unlike the main game, it definitely has got a balance between the\
      \ overload of powerups and the challenge it provides during gameplay, except\
      \ of course in the third segment where in some instances, you will get massive\
      \ amounts of ''mirrored shooting'', besides from that, I believe in terms of\
      \ the unlockable characters with their different weapons, spacecraft style and\
      \ their abilities the difficulty in these aspects could be stepped up a bit,\
      \ but since in some characters their weaponry changes and some of the abilities\
      \ are locked throughout the gameplay, probably would be the best just to keep\
      \ the difficulty at its level.\nIt is a DLC that I would recommend for my friends\
      \ to play to better understand the story and \n where the main game is set,\
      \ could have some small adjustments, but in the end, it is just a game that\
      \ I will always come back.\n\nScore: 9.5/10 \n\n\n [h1] -Written and posted\
      \ on the group/curator ''The (almost) honest opinion'', also known as, ''T(A)HO'',\
      \ come and join the group and/or the curator page for more reviews such as this\
      \ one!\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/thealmosthonestopinion] Group\
