      experience the first virtual cat that feels like a real one.<br><br>Konrad,
      the cute kitten, needs a helping hand and lots of love. You have to satisfy

      litter box, let him take a ride in a hot-air-balloon and lots more!<br><br>A
      particular highlight for all cat fans is the unique <strong>plush toy mode</strong>.
      This feature brings your favorite plush toy to life as a virtual cat, letting

      to various rooms and areas in which to do so. In the Dress Room, you can unlock

      to feed the kittens, clean them, play with them and find them when they get
      lost.<br><br>Cuteness overload awaits all cat fans in this unique virtual reality
      game. Experience a new way to combine real life and virtual reality. Will you
