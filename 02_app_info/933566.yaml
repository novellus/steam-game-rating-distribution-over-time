    review: 'I don''t know why Steam lets season pass owners review this, but none
      of the other individual packs. Whatever, I''ll bite.


      It''s bad. You already knew it''s bad. They just lazily copied over two of DW8XL''s
      challenge modes and locked mediocre weapon gems behind it after the fact. It''s
      not fun, and it''s not worth it. One of the most pathetic pieces of DLC this
      series has ever gotten.'
