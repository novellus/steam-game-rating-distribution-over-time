    review: '[b][u]Game Information[/u][/b]


      "The Dreamatorium of Dr. Magnus 2" is a Hidden Object Puzzle Adventure game.
      The game was developed and published by Two Desperados.


      "The Dreamatorium of Dr. Magnus 2" is the second episode of "The Dreamatorium
      of Dr. Magnus." Previous episode: "The Dreamatorium of Dr. Magnus."


      [b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]


      Game Visuals


      I want to mention that the visuals in the game are well done. The visuals can
      be adjusted in the game''s option menu.


      Game Audio


      I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio
      is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game''s
      option menu as well.


      Gameplay


      There are four different difficulty game modes to choose from: Regular; Advanced;
      Expert and Custom.


      The notebook keeps track of progression in the game. Such as story events and
      clues.


      There is an interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel
      between each location quickly without having the need to constantly backtrack.
      It also indicates that there are a variety of tasks that can be completed at
      various locations within the game. The interactive map is automatically given
      at the start of the game.


      There is a padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in
      place to make it stationary.


      There are some interactive items in the game. Some of the interactive may require
      extra components before they can be interacted with. All interactive items are
      marked with a symbol in one of the corners.


      Magical Amulet that allows the player to reveal certain events that had happened
      in the past.


      Multi-tool device tool comes with three different tools: Screwdriver; Scissor
      and Knife.


      The hidden object scenes consist of the following: Reversed hidden objects;
      Fragmented items; Shadow items. Some of these hidden object scenes may require
      little or no interaction.


      The puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of
      them.


      There is a collectible in the game: Eye of Horus. They are scattered throughout
      the game for the player to find.


      There are fifteen different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the
      game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need
      to be completed before they can be unlocked.


      Miscellaneous


      There are extra features in the game: Wallpapers and Concept Art. Some of these
      extra features can be accessed only after the entire game is completed.


      There are five different trading cards to collect. Only three of those trading
      cards are given out by the game. There are several ways to get the rest of the
      trading card: Purchased from Steam''s Community Market; Trade with friends;
      Booster Packs and its'' Booster Pack Creator.


      Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay
      value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game''s
      full price value.'
