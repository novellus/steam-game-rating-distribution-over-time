Not much to say about this one beyond that - it's about halfway to being fun, but the controls and your four \"spells\" are all very awkward, often missing despite seeming to come in contact with the target, and it's incredibly easy to fall off a ledge while trying to dodge and reset the room. There's also a lot of random fights against enemies which come across as just grind, except there's almost no progression and thus very little to grind for.\n\nI was still trying to stick with it, though, until I hit the first boss, which has one part teleport around often enough to be very difficult to deal consistent damage to and the other part fly in the air immune to damage until the first part has been sufficiently damaged. Both times I attempted this boss, after several minutes of fighting I either died or fell off a ledge, resulting in its health being fully restored.\n\nSo, yeah. Enough of that. Not recommended, but maybe the designer's next game will be less awkward to play.\n\n(As noted, this is a review where I haven't completed the game. I got frustrated enough with it that I'm not going to try again, though. I'm not sure how far I got - the game mentions 450 encounters, and I certainly did what felt like at least 100, but also 10 bosses, and I gave up on the first one.)","timestamp_created":1551854623,"timestamp_updated":1551854623,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52645498514175415","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kcvvqOkCf6G0vAE="}
