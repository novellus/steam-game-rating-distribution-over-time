    review: "Yup, it should have been included in the base game but the amount of\
      \ different layouts that each track has is something that you probably won't\
      \ find anywhere else. Different layouts from different points in time, how cool\
      \ is that ? \n\nBesides, if you read the details on each track pack, in some\
      \ of them it is stated that a few more layouts will be added, and will be available\
      \ to people like us, who purchased it without any additional cost. \n\nIn short,\
      \ it is a great deal. Spa is yet to be released, and there will be another one\
      \ of those tracks coming ( Monza ?) + future layout updates/addition all without\
      \ any additional cost."
