It was a little repetitive, but still a lot of fun.  This dlc makes the game even better, by adding a lot of much needed variety to what you fight.  My only complaint would be that the rewards for some of the more difficult beasts just don't seem worth the risk, unless you are fighting them purely for the challenge.","timestamp_created":1543562815,"timestamp_updated":1609451931,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41/Cz3fYCcOaItAE="}
