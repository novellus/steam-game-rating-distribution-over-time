Each time the day repeats you will have found something new, which you can then exploit in the next cycle: either you have found a new item, learned the schedule of a new character, or gleaned crucial information about how to break the cycle. The game manages the difficult task of making gameplay compelling and even addictive without combat or XP or other video game tropes. I also appreciate the many quality-of-life features in the game that they maybe didn't need but are what elevate the gameplay: you get to keep items between cycles, there's a very helpful hint system which helps you along without making it too easy, and when you die the game often lets you restart just before that happens, without making you play it all out again.\n\nMy only gripe is possibly that the story doesn't neatly wrap up in the end. I would have liked to see a really cohesive ending that draws in all the story threads from the various endings. But all in all it's a small criticism. I strongly recommend this game!","timestamp_created":1608293850,"timestamp_updated":1608293850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuZPyuvYCfPyVuwI="}
