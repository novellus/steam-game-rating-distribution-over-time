A better tutorial is needed at the start of the game. And a crosshair should be implemented as its a game where you need to aim at the ball.\n\nGameplay: Can’t give a rating really about this it depends if you like the concept of the game or not but I enjoyed it :).\n\nAudience: Young and mature\n\nGraphics: Good for the money you pay. Similar to a website game but not really.\n\nPrice/Quality: Not really worth the price at the moment due to some small fixes and the game needs some more development in my opinion. Buy the game when its on sale on steam.\n\nBugs: Cursor is shown all the time when moving around which is really annoying. Instead, a crosshair should be implemented. for easier aiming.\n\nRequirements: Low-end PC\n\nDifficulty: Kind of hard if you haven’t learned where and how to aim to make the ball go the direction you want to.\n\nGame time/length: Endless, play until you get bored.\n\nPros/Cons: I will list that down below.\n\nImprovement: When you put the ball into the sockets you should be able to automatically teleport to the next socket. Or else you will get lost and don’t find where the next socket especially on “MAP 3”. Tutorials should be better implemented in the start instead of some small screens. Its easy to miss and hard to understand but otherwise the game is actually quite enjoyable but I wish there would be a multiplayer mode where you can play golf and maybe even be able to “shoot your friend”? to joke around as I feel it fits in good with the pistol that you use to launch the golf ball. A crosshair must be implemented as its a game where you need to aim at the ball.\nI like the concept of having those pictures of how the way looks to get to the socket. But it should be nice if it got implemented to all maps.\n\nOverall: Buy the game on sale, some development is needed. But the game is still enjoyable and fun to play. Has a good potential once its fixed!\n","timestamp_created":1562778908,"timestamp_updated":1562778908,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw1ra47usCc9qHzgE="}
