The only thing I wish they would change is incorporating Twilight Struggle's action round tabs instead of that awful log (it's better than nothing, I guess), and maybe adding an option to pause and confirm after every opponent play. The later would especially be useful to newer players who aren't familiar with all the cards, instead of having to go through the discard and removed to read the cards.\n\nAnother couple items if you're thinking of buying this:\n1. There aren't that many people playing this game right now, so don't expect to play a quick (45 mins) real-time match with randoms - there's no games in the lobby. I'm hoping this changes as more people buy the game.\n2. The only AI option at the moment is a bot that uses the cards' operations points, but doesn't trigger its opponent's event, so it's not like playing with actual rules. That being said, maybe it's because I'm new to the game, but because of this, I find it more challenging than the Twilight Struggle AI - which isn't saying much.\n\nSo yeah, almost no complaints. Solid Purchase. Good job Playdek!\n\nPS When are those COIN and Imperial Struggle games coming? :)","timestamp_created":1609480736,"timestamp_updated":1609480736,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52884066104888916","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw0OGh3vYCdoOovwI="}
