I really felt connection and emotion and I'm still glad kaori was my first pick. The jokes really hit, including a surprise appearance from a certain someone. These puns and the quality of this humor has me happily awaiting to play more from pixelfade. If you've played ace academy, play this, if you haven't.... what are you still doing here, go play ace academy and then play this as well.","timestamp_created":1609070041,"timestamp_updated":1609070041,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+oqD0vYCc8TcvQI="}
