    review: 'In this episode, you control Klaudia, Lila and Ryza.


      You have access to a lot of materials but only a few recipes. You have a starting
      equipment and you cannot make any better. You can gather and kill monsters as
      much as you want, but it''s useless.


      Only thing you have to do is gather a couple of specific materials, do a couple
      of recipes and done.


      The story is cute but it is too short.'
