Most areas are procedurally-generated (and very badly at that; i.e. some portions of the maps, especially the Viking maps, are impossible to reach, cutting the player off from potentially valuable loot), and all are small, square maps. It should be noted that some abilities (most notably summons) are broken, and can potentially crash the game (the aforementioned summons WILL, sooner or later). I did enjoy my time with it, but I eventually got bored of the same, boring things over and over again. Unless you're hard-up for an ARPG, or really tight on money, look elsewhere.","timestamp_created":1609166661,"timestamp_updated":1609166661,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42NTz1PYCd8GPvgI="}
