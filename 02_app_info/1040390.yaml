    review: I knew a little about the game, still, I am surprised by it, because it
      tells me "you are not done learning/deconstructing yourself!" Like, there are
      so many possitive things about human relationships that the game shows, that
      I hope everyone gets to experience that kind of kindness some time in their
      lives.
