I'm having an issue on WMR though with the control sticks being too sensitive. I'll tap left or right to change bars and doing so, my direction will change back more often than not. It is almost as if the control stick hits the opposite direction and switches me back when i let go of the stick.\n\nIt would be nice if dev could implement a \"move stick x amount before changing bars\" option.\n\nOther than that it is a fun little game.","timestamp_created":1576463076,"timestamp_updated":1576463076,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1576543611,"developer_response":"Oh no, that definitely shouldn't be happening.
