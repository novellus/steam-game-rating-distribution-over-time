    developer_response: "Thank you for the well thought-out review! One thing I wanted\
      \ to note is that the MCs personality IS actually meant to be different in every\
      \ route. She is an alternate reality version of herself, which is discussed\
      \ more in the Deluxe Edition. Also, whether it seemed like there was, there\
      \ is a rhyme and reason to the way the choices go. They are meant to match 3\
      \ different personality vibes of kind/diplomatic, sassy/humorous, and aggressive/direct.\
      \ In some routes, the MC doesn't deal with her mother situation from the prologue\
      \ as much (like Tatsuya, but rather focuses on the issues before her). In Takumi\
      \ and Hikaru's routes, the sorceress plot and the MCs past with her mother are\
      \ the focal points.\n\nIt was our first game (this team is no longer together),\
      \ and we had never written a visual novel before, so we were learning to adapt\
      \ our writing styles to that genre. It was a massive project with only three\
      \ people, and I was the sole one doing editing - there also were no beta testing,\
      \ so I was on my own. Rather than offer up an excuse for the parts you didn't\
      \ enjoy, I wanted to explain why it may have come across as amateurish - because\
      \ it was! \n\nHowever, 2 years of development and a ton of resources did go\
      \ into it, so I believe we did the best we could at the time. MDSOA was pretty\
      \ much the project that taught me everything I know (I'm the sole developer\
      \ remaining, now solo) and I'm grateful that most people were able to find some\
      \ joy in its potential, even if it wasn't fully realized the way it could have\
      \ been. If you liked its concept, then perhaps you'll be able to enjoy future\
      \ works in the universe now that I'm many more years experienced (although there\
      \ were two writers, my personal writing style in VNs has also drastically changed).\
      \ Cheers!"

    review: 'I was very torn about whether or not to recommend this game. On one hand,
      it''s very clear the studio put a lot of effort into it and I think they have
      a really great concept on their hands. The content is sizeable, the art is beautiful,
      and the music is great. On the other hand, those things alone do not make a
      quality game, and I found Mystic Destinies to be incredibly unpolished.


      First of all, each chapter of every single route in the game was peppered with
      errors! Sentences like, "I thought knew he felt that way," where you can tell
      it was originally written one way then was changed and just didn''t get edited
      properly. This happened so many times, it was absolutely ridiculous. A few mistakes
      here or there are expected, but their number of errors far surpassed the amount
      you would expect to find in a product you paid for.


      Second, the content didn''t feel edited. I don''t just mean structure mistakes,
      but the story itself. There were numerous moments when information was inserted
      into the plot when it shouldn''t have been (for example, the MC calling a character
      by their name before the MC had even learned their name) and moments when information
      was inserted at random and then unexplained. [spoiler]One of the most obvious
      moments was during Shou''s route when the MC recognizes Takumi but then never
      explains where she recognized him from. The moment just passes awkwardly. I
      reread it several times trying to see if I missed something but I hadn''t.[/spoiler]


      Third, the script was in desperate need of tightening up. I found it overly
      verbose to the point of being repetitive and boring, so that every time I started
      to get sucked in and interested, I got pulled right back out by long-winded
      internal monologues, time skips, and irrelevant information. On top of that,
      I really dislike having important information recalled by the MC when it should
      be something I experience with her, and that happens a lot.


      Fourth, the presentation started off really strong but then quickly lost momentum.
      I didn''t mind being confused at first because the MC herself was confused about
      what had happened to her, but then we got some time skips and I was still confused
      while the MC had apparently learned some stuff. I would''ve appreciated a longer
      prologue that fleshed out the game world and lore a little bit more so that
      I felt more on the same page as the MC. In a game where you aren''t limited
      by which route you can play first, it''s important to find that balance of information,
      and I don''t think MDSOA achieved that balance.


      A few other minor complaints:


      -I was really unimpressed with the MC. Her growth as a sorceress was really
      varied and largely underexplored. In most conflicts, she was pretty useless
      so that by the time she actually did something effective, I had a hard time
      believing it.

      -Some of the characters'' personalities lacked consistency at times, including
      the MC.

      -The endings were dependent upon player choices but there was no intuitive reason
      why option A, B, and C gave Z-ending. I remember going back through for achievements
      and was thinking, "What does this have to do with anything?"

      -The illusion of choice was, 90% of the time, an illusion. What you picked may
      get you a different ending, but it wouldn''t change anything at all about the
      actual story, which was really unsatisfying.

      -They just dismissed the prologue''s plot entirely and, in some routes, that
      felt very strange.

      -There were times when the art didn''t line up with the story.

      -This is just nitpicking, but it annoyed me: in a couple of the routes, nearly
      every scene where two or more people got together required drinks (often accompanied
      by snacks). In some places it felt natural, in others it was just weird filler
      text and it happened often enough to be noticeable.


      The game was so long-winded and had enough problem areas that I had a hard time
      investing myself in the characters and their stories. I spent nearly 60 hours
      getting through this game, and after about 20, I was ready to quit and only
      kept going because I was determined to get some answers (I had high hopes for
      the last route and, sadly, it disappointed me the most). I''ve played free games
      with more polish and a tighter story than this one. At the end of the day, I
      think MDSOA has a lot of potential to be an amazing game. It has so many things
      going for it but, to me, it just fails in the execution.'
