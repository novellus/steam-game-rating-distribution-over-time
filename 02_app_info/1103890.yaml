    review: If you're looking for a short horror game with compelling story this game
      may be for you. You also need to look past some of the frustrations (character
      moves too slowly, gets stuck on furniture easily, slow dialogue,  frustrations
      of the character you're playing (why would he take the memo but not read it
      right away)). I got the game 75% off and felt that was a fair price. I wouldn't
      pay full price for it.
