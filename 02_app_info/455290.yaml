    review: 'Some of my friends came over and we started playing.

      We played through every mode and it was such fun! Especially the soccer mode,
      we played that for hours.

      Also the sounds of this game are hilarious, like when you pass poison the little
      "die slowly" in the background.

      We really had a fun night and there definitely will be some more with Dashing
      Dinos! :)'
