    review: 'It''s a Very fun game with an alright story, but a LOT of bugs.

      I would recommend you get it if it interests you, but be aware that this is
      an unfinished project of a game.


      Tips for beginners:


      1)Turn off the music. There''s a bug in the game that makes all of the soundtracks
      play at once, it doesn''t sound too bad some times, but it''s not the most pleasant
      thing to listen to;


      2)In the safehouse go till the farest wall to the right and change your tie
      to blue for SPEEED (cuz health is for casuals and stealth is non-existent);


      3) NEVER get the Silenced Handgun, it does 0 Damage to dogs which can easily
      one-hit you.


      P.S.: you can crouch to not die to dogs instantly, but when you stand up you''ll
      die.


      Oh and when you buy something, you don''t get to keep it if you buy something
      else


      And most importantly of ALL: the ending is not satisfying at All and Dogs are
      terrifyingly OP'
