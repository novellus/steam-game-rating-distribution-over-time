    short_description: The Ryuusian Royal Cabal thought that the discovery and research
      of five new forms of magic would be the greatest undertaking of their lives.
      Unfortunately, they drastically underestimated the difficulties of love, mental
      health, family, and the occasional mad demigod.

    review: "An excellent sequel to Brilliant Shadows.\n\nGood stuff:\n[list]\n[*]\
      \ Great writing and character development.\n[*] Unique and interesting lore.\n\
      [*] Racial diversity, given that several dark-skinned characters have their\
      \ own goals and ambitions that don't revolve around white people.\n[*] Queer\
      \ representation, three different queer couples and a trans character.\n[*]\
      \ Choices greatly matter, with several different consequences and endings.\n\
      [*] Lovely artwork.\n[/list]\n\nBad stuff:\n[list]\n[*] Several typos.\n[*]\
      \ Despite the presence of a trans character, there were some instances of ciscentric\
      \ language and cissexism. \n[*] Incomplete gallery? (Some CGs aren't available\
      \ in the gallery)\n[*] Lack of compiled information for reference. With a story\
      \ like this that has so many unique terms and variables to keep track of, it'd\
      \ be nice to have an option in the menu for people to refresh their memory if\
      \ they've forgotten what something means.\n[/list]\n\nIt's definitely an excellent\
      \ visual novel despite its flaws. If you've read Brilliant Shadows, definitely\
      \ follow up with this!"
