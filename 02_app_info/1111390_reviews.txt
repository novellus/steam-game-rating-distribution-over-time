LISTEN. THIS GAME WAS AMAZING. IF YOU HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF STEINS GATE, STEINS GATE 0, AND EVEN CHAOS HEAD AND CHILD, YOU WILL LOVE ALL OF THE REFERENCES, CALL-BACKS ETC. I WAS GENUINELY SMILING FOR ABOUT 75% PERCENT OF THIS GAME. IT'S SO GOOD. IF YOU'RE A FAN OF THE SCIENCE ADVENTURE SERIES, THIS GAME IS BEYOND PERFECT. PLEASE PLAY. THANK YOU.\n\nEDIT: I AM SO GIDDY RIGHT NOW DUDE :))))))","timestamp_created":1609227514,"timestamp_updated":1609228415,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gZ7f1vYCfZmvvgI="}
