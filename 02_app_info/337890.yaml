    review: 'A short kinetic visual novel. For the current price (75% discount), totally
      worth it, for the full price, maybe not so much.


      So, this is an out-of-the-blue prequel to the previous Dysfunctional Systems
      VN (Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to manage chaos). Most of what it does is
      world-building.


      Since it is a kinetic VN, there is no branching, hence the replay value is nonexistent.


      Art is serviceable, but not great. Music is not annoying but not particularly
      memorable either. Writing is a little stilted compared to the first installment,
      but it''s fine for what it is (i.e. exposition dump). The philosophy it kind
      of tries to push is slightly annoying, but probably that''s the point [spoiler]since
      it gets subverted by the end.[/spoiler]


      Overall, this is at the same time encouraging and disappointing for the fans
      of the first installment. It''s a mediocre kinetic VN set in an interesting
      multiverse, but here we mostly get to see the boring parts.


      Overall, if you''re interested in anything I described, it''s a fine 1.5-2 hour
      read. But it''s not something you''d really want to read unless you''re somewhat
      invested in the first game in the series.


      This does make me hope that other (hopefully more interesting) installments
      will happen eventually, so I''ll give this a slightly begrudging thumbs up.'
