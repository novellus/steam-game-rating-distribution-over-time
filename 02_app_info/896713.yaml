      \ the TGV-R\xE9seau &amp; TGV-RDuplex make for a fantastic high-speed addition\

      \ \u201CAtlantique\u201D sets, which were built in the late 80s to serve the\
      \ LGV line sporting the same name, the TGV \u201CR\xE9seau\u201D was ordered\
      \ in the 1990s to bolster services on the entire SNCF\xAE LGV network. A total\
      \ of 90 were built as a mixture of dual and triple-voltage units and 80 entered\
      \ service with SNCF.<br><br>Each TGV R\xE9seau is capable of sitting over 377\
      \ people in original configuration, 352 people in R\xE9nov Lacroix across its\
      \ 8 sleek cars, and the combined effort of 2 power cars gives each set 11,800\
      \ horsepower, enabling them to easily reach 320 km/h in day-to-day service.\
      \ In order to increase capacity on certain journeys, the TGV R\xE9seau can couple\
      \ to other TGV sets, such as the TGV Duplex, TGV POS (Lyria), TGV 2N2, OUIGO\
      \ to provide extra seating. <br><br>When phase one of the LGV Est was nearing\
      \ the start of operation, it was decided that instead of ordering an entirely\
      \ new fleet, trains would be made up of existing traction. 19 TGV Duplex in\
      \ production and 19 TGV R\xE9seau sets were taken out of service, given each\
      \ other\u2019s coaches and modified as necessary. The result was the TGV POS,\
