I've apparently waste 12,99€ for having a DLC full of glitches and bugs. Really I'm serious.\n\nAt first, there is a lot of very basic things you can't do :\n-Change a political party's name (When you create a new party, the name is randomly generated by the game and you can't change it).\n-Create or modify a character (You can't create any character, like if you want to customize a president's face or something like that).\n-Change a national anthem.\n-Create new buildings.\n-Make natural disasters happen.\n\nAnd for the little things you can do, it is all horribly buggy :\n-If you create a political party for any nation, when you get to play your scenario, it will have the default name. Like if you decide remove the \"Republican Alliance\" from the american political parties, if you create another party with the same political ideology (Right centrism) it will be called \"Republican Alliance\", even if the generated name is different when you are modding your scenario. Everything you create or change will finally have the default game name when you play.\n\nIf you have 12,99€ (Or whatever your money is) DO NOT do the error I've made by buying this completly glitched DLC. I'm serious, you have to trust me. Buy another Geo-Political game that have a free included modding program like SuperPower 2.","timestamp_created":1443879053,"timestamp_updated":1443879053,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47Lz5ltACeZnrRQ=="}
