My expectations were very low for this but was thoroughly entertained. The hidden object sections were mostly easy but I did use the \"hint\" option a few times because certain items were too well hidden. Since English is not my native language I had to look up a few words I was unfamiliar with (like spanner and clef), which I consider a plus because I love adding new terms to my vocabulary.\nBesides the \"hidden object\" scenes there's several other logic minigames that I enjoyed and was challenged by more than I would have expected, even having to look up online the answer to one.\nA good casual option to kill some time and use your problem solving skills.","timestamp_created":1601001126,"timestamp_updated":1601001126,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh8/G4fQCcvzvowI="}
