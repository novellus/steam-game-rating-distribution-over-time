I use it as a way to show people VR as it is a very comfortable and a pleasantly stimulating experience.\n\nIf anyone else knows of other cool music experience in VR feel free to message me or reply here.\n\nThank you to Vivia for the amazing music. Much love.","timestamp_created":1608239871,"timestamp_updated":1608239871,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wZ6kufYCccmEuwI="}
