    review: "I am in love with this game! The mix of 2d, 3d and pixel art is one of\
      \ the most adorable visuals I have seen in a while :D\nThen there\xB4s the combination\
      \ of time management with budgeting plus juggling different recipes in the menu\
      \ and that adds to the difficulty that made me struggle for a bit before getting\
      \ the hang of it (but I\xB4m still almost always broke XD)! The price this game\
      \ is set at I\xB4d say is more than fair and my kudos to the people that put\
      \ together this charming game :)"
