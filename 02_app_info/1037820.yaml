    review: "I have been playing this game for hours.  It's a great game so far and\
      \ is entertaining. It is designed very well and keeps you moving forward and\
      \ focused. The game player\u2019s customization option is also a big plus, in\
      \ my opinion, this really is an enjoyable game to play. Especially, if you like\
      \ Japanese Ancient samurai strategy games.\n"
