    about_the_game: Sabreurs - A Noble Duel is a local 2-player fencing game about
      two noblemen settling their disagreement. Maybe someone insulted the other's
      mother, wronged their family or doubted their noble upbringings. But that doesn't
      matter - for it is time to settle this by a duel!<h2 class="bb_tag"></h2><img

      Search no more! Sabreurs offers you a chance to challenge your friend to a sabre
      duel - the game's moveset, and our inspiration comes from real life sabre fencing
      and historical fencing manuals. Use the right joystick to control your dominant
      hand's movements, and the triggers and shoulder buttons to cut and change your
      guard and attacking angle.<h2 class="bb_tag"></h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/921840/extras/Text_Divider05.png?t=1536940703"
