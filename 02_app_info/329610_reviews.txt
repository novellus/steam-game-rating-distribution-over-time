Baseball 15 when it came out. I ended up playing an entire season and quickly learned how to dominate the league into the post season. A few glitches occurred but in my experience, they were very rare. Glancing at other reviews, I must have been very lucky. This game doesn't have the modern presentation that you might expect, but it does offer the classic experience that I remember from my NES days. Revisiting this game today, I couldn't find someone to play with online. Instead, I played an exhibition game and won in just 4 innings 12-0, highlighted by a grand slam in the 3rd inning. It was cool but I also remember outplaying the AI a lot in the past too. Strangely, I did notice that my GPU ran much hotter in the main menu than during actual gameplay. As expected, the rosters are out of date and I am not sure if the newer versions of the game have changed much from this one. I am definitely one of the few who knew what they were getting into with this game and enjoyed it. If you can look past its shortcomings to appreciate a different breed of baseball video games, maybe you will too. Game on.","timestamp_created":1594052270,"timestamp_updated":1594052270,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw++q6kvMCfbOokwI="}
