      \ THIS GAME</h2>Playable in single-player or co-op, Wild Planet is a stylish\
      \ low poly open world survival game set on a tiny alien planet full of diverse\
      \ biomes. In the game you\u2019ll explore, hunt the indigenous giant alien bugs,\
      \ build outposts and craft weapons and equipment as you attempt to survive and\
      \ build a life for yourself in the hostile alien environment.<br><br><strong>Chill\
      \ COOP experience</strong><br>We want people to experience our game with their\
      \ friends, discover the world and work together to survive.<br><br><strong>Top\
      \ down view - environmental narration</strong><br>The top down view gives another\
      \ way of storytelling and environmental design.<br>The low poly art style works\
      \ also very well with a top down view and focus only on the most important part\
      \ in the environment.<br><br><strong>A colorful scifi atmosphere</strong><br>We\
      \ want to bring a chill, positive and colorful experience. Far away from the\
      \ usual dark scifi worlds. A friendly, calm, joyful experience on an alien planet.<br><br>we\
      \ have a unique non-linear storyline driven by dynamic events which will shape\
      \ your adventure.<br>The players will be confronted by unpredictable hand crafted\
      \ events driven which will uncover the different paths for the story and lead\
      \ them through in-game narratives using the strengths of the medium without\
      \ reliance on cut-scenes.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">WHERE IT COMES FROM</h2><br>We\
      \ created this game during the covid-19 because we wanted to escape ourselves\
      \ and stay busy.We decided to depict a colorful and relaxing universe where\
      \ everybody could just unwind during this weird period in the world.<br><br>We\
      \ are looking to present the story in a nonlinear setting, allowing the player\
      \ to set the pace, focus on details and fill the gaps with his imagination and\
      \ go back and look again at things that he thinks he missed to uncover everything\
      \ we wanted to tell.<br><br>Our artistic vision pushed us toward Low-poly and\
      \ to us it is an amazing way to create clarity through simplicity. For us the\
      \ low-poly style can be seen as a gaming equivalent to minimalism and as huge\
      \ fans of science fiction we wanted to focus on the fiction and merge the usual\
      \ complicated universe of scifi with the low poly minimalism to give another\
      \ perspective to the scifi genre.<br><br>We want to give players the freedom\
      \ to draw their way through the environment in any way they wish. If we do it\
      \ right, we can create in-game narratives using the strengths of the medium\
      \ without reliance on cut-scenes, dialogue, special effects, and user-interfaces.<br><br>If\
      \ we had to define the niche of our game on the shelf of a video-game store,\
      \ we\u2019d imagine our game being somewhere in between \u201Ca short hike\u201D\
