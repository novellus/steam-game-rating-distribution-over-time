    review: "I've only played the tutorial so far, but I'll be back for more, I don't\
      \ need to play more than that to give my opinion on this one. \n\nIt's a fairly\
      \ basic and straight forward puzzle game with catchy music and a somewhat unique\
      \ premise. Basically, it was Helltaker long before Helltaker... \n\n(don't take\
      \ that the wrong way, it's not at all like Helltaker in any other way but what\
      \ I said before)"
