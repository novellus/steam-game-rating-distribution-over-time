The story is so well written..\n\n((I cannot express how happy that made me, especially for the time the time the story takes place and English being different in those times.))\n\n..and though I do appreciate the additional voice of Lady Whitely, I found it to be not suited for the MC. I imagined her to sound far different from what she sounds in the game itself. \nRegardless of that voice option, I for the most part liked her character. Sure, her naivity or plain stupidity can get rather irritating, but what MC isn't an MC without either of those traits, even just a little bit. (Lot aren't, I am sure.)\n\nThat aside, I love the idea of mystery solving, and this game just did it for me in that aspect. I have to admit that I liked going through the mysteries and cases that were presented, more than I did going through the love interests' routes. As everyone seems to agree, the one character we adore just so happens to be the one that doesn't have a route.\n\nI do recommend this game, on sale if possible as I did. I will welcome a sequel if it ever comes to that, with open arms. I and others definitely need one.","timestamp_created":1609834005,"timestamp_updated":1609834005,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oLDl6PYCfZ3RwAI="}
