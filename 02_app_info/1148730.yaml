      \ will give you access to the download of the Prologue and all subsequent Volume\
      \ updates after this throughout 2020 will be free updates. We have no in-game\
      \ purchases, and this one-off cost will give you access to a potential 240+\

    review: I absolutely loved this game. It does so much. It brings vibrant, multidimensional
      personalities to life. It discusses the brutality of feudalism (unfortunately
      still relevant to today), while framing it from the perspective of a person
      brought up in it. There's a lot of worldbuilding lore here alongside character
      development, and I adore it. The queer/trans/nonbinary aspects of this game
      are delightfully made both an everyday part of the world, yet unique and worth
      noting all the same in ways that are say, interpersonally relevant while talking
      about the wider world (I really loved the possible dialogue between Roux and
      the PC in the forest on gender, connecting on shared experience). I absolutely
      adored the dialogue, and found the plot rather compelling, as it delves into
      questions of the transient nature of life, and what that means for the role
      of governance, and how we live with nature. I guess some things I wish for that
      might be a bit more work would be having two different flirt options if there
      is a bodily attraction component being invoked by one. As a demipanromantic
      person, it is very rare for me to experience attraction to a person for anything
      other than their personality, but something I will note for writing's sake as
      that, at least in my case, if that love is around long enough or strong enough,
      appreciation of the body grows too, but more as familiarity and the casing that
      holds the singularity of the person, and less as physical attraction. But, most
      of your flirt dialogue I used suited me just fine, and was very cute! (I also
      have to note that after seeing Livia's big muscles and her six-pack playing
      the Ambassador route, I was not at all surprised by her strength when she lifts
      the PC if you choose her as the romance option, but I get you were trying to
      say that the character is still surprised by her strength all the same. Maybe
      finding it comforting?) There were some grammar errors and technical bugs yes
      that I'm sure you're aware of, I look forward to seeing where this game goes!  This
      is easily one of my favorite videogames ever, wishing you all well during the
      pandemic
