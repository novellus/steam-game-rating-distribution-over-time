    about_the_game: <strong>Meadow Fun!! is a game mainly for kids (from 3 to 10)</strong>.
      It tells the story of the Meadow Fairies, which give a gifted kid the power
      to talk to animals and gather, with his magic net, lost and stray animals like
      frogs, squirrels, bunnies, butterflies, dragonflies, and saving creatures from
      danger, along 20 colorful and relaxing levels, 4 different game modes and 4
      bonus levels. <br>This game is ideal on Easy mode even for small kids (from
      3-4 years +), who will enjoy the soft style, the accurately designed level of
      difficulty (never frustrating or stressful), the fuzzy colors and the super
      easy controls. Hard mode, instead, makes Meadow Fun!! a time-based, fast pace
      game, where players will need fast reflexes and super accurate movements to
      finish every level. All set in a dreamy  environment, with a calm and charming
      original sound track. In story mode, players can count on Meadow Magic, which
      will make players go faster, freeze time, gather animals easier or fly up to
      avoid falling into water.<br>Gamepad, keyboard and mouse supported. Steam controller
      also supported (directly in game, not in the Steam Link menu). <br>Only for
      Windows

    review: 'Meadow Fun!! is a beautiful little game ideal for spending some time
      with your kids and having some fun. The musics are really emotional and the

      the bonus levels.

      I enjoied very much the hard mode, difficult even for me! :)

      Reccomended!'
