An update that never came, because as it turns out it's abandoned by the devs and hasn't been updated in 3 years. I decided to give it a try now and it's extremely lackluster.\n\n• The default button bindings for the Vive wands shows how old it is: you grab with the side grips rather than with the trigger. Thankfully you can change this.\n• There's a distinct lack of anti-aliasing despite every model being made out of a handful of triangles.\n• The game defaults to 3 players, making it clear that it was never planned to be enjoyed alone. I doubt it would be very fun sharing your headset every 3 minutes anyway...\n• Props often spawn outside the safe area, which makes it either impossible for me to interact with, or makes me risk knocking furniture around.\n• About half the minigames are reskins of others.\n• If you win the minigames during the screen transition, it makes validation sounds but it doesn't count as a win.\n• A lot of minigames rely on color-coding or remembering lists, which has no place in a game like this and makes certain minigames unbeatable if you're colorblind.\n• The game lacks personality. The music sounds like copyright-free stuff you grab as a placeholder. The \"great job!\" voiceline is grating and plays every 10 seconds. There are barely any sound effects, or the ones that are in don't sound good (popping a balloon makes a *thud* sound). The main menu has the pictures of the devs hung on the wall for you to look at, so you can put a face on the complaints you have after coming to the realisation that you bought an abandoned test game.\n\nPerhaps I should've tried the demo.
