That said, Second Death was the best $3 I ever spent.  The tutorial was a breeze, and the story mode is so well-envisioned, I didn't mind dying over and over to get more pieces of it.  If you like turn-based RPGs, this game is a great investment!","timestamp_created":1543264404,"timestamp_updated":1543264404,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwosDuqOcCcvHKswE="}
