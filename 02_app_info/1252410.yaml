    short_description: Alien Scumbags is a sci-fi action platformer with a big slice
      of horror and a stack of pop culture references. You'll run, hide and kill across
      several levels, collect items from capsule machines and unlock characters. No
      checkpoints, if you die it will cost you your score to continue.

    review: If you're looking for an Old school shooter RPG with tons of throwbacks,
      easter eggs, and replayablity, and pop culture references this is your game
      and for the price I'd argue can't be beat. Visuals are a throwback to Sega genesis
      days and the game does not hold back on hitting that nostalgia mark.
