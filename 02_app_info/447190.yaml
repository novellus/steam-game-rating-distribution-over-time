    review: "I agree with what another reviewer said about not going into this game\
      \ with super elevated expectations.  It is a basic, fairly sweet, occasionally\
      \ steamy VN. The love interests seem to be fleshed out a lot better than the\
      \ MC, which I suppose was deliberate on the part of the developers.  However,\
      \ I felt left wanting to know more about Shiori other than the fact she likes\
      \ to read, cook, and gets ridiculously over-the-top embarrassed at nudity and\
      \ sex talk, so much so that one would think she'd been a nun in a past life.\
      \  Part of me was unsure why all these urbane, accomplished men were so taken\
      \ by her other than the fact that she was a pretty young thing who happened\
      \ to show up at their sausage-fest bar one day. \n\nSo, while not overly compelling,\
      \ it was cute and a pretty enjoyable way to pass some time. I'd recommend picking\
      \ it up next time you see it on sale."
