I picked up the hero series after choice of robots buts its appeal can be repetitive after the third or so playthrough. \n\nThe branching in this series is okay, some things feel shoe-horned, especially if you had a good run from the game directly before this one. But most events you navigate through will have thresholds of effort you build upon, the game does not take kindly to the situational thinker who presents many behaviours, its bad for the press. Stick to lone wolf or team player, kind hero or ruthless hero and your fame/legend score will rise quickly.","timestamp_created":1601615285,"timestamp_updated":1601615285,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sLnt8/QCecOqpQI="}
