Not only is it a lovingly crafted tribute to the Dragon Quest series (specifically DQ 1 and 2, I feel) but it's a super fun and charming RPG in its own right. The combat is well balanced, you have a lot of tools to work with, and it's fast. My ideal JRPG combat is turn-based but still fast enough that it feels exciting, and this game nails it. You have the option to skip battles you're overleveled for by pressing a button right before the fight starts, and that's the way it's meant to be played. I skipped every optional battle and never felt underpowered or so overpowered that I didn't have to think about each encounter. It's a great mechanic, because players who would rather grind still can. It's the perfect length, about 8-10 hours to do everything. The game's full of fun surprises and rewards for exploring. I've seen complaints that the story is shallow, and sure, Brave Hero Yuusha Ex isn't literature (no video game is.) The quote-unquote \"story\" of a DQ game is always \"party of heroes goes out to slay ultimate evil threatening the world\", and BHYEx doesn't stray too far from this standard, but it has a couple fun twists on the usual formula, and a couple genuinely heartwarming moments. A DQ game is always about the little moments, the charming characters you meet, the weird goofy jokes, the small stories you play a part in. Sure, there's always the ultimate evil you have to slay to save the world, but it's a formality. It's really about discovering new places, making new friends, solving problems, and finding secrets. If that sounds like your jam, this game will be your jam.","timestamp_created":1603774589,"timestamp_updated":1603774589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hMWatPUCeOmwqgI="}
