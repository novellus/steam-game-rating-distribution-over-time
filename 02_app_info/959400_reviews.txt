I loved the narration, how the story of the game is presented to the player and the fact that it shows the controls in the screen.\n\nWhat I did not like:\n1. The story is linear - clearly that is not the main focus of the game.\n2. The damage of the weapons is the same - there is no great reason to use a large and slow weapon if I can use a weapon with a similar size \nand faster and causes the same damage.\n3. Enemies are limited to only combos, making attacks privisible.\n\nIn terms of bugs, I did not experience anything that would ruin my experience, - \nI fell once or twice inside the map, that's all.\n\nWhat I recommend:\nAdd blood to creatures and dismemberment too;\nAdding collisions to weapons, for example when a weapon hits an object it returns;\nAdd normal attacks to enemies, not just combos;\nAll weapons in the game do the same damage. Increasing damage on heavy or larger weapons would be a good idea;\nMore characters to play with - not just a king, but a wizart or knight or spearman, would be funny;\nAdd fall damage.\n\nConclusion:\nI had a lot of fun playing Save Thine Kingdom!\nHonestly, I think it's worth the money and if the little negatives are adjusted, the game will be much better.\nI recommend give it a try!\n","timestamp_created":1552236700,"timestamp_updated":1552236700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwloyhtOkCdvjivAE="}
