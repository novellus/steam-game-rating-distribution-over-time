It's functional but unpolished. It delivers action but not without headache. As I can be a bit obsessive and nit picky I'll try to be summary in my critiques.\n\n+ Character Stat Customization (Decent balance of upgrade ability and still fun in beginning)\n+ Weapons That Actually Feel Different (melee and range have multiple types)\n+ Functionally Sound (Menus, Saving, Loading, Player Prefs, etc)\n+ Level Design (Good mix of maze like passages without overly complicated routes)\n+ Tuned Difficulty (Fits several play styles as resources and combat can be altered)\n+ Voice Acting (The female supporting character is well voiced)\n+ Music and Ambiance (Audio fades in and out well as music and vocals transition)\n\n- Multiple Spelling Errors (in game world signage, dialogues, and player menus)\n- Character Movement (click = walk, double click = run, but doesn't always work)\n- Character Interaction (clicking on objects is sometimes difficult)\n- Visually Challenging (hard to see some of the smaller pickups especially on lower graphics)\n- Lacking Options (can't disable screen shake, can't use controller, can't use or bind keys)\n- Audio FX (The sounds play fine but don't always fit well if that makes sense)\n- Nav Mesh Jankiness (Sometimes character movement is all over the place)\n- Voice Acting Again (The male lead voice sounds like it was recorded with a potato lol)\n- Inconsistent Art (Challenge with store assets is getting them to feel like they go together)\n\nOverall, Remnants of the Dawn is worth the asking price. It's short and sweet, alluring, a bit janky here and there, and reminiscent of older top down dungeon crawlers.","timestamp_created":1603331720,"timestamp_updated":1603332364,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7sqDp/UCeMusqQI="}
