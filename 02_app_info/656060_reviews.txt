Perfect for when you're in between matches or if you need something to unwind yourself after a long session of gaming. Very very afffordable game and for the price, it's made decently well. The sound track in this game is phenominal. It's able to tie everything together to make the game more relaxing and enjoyable. the controls take a bit to get used to but after ten minites of playing, you'll get the hang of it.","timestamp_created":1530027868,"timestamp_updated":1530027868,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458370238542556763","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9o+xnuQCebGnpAE="}
