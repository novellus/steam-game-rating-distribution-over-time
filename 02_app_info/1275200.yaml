      \ needing to lie down afterwards? Well, we\u2019ve got some good news for you.<br>We\
      \ built STRAYLIGHT around the Fling Engine, a new way to move in Virtual Reality\

      \ you say, a rare few experience discomfort in Virtual Reality no matter what\
      \ kind of game it is! Well, yes, unfortunately, that is true. But hundreds and\
      \ hundreds of people who have <i>never experienced</i> VR before have not only\
      \ played STRAYLIGHT without any discomfort, but they had <i>tons of fun</i>\
      \ doing it. It\u2019s true!<br>In STRAYLIGHT, you can fling yourself around\
      \ like a crazed space monkey, and it won\u2019t make your favorite aunt feel\

      \ goal in STRAYLIGHT is simple: Get to the end. But to do that, you\u2019re\
      \ going to have to <i>fly</i>. You\u2019re going to have to dodge and swing\
      \ and soar, avoiding deadly obstacles by the most razor-thin margins. You\u2019\
      re going to have to react faster than you can think, finding your own pathway\
      \ through these beautiful--and dangerous--cosmic playgrounds. <br>STRAYLIGHT\
      \ is all about the flow, all about mastering the Fling Engine to become an unstoppable\
      \ parkour space ninja; all about nailing that perfect run and making it through\
      \ the level without dying once. It\u2019s about swinging around a deadly crystal\
      \ ball just in time to barely avoid a deadly spinning crystal ring, and crowing\
      \ in triumph. It\u2019s also about dying, over and over and over again, until\
      \ you become transcendent. It\u2019s about telling those who say you can\u2019\
      t move around in Virtual Reality \u2018Oh yeah? Watch <i>this</i>.\u2019<br><br><img\

      \ meant to evoke the best feelings and gameplay of old-school platforming games\
      \ (which we love) but evolved for Virtual Reality. Get to the end, collect the\
      \ cubes, time that perfect jump and avoid death by milliseconds; the spirit\
