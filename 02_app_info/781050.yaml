    review: I honestly really enjoyed this game. As someone who hasn't played any
      games like this (I've watched people play them), it really helped me understand
      the mechanics. I think that if this game was fleshed out more (more clues before
      going in the building, more notes, more spaces, opening locked doors, etc) it
      would add to the suspense and pull you into the story more. All-in-all, a decent
      little walking simulator.
