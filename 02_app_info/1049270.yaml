    review: "[h1] The Pros [/h1]\n\nRewards players for being stealthy and deceptive.\
      \ It's been a while since I've hid my controller from my friends so they can't\
      \ see when I press the buttons.\n\n5 fast and fun minigames.\n[list]\n   [*]\
      \ Hackers: Each player must compete to control a number of computers to open\
      \ their escape.\n   [*] Cops & Rats: Convict players try to destroy a number\
      \ of cameras before escaping while the cop(s) try to shoot them. There are clone\
      \ AI convicts so that the cop(s) will have to pay attention and guess which\
      \ prisoner is the player(s).\n   [*] Gang Wars: Each player must control slums\
      \ to spawn AI gang members that attack the other player(s) and their gangs.\
      \ Last player alive wins.\n   [*] Prison Break: AI convicts and player convicts\
      \ are lined up in a \"Simon Says\" fashion and must reach the end before other\
      \ players shoot them.\n   [*] Watch Towers: Same as Gang Wars, but no one is\
      \ allowed to directly fight each other, and the slums are sniper towers which\
      \ aim randomly. Players can control towers and control when they fire to kill\
      \ other players and their gang members.\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1] The Cons [/h1]\n\n\
      At first the game can be a little confusing as to what you're suppose to do\
      \ for each minigame. Although this doesn't affect experienced players, it can\
      \ be a small issue when getting started.\n\nThe game is quite simple, but I\
      \ wouldn't necessarily call that a con, just something to keep in mind before\
      \ you buy the game.\n\n\n[h1] The Bugs [/h1]\n\nThe first bug being that many\
      \ of the settings that you can adjust for each of the minigames are bugged.\
      \ The settings for the minigame \"gang wars\" worked properly (for example AI\
      \ convict numbers, convict speed, slum spawn/capture delays), but the minigame\
      \ settings for the other four minigames all are titled: \"AI convicts\", and\
      \ sometimes the number showing you the amount didn't change at all when adjusted,\
      \ leading to an annoying experience of adjusting the settings without knowing\
      \ what will happen, and then testing the minigame to see what changed. It is\
      \ such a simple-to-fix bug, but it breaks a fun part about the game.\n\n\n[h1]\
      \ Last Thoughts [/h1]\n\n[b] This game has a lot of potential [/b]\nBut until\
      \ they change these small bugs, I must not recommend this game. I hope the company\
      \ develops this game more because I would be more than happy to adjust the minigames\
      \ and play new minigames that they may come out with."
