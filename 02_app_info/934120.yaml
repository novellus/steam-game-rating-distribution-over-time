    review: I bought this thinking I was getting a Monkey Island homage. Instead I
      got a mishmash of assorted references, fourth wall jokes, and unintuitive puzzles.
      Then towards the end the game forced me to complete a Sudoku puzzle (I hate
      Sudoku) which I had to use an online Sudoku solver to get past just to finish
      the game.
