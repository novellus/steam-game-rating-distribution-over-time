A weird Lv. 1 that hits randomly in a diamond shape, an instant death Lv. 2, a Lv. 3 where she actually can steal enemy items which might help with grinding, and a seriously strong Lv. 4 where she summons a Mecha Rabbit that pretty much is an invincible tank that aggros everything in sight. I personally think she's one of the coolest DLC characters next to Utsuho and Sakuya, even though she's not very popular in the fandom.\n\nShe can handle weapons with the Splash seal without damaging herself. Since most weapons with the Splash seal are guns, it makes sense considering her military background.\n\n[spoiler]She also can naturally negate Watatsuki no Toyohime's instant death fan attack. Why would she wanna annihilate her own pet bunny?[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1556951772,"timestamp_updated":1556951772,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.577464818954467773","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwttXjwOoCdZLCwAE="}
