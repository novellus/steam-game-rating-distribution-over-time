I've been a fan of the F4F since Combat Flight Simulator 2. The F4F was a huge game changer for the US in WWII, and getting to fly a model of it, is pretty rad. Some people claimed it's slow, but, only in comparison to later WWII planes. This bird replaced the Brewster Buffalo (a really slow plane) on a sort of \"get it done now!\" status at the beginning of the Pacific Theatre. The US seriously needed something to at least go toe-to-toe with the Zero, and this was it, just barely. So, for an early 40's plane, this thing is great. It was phased out, for the US at least, when the F6F was introduced around 1943.\n\nIt dives really well, it's playful in the air, rolls great, and is super easy to land. If you're practicing carrier landings, this is your bird.\n\nGet it on sale and you wont be disappointed.","timestamp_created":1572397621,"timestamp_updated":1572397621,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48POMje4Ce7Wb1QE="}
