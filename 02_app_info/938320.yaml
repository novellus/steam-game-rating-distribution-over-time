    review: 'This game tries to be a great RTS title but fails basically on every
      aspect.


      The tutorial is of pretty bad quality, the voice acting tries to invoke nostalgia
      of better games. There''s no visual feedback if a villager is gathering or not.
      Generally there are not enough animations in the game to tell me what''s happening.
      It feels like an Early Access title even though it isn''t, Maps are extremely
      small too. The graphics are functional but not pretty.

      There''s no skirmish as far as I can see. Just some kind of wave mode.


      Just play some better RTS titles which are on the market now like the Age of
      Empires franchise. Age of Empires 4 will come soon enough ;)'
