    review: 'If you don''t like getting rolled by RNG you REALLY wont like this game
      having fun with it but a large % of runs are literally unwinnable due to the
      trash characters it rolls for you which makes you spend a lot of time rerolling
      runs until you get a character that''s even usable ie has more than 4hp and
      can do more than 1 damage by having stats that are relevant to their skills
      which is very uncommon. Rolling random skills for new characters is weird why
      on earth would a god tier mage start with 2 physical moves? This wouldn''t be
      as frustrating if there was a way to forget or replace old skill but no you
      are just limited to 4. The gameplay is really fun and it''s pretty satisfying
      my only real qualm is how long it can take to find a run that''s actually playable.


      This DLC should be in the base game there pretty much isn''t a base game without
      it.'
