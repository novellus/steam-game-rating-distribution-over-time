    review: "Un piccolo capolavoro, secondo me.\nthe dope game \xE8 , concedetemi\
      \ il termine, un \"gestionale arcade\".\nLo definisco cosi perche nonostante\
      \ appunto sia un gestionale, le meccaniche sono assolutamente fluide  e dinamiche,\
      \ godibili anche per chi, come me, non \xE8 proprio un estimatore del genere.\n\
      Il gioco, come facilmente intuibile, consiste nel farsi strada \"nella strada\"\
      . Partirete, grazie ad un piccolo prestito da parte di uno strozzino, nella\
      \ vostra carriera di spacciatore, incontrando tutte le difficolta ed imprevisti\
      \ del caso.\nLe modalita sono due. In quella \"storia\" si possono man mano\
      \ sbloccare i tempo di durata sempre piu lunghi, poi c'\xE8 la classica sopravvivenza.\n\
      Non c'\xE8 la traduzione in Italiano, ma si puo scegliere tra la realistica\
      \ ed una divertente (?) SFW, nella quale il fumo diventer\xE0 liquirizia, l\
      \ ecstasy caramelle e via dicendo...\nNon ha, a mio parere, una grande longevita,\
      \ il gioco \xE8 piuttosto ripetitivo, ma se \"l argomento\" vi solletica, sapra\
      \ tenervi impegnati per un bel po di ore.\nPer il prezzo che ha, straconsigliato!\n\
      7/10"
