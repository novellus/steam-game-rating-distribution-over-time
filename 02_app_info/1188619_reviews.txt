You have a starting equipment and you cannot make any better. You can gather and kill monsters as much as you want, but it's useless.\n\nOnly thing you have to do is gather a couple of specific materials, do a couple of recipes and done.\n\nThe story is cute but it is too short.","timestamp_created":1607471059,"timestamp_updated":1607471059,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g7qvovYCc/GkuAI="}
