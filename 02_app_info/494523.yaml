    review: "I fly a SportCruiser in the real world. I purchased this model to practice\
      \ some operations at home, and works OK. \nI miss some extra configuration,\
      \ as the possibility to choose the instrument panel type (for example in the\
      \ real world I saw some SportCruisers whose airspeed indicator shows mph (statute\
      \ miles instead of nautical miles), but this is not so relevant.\n\nThe model\
      \ is OK and the instruments work fine."
