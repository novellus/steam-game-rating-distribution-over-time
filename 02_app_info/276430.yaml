    review: "It's certainly better than the first one, but that's not really saying\
      \ much. For an early 2000s animal sim game I'd give it 3/5 stars, as I didn't\
      \ not enjoy playing it.\n\nPros:\nVariety of Animals - Horses, dogs, cats, budgies,\
      \ rabbits, guinea pigs, and fish \nVariety of Breeds - There are 3-8 breeds\
      \ of every species available, and they seem pretty evenly balanced\nExtra Challenge\
      \ - Each mission has two optional challenge objectives, the completion of which\
      \ will allow you to upgrade the visual appeal of the hotel grounds\nCharacter\
      \ Customization - You can change certain aspects of your avatar's appearance,\
      \ this was not possible in the first game\nRunning - Your avatar is allowed\
      \ to run, an improvement from the first one\nPlaytime - Took me about 50 hours\
      \ to fully complete the game\nSale Price - Get it on sale with the familyplay\
      \ bundle and it will cost you about $1.50\n\nCons:\nClothes - Early 2000s fashion\
      \ went out of style for a reason\nSpeed - There's still no way to speed up time,\
      \ this can make the first couple of missions drag, but once there are three\
      \ or more different species there at once it picks up\nNormal Price - I honestly\
      \ don't know if the asking price of $15 is a moral travesty, or a practical\
      \ joke\n"
