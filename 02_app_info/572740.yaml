    review: Secret of Shadow Ranch was the first HUD overall in the series. Trying
      to find out what to do next is much easier now because of the addition of the
      on-character checklist to keep yourself on track with tasks. The cell phone
      with internet on-character is much easier to research puzzles to find solutions.
      I would say a negative about this one is that a lot of it is translation puzzles
      which I am not a big of fan of as well as the magnet puzzle is one of the most
      annoying puzzles I have ever done. Play it and find out what I mean.
