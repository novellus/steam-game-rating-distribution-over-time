SGB is new if you didn't know and has very little assets to begine with.\nThat being said the DLC is a little bundle of relief the assets are of quality and worth it becouse you get alot more materials to work with when creating your game.\n\nPros- More assets and terrain to work with in your SGB project which is a releif\n      Quality assets you can tell they really tolk some time and effert into puting the \n      DLC together.\nCons- Only one vehical design for the cars the other car models are just painted diffrent\n      No 2D graphics for the 8 modern character models.\n      \n","timestamp_created":1473985542,"timestamp_updated":1473985542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw986YmNcCdNGsYQ=="}
