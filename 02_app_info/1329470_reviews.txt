It isn't just 4:3, but the powerup buttons are obtrusively above the picture. Seems like a several years old engine. Do you like screenshotting? Well, you need to clear away the powerup buttons even with 45+ seconds left.\n(-) You must drag the pieces. Fixed years ago.\n(+) If you are just casual and ignore stars and powerups, it's usually nice.\n(-) The first worlds are rather simple, then by the 5th you regularly need 10 hints to get going, earned in twice as many completed levels. Or is it just bad RNG? Shouldn't be. So you practice the same puzzle 5-10 times, farm some cash and memorise the layout, then when it seems nice, you start spending. Alternatively, use a second screen with a screenshot. Or just replay the entire game 3-4 times.\n\n... By the way, the text on this store page is for a different game by the same publisher.","timestamp_created":1609515575,"timestamp_updated":1609869202,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpdLr6fYCcpa3vwI="}
