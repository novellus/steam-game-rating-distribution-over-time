No Competionist trophy.\n\nSide note: I had to replay random levels about 7 times until the last two blocks appeared since they're luck based.\n\nThe 'Germinator Destruction Gold' trophy works but it was a biiiiitch to get it since the pills are random and germs movement are random, as well, cu.\n(I you miss more than three shots, quit the run.)\n\n((You can unlock the germ game by clicking the Otori poster at the beginning of level 5, 6, or 7 (I can't remember) since it zooms in on the dang thing at the end of one of these levels.))\n\nOther than garbage trophies that made me spend wayyyyy too much time on this... \n\nissa solid game. Can't wait for the sequel.","timestamp_created":1551351489,"timestamp_updated":1595917223,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xYiFyvMCd9z8uwE="}
