      \ your relationship with your family is strained by the shock. You cannot recall\
      \ what happened exactly on that night\u2026 What events terrified you so much\
      \ that your mind just snapped and drew a curtain of oblivion over them? You\
      \ are convinced that you have to face your memories and fears to overcome them.\
      \ You then heard of a psychiatrist who claims to bring back memories through\
      \ hypnosis, so you booked a consultation with him. Now, you are going to relive\

    review: "GENIAL EXPERIENCIA VR;LO PRIMERO AGRADECER AL DESARROLLADOR LA OPCION\
      \ DE PODER CONFIGURAR BRILLO Y GAMMA COMO UNO QUIERA,ASI HE PODIDO DISFRUTAR\
      \ DE ZONAS OSCURAS MAS NEGRAS Y MENOS GRISES CON RIFT S,LA DURACION UNAS 5 HORILLAS\
      \ QUE NO ESTAN MAL PARA ESTE TIPO DE JUEGOS,EL TRATO DE UNREAL ENGINE ES GENIAL\
      \ Y GRAFICAMENTE LO APROVECHA MUY BIEN,SOLO FALTAN POR PULIR ALGUNAS PEQUE\xD1\
      AS COSAS;COMO LA TORPEZA DEL PERSONAJE AL AGARRAR OBJETOS Y LO COMPLICADO QUE\
      \ ES SEGUIR EL MAPA;PERO EN GENERAL DREAMBACK ES UN GRAB JUEGO Y UNA GRATA EXPERIENCIA\
      \ EN REALIDAD VIRTUAL."
