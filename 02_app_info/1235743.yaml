    review: "Honestly, this pack offers about as much as any of the $40 expansion\
      \ packs. I would always recommend buying all the Sims 4 DLC when they're on\
      \ sale, but if you're thinking of buying any of them, I would highly suggest\
      \ this one for starters. This pack offers a new neighborhood, an entirely new\
      \ way to play, crazy powers and perks, the entire game is changed as a vampire.\
      \ I found that this pack goes especially well with City Living, because living\
      \ in an apartment allows your vampire sim to nearly avoid sunlight, which is\
      \ very important at the start. As you progress, you can basically become a god\
      \ among sims. \n\nHighly recommend!"
