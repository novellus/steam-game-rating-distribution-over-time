High risk, high reward!<br><\/li><li><strong>Farm mysterious plants<\/strong> -  Find unusual seeds on distant planets and nurture them in your farm until they’re ready to be harvested. Take good care of them though, or they might escape...<br><\/li><li><strong>Craft machines and gadgets<\/strong> - Collect all sorts of useful junk floating around in space and put together to build machines that will make your food faster and your life easier.<br><\/li><li><strong>Mine yourself rich<\/strong> - Using your nifty drill and various dangerous devices, discover valuable resources needed to build that giant thruster grill you’ve always dreamed of.

Some will help you, some will need your help, but all of them have one thing in common. They need food!<br><\/li><li><strong>Keep track of time<\/strong> - Each planet has its own day and night cycle. Certain creatures and plants are only accessible at certain times of the day.
