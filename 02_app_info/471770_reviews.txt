Whats left in the game is a little bit of fighting and it becomes more of a scavenger hunt to find the enemies you missed. This game would have been fun and cute if it wasn't abandoned. We need more non human games like this to be popular and fine-tuned. I wonder why this game didn't catch on to where they just pulled the plug.","timestamp_created":1487656298,"timestamp_updated":1487656298,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519388556480407715","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4bTOr9oCeojccg=="}
