Click click click. Three minutes of clicking text before I got my first choice. How did I ever get 7 hours out of this boring dating sim/time management game? Another dating sim with Anime girls set in a school. Another visual novel with endless minutes of boring reading before you get to make a choice. The time management involves far too much effort, though I found it fun. Skip this unless you like reading school girl dating romances for middle school morons. Will be buried at the bottom of my virtual bookshelf.","timestamp_created":1609245737,"timestamp_updated":1609245737,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gqih1/YCdoS3vgI="}
