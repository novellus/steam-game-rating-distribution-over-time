    about_the_game: <strong>June, 1983. </strong><br><br>The summer heat has arrived
      earlier than it does most years. <br>By day there are cicadas, and by night,
      the higurashi.<br><br>Hinamizawa, a small village in the Japanese countryside.
      <br>While there are fewer than two thousand people there, every year, 'something'
      happens.<br><br>For the past 4 years, someone has died, and someone else has
      gone missing. <br>This series of deaths and disappearances is connected to the
      local resistance against a now-abandoned dam construction project. <br>A murder
      during the construction, covered up by the local authorities, is being re-enacted
      year after year. <br>Is it a conspiracy? A coincidence? Or perhaps a curse?<br><br>Someone
      who was supposed to be there... isn't. <br>Someone who wasn't supposed to be
      there... is.<br><br>Someone who was alive last night is now dead, and someone
      who is here right now isn't alive.<br><br>There is no way to avert this tragedy.
      There is no choice but to give up trying. <br><br>But even so... <i>please don't
