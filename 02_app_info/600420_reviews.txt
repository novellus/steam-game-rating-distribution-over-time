It is simple to play and opens up at a good gradual pace, introducing new complexities only as you master the previous features presented to you. \n\nI like the aesthetic design, and the way that the characters are portrayed, since it stimulates an archetypical expectation while also reinforcing the fact that it is a video game where you're meant to have fun, meaning that doesn't take itself too seriously.\n\nWhat it is kind of lacking is replayability, after completing all the missions and having \"won\" in freeplay mode, there isn't really anymore to explore, except from completing the game on the hardest difficulty, which I'm not the type of person that cares about.  For a $6 game, I wouldn't expect any replay ability either, and for $6 dollars I don't expect the replayability to be there, like I would with a $200 title, e.g. Europa Universalis IV with DLCs.\n\nTechnical stuff:\n\n- I played it on Windows 10 without any issues, at my native resolution. However, the game automatically down-scales, but I did not find that disturbing to my experience, and the game probably looks best at it's intended resolution.\n\n- Scrolling around the map by using the mouse at the screen edges is very fast, had to click on the mini-map or use the arrow-keys.\n\n- The steam overlay doesn't work in the game at all.","timestamp_created":1609967992,"timestamp_updated":1609969902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm+Tr7PYCc8COwQI="}
