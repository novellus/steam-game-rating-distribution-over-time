Don't get lure by the graphic here, the game lacks on serious development or the developer has given up on improving the game with a last release that doesn't match their promotional materials:\n- Bad control with no actual game controller support (Unity has the functionality right out of the box to support a gamepad...)\n- Game starts with the most basic weapon (a shovel) without the possibility of upgrading before an unbeatable section. It looks like you have to trade your weapons and not finding them along the way (or collecting them from dead enemies...).\n- So far world interactions are limited to collecting health by opening box. I haven't figured out how to use the vehicle from that section with gazillion of enemies you have to kill with a shovel.  Check options and using E for interaction doesn't do squat. \n- Music is sort of horrible\n- They have implemented a store to actually purchase crap to customize your character... \n- The developer website seems to be dying indicating that they no longer exist and that game is no longer supported... \n\nI'm going for a refund...","timestamp_created":1608691093,"timestamp_updated":1608691093,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44MHdxvYCdtOqvAI="}
