I've enjoyed the overall presentation and battle system so far, but it overall feels sort of less consequential than their previous game, which is weird considering as that was so slight graphically and mechanically.\n\nIt's less clever than their other work, which means it's more of a run of the mill RPG Maker experience with some interesting mechanical flairs. I'd recommend, but less enthusiastically than 8-Bit Adventures.","timestamp_created":1593033517,"timestamp_updated":1593033517,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/MyM9PICdLb6jwI="}
