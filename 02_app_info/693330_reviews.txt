Also, I updated review now that it is free to play. [/h1]\n\n[i] Note: only issue on the Oculus that I experienced was that the button mapping wasn't exactly correct. You click on the left joystick to warp the ball to you. Then after throwing the ball (press left trigger and let go with arm movement) you have to to click down the right hand controller joystick to move in that direction. To get to menu, you press Y button. [/i]\n\nThis is a very simple looking game with a strange movement mechanic at the start of the game. You have to throw a ball and then you'll move in the direction you threw it. You can warp the ball back to your hand to change direction or catch and throw the ball again to increase speed. On the second level, you can pick up the ball and throw again to gain acceleration. On the third level, you simply shoot at the white cubes and you'll teleport to them. On another level, you lose your ball and must rely on shooting the white cubes and momentum to traverse the level. \n\nYour enemies are geometric shapes that shoot at you. You have to shoot them down and also shoot or avoid the bullets they are shooting at you. There's several levels and some kind of convoluted story thrown in bits and pieces. You can pickup health potions along the way. There's also some levels where you have to find keys. And there are also boss fights thrown in. There is a checkpoint system where you spawn near the yellow cubes. Once you clear a level, the next level will appear for you to be able to get to, acting as a save system.\n\nIf enemies detect you, within proximity range, they can start shooting at you. They can also shoot through walls. So you do have to be strategic in your approach to blind corners. And you have to find ways to quickly change course to avoid heavy damage and to get clear line of sights to the enemy. It is not unusual to not have a direct line of fire to the enemies, so you're moving not just to avoid damage but to cause damage as well.\n\nI got it on sale for $.99 cents. It's definitely different than anything else I've played in VR so I think it's worth .99 cents for that reason alone. In fact, after playing around the game some more it had a lot more depth to the gameplay and is different than most shooters so it was a hidden gem and easily worth more than a buck. It does not have the best graphics or sounds, but the gameplay is solid and challenging. And I had fun. Beating the boss on that second level for the first time felt very satisfying.\n\nNew Rating 7.5/10. One of the better free to play VR games. Thank you dev for making this free to play and great job!","timestamp_created":1522113711,"timestamp_updated":1522995554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488814949989318848","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7fzmzOICctTXnAE="}
