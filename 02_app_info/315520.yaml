    review: "How is the Super Win the Game Soundtrack?\n\nTechnical details:\nFormat:\
      \ MP3, 128 kbps\nNumber of tracks: 18\nTotal size: 22 MB\nTotal length: 0:23:56\
      \ hours (~24 Minutes)\n\nThe soundtrack offers chiptune-styled music, fitting\
      \ to the theme of the game.\nUnfortunately by the tracks being relatively short,\
      \ the (perceived) repetition inside the tracks gives a feeling of getting even\
      \ less unique music than expected. That aside, the variety of genres is fitting\
      \ for a video game, but fails to set new accents.\n\nThe happiness of the third\
      \ track \"The Lamplight Proclamation\" is carried over to the fourth track \"\
      The Mushroom Jam\", which sounds dark and happy at the same time, but not crazy\
      \ enough to really remind of the other mushrooms.\nTrack 5, \"Old Haunts\",\
      \ uses a musical principle that was used in the infamous Track 4 from the Tropico\
      \ 4 soundtrack: Repeating the same thing and then repeating it with a changed\
      \ note. Unfortunately here it does not get quite that pop feeling, but could\
      \ have been a great track with more variety. Please compare for yourself:\n\
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruxmkh6FQsE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wiiSjb5lhI\n\
      Track 7, \"Old White\", uses the same musical scheme again. If J. Kyle Pittman\
      \ was inspired by the Tropico track above, he did a nice hommage without actually\
      \ copying it. If not, a good choice to use that kind of scheme.\n\nTrack 9 must\
      \ be the highlight of the album: \"Subterranea\" is good chiptune pop, reminding\
      \ of techno/trance music. Unfortunately, again, the length of the track cuts\
      \ the enjoyment short.\nTrack 10 is \"Growing Up\" that reminds me actually\
      \ of punk music \xE1 la Green Day, but only lasts for half a minute.\n\n\"Arc\
      \ Evil\" follows which spreads a dark mood indeed, giving me even goosebumps,\
      \ while still not being a memorable melody. This also sets the tune for the\
      \ coming track which is in a darker mood: \"Pity Wings\". Unfortunately \"Bored\
      \ and Bled\" has a dark name, but sounds too happy for its name. It is no surprise\
      \ then that \"The Razor's Edge\" is also happy, sounding like a ballad without\
      \ a singer.\n\nTrack 15, \"The Hollow Heard\", is mistuned while poppy - fitting\
      \ to the place in the game where it occurs, but partially unpleasant to hear\
      \ on its own. Track 17, \"Hall of Speedruns\", delves into rock music, but is\
      \ over too fast. The final track just delivers normal poppy music once more,\
      \ like the other three not mentioned tracks (1, 2 and 16), although all in different\
      \ styles.\n\nWhat remains is a fleeting glimpse, like a box of chocolates.\n\
      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0acEl97ZBME\n\nIt is pleasant but the enjoyment\
      \ is too fleeting, too few. The soundtrack is by no means bad, it is enjoyable\
      \ in parts, but as a separate DLC I can really only recommend it to hardcore\
      \ chiptune fans. All others will get enough out of it from hearing it ingame.\n\
      \nUnfortunately one can only buy the standard or the soundtrack version, without\
      \ any chance to upgrade, to buy the DLC extra. In this case I can only say if\
      \ you get the game on a good sale (75 percent or more) and collect music, or\
      \ if you want to support the developer, you might want the soundtrack edition.\
      \ If you are a \"normal\" player, the standard edition of the game will suffice\
      \ for you.\n\nRecommended: Only for chiptune fans, as you will hear almost everything\
      \ ingame aplenty. My upvote is for lack of a \"neutral\" option."
