If you're looking for something with a wider variety of puzzles and a deeper story, then maybe look up the background to this one and skip to Return to Ravenhearst. \n\nI played the Ravenhearst games when I was younger and came back to them in my 20s for nostalgia. I started with this one to play the games chronologically. And I kinda wish I hadn't. I was originally going to leave this with a positive review, noting that maybe I'm just not the target audience. Then I started on the sequel, and in comparing the two I realize just how much I disliked playing this one. I pretty much dragged myself through it for just the story.\n\nThe only gameplay I enjoyed was doing the jigsaw pieces of the diary, which only makes up roughly 10% of each level. The story is a lovely set up to the Ravenhearst series. I also enjoyed when they interwove the look & find and the story. In the gameplay, you'd see books that Charles' would have read, and in the story, Emma talks about Charles' obsession with door locks and collecting random junk. I wish there was more of this, and the look & find portions actually contributed to discovering more of the story, perhaps observations that the diary doesn't give you. The map being a floor plan as a nod to Charles building the house was a nice touch.\n\nLooking at the negatives, the game was just monotonous. Visually, a few screens are nice but otherwise most are not even pleasant to look at. And then you have to come back to them. This game has a story, but the game play does not support it other than taking place in the same house. You could easily be playing a word search or matching game and it would be about the same. Maybe it's unfair of me to compare this to its sequels, but in Return at least, the look & finds contributed to puzzles and they felt like I was investigating a part of the rooms you entered.\n\nA break from the look & find portions are the puzzle locks that you are occasionally blessed/cursed with. I personally found these to be a pain as they're sometimes nonsensical and have very little direction. The few I was able to complete without assistance from a guide did not leave me feeling accomplished or clever. Just annoyed. \n\nThe sound design wasn't terrific either. It starts with a good atmosphere, but the amount of creaking floors and yowling cats, plus the badly looping ticking of the timer, is enough to make you want to mute it. I didn't struggle with meeting the time parameters, but it wasn't necessarily fun to be rushed. \n\nThe game isn't bad, and it does set the stage for it's sequels. However, I honestly regret even spending $10 on this and not just looking up the story for my adventure into the rest of the series. I personally couldn't recommend you play it unless youre 100% here for the look & find, and the occasional puzzle and plot is just a cherry on top. Even then, grab it on sale for $4.","timestamp_created":1606536893,"timestamp_updated":1606536893,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pPLDhvYCctGTtAI="}
