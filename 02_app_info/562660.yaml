    review: "Nice and chill game, some variation of Angry Birds, where you need to\
      \ collect stars and toys for cute panda cutting off rope holding it and tilting\
      \ screen. Some levels are boring, some are fun, panda costumes are quite cute.\
      \ \nGame itself is not very long (~3-4 hours for 100% achievements) however\
      \ it's price is so low, so it worth every penny.\nNot \"must play / extraordinary\
      \ gameplay\" game but relax and easy game for couple hours."
