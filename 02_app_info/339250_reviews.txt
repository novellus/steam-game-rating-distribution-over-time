And also the story is the exact same as mindy's arc, yeah dream world again, yeah training again, memory wipes again, her sister behind everything again, cecilia guide again, no telling lost memories again.\n\nThe rpg element? there isn't one, there's no chance for you to grind anything and when you die you lost all your progress, and don't worry you'll always die, in fact you won't need the continue button there, you will die every like half hour. I'm 18 hours in this game and this is still happening. I'm really disappointed in this game, it's not winged sakura except for the anime art","timestamp_created":1507583744,"timestamp_updated":1609614094,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.489065796136856079","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw672e4vYCeY3phwE="}
