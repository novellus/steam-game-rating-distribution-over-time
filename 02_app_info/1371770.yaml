    about_the_game: Come play the new-and-improved version of Dust to Dusk on Steam!<br><br>Game
      Overview:<br>Set in a modern Japanese office, this horror-inspired adventure
      title employs the unique Zapping system,<br>which allows you to play the story
      from the point of view of multiple characters.<br>Although zapping isn't required
      to reach the game's true ending, it does fill in plenty of gaps and will<br>help
      you better under each character's motivation.<br><br>There are four different
      endings, with three &quot;non-true&quot; ending that conclude with a staff roll.<br>Try
      and find them all!<br><br>Although it is a horror game, there are no chase sequences,
      no jump scare-type images, or game overs.<br>Play the game and take in the after-office
      atmosphere at your own pace.<br><br><br>Story:<br>Rumors are abound at the Tsukimiya
      Corporation about a child ghost<br>that wanders the office halls. In fact, the
      hushed whispers and paranoia<br>have grown so readily that the office now shuts
      it doors promptly<br>at seven o'clock each night--the same hour this child comes
      out to play.<br><br>One night, Jun Tsukimiya, the corporation's chairman, oversleeps
      at his<br>desk and is left alone on the cusp of dusk. And what does this child
      say<br>to him when they finally meet?<br><br>&quot;You know nothing, Jun Tsukimiya.&quot;<br><br>Just
      what is it that he doesn't know? Whatever it is, the clock is stuck<br>at seven,
      and he has little choice but to find out.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1371770/extras/profile_English.png?t=1598454032"

    review: "I've never played a game like this before, and it was quite the experience\
      \ for sure. The story for how short it was still managed to surprise me in ways\
      \ i didn't see coming. I enjoyed the zapping mechanic to get different mechanics\
      \ and some of the different choices provided. \n\nOverall it's almost a must\
      \ buy for the price it's at if you have the money I recommend you get this\n\
      i'd give it a 8/10"
