    review: Looks great! But no official route for it where you can use them for regular
      services. I would like to see GDR or eastern European route and locos (for example
      DR BR 132) in 1980-th for them. I mostly like dark-green livery it looks more
      attractive for me. I recommend to buy it as it has reasonable price even without
      sale.
