    review: "MMMMMMMMETALLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!\n\n   Kinda like DragonForce - minus the\
      \ questionably \"girly\" vocals - this soundtrack just flat-out ROCKS. That's\
      \ all there is to it.\n\n   Lots of double-kick, lots of keyboards, and no end\
      \ of head-banging guitar riffage. Sure, every track sounds much the same - just\
      \ like a DragonForce album - but you'll get what you get and you'll bloody well\
      \ like it, Sonny-Jim! \n\n   A super-easy recommend to all you metalheads out\
      \ there, especially at such a ludicrously low price for eighteen tracks of slightly\
      \ below-average song length.\n\n   Verdict: 8.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this\
      \ review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\n\
