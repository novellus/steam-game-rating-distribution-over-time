Freely\n\nI found the description of this application to be very misleading\n\nThe first two image examples are from something else entirely, prerendered scenes that are not representative of the app\n\n\"Lithodomos VR has painstakingly recreated the Acropolis and Parthenon, allowing you to step back in time and visit, and explore, the Acropolis in all of its original splendour and glory.\"\n\n\"Every detail has been researched and approved and is backed-up by archaeological evidence.\"\n\nThe basic layout of the Acropolis is there with some of the buildings accurately represented, but 95% of the terrain is not accurate, there are no gardens (its all sand/dirt with the exception of one key garden) and many smaller structures around the main ones are missing completely.\n\nYour area of movement is extremely limited. At first you have a small area you can freely move around with status in places they shouldn't be to make them easy to access.  I can't really blame them for this as it was cool to see them, however more attention should have been paid to the ground around them as they looked haphazardly placed\nThen its some on-rails sections you can look around.  Next is you can explore the inside of one building before going back to on-rails and finishing the experience\n\n\nPros :\nGreat narration with interesting facts and well spoken\nDecent looking models for all the status and buildings\nEasy to use, no motion sickness (though you do fly around a bit so sit down)\n\nCons :\nUnable to explore the site myself\nToo little time in each scene\nTerrible lighting.  Bake some AO and GI into this scene to make it look like the first promo image!\nTerrible, innacurate landscape (inside the compound) really destroys the recreation\n","timestamp_created":1510005331,"timestamp_updated":1510005331,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.705084025859832764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1510814495,"developer_response":"Hello TemplarGFX,\n\nThank you for your interest in our experience of the Athenian Acropolis, we are always looking for constructive feedback to help us build a more engaging and informative experience while maintaining academic integrity.\n\nOur reconstruction without gardens reflects current scholarship and artist representations published by the Acropolis Museum in Athens, which we consider to be an authoritative source. While it is possible that gardens were present on the Acropolis, there is insufficient authoritative evidence for us to responsibly include them in our reconstruction - we could not faithfully guarantee accuracy, which is the quality we value most in our work. If you are aware of an authoritative resource demonstrating the design and location of the gardens of the Acropolis that we have missed, we would be very grateful if you could provide it to us. \n\nOur placement of statues matches bases recorded in excavations, reflected in plans published by the Acropolis Museum. We hope to add more internal scenes to our reconstruction soon - very soon - but the company's integrity demands that they be accurate reproductions, and we choose not to use placeholders until accurate scenes are ready. \n\nThank you very much for all of your feedback, we hope that you take a look at our other reconstructions as they continue to be published.  \n\n- The Lithodomos VR research team"}],"cursor":"AoJ4w5rVyd8CetLLigE="}
