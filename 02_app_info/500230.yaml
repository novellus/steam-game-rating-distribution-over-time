    review: Compared to its price(When on HUGE sale), it is cool. You can access to
      6 missions that are for ILS(+Little VFR) landing practice. It could be easy(NOT
      FOR ME), you set Mouse Yoke and shaking your mouse-hand really busy, while rolling
      mouse wheel crazily to adjust speed. In this way, you can feel X, Y, Z movement
      visually, coming to your mind. Every mission is short, as this DLC aims in landing
      procedure(not much detailed) and I agree that there are not many missions available,
      but this could be the good way to practice landing, if you like to practice
      'manual' landing in critically low visibility situations, not automatic. The
      only problem is, I don't think this DLC is well worth the 100% price, even in
      50%. If I could learn something useful in instrument landing, such as setting
      localizer frequency or engaging auto landing..
