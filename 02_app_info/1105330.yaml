      \ is a survival strategy game where time is working against you. With the Moon\u2019\
      s electronics down it is up to you to traverse the lunar soil and try to make\
      \ contact with Earth while managing your crew and resources. You will never\
      \ know what you will encounter along your way, thus be prepared to make crucial\
      \ decisions and live with the consequences. Whatever you do - don\u2019t go\
      \ into the light!<br><br><br>As a member of the Engineering Council sent by\
      \ Moon Shell, your task was to oversee the construction of a newly developed\
      \ mining system on the Moon. The simple objective changed dramatically when\
      \ a massive solar storm hit the Earth, destroying all electronics in its wake.\
      \ Soon after, you witness the Sun's scorching heat as the Moon's main communication\
      \ relay falls into the light. You are alone, and now everything within the Sun's\
      \ reach is gone within seconds. The light is your enemy and the darkness is\
      \ your salvation.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1105330/extras/DM_GIF_READY_1.gif?t=1605835753\"\

      \ everything it touches, you must avoid its radiance. The Mechaplex - a giant,\
      \ general-purpose engineering vehicle will stand as your base of operations.\
      \ It will also serve as your getaway vehicle, thus plan your actions accordingly\
      \ and escape the tireless enemy. You must constantly move forward.<h2 class=\"\

      \ Develop new mechanical prototypes that will enhance your mineral gathering\
      \ or focus on enhancing your convoy's movement speed to elude the Sun's deadly\

      \ DECISIONS</strong></h2>You are not the only one who is seeking a way out of\
      \ this disaster. New crew members, some even pilots such as yourself, can join\
      \ and bring you valuable abilities and new building platforms, but you have\
      \ to feed and shelter them. Will you help the unfortunate? Or will you look\
      \ out for yourself and not risk being betrayed? What kind of person are you?<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CREW RELATIONSHIPS</strong></h2>Keep in mind that\
      \ your crew will react to your decisions. Some members will dislike joining\
      \ with someone from a rival country while others will embrace him. Decide to\
      \ throw out a popular member and you may risk a revolt, which may have dire\
      \ consequences for everyone."
