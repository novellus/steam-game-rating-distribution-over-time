      \ Games\u2019 tremendous Bernina Line: Poschiavo \u2013 Tirano route!<br><br>In\
      \ 1904, the revolutionary Albula Line opened to traffic, stretching to the spa\
      \ resort of St. Moritz and ensuring the continuation of railway connections\
      \ in eastern Switzerland. It would only be open for about a year before discussions\
      \ for another railway were taking place; a line that heads due south through\
      \ the Bernina Valley, climbing to 2,253 m (7,392 ft) before beginning the descent\
      \ towards the Swiss-Italian border.<br><br>The new route would be the most challenging\
      \ yet, having to climb and fall within a set distance meant many breath-taking\
      \ hairpin turns and some of the steepest gradients ever attempted by conventional\
      \ rail were set to feature. The line opened in stages between 1908 and 1910\
      \ as an electric, single track railway, connecting Italy with Swiss railway\
      \ network.<br><br>For the first few decades of its life, the Bernina Railway\
      \ struggled to pay for itself after a costly construction, even tinkering on\
      \ the bankruptcy line for some time. The line was rescued in 1943 following\
      \ a takeover by the Rhaetian Railway (RhB), who upgraded the line quite substantially,\
      \ including the re-model of the top of the pass, which was originally constructed\
      \ for scenic purposes but was in avalanche danger zones.<br><br>Since then,\
      \ the line has established itself as a major tourist route for those who seek\
      \ stunning views and Alpine resorts, and has become home to the \u201CBernina\
