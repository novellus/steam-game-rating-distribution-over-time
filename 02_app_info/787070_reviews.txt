The game got updated recently so there were some changes to it since it was first published back in 2018(?).\n\nAnyway, this game was the main reason why I created my Steam account since I actually did want to support the developers. Although the guy who mainly advertises this is addicted to Yuuto (seriously, just read the descriptions of most of his videos past 2017), I thought the game looked pretty solid.\n\nAnother aspect of the game which I liked was how it made use of Yuuto Ichika, which was one of those memes in the original Touhou Hell that was either hated or very loved. I initially thought Yuuto was just meh but I did grow to appreciate her over the years (I think a little too much because of Maki Ligon). \n\nGameplay-wise, the game is also fun, being a mix of bullet hell and rhythm games. It's heavily reminiscent of Yuuto Ichika's One Time Wonder, which was published in Touhou Fangame Jam. I think that game was like a test for this one's gameplay except it didn't have the rhythm elements.\n\nOn the graphics side, I like how the color palette looks. The colors seem appealing to me even if there's only four of them (though the later stages had fully-colored cities as a form of symbolism, kinda wish they kept all of it.) \nThe art for this game is really good, too. The character stills and cutscenes are things I appreciate a lot, although I have some mixed feelings for the in-game sprites. I think it should be a little bigger but that's only because my eyesight is bad even with glasses on.\n\nAs for the music, its one of the best I've heard. I can listen to the entirety of it for days (I even set my alarm as Yuuto's theme for like three years just because of it, and I never got tired of hearing it after all these years). I got into this expecting it to sound like Touhou (which, to be fair, there was one track that did sound like it) but most of the music in the game is its own thing.\n\nLast but not least, the story aspect. It's not the strongest part of the game, in my opinion. I don't find it generic but I guess a little lacking in some of the more serious scenes. Though since this game is light-hearted (for the most part) I guess it's alright. If there's a sequel for this, I can't wait for it.\n\ntl;dr \nThe game is fun but a little lacking in some aspects.\nThe music is great and you should buy the album.\n\nOverall rating: 8/10","timestamp_created":1610011528,"timestamp_updated":1610011528,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtMmK7vYCda+dwQI="}
