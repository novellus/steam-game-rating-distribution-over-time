We wanted fixed balance. Especially the part of it that was about loot. In case if you're late to the party, the game that was was originally pretty fun to play was seriously broken in its enhanced form. Nice example of how broken balance can ruin all the excitement from playing an [b]ARPG[/b] title. What did we get instead? We've got ourselves a second [b]DLC[/b]. Which... is even worse than the first one. I mean, when [b]Titan Quest: Ragnarök[/b] appeared, I was pretty excited. Even though I've already suffered quite a lot from terrible changes in [b]Anniversary Edition[/b], the idea of getting more content for the game I used to like back in the days? It felt great. But after finishing it... let's just say I was less than excited.\n\nNow, let's look at [b]Atlantis[/b]. It's smaller (only [b]13[/b] quests that take place in only six areas), it comes with even more confusing level design (like in [b]Ragnarök[/b], from time to time you'll find it hard to see where you should go next), the balance is still broken (for the entire playthrough of [b]Atlantis[/b] I didn't get a single item that was better than my old equipment from [b]Ragnarök[/b]), while every single story quest here just wants you to go and look for something in the present area. Sometimes without even telling you what you're looking for. At one point of this [b]DLC[/b] it'll be literally that. “Go and look for something unusual.” What... the heck? Like... seriously, guys? [i]Seriously?[/i] You took an ages old game and the best you can do is asking us to “look for something unusual”? Get the heck outta here.\n\nSo... yeah. You already decided that you want to give [b]Anniversary Edition[/b] a chance, you may as well get this [b]DLC[/b] as a part of the bundle. Especially when it's on sale. Just because [b]13[/b] new quests are [b]13[/b] new quests. Even though all of them are pretty bad and [i]man[/i], I hate level design here, the new areas looks beautiful, so... yeah. Why not prolong your experience for a bit longer for a couple of extra bucks? I mean, you already in, why leaving with some stuff unfinished? Right? [i]But[/i] if you're thinking about this [b]DLC[/b] as a reason to return to the world of [b]Titan Quest[/b], then you should start forgetting about it. Like... now. Not only this [b]DLC[/b] is way too short and way too uninspired, it looks like [b]Anniversary Edition[/b] ended up having the broken balance forever. And you just don't need it in your life. Not in its current form. In other words, either stick with the original, or go play something else. [b]Steam[/b] offers enough alternatives.
