      [b]yuso[/b] are cute-looking but supposedly evil ball-like creatures and you''re
      tasked with removing all of them from every planet in the solar system. and
      pluto. and the moon.


      it kinda plays like [i]lights out[/i], except you can''t turn the light on again,
      so to speak. balls of the same color can be removed if they''re next to each
      other vertically or horizontally, but clicking and thus exploding a ball will
      have an effect on all 8 tiles around it if they''re occupied. same-colored yuso
      will disappear, different ones will change color, unless it''s a sleeping yuso
      that can also be part of matches, but needs to be woken up before its color
      can be changed. [b]no turn limit, but certain mechanics activate after a few
      turns[/b], such as bombs or nightcaps that put nearby yuso to sleep.


      the [b]100 levels[/b] are mostly on the easy side and don''t involve too many
      steps, but [b]unlimited undo[/b] is available to reduce tedium and repeating
      the same thing over and over. puzzles are sorted into packs of 10, they unlock
      as you make progress, but every level within is available to try immediately.


      the graphics are cute and the audio isn''t as bad as I expected, but there''s
      annoying gibberish during dialog and the text is full of grammatical mistakes
      as well. separate volume settings, a bunch of languages and windowed mode are
      all here, along with proper level selection and level numbers, don''t need anything
      else for such a simple affair.


      overall, it''s a decent package, good for all ages, [b]takes about 3 hours[/b],
      but definitely overpriced, so wait for a sale. and don''t bother if you care
      about achievements, some of them are bugged.'
