I'm sure this was a lot of work, but this review isn't going to be positive. I apologize for that, but I'll try to be constructive instead of just an ***\n\nAnyways, There were a lot of technical details in this game. And I mean a lot. The game doesn't really have any puzzles at all really, and the mechanics are very difficult to use. First off, if I just spam the blocks, I'm able to glitch through walls, and often times you get stuck inside of them. If you're going to make a puzzle game using such a mechanic, you definitely need to debug it. But not to mention, most of the time, the levels were not challenging, or just relied on the weak controls to make it challenging. There wasn't even a way to die until the 10th or 12th level, except for the glitches that continuously occured and sometimes killed your character.\n\nAs well as this, you need to fix the tutorial. You left signs in the tutorial telling people that they\nneeded to use A and B to shoot, but the controls aren't even A and B. They are X and Z, along with the arrow keys.\n\nAlso, the beginning tells you to press any button to start, but I literally had no idea how to start\nit, and it just sort of started after I slammed like half the keys on my keyboard. You probably should make it easier to start.\n\nLastly, even if there were some difficulty to the levels, it wasn't because of your level design. Your puzzle design was weak at best, and really just spamming away the 5 second blocks is the easiest way to beat any level because the game just sort of teleports you around to prevent trapping you within the blocks.\n\nOkay, now onto the positives since I went all out on the negatives. The art style, while minimum, is alright, and I appreciate the animations you added in. If you made the art and music, you did a nice job with both. While I didn't really like the music, and the sound effects didn't make sense to me, I can appreciate that you attempted on that half. Really, I can appreciate that you attempted to make\na puzzle game. It's hard ****.\n\nSorry for the negativity, but this is gonna have to be a downvote for me. I'll let you keep the two dollars, as I don't really think I need a refund for this, and I can appreciate the low price. But please do consider taking this criticism to heart and recognizing the flaws within your game. It's clunky, and if you can fix that, your next game could be pretty darn good.\n\nAlrighty, peace.","timestamp_created":1536981837,"timestamp_updated":1536981937,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.695103108882904053","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tuXQ7eUCeonVqgE="}
