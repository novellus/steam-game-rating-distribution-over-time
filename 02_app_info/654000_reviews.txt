Players wait for the cone ahead of them to get ever thinner, increasing their accuracy, and press RB or RT (on controller) when they wanna try their luck at an accurate shot.\n\nThe first man to land a hit wins, the loser eats dust.\n\nMy mates and I turned it into a short, tournament style set of duels, where the winner moved on against better and better gunfighters, while the losers downed a number of shots equal to the tier of the tournament they made it to.\nWe made the winner do just one shot with each win, just to keep it interesting.\n\nIt was a great bit of fun while it lasted, and for the price it was worth every piece of silver.","timestamp_created":1545499074,"timestamp_updated":1545499074,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521500706672668457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3Yu76+cCedeBtgE="}
