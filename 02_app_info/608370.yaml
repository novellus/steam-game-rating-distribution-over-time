    review: "This game is a 2 out of 5 stars! Let me explain...\n\nThere are less\
      \ than 20 songs\n\nWhen your playing a song, you would think that the only drums\
      \ you hear are yours, but know they dont even cut out the audio for you to play\
      \ and hear your own. You are just playing over the songs.\n\nWhen playing the\
      \ songs you have a choice of 3 difficulties, they are fun mode, hard mode and\
      \ pro mode. I am not even a drummer in real life and I would rather play the\
      \ pro mode than the other two modes. The fun mode is more like the play 1 note\
      \ slowly for the whole song. This game is so stupidly easy and is only fun to\
      \ play in the pro mode. But to play in the pro mode you have to play in the\
      \ other two modes to get to it. This makes the game way longer than it needs\
      \ to be. What I liked about guitar hero is that it gave you the option to choose\
      \ what mode to play in, this says no you have to earn your way. Imagine playing\
      \ guitar hero or rock band and you want to play a song, but you have to play\
      \ the whole dang song 2 times first on easy mode just to play it on hard. \n\
      \nThere are only 2 maps/drums\n\nThere is a thing on the side for lyrics, but\
      \ many of the songs dont actually show the lyrics so why even put that in the\
      \ game. \n\nThe only good thing about this game is that when you do get to play\
      \ in pro mode it is fun... thats it, its not worth your time to play everysong\
      \ 2 times to get pro mode. If there are like 17 songs and each song is like\
      \ 3 minutes, then you have wasted    around 2 hours cause sometimes it will\
      \ say it wasnt even good enough and you have to play it again. The total amount\
      \ of fun that you will have in this game is less than an hour, while like I\
      \ said you will be wasting your time not having fun in this game for 2 hours."
