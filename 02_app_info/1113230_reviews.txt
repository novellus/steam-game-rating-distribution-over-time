With a bit more patience (and looking more closely at the intro Steam video and game notes), I have found an interesting strategic game.\n\nGlad I made the effort!","timestamp_created":1566273508,"timestamp_updated":1567322782,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk/ft9ewCcrTZ0AE="}
