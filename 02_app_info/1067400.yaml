    review: "[h1]Practice makes perfect[/h1]\n\n[b][i]Drawn Down[/i][/b] is an old-school\
      \ AGS-style point-and-click adventure made using the Unity engine. When you\
      \ start the game, you are immediately greeted by terrible pixel-art with little-to-no\
      \ shadows and amateurish dithering, dull voice-acting (at first, I have thought\
      \ that the main character is voiced-over by a bot), and the messed up first\
      \ location exit area (hard to click). The temptation to turn off the game at\
      \ this point was truly excruciating; nevertheless, I had persisted. \n\nWe arrive\
      \ to the station to find out that the protagonist is an artist working for the\
      \ London Police Department. Among other things, a peculiar mini game happens\
      \ where you have to sketch the con based on the witness' description - that\
      \ neat engaging element is repeated multiple times throughout the game story\
      \ ([spoiler]it is even incorporated into the best ending scenario - however,\
      \ the whole plausibility of a riot-control robot from the mid-2050s not being\
      \ able to distinguish between a drawing and a real-life person is nigh impossible\
      \ (additionally, in that scene one can just walk out into the clear and run\
      \ around the villain - nothing is going to happen, that just kills the tension!)[/spoiler]),\
      \ which certainly helps the player to submerge into the plot. The rest of the\
      \ locations are pretty generic for the not-so-distant future sci-fi, a blend\
      \ between [b][i]Ghost In The Shell[/i][/b], [b][i]Blade Runner[/i][/b], and\
      \ [b][i]Detroit: Become Human[/i][/b] - however, a few landscapes are truly\
      \ gorgeous (like the city view in the hobo town). \n\nThe characters do their\
      \ job but are not memorable, with the exception of Frank who is the only one\
      \ graced with the decent voice acting. The story unwinds at a steady pace, the\
      \ dialogues are not overwhelming, and the finale is fitting (and also has some\
      \ groovy tune). More detective work (e.g. cross-referencing the data bits using\
      \ the AI DB interface provided by the main character's smartphone) would be\
      \ appreciated - alas, the investigatory content is disappointingly lacking.\
      \ An occasional joke is brilliant, though, somewhat making up for it! Most importantly,\
      \ the interactions required to progress the story further are logical, including\
      \ from the game context's perspective ([spoiler]the only tedious bit was the\
      \ pixel-hunting I had to do to find the CCTV near the gallery - the world detalization\
      \ is not sufficient for such kind of activities[/spoiler]).\n\nThe game blesses\
      \ you with the option to run towards the location's exit - a feature that more\
      \ point-and-click adventure games should provide. However, some of the other\
      \ technical decisions are a miss - there are not enough descriptions for the\
      \ interactable objects, nor there are plenty of them in general. Additionally,\
      \ the dialogue and item-hover boxes are the standard Unity ones along with the\
      \ font used for them and they look unsightly and out of place.\n\nThere are\
      \ a few plausibility issues here and there (e.g. the ability to access and interact\
      \ with random devices at the police station via a terminal without entering\
      \ any kind of password) - whilst they serve the plot, it is hard to overlook\
      \ such shortcomings, as the game strives to be a cyberpunk-themed work: a genre\
      \ in which the logics and believability of human-technology interaction are\
      \ vital.\n\nTo summarise, it is an [i]OK[/i] game which would definitely benefit\
      \ in its development from some more experienced creators. It is akin to a good\
      \ daytime TV show - it is enjoyable but not quite there yet. Surely, I could\
      \ have been doing something more productive or play a better video game, but\
      \ I do not regret spending a few hours on this title - it was a pretty good\
      \ time.\n\nI would recommend grabbing it on sale, especially if you are fond\
      \ of point-and-click adventure games."
