It is one of my favorite movies of all time. [/b]\n\nIn this accurately described \"Mad Max on BMX bikes\" thrill ride, you'll be transported to a world ravaged by nuclear war where water is scarce and Michael Ironside rules with...an iron fist (heh). Only an unassuming kid turned hero can oppose him with the help of the friends he meets along the way, bringing back an ounce of normalcy to the world and several liters of water to the people in need.\n\nThis oddball movie does not take itself seriously and neither should you. It's a light-hearted, romantic bloodfest about a kid becoming his childhood hero while taking down the childhood memory that haunts him.\n\n\"Aventure is out there\" is a line quoted from the movie UP. This movie not only brings with it a sense of adventure, a feeling that the world they are in is actually tangible for you, the viewer, but also a bit of that Disney Magic. It has that feeling of innocence, of heart, and then someone gets their eye socket jammed-in with a screwdriver, and suddenly all is right with the world again.\n\nNow, I'd be remiss if I just glossed over the obvious 80's retro vibe this movie bleeds. From the outfits, the title card, the music, and even the feel. The only way I can describe the feel is what you feel when you watch Robocop, Terminator, or Predator. You just know you're in for a good time. If you like the 80's, this movie will make sure you're taken care of.\n\nI really don't know what else to say. Don't think this is some chick flick just because there's some romance. It definitely is not. It's a charming movie, filled with buckets of blood, humor, cheese, and a dash of romance. There is so much to it I haven't talked on. There is so much charm. My review definitely doesn't do this movie justice.\n\nI have bought the 3 disk collectors edition, the standard steelbook edition, the 2 different SteelArchive German imports, a VHS edition, the standard edition, and several digital editions on top of multiple shirts too. When I have a bad day, I watch Turbo Kid. It really is magical. It is action packed. It is sad. It is funny. It is a very good movie that kind of just came out of nowhere.\n\nDo I recommend this product? If I could choose but one movie in my life, this would be what I would recommend to you.\n\n[spoiler] *Bioelectric Transmitter not included [/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1497764839,"timestamp_updated":1602001971,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ488Sw//QCedKKfA=="}
