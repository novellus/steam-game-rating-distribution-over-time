The different victory paths are neat and satisfy different styles of play,  \n\nI think conquering/pirating should perhaps have a bit more consequences or some kind of event where stronger enemies attack you. Feels like once you get on a roll with cannons and equipment it's hard to be stopped/challenged.","timestamp_created":1607924600,"timestamp_updated":1607924600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzMnxr/YCc5KFugI="}
