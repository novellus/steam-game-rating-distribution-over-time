    review: "Warning: Remote Play not working due to the game needing to recognize\
      \ the controllers BEFORE launching it.\nWarning: Game was designed for PlayStation\
      \ 2, most modern computers will encounter severe bugs in certain maps, specially\
      \ maps and hills.\nWarning: Game images do not depict the actual game, but get\
      \ very close to it.\nWarning: It is a posibility that your computer won't start\
      \ the game due to it being, very, very old.\nIf this happens, usually the fix\
      \ is to select a lower resolution. Try this until it works, lowering the resolution\
      \ each time.\n\nIf you however do not care for bugs and just want to have a\
      \ fun time, or play with friends with multiple controllers or by streaming your\
      \ keyboard, then go ahead and buy it. \nI personally would recommend waiting\
      \ for discounts.\nThis is a very subjective review, do not abide by this."
