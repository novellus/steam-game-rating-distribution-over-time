Filled with stock assets, that even repeat within the game a lot. Pick up useless things with left click, rotate them and then throw them away. Read notes spread around to understand the story.\n\nGameplay consists of opening combination locks (Really?). Search for the password or key. Spend 15 min opening every one of the fifty drawers in a house to find them.\n\nThere are some spooky parts, but even those are generic. Get teleported to a weird alternate dimension thing. There's some blood, some strong white light, some darkness, corridors, doors.\n\nMaybe I've just played too many indie games of this type but this game is seriously boring. Sorry to the devs, I'm sure you did your best.","timestamp_created":1607891904,"timestamp_updated":1607892182,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483870983123779297","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv/T1rvYCfrf4uQI="}
