    about_the_game: "The newest, most spectacular innovation in audio-visual enchantment.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nIn a world where time is running out, where angels, are now\
      \ demons, and vice versa, and human emotion is no longer a valid format, there\
      \ is one entity ready to put his FOOT down, and say NO. Play as a lonely timid\
      \ left foot, determined to make his mark on a world that's ever so crumbling\
      \ around him. Make your way through exhilirated, magnificent and enchanting\
      \ landscapes. Move with shoe, live with shoe, breathe with shoe. Be. Shoe.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nTraverse through a dense forest, examine the gems through\
      \ the eyes of your feet, and allow the sun rays to reflect through the intricate\
      \ cuts of the blue, red, and even yellow precious stones. Ever wondered what\
      \ it would be like to walk on the ceiling? Gravity reversed? Fish with legs?\
      \ Or how about owning your own horse with a personality more extatic and enchantingly\
      \ realistic than any class clown or surf shop employee? It can all be done with\
      \ TICKET. In TICKET, every one is a millionaire. you will never be as rich in\
      \ real life, as you can be in the game-world, both in monetary and spiritual\
      \ terms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game features astonishingly realisting high\
      \ definition real-world 4D engines, bringing what you see around you every day,\
      \ into a hyper realistic cyber-universe, with graphics so real, your brain could\
      \ never hope to comprehend the full extent of mind numbing beauty this game\
      \ exudes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game's soundtrack is a masterful manipulation\
      \ of vibrations, intricately designed to elicit the most pure and joyful of\
      \ emotions when entering the brain through ear holes. 30 works of sonic art\
      \ guide you through Shoe's troubles and trials and tribulations, elevating your\
      \ sense of reality to a higher plain as you jump, hop, skip and jump, bounce\
      \ and spike your way through the world of TICKET."

    review: "I love this game. It's a perfect mix of surrealist humor, hard but not\
      \ impossible platforming and with a great soundtrack. \nI'd recommend looking\
      \ up a guide for rainbow weather (the final level) though."
