It has a very mediocre acceleration rating and its performance caps out a 446 despite being a category 3 car. For comparison, the Honda Civic already in the game, which is a category 2 car, caps out at 494.\n\nThis Citroen stops being competitive in level 3 or above events, even when maxed out.\n\nUnless you want to spend $5 to give yourself a handicap I'd stick with any of the rallycross cars in the base game.","timestamp_created":1592261359,"timestamp_updated":1592264627,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.630742669105529785","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s8KX3fICdNemjgI="}
