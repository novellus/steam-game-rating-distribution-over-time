    review: "Overall, I enjoy this download. The virtual cockpit (VC) could have more\
      \ usable switches. However, there are just as many usable switches as the standard\
      \ Westland on FSX. I actually  think they did a great job making this helicopter's\
      \ VC! The helicopter handles quite well (if you know how to handle it). I saw\
      \ other reviewers asked about lowering the rear ramp... The controls are below.\
      \ Please note that you must hold the Shift + E  then release that combo and\
      \ then press the number if you want it to work. Essentially, don't push everything\
      \ at the same time. \nLower the top portion of the ramp: Hold Shift + E and\
      \ then release. Then press 3.\nLower the middle portion of the ramp: hold Shift\
      \ + E and then release. Then press 2.\nLower the bottom portion of the ramp:\
      \ LAND! Then, hold Shift + E then release. Then press 4."
