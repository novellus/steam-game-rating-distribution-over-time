    review: 'I am on the fence with this DLC.


      Good for flavour events, this DLC is either loved or hated depending on the
      type of player you are. If you enjoy the supernatural elements of the game it
      can be really fun, however if realism is your goal do not buy this. Some of
      the features can make your game incredibly easy. Kidnap anyone, regrow limbs,
      become immortal. This DLC depends entirely on what you like from CK.'
