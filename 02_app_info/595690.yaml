    about_the_game: '<strong>Note (June 18, 2019):</strong>  <i>This game is being
      updated weekly.</i>  That means it''s going to change, a lot, over the next
      few years.  The game is already playable, feature-complete, stable, and chocked
      full of content---it''s already an entertaining and interesting game.  However,
      my goal is to make the very best game possible.  In a large-scale multiplayer
      setting, it''s very difficult to predict the group dynamics that will result
      from a given change, so there will be some experimentation along the way.  You
      may not like every change that I make, but you should know that I''m working
      hard and doing my best to explore this brand new design space, and we''ll hopefully
      end up, eventually, at the best destination possible.  In the rare case where
      a given change ends up being completely disastrous, I always act quickly to
      fix it.  There are hard problems to solve, and with your support and input,
      we can solve them together.  That is part of what you are buying when you buy
      this game:  a seat at the table around a game that is changing and improving
      week after week.  Thanks for your input, trust, and support during this process!  --Jason<br><br><strong>Note
      (March 13, 2020):</strong>  Over the past two years, the game has been updated
      92 times, with a total of 2812 new objects added, for an average of 30 new objects
      per update.  Some weeks, when I was focused on fixing other things, very few
      new objects were added.  Dozens of new things are not added every single week,
      but dozens are added on average.  The game is updated in a substantial way every
      single week, however---except, obviously, when I''m sick or on vacation.  The
      trailer depicts a potential future for the game.  There aren''t robots in the
      game (yet), but there are loads of things that weren''t shown in the trailer
      (radios, airplanes, rail carts, oil rigs, ice cream, etc.)  At least 2812 things
      weren''t shown in the trailer, in fact.  For a game that''s changing weekly,
      a trailer gives you only a general idea of what the game is like, and where
      it''s headed.  The current plan is to get up to robots in the game someday,
      but, like I say in the trailer, who knows where we''ll end up?  --Jason<h2 class="bb_tag">Description</h2><br><strong><i>A
      multiplayer survival game of parenting and civilization building. Get born to
      another player as your mother. Live an entire life in one hour. Have babies
      of your own in the form of other players. Leave a legacy for the next generation
      as you help to rebuild civilization from scratch.</i></strong><br><br>Hey folks,
      I''m Jason Rohrer, and I''ve been working on One Hour One Life for more than
      three years.  I''ve been doing everything myself---I drew all the graphics on
      paper with pens and markers, I coded the entire engine from scratch, I composed
      and performed all of the music, and I even made all of the sound effects.  It''s
      a very personal game, and it''s really unlike anything else that''s out there.  It''s
      also a huge game---over 1300 fully interactive, craftable objects already.  And
      it''s only getting bigger, with weekly updates adding new things all the time.  The
      game was initially released on my own website in February of 2018, and over
      the intervening months, I released 29 updates off-Steam.  I''ve promised to
      keep releasing weekly update for at least the next two years, with the end goal
      of making the largest, most comprehensive crafting game in history.<br><br>Okay,
      so what about the game itself?<br><br>First of all, you only live for an hour,
      where each minute marks a passing year.  You join the game server as a newborn
      baby, and some other randomly-chosen player is your mother.  You depend on her
      for your survival.  And why will she be willing to waste her valuable time and
      resources to keep you alive?  Because she''s going to die in an hour just like
      everyone else, and if she wants what she accomplishes in her lifetime to have
      any meaning, then the next generation (aka, you) is her only hope.  And if you
      survive into adulthood, you may get the chance to have babies of your own---other
      players, just joining the server---and those babies will be the next generation
      that gives meaning to your own life accomplishments.<br><br>Across this ever-growing
      family tree of generations, players are collectively conducting an enormous
      project:  they are rebuilding civilization from scratch.  The online game world
      starts out as a near-infinite expanse of wilderness (four billion meters wide
      from east to west, and four billion meters wide from north to south, with a
      total surface area of over 18,000,000,000,000,000,000 square meters, or 36,000
      times bigger than Earth).  The very first player to join the server is Eve,
      and she starts out in the wilderness as the root of the family tree.  Eve and
      her immediate offspring lay the foundation for the future civilization, perhaps
      making a few primitive tools, cooking basic foods, and starting a small farm
      as they scrape out a meager existence before dying.  Future generations will
      build on this primitive foundation, eventually mastering more and more advanced
      technology, including domesticated animals, metal working, permanent buildings,
      and transportation networks.<br><br>But as real-life history has shown, civilization
      is fragile.  A generation that is born into the lap of luxury---on the backs
      of their ancestors'' hard-won accomplishments---can just as easily squander
      their inheritance as build upon it.  Key resources run out over time, so careful
      management, planning, and organization are necessary to prevent an inevitable
      collapse.  Thus, the game graduates from the individual challenge of primitive
      survival in the early stages to a group organizational and leadership challenge
      in the later stages.  How do rules and procedures for group survival propagate
      across multiple generations?  What did our great grandparents have in mind for
      this village?<br><br>The main mode in the game involves being born as a helpless
      baby to another player as your mother, but you can also play with your friends
      as twins, triplets, or quadruplets.  One baby is hard enough to take care of---any
      mother that can successfully take care of quadruplets deserves the eternal gratitude
      of you and your friends.<br><br>All of this is happening on my own centrally-managed,
      persistent servers, and your purchase includes a lifetime account on these official
      servers.  After you buy the game, you can instantly connect to this world with
      no configuration or server set-up.  It all just works.  You also get access
      to the full source code, including the server code.  Technically-minded folks
      can run their own private servers, or even use the powerful content editor to
      make their own mods. <br><br>I hope you''ll join us as this sprawling civilization-building
      experiment continues to unfold.  Many thousands of players have already collectively
      lived over 400,000 hours in this endlessly-changing world so far.  Before the
      Steam release, the average playtime for each player was 17 hours, with dozens
      of players logging over 500 hours each, and 94% positive off-Steam player reviews.  This
      is a deep and rich game already, and there are still hundreds of content updates
      to come.<br><br>No two lives are ever the same, and a new story always awaits
      on the other side of the [GET REBORN] button.<br><br>Jason Rohrer<br>October
      2018<br>Davis, California'

    review: My first life my mom found out I was completely new. She showed me how
      to farm and told me about yum and how tobe a good bb. She gave me clothes and
      put pies in my backpack and kept checking on me. Then it was time for her to
      die and her final song was playing. I cried :( Such a nice person I would never
      know if I met again. Lovely game with lots of crafting. Just make sure if you
      end up in a village without drama the next life could be better.
