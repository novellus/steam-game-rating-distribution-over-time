    review: "Warning: The controls require practice and mastery which might not be\
      \ fun for some people. \n\nHowever, I personally like a good challenge and this\
      \ game sure delivers (even If I'm terrible for the moment).\n\nThe graphics\
      \ are simple but fun to look at and I like the surrealist twist you don't see\
      \ everywhere.\n\nI recommend this (and for 1$, you really can't go wrong)!"
