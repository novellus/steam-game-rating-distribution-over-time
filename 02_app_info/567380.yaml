      /><br>Heartbound does not use the traditional systems of Levels, Experience,
      or Consumables. Everything is skill-based and combat can change based on your
      relationships with others or things you have done. Weapons can be found throughout
      the world and they augment how much damage you deal in certain situations.<br><br>Every
      enemy you encounter has unique mini-games that you will not see anywhere else
      in the game. There are no random battles and a number of encounters are avoidable
      based on how you progress. Combat never ends in death and defeating someone
      allows you to see their memories from their perspective. What you do from there
      is up to you.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/567380/extras/CombatImage.jpg?t=1597746347"

    review: i love this game. i found this game way back in like 2016/2017 as a demo
      on itch.io and ever since i fell in love. im not that active in the community
      anymore, but i absolutely adore this game. i bought it at full price and i wouldnt
      pay a penny less for it. its genuinely such a beautiful game
