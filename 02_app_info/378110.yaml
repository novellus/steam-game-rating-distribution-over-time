      \ learn about the organization and the people who work there. Read files and\

      \ Data found on their systems will help you learn about the motives of the organization,\
      \ and how dark their plans can get. You may also discover dirty little secrets\
      \ about the employees as well. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHacking into new accounts\
