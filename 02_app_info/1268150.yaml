    review: 'Nope.

      Looks fun on pictures and gameplay but its just so unpolished.


      - UI is garbage, for example, weapon customization the sights for example are
      all named scope1, scope2 etc. and the list is covering the sights themselves
      so you have to click the scope/sight to see what it actually is.


      - No servers and i couldnt host.


      - Bots are just dumb.


      - Dont know how the recoil is programmed but first of all, its way to brutal
      on some weapons.

      If you control the recoil, after the spray your screen will continue to go downwards
      without you interacting?


      - has killstreaks but one (atleast one) map has a roof and when you call in
      an airstrike the bombs will hit the roof turning it useless.


      I dont know if this is supposed to be an asset flip or not but at its current
      state it feels like it.'
