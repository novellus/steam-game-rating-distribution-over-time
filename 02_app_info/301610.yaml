    review: 'My experience was not good with the program.

      The price set for the program (even after the sale) is not worth it. There are
      several other better alternatives that you can get for the same price, or even
      cheaper, such as CPS or SAI.

      The program lags a lot and tends to freeze.

      The brushes were not that impressive.


      I tested some of the brushes and here is my opinion on it:

      - The "paint" brush is mediocre, it does not blend well with colors.

      - The "airbrush" does not have a good feel to it, it looked like a lot of low
      opacity circles rather than an airbrush.

      - The "pen" the only OK tool (in my opinion).

      - The "pencil" is it a pencil? It is a lot of dots lined up together when looked
      upon closer inspection.


      Not worth the price.'
