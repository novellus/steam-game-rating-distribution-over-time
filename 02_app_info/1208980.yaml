    review: "this one was hard to understand where and how from the start for me,\
      \ needs more instructions on a few things. if you do try it, i would suggest\
      \ that you change the cam, the movement and cam from the start is crazy. aiming\
      \ is a royal pain. i started doing the missions and at some point i should have\
      \ grinded a little more to upgrade because the enemies just got real powerful\
      \ real quick.\n i believe this is still early access so, maybe it will get better?\
      \ ill check back in a month or two and see but as of this moment, i can not\
      \ recommend this one. it needs some more work."
