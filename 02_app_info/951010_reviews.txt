In 5, 10 years we will look back at this avant-garde masterpiece of gaming meta-commentary and savor every second of its hazy obscurantist labyrinthian splendor. This game breaks the script like no other.\n\nLike House of Leaves, the first building you enter is tremendously bigger on the inside than on the outside. After I nearly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ myself when an enemy, whose distorted proportions made him as tall as the ceiling (as low?), speed-walked toward me with an axe screaming in high-pitched backward Japanese, I went into an office and found a book set on an pedestal like the bible, but when you read it is copy pasted from the Wikipedia page on water. The next thing I know I am in some futuristic complex, my NPC assistant is creepily T-modeling behind me, the hallways are twisting into themselves like the lines on a palm-- my brain is starting to squirm. For the first time in probably 15 years of gaming, I felt like almost anything was possible in the next room.\n\nAppreciating this game unfortunately might require having taken at least some introductory level art history classes. The game features numerous elements of the Russian avant-garde of the early 20th century in particular, breaking the 4th wall by calling attention to its own constructed-ness with immersion-busting gestures such as placing text prompts on certain spaces of the map so they repeat literally every time you walk over them, or obliterating the tired conventions video game puzzle solving by presenting \"puzzles\" that are so ham-fisted and forthright they nearly assault you with the devices they employ.\n\nThe creators of Zero Spring make it disturbingly clear that behind the curtain of our little Oz game-worlds are men and machines pulling the strings, a simple glitch, a furtive gaze through a glass darkly spies the wizard, and the entire facade begins to unravel-- and when that happens, at that moment, where will we be? Zero Spring leaves the player feeling like they are deep in a k-hole in low budget Japanese haunted house, or perhaps that they have woken up after 10 years in a coma in some dystopian nightmare world with severe brain damage. It is exquisite.","timestamp_created":1577434734,"timestamp_updated":1577434999,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547217845916748047","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jf2co+8Cduiw5wE="}
