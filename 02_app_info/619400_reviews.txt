Guess what, there's no option to load the last level you were on! This can be very stressful and not fun at all, there's not even checkpoints in the game either. So beware that if you die in the level, you'll have to redo the entire whole level AGAIN until you complete it. Also, the physics and the controls in this game is very terrible meaning that it will take a while in learning on how to control your character through out the game meanwhile tearing off your hair during the process. I highly recommend avoid on buying this game, unless you have money that you have to waste it on.\n\n❤ Audience ❤\n☐ Beginner\n☐ Casual Gamer\n☑ Normal Gamer\n☑ Expert\n\n☼ Graphics ☼\n☐ Bad\n☑ Alright\n☐ Good\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Fantastic\n\n♬ Music ♬\n☐ Bad\n☑ Alright\n☐ Good\n☐ Beautiful\n☐ Fantastic\n\n☠ Difficulty ☠\n☐ Easy\n☐ Average\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☑ Hard\n☐ Unfair\n\n§ Bugs §\n☐ Bugs destroy the game\n☐ Lots of bugs\n☑ Few Bugs\n☐ You can use them for speedrun\n☐ Nothing encountered\n\n☯ Story ☯\n☑ There is none\n☐ Bad\n☐ Alright\n☐ Good\n☐ Fantastic\n\n⚔ Gameplay ⚔\n☑ Frustrating\n☐ Sleepy\n☑ Boring\n☐ Fun\n☑ Challenging\n\n۞ Game time / Length ۞\n☑ Really short (0 - 3 hours)\n☐ Short (4 - 8 hours)\n☐ Few hours (10 - 20 hours) [if you focus on the main story]\n☐ Long (40-60 hours) [if you complete everything]\n☐ Very Long (61-100 hours)\n☐ Extremely Long (101+ hours)\n\n$ Price / Quality $\n☐ Full price\n☐ Wait for Sale\n☑ Don't buy\n☐ Refund it if you can","timestamp_created":1609164697,"timestamp_updated":1609164697,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42pXs1PYCfa6OvgI="}
