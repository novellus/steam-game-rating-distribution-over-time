Player's character dies with just a little tilt to their body. Turning in whatever direction is really hard. In Stage 2-2 if you don't start the level by pressing a key to move forward, your character is going to flip over and die. And controls are never fully explained, so I used a really stupid technique of clicking icons with my mouse to use abilities.  It seems it is primarily a smartphone game, but even then the difficulty level is just too high for what seems to be a game for kids (it wouldn't be much of a problem if the control system was better). I could see it being a nice game if fixed, it has a basic level of level design, nice-looking graphic style and the difficulty level makes you think about the mechanics of the game, which I consider a plus. But still it's just a broken piece of garbage with bad controls.","timestamp_created":1561763578,"timestamp_updated":1561763867,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l62Y0OsCdbvNxAE="}
