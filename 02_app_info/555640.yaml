    review: Great game, sadly short but overall a great story. I wish there was a
      better ending or perhaps a continuation game going into their college life rather
      than just zooming in on either Chiyoko or Arisa's face. The main character was
      a bit too much of a weeb for my tastes and is a bit of a cliche, however this
      game provided many interesting facts about Japanese culture and I learned a
      lot from it. Would love to see more of this game.
