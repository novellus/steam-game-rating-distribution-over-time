    about_the_game: HOW LONG CAN YOU SURVIVE? Lord Pain has summoned his infernal
      minions once again to wreak havoc on the realms of men... As one of the last
      of the Bowmen, a long forgotten but elite Elven race that once guarded the living
      against this malevolent evil, you must conjure up your courage and venture forth
      toward the portal of doom to save mankind once again. With a bit of skill, a
      dash of luck, and the help of unusual accomplices, you may hold these demons
      off just long enough for the living to be saved and mankind to emerge victorious
      once again!<h2 class="bb_tag">SURVIVE THE ONSLAUGHT OF A CARTOON HELL</h2><img

      /><br>Fight against Lord Pain's relentless armies in a single game mode called
      &quot;Onslaught&quot;, whereby enemies spawn in progressively more and more
      difficult waves the longer you stay alive. To succeed, you'll need to call upon
      allies for aid, equip unique items, use health potions, and decimate your foes
      by detonating powerful explosives. <br><br>Leveling up your character after
      each encounter will allow you to invest in player attributes that will improve
      your character's damage throughput and survivability, slowly allowing you to
      progress into more daunting and brow-sweating difficulties.<h2 class="bb_tag">EQUIP
      UNIQUE ITEMS</h2><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1241810/extras/item_preview2.png?t=1609890518"
      /><br><br><i>Bowmen</i> comes &quot;equipped&quot; (heh, see what I did there?)
      with a plethora of items that drop from enemies that have succumbed to your
      inescapable wrath. These items can improve your player's stats, grant you extra
      experience per kill, heal your character, or empower you with unique skills
      and abilities. Will you stick with a scroll that gives you some additional health
      regen, or will you drop it in favor of that sick legendary sword that will allow
      you to do maximum damage? The choice is yours!<h2 class="bb_tag">EARN SKIN REWARDS</h2><br><br><img

      high global ranks in <i>Bowmen</i> will unlock unique skins that will allow
      you to customize your character for a more personalized gaming experience. Some
      of these skins are available only for a limited time during certain seasons,
      so make sure you maintain your rank for a chance at earning these! Speaking
      of ranks...<h2 class="bb_tag">FIGHT YOUR WAY TO THE TOP</h2><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1241810/extras/top_player_small.png?t=1609890518"

      difficulty, your score will automatically be submitted to our servers at Ethereal
      Gem along with your character's name and your current level. If your score is
      higher than any of the scores within the top 1000 for that season, your score
      and rank will be shown in-game so that everyone will know their place relative
      to YOU in the Bowmen hierarchy!<br><br>Thanks for checking us out!
