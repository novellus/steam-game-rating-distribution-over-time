Unfortunately, this recommendation is [b]extremely[/b] tentative and comes with [b]tons[/b] of caveats.\n\nBasically, you start by naming your driver, picking a profile picture for them, and buying one of two cheap cars. You run some early races, get acquainted with the controls, and then find out the hard way that this game is pretty harsh about making you budget your resources.\n\nYou have to keep enough fuel in your car to be able to race. You have to keep your car repaired to be able to drive it. You have to keep enough money on hand to pay to enter the races; and if you can't manage that, you'll have to wash cars to make up enough pocket change to run the very first race again. Eventually, you'll manage to start upgrading your car, which is when the [b]real[/b] grind starts.\n\nIf you can make it up to the point where you've got at least two well-upgraded cars, the grind starts to ease off a bit, as you'll be able to juggle your cars and keep at least one race-ready. After that, it's mainly just a matter of keeping your car on the road and not running into traffic, rivals or cops.\n\nBut overall, this game just isn't as [b]engaging[/b] as a driving game as it could be. Ultimately, if you think you'll like [i]80s Overdrive[/i] based purely off the looks, you'd probably be better served getting [i][url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/732810/Slipstream/]Slipstream[/url][/i]. [i]Slipstream[/i] allows you to drift your car through corners, has a drafting mechanic for riding close behind rivals and traffic to speed you up, and allows you to set your own soundtracks instead of being restricted to only what's in the game by default.\n\nBut if you're like me and you've already played [i]Slipstream[/i] to death, [i]80s Overdrive[/i] is at least a decent game with good driving mechanics. I'd give [i]80s Overdrive[/i] a 6.5 out of 10.","timestamp_created":1609886013,"timestamp_updated":1609886013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537624657154083252","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45OKr6vYCfL3rwAI="}
