      \ when I was 16. Really loud death metal. But I had always been interested in\
      \ electronic music as well and started to make it. I will have some music and\
      \ it will inspire me to make something visual. It\u2019s all very integrated\
      \ because the music inspires the visuals but the visuals also inspire the music.\
      \ It\u2019s a constant interaction between the two. I like to go into the details.\
      \ I can work for a year on a small piece but I make it exactly how I want. VR\
      \ is a really intense and immersive way to experience music. The best way I\
      \ can describe Apex is like when I was fifteen and went to a death metal concert,\
      \ and what I felt being in the crowd as the band played, the aggression and\
      \ the energy. It\u2019s overwhelming and kind of scary but it makes you feel\
      \ something. And that\u2019s what I wanted to do with Apex. There is destruction\
      \ but there is also beauty in what you are seeing. It\u2019s really more of\
      \ an atmosphere than a traditional story.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith VR it\u2019\
      s really hard to tell a story in the traditional sense. You visualize it in\
      \ your mind in the traditional way, different shots, controlling the frame.\
      \ But in VR when a character walks away they are still in the world, so you\
      \ have to think about it in a much different way than films. So something like\
      \ Apex is more of a pure atmosphere. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m interested\
      \ in doing now, putting people in worlds more than telling traditional stories\
      \ in those worlds. I like it when people take off the headset and have to adjust\
      \ to the earth again.&quot;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Arjan van Meerten, Creator"
