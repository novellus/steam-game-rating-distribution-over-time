The lighting was 10/10. I was amazed by the insanely good jumpscare in the ''W.C'' don't know what that stands for... I'm assuming washroom but idk. Love how I could barely get up the stairs in the lighthouse because the game is just that clunky. You even had to tell us to jump at one point on the lighthouse stairs because they are just so poorly made. Also you guys barely put any effort into helping the player find damn keys. I couldn't even get passed the bar because... Well? Where's the damn key for the locked door? And the flashlight. Oh man you guys nailed it. Once it goes out you can't see shit! And the battery drains so god damn mother broccoli fast it's unbelievable. At the end of the day. it's just another terrible product on steam. \n\nP.S: I could make a better game with my beautiful furry eyes closed in a week. It's not that hard just saying. Stop scamming people for their money. I hit the refund button on this game so fecking fast it's funny. I rather my money to go in to quality instead of garbage. \n\nP.S: My grammar is better than yours and my main language is French.
