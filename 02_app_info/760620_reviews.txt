Gathering, Mining, Farming, Crafting... on a tiny planet that gets visited by merchants in UFOs... and monsters fighting from time to time... and errr... there's magic in the talk... A Wizard that came on an UFO teaching you how to magic... An alien that came on a food truck err, UFO, tries to teach you how to cook... umm... where am i? T^T\n\nOkay... the protagonist seems to be a boy stuck (crash landed?) on a tiny planet, that he tries to survive by eating berries... poor thing... Then came a spaceship landing on the planet and a lady gave the boy some knowledge and ingredients to craft tools... uh? what? no rescue? After that, another UFO shows up and the people from inside isn't willing to come out and meet you, so you'll just have to talk to the ship from outside, seems like he's a wizard that travel in a UFO... eh? that doesn't sound right, but well... the wizard teaches the boy more craft recipe and try to sell him potions... uh.. no rescue from him either? Then an Alien came on another UFO, and this green thing (who also doesn't want to show his face outside the ship) tries to teach the boy how to cook. Eh? you sure we are on the same diet? and uh? i guess you're not rescuing me from this planet either? Everyone i met doesn't want to rescue me, instead they just gave me recipe and ask me to work for them... is this how you treat a kid in your galaxy? T^T\n\nSo... in the end, the stranded boy become a farm tycoon on the tiny planet because of these wicked people...\n\noooh, did i mention that he fights monsters/other enemies the same way he chopped up a tree? Evil~! :3\n\nWould i recommend it? well... it's a nice farm building game if you don't count the wickedness of the npcs... so yeah... viewing it as a casual game and play it at your own pace is the best. Mainly because, like most \"farming game\", there's a wait timer on your production line... if you are not the patience type... well... you won't be starting a farming game anyway... :3","timestamp_created":1609825781,"timestamp_updated":1609826840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3IXK6PYCdb/OwAI="}
