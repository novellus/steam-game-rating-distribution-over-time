    review: 'I bought this game on a -75% discount, I was pretty excited to play it
      tbh. I''m sad to give it a negative recommendation.


      This game looks super fun at first glance. Music is alright, it''s an abstract
      twin stick shooter. It even seems to have a tactical element through the notion
      of area control. Neat! Outsmart your opponent by blocking them in and then shooting
      them.


      Or so you would be led to believe, or at least that''s what I was thinking.
      The problem is that this game has a game design.. uh, flaw? It''s only a flaw
      in the sense that I think it ruins the fun for me.


      The way it works is that you press an arrow key and you shoot in that direction.
      Nice. But if you press the arrow key in a direction while a shot is coming at
      you and you shoot at the shot, then you "block the shot" and both shots disappear.
      Nice.


      If you time your shot "correctly" which feels like a 0.125s gap before the shot
      hits you, then you override the enemy shot, and deflect the shot back entirely
      to your opponent.


      This effectively kills all tactical element of the gameplay, and reduces it
      to a matter of "who has the best twitch reflex if you are 2 square away from
      one another and/or manages to accidentally get in a shot from a direction while
      the enemy is not looking". There is no tactical element here, just trying to
      deflect the shots back.


      Therefore, if your enemy has 1 ammo stocked up, then doesn''t matter if you
      have 3. In fact, if you time it correctly, you seem to be able to steal a speed
      shot, if you press it at like a 0.005s window? I felt like I was cheating even
      when I accidentally managed.


      So VERSUS mode against CPU is effectively "can you out-twitch-reflex a CPU that
      consistently reflects shots 3x times if you try to shoot at it while it has
      ammo available", and feels less skill-based and more luck-based if you accidentally
      manage to succeed.


      Maybe I just suck, but twitch reflex isn''t my type of fun. I thought this is
      tactical, but it''s a matter of pressing the arrow key in a 0.125s timeframe.


      Meh.


      The problem is that the game is effectively a matter of "ammunition management",
      the special "fast shots" for example provide +1 ammo over your opponent. You''d
      think what matters is how many ammo you have, but it''s more-so a matter of
      "whoever shoots first will lose if the opponent has good twitch reflex", which
      the CPU obviously does.


      It''s probably more fun with friends, because they probably aren''t as good
      at twitch reflex as a CPU. If this game had no twitch reflex deflection, it
      would be more fun....'
