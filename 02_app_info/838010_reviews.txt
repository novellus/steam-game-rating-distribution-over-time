The art, characters, and world are fun and I liked the core mystery of the story. The gameplay was fluid, though I had some trouble being reliably good at the core mechanic, which led to some trouble with time-sensitive sections later in the game.\n\nI left it on overnight one time so my \"hours played\" is a bit skewed, in practice it probably took me about 10 hours. I went for all upgrades, but not all achievements. Fights against standard goons felt easy to me, but I still found a bit of a challenge with the bosses, and I prefer that part to be too easy rather than too hard. Bosses had some creative patterns and fun animations. I'd love to see a sequel someday!","timestamp_created":1603999306,"timestamp_updated":1603999306,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkeLzuvUCd+rzqgI="}
