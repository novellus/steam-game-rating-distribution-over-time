I thoroughly enjoyed it and may play it again.\n\nIt's a basic city builder and labor assignment game. It does a job well of pulling in mechanics I like such as upgrading, research, and labor division. The labor assignment system remind of lotr 2 a little bit. It's essentially turn based but with auto turns.\n\nI noticed a couple inconsistencies in UI text size at the very end. The camera controls kind of bother me but aren't really important. \n\nI hope to see more games like this.","timestamp_created":1607528980,"timestamp_updated":1607528980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4rOMpPYCfqC1uAI="}
