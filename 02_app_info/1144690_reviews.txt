When I picked it up, I hadn't played Super Metroid; something I soon would rectify. In fact, I found myself enjoying Project Solarbot a lot more after doing so -- the game isn't quite as accessible to a complete newcomer to the genre as I'd wish, but going in knowing the basic rules of a Metroid game, you'll feel right at home.\n\nThis continues to be a theme, at least for me. The game constantly has you running and on edge, because the solar energy mechanic is no joke; it's basically a strict timer on your travels, especially once you dive deeper into the innards of the planet. Personally, I found this a tad aggravating, as I like to explore at my leisure, but I know what Metroid speed runs look like and I think in *that* context, the system adds a nice spicy motivation to get faster and faster.\n\nThe atmosphere on the other hand, is top-notch. The musical score constantly manages to sound ominous and a bit lonely. It's my highlight of the game.\n\nOverall, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to Metroid fans, especially if you like optimization of your travels.\n\nOne last note: It might be obvious from my constant comparisons to Metroid, but do yourself a favor and play this game with a good D-Pad. I found controllers like the 8bitdo SN30 (a SNES inspired gamepad) to enhance my experience a lot, whereas mxy old 360 gamepad downright frustrated me.","timestamp_created":1590582204,"timestamp_updated":1590582204,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5sqFq/ICc9jMigI="}
