No external dynamic braking sound, or it at least doesn't play consistently.\n- Livery looks pixelated on the ends, like it was drawn at a very low resolution and scaled up.\n- Top speed of 64.2 mph. In reality these were geared for at least 70 mph.\n- Headlight flare disappears when the camera moves close to it.\n\n~ Horn sound has an abrupt transition between the 'start' and 'loop' sound clips, but it doesn't sound bad, just like it has a high pressure threshold before it 'opens'.\n~ No extra stock and no loco variations (including no snowed-over model in winter); very sparse for a DTM release but not abnormal compared to other developers.\n\n+ Excellent engine sounds.\n+ Opening the engineer's door affects outside noise.","timestamp_created":1609107339,"timestamp_updated":1609623467,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v57C4vYCc5TzvQI="}
