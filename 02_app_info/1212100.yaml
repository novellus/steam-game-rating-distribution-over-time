    review: 'In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet
      enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our
      judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read.
      But the bitter truth we critics must face, is that in the grand scheme of things,
      the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating
      it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is
      in the discovery and defense of the *new*. The world is often unkind to new
      talent, new creations. The new needs friends. Last night, I experienced something
      new: an extraordinary game from a singularly unexpected source. To say that
      both the game and its maker have challenged my preconceptions about fine game
      making is a gross understatement. They have rocked me to my core. I realize,
      not everyone can become a great artist; but a great artist *can* come from *anywhere*.
      It is difficult to imagine more humble origins than those of the genius now
      game making at SokPop, who is, in this critic''s opinion, nothing less than
      the finest creator in the industry.'
