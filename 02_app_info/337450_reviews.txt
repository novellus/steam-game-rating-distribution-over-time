More challenging than you're probably thinking, too; some levels will definitely test your patience—this is especially true for the last few stages where the horned mice creatures show up with their strangely specific hit boxes.\n\nStill, [i]Dream Tale[/i] is quite decent, even if it feels incomplete (regardless if you collect everything or not, the game ends with a 'to be continued' message), with reasonably solid controls and an art style vaguely reminiscent of [i]Yoshi's Island[/i] or [i]Kirby's Epic Yarn[/i], albeit nowhere near as good in either design or visual direction, but for an exceptionally cheap platforming time waster? You could do much, much worse.\n\n[b]Rating:[/b] ★★★","timestamp_created":1595246143,"timestamp_updated":1595246362,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.471698105335235596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2feFtvMCdv66lgI="}
