      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n* Lux can fight with DNA mods, which are essentially superpowers\
      \ that are grouped into four classes: Incinerate, Freeze, Shock and Invoke.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\n* She can also use guns. At present, there are eight gun\
      \ types defined.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Guns can be upgraded using weapon parts,\

      \ speed, range, etc.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Lux gains skill points as she levels\

      \n<br />\r\n* Lux\u2019s outfits (and hair) can be changed. There are over 800\

      \ to a unique look.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Collectibles are scattered across each\
      \ level. There are almost 100 collectible items in the game, such as documents,\
      \ audio files, etc. In addition, consumable items such as medkits and shield\
      \ energy packs can be found near combat areas.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* Each level\
      \ contains tasks (e.g. &quot;remove propaganda posters&quot;) which can be used\
      \ to earn XP. Lux can also earn XP by completing challenges (e.g. &quot;kill\
      \ 10 enemies with the sniper rifle&quot;).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n* There are a\
      \ huge variety of enemies. We won\u2019t spoil the journey here, but once you\
