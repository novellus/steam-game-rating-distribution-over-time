Battlestar Galactica was an amazing ride right to the end. Couple of really good fights in there, depending on your play style you can make almost anything work, my ending was Viper's Of Capprica Elite squadron. Its in the cockpit where makes it or break it in battles. Folks I highly encourage you to get this game and all its DLCs, I would have paid more for it.\n\nOnly sad part of this game is that most likely there won't be anymore, but I do hope they reboot this game with a bigger budget. I followed the original shows on VHS back in the day 'ya I am that fracking old'\n\nGreat game Black Labs and Slitherine, I hope this gets to you boys/girls who built this fine work.\nThank you for the entertainment, thank you for your hard work in this.\nPlease, just can you make one more series? Perhaps the fall of the 12 colonies?\nStarbuck, Apollo? Come on...\nPlease? lol\n0 Comments","timestamp_created":1604034712,"timestamp_updated":1604034712,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558139562606811523","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnOr6u/UCeoL/qgI="}
