    review: Click click click. Click click click. Three minutes of clicking text before
      I got my first choice. How did I ever get 7 hours out of this boring dating
      sim/time management game? Another dating sim with Anime girls set in a school.
      Another visual novel with endless minutes of boring reading before you get to
      make a choice. The time management involves far too much effort, though I found
      it fun. Skip this unless you like reading school girl dating romances for middle
      school morons. Will be buried at the bottom of my virtual bookshelf.
