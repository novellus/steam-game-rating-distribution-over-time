While the story is not overall a masterpiece and is more convoluted overcomplicated than great, I still very liked some of the characters and the idea of fusing vs fighting with visual novel in a way where the battle result was your choices for the novel. That being said, I was very interested of what would be this pure visual novel prequel. Well, let's get reviewing. Warning, contain spoilers\n\n\n[b]Story[/b] : like blazblue story, it's entertaining without being that great. The three first chapter are too similar to my liking (meet an union, meet a girl, meet plot) but once the first part of the game over, the plot overall get to the point. \n\n[b]Characters[/b] : without a doubt, the weakest point of the game. The characters  are more there to reference a character of BlazBlue, either by gender-bending one or crossover two, than being their own characters. Some characters don't have personality at all and are only described by their relationship with others characters \n[spoiler](Ringo, Justice, Akira)[/spoiler]. The worse for me is the main character. Listen, if you write a visual novel, either the main character you get the pov must not have personality and be a stand-in for the player, or be at the other end of the spectrum, the most well written and deep character of the cast. Here, the hero have two character traits and its all.\nSpecial mention to the whole path = one girl which is a very classic visual novel system, but not even concluding the path with at least a 'I love you' or/and a kiss. The swiming pool fanservice is okay, but a kiss is too much?\n\n[b]Lore[/b] : The game should have been called Blazblue : Prototype because it's just referencing the previous and latter games in the franchise without giving much. Since we discovered the blazblue world being our future, we wanted the pov of the world it should have been before the calamity. Yet, what we got is normal world with secret magic organisations. Like, for real, it wasn't already completely done and redone? Just read the wiki\n\n[b]Port[/b] : This game suffer from the same problems than other games made with the BlazBlue engine. It was developped for PS systems and the game is more of an emulation of a PS system in a windows on your PC than an actual PC port. Which is why you get not only the pixelated problem if the game launch on 1080p screen and you need to select 720p and return to 1080p to resolve it. The game was once on a CD and it show when the same scene contain sometime 3 different loadings before reaching its end.\n\n[b]Translation[/b] : While I would not usually talk about it, the horrid translation of this game from Japanese to English must have a special mention. I rarely seen such bad translation in a professional work. Even a fan translation would be more respectful of the original text than this. I don't listed them, but the ammount of cases of either direct speech to text translation, or at the other end, approximations that doesn't carry the meaning, is completely out of the roof. I first though it was a problem of the Japanese voice not saying the same as japanes text, but no, it's just the english translation being horrible. When you have two character separating by saying -See you soon, -Farewell (or most precisely : I don't think so), and replacing by having both saying a simple 'goodbye', there is a big problem\n\nGameplay : Ah, we are entering the critical zone of my frustration so I will first give credit where credit is due. The ToI system is both from a meta perspective and a lore perspective very brilliant. It's a great replacement to the classic choice options and [spoiler] explaining the idea of shifting timeline by the knowledge the character got or not from the news/social media is a great idea [/spoiler]\n\nNow let's enter the reason I am so angry with this game in the first place. Let's talk of my game experience. While I would not call myself a visual game expert, I still fully played fate/stay night, Clannad, MuvLuv, Higurashi, and another half dozen. I know how visual novel works, I am experienced in this genre. Yet, this one is the most counter intuitive one I ever played.\n\nFirst play : Didn't understood the Toi was the full choice system. The way the tutoriel work by recommanding to read the three neutral articles before showing you almost immediately a scene tagged as happening because Toi made me think it was complementary to a classic choice system, not it by itself. So of course, I stop using it and got the bad ending at chapter 5/6. I was waiting to have a choice to make, and its pretty much what the bad guy say to you before killing you, but well, I meet the cast, knew more or less the girls who would have a path, and get back to it.\n\nSecond PT : The game being a prequel, I understood one of the path was supposed to be the true end, so I wanted to avoid it and keep it for last. I pretty much understood it was either Es or Hinata path, the former being the obvious, the latter the most probable if obvious was a red herring/bait and switch. So I decided to try to do Kuon path first because I liked her character and she was the girl from the secret magic city. That and well, I am not fond of abusive tsundere like Mei. I was supposing you needed to read the character chart, see what they are interrested in, then select the news that correspond in the bunch. Tried and failed.\n\nThird PT : Thinking I missed something, I redo it selecting all Toi except the Swimming pool one. Why? Because it's the only case the Toi open by force outside the tutoriel, and were the previous article always paired the path by two (Hinata and Es, Kuon and Mei), this one clearly separated them, making me think it was the supposed point of choice. Selected Kuon only, died again\n\n4th: Going frustrated, even more and I must specify that, with one of the worst fast foward in a VN that make you repeat the first chapters in an half hour each time. I was already in by 4 hours. I supposed, from my knowledge of VN, that the game forced the separation and I was to avoid completely all toi except Kuon's. At this point, I had mapped which toi correspond to which character. Made sure only to choose toi with Kuon icon... I reached the same bad ending. Must also precise having exactly the same bad events and bad ending each time without variation doesn't help at all feeling progress.\n\n5th : Did the counter intuitive choice of only taking Kuon AND MEI toi because their toi are paired before the swimpool, finally reached the actual 6th chapter, saved, and respired at least. Decided to map the next tois by selecting them all, the obvious happened, another bad ending which is exactly the same bad ending than previous, but happening this time latter, out of nowhere. By this point, I though there was only one bad ending, just happening at different points.\n\n6th : Did the Kuon path, completed the Kuon end, not as much lore as I would have loved, no real secret interresting scene (Izayoi bad consequences are already known from BB : Continium Shift)\n\n7th : Discovered that once an ending was reached, now the news were tagged before read about which character they concern. Extremely frustrated about the page I wrote to map the paths. Did the Mei path, which was EXACTLY THE SAME than Kuon path but with both switching and the very end of it being the only diference. Hated this end, more over that I hate abusive tsunderes\n\n","timestamp_created":1609063413,"timestamp_updated":1609063413,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40Obp0fYCfKHZvQI="}
