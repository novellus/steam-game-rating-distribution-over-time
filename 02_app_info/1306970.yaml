    about_the_game: "In Diluvian Ultra you play as Atilla, an undead king that is\
      \ awakened in deep space, aboard his tomb, ship by an invasion of unknown enemies.\
      \ He must fight to prevent them from stealing his most sacred object: The Book\
      \ of Life. Without the book, Attila\u2019s order can\u2019t revive the long\
      \ dead human species.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe spaceship is a living combination\
      \ of flesh and stone, teaming with creatures created to serve a purpose aboard\
      \ the ship. Even the doors are alive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDiluvian Ultra is built\
      \ around a damage system where you have to combine weapons to be effective.\
      \ Armor negates most damage, but some weapons are designed to damage only the\
      \ armor itself, setting the victim up for a lethal blow. The player has to be\
      \ careful, as enemies will combine their attacks in the same way. Armor damage\
      \ cannot kill you, but take too much and a single well placed lethal attack\
      \ will kill you in one hit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCombat in Diluvian Ultra is all\
      \ about mobility. Dodge enemy fire, while you chain together ranged attacks\
      \ with close combat blows and devastating ground slams to interrupt and stun\
      \ your enemies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe weapons range from living insect guns,\
      \ to plasma spewing shotguns. Each has a unique special reload function, like\
      \ healing armor damage or turning the magazine into a grenade."
