Some of the dialogue, especially in the more intimate conversations, is really well done and gives substance to the characters. The funny bits also got some hearty chuckles out of me.\nAlso, the suspenseful moments really do their job well. That, combined with the tough choices you make along the way, make for quite the engaging ride, which I'm curious to see how it will turn out when new chapters release in the future.\nIf you're interested in a story with lots of twists and turns, in which your choices actually determine the course, give this game a shot!","timestamp_created":1605715593,"timestamp_updated":1605715593,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ48vCG7vUCeImSrwI="}
