I got it on sale for $5.99, so for $6 I feel like the length of the DLC is good, but I would be disappointed if I had paid the full $10 for it. I really enjoyed the mixing drinks aspect of work because it allowed for a bit more of a time management decision from the player and it was fun to memorize the ingredients. I do wish, however, that the 3 date system was explained a bit more thoroughly. I knew I could only meet the person 3 times, but I didn't know it would be a brief interaction with no personal input, and that they would be judging me strictly on items and clothing I had bought or gifts I brought for them. Overall I still really enjoyed the DLC, and I'd recommend it to anyone who really enjoys the base game.","timestamp_created":1609795256,"timestamp_updated":1609795256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7MfR5/YCfdXBwAI="}
