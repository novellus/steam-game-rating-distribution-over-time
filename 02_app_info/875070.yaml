    review: 'As always a very good module for our favorite Virtual Tabletop program.
      I recommand it. For me there is a major let down though and it is a problem
      since the release of Mordenkainen''s Tome of Foes : there is no more decal for
      the background of FG. I want to enjoy the art of at least the covers of my virtual
      books. Come on guys, give us decals !'
