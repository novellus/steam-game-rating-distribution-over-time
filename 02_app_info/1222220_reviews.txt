The creator utilises said engine in a really imaginative way, using the top half of the screen to advance the narrative in a comic-book fashion while the player plays on the bottom portion (though some levels are full-screen).  There are diverging paths in the story as well, which will no doubt play a greater role as the story unfolds. As far as the story goes, some things were a little unclear (the general is a bad guy putting everybody to sleep?) but it's only the first chapter. Graphically, the pixel characters are pleasing to the eye with a good palette choice on the colours. Being on the Platfinity engine, there are limitations to the animations, but these don't detract from the game \n\nWhile containing only one of the planned 7 chapters, for $3 it's a good way to help this indie dev bring his full story to the screen. \n","timestamp_created":1584302375,"timestamp_updated":1584302375,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547872304916381836","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4hfjx7/ACfpOv+AE="}
