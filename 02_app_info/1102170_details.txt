Personally, I want to feel like I’m competing against my own skills, rather than against the game itself – if I fail I want it to be because I couldn’t work it out, not because the game threw a curveball at me. Depixtion pulls this off beautifully and I know I’ll definitely be returning to levels I already beat to see if I can do them faster.”<br><a
