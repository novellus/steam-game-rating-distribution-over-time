You get a massive party of characters to fight in RPG battles.\n\"Oh ha ha,\" you say, \"like that mobile Final Fantasy game where you just tap to attack right?\"\nNO. Each of the characters has stats and unique moves, and combo moves, and an HP and MP pool of their own. They're like characters from any other oldschool RPG, except you get 100 of them at once.\n\nIt's cool for a while, give it a spin.","timestamp_created":1586657368,"timestamp_updated":1586657368,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/MKJtvECcdGLgAI="}
