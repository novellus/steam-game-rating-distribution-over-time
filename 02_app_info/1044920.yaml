    review: 'bad... not a good game hard too setup controllers , laggy fighting not
      done game!!


      wast of a good idea, forced team even if you do some how get the controllers
      too work together it clunky hard to control direction of moves vary limited
      moves vary limited game play got stuck and had to restart in town 4 times only
      got controllers to properly work once then when i exit the game and go back
      can''t get them too work again ??? why i try''d every thing even what i did
      the first time i got it too work and nothing,, i could ignore the poor game
      play if the controls were easyer to setup and use.. tho it hard to aim in game
      you really can''t tell what your going to hit or how to aim a bow i can''t justify
      paying for this game till it gets fixed ... i see other problems in the game
      too.. it too bad i like the concept the in game menu is really nice and easy
      too use the playable people are intresting even if limited to play type and
      weapon type the action how ever slow and it doesn''t seem that the one who made
      the game used or even looked into how other games use weapons , thats deffenitly
      needed for a game like this . TRY demo before you buy..'
