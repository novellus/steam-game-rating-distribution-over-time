    short_description: Peeping at Odd Jobs through a mirror? One morning, Gin-san
      notices that the Odd Jobs kitchen has been fitted with a brand-new mirror. Stuck
      on it is a note from Otose, but it was all a ruse for Sacchan to peep at Gin-san
      from inside the mirror! Just what **** side of Gin-san will she end up...
