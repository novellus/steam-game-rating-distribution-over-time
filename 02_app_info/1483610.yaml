    about_the_game: 'GravitreX started as a contender in the Swedish Game Awards Warm-up
      competition &quot;80''s Warm-up&quot;, which had 80''s as its theme. GravitreX
      won that competition, and was later ported to Android. After a few years on
      Android, it was then turned into an arcade cabinet. Two or three cabinets still
      exist today, in different barcades in the Phoenix Arizona region. It has now
      come time to complete the circle and port it back to PC and Steam.<br><br>This
      2D physics simulation has you trying to land two ships on their respective platform.
      Like the old classic Lunar Lander, but much more difficult and more heavily
      physics based.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Two ships
      to land, even in singleplayer<br></li><li>Ships are equipped with a grabber
      which can be used to lift boxes or other ships<br></li><li>Ships are also equipped
      with an AutoHover System which can be activated by holding down the Switch Ships
      button (B)<br></li><li>Ships have lots of systems that can be damaged<br></li><li>When
      damaged, a classic synthetic voice will say what systems are damaged<br></li><li>The
      voice warnings can be acknowledged (muted) by pressing a button<br></li><li>As
      this is the Arcade version, every play you will start on level one with three
      ships<br></li><li>Extra ships are awarded every 30k points<br></li><li>35 levels
      of increasing difficulty. We are not kidding on this one.<br></li><li>Perfect
      for Arcade Cabinets, can even be set up to accept coins (See ''If you happen
      to have an arcade cabinet'' section below)<br></li><li>Steam achievements<br></li><li>Classic
      arcade style highscore with initials, with online entries from your Steam friends
      (All-time), and Global (Today).</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Controls:</h2><strong>XBox
      360 Controller:</strong><br>Bumpers = Thrusters<br>(A) = Grabber<br>(B) = Switch
      Ships / AutoHover (hold)<br>(X) = Acknowledge warnings (until something else
      breaks!)<br>(Y) = Self Destruct<br><br><strong>Keyboard:</strong><br>Left/Right

      next pushes a control will become Player 2. If Player 1 has switched ships Player
      2 will control Ship 1 only until the end of the level. Starting next level,
      Player 1 controls Ship 1. Once a second player has joined in, the game cannot
      go back to 1 player until the next game.<h2 class="bb_tag">Tips and tricks:</h2><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>A Ship that''s been turned upside-down can usually be rescued
      using the grabber and the other ship. Don''t immediately Self Destruct!<br></li><li>Firing
      both thrusters simultaneously will stop the ship''s rotation. If the ship is
      rotating to the right and you press both thrusters, only the right thruster
      will fire first, until the rotation has stopped. Unless, of course, the stabilizing
      system on that side is damaged.<br></li><li>If both ships are destroyed at the
      same time, the level will be reset. Sometimes you will need to reset a level
      by self destructing both ships. If one ship is destroyed and you realize the
      level will need to be reset, Self Destruct the other ship quickly before it
      respawns, otherwise it will cost an additional life!</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">If
      you happen to have an arcade cabinet</h2>This only applies to cabinets with
      a PC inside of them of course. In the Options screen you will find an option
      that may interest you:<br><br><br><strong>Coin Handling:</strong><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>None:
      This is the normal PC setting. There is no concept of coins, and players can
      jump in from any controller<br></li><li>Freeplay: No coins needed to play, just
      press 1P or 2P start.<br></li><li>Internal: This is the normal Cabinet setting.
      Inserting coins increases the credits (''5'' on the keyboard or Select on the
      controller).<br></li><li>External: This is if you have an external coin mechanism
      with its own credit counter. It should send keypresses to tell the game the
      credits situation: ''0'' for No credits (''INSERT COIN'' will be displayed),
      ''8'' for 1 credit (''Press 1P Start'' will be displayed), or ''9'' for Multiple
      credits (''Press 1P or 2P Start'' will be displayed). Also, Multiple Credits
      can be pressed again and again to play the coin inserted sound effect.</li></ul><br>In
      all coin modes except ''None'', pressing 1P start (''1'' on the keyboard, or
      Start on Controller 1) will start a 1P game and P1 then controls the game either
      from keyboard or controller 1. Pressing 2P Start will start a 2P game, with
      P2 controlling Ship 2 from the alternate keyboard controls (see below) or controller
      2. In the ''None'' mode, pressing any input on any controller will start a game
      with P1 controlling the game from that controller, and the second controller
      to receive a button press will join as P2.<br><br>The alternate keyboard controls
      are:<br>Q/A = Thrusters<br>S = Grabber<br>I = Switch Ships / AutoHover (hold)<br>W
      = Acknowledge warnings<br>K = Self Destruct<br><i>These are not placed ideally
      for playing on a keyboard, they are meant to be mapped to from an I-PAC or similar
      arcade button to keyboard key converter.</i><br><br>If you have a cabinet with
      default Mame key assignments, delete the &quot;KeyMap.cfg&quot; file and rename
      the &quot;KeyMap_MAME.cfg&quot; file to &quot;KeyMap.cfg&quot;. If you have
      different keys assigned, edit the file and adjust accordingly. Because many
      cabinets only have three buttons, in this config the stick is used for three
      of the buttons. Left=Mute, Down=Self Destruct and Right=Switch ships/Autohover.
      Feel free to change these if you have more buttons and want to use them.<br><br>Most
      arcade frontends can be tricked into launching PC games, usually by creating
      a dummy &quot;Emulator&quot; called PC, and maybe a dummy file as the &quot;rom&quot;.
      This way GravitreX can coexist with all your other arcade games! If your cabinet
      does not have internet access, set Highscores to local in the options, and it
      will save highscores locally to a file instead (local highscores can also be
      selected from the options menu).<br><br>If you have a cabinet (or plan to build
      one), and want to put it somewhere public and actually charge real money from
      people, get in touch with us about getting a commercial license and a customized
      non-steam version of the game.'

    short_description: This 2D physics simulation has you trying to land two ships
      on their respective platform. Like the old classic Lunar Lander, but much more
      difficult and more heavily physics based.
