It's a very pretty model, but super glitchy. The plane would constantly glitch on the ground, and it made the runways and taxiways glitch out even when I wasn't using this plane. This DLC comes with an installer, so I removed everything from it entirely from the FSX directory and the game has been back to normal since. It was the only change I made, so it must have been this DLC. Come to think, I'll try to manually put the model into the FSX:SE directory and see if that works because this DLC comes with 2 extra Missions and add-on scenery and probably some other garbage that glitches the game. Hopefully it's all the ancillary junk that they included that's causing this plane to crap out my game and I can actually get my money's worth with just the model.","timestamp_created":1607125871,"timestamp_updated":1607125871,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mdWKmPYCe66vtwI="}
