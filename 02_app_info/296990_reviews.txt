Gameplay-wise, it'll still be [b]Breach & Clear[/b], only now there'll be randomly generated maps, deep soundtrack and simplified visuals from [b]Frozen Synapse[/b]. [b]DLC[/b] comes with five missions long “campaign” that'll be available in all three [b]Breach & Clear[/b] modes (“kill 'em all”, “disarm the bomb” and “rush for the exit”), bu-u-ut that'll be it. And it's not like randomly generated maps will add much (those actually look better on paper than they feel in the game).\n\nAs the result, this [b]DLC[/b] totally doesn't worth [b]$3.99[/b] / [b]£2.79[/b]. It's pretty much more of the same, now with simplified visuals. It won't prolong your experience with [b]Breach & Clear[/b] much, it won't add much to the game, and there's still no proper story. It's still totally playable, though, and there's nothing seriously bad about it (hence the thumb up). It's just not worth paying extra for it. You get it in a bundle, or something like that – you won't feel bad about playing through it. At all. Quite the opposite, actually. But if you're short on money, you may as well skip it. Just because there's not much to see here.","timestamp_created":1574695858,"timestamp_updated":1574695858,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.623058319091796875","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9f3L0e4CeJLM3AE="}
