It has all of the standard eFunSoft Match 3 mechanics set inside a mystery to solve.  Instead of solving levels to upgrade your Castle/Village/etc, you solve levels to get access to clues that will hopefully help to solve the mystery.  Getting clues sometimes leads to fun mini-games like HOG or Match pairs.  The mystery solving aspect really makes the game interesting.","timestamp_created":1602366596,"timestamp_updated":1602366596,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52702707052230835","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuryfivUCfq+OpwI="}
