Considering the price it is well worth it. Like most games I feel that its not super different from any other but it is fun to play. Though i get frustrated already at the beginning. The con for this game is that i find that you side scroll faster than going forward which i used to my advantage later in the game. Overall, for the price of the game and what you get out of that I do recommend this game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgYxvy3ytyA","timestamp_created":1558025202,"timestamp_updated":1558025202,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541856944561004639","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlb3i4OoCd4ynwQE="}
