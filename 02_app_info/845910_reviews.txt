Lovecraft short story portrayed in 1920's style B&W silent film with sound track. Highly recommended to Cthulhu experts and fans worldwide. \n\nThe feature is half normal length so you will have some time left within the hour to make some lemonade and popping corn, enjoy.","timestamp_created":1550074818,"timestamp_updated":1550074818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3ZXq8+gCcfPnugE="}
