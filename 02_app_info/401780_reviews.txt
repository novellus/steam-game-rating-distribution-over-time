I personally found it clunky to play, with some of the NPC's being impervious to bullets, whilst thoes other NPC fell to the ground.   \n\nOverall the timings of the the game are really off the mark, to the point where the example screen grabs in the store front, are not a fair example of the real game play experiance.   In my case, if I didn't hold down the D key too speed up the car.  The NPC's would kill my charictor before the window of opertunity too shoot the target, became available.   \n\nThis is nothing more than a poor quality duck hunt game, that is packaged with a morral blurb that seems like an after thought given what the game is about.   I won't be playing this again as it's just a slow paced game, with a lot of bugs in the game.   \n\nThis should be a 99¢ game and not £2.79.  \n     \n","timestamp_created":1465785257,"timestamp_updated":1465785257,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4woHno9UCeMLhWQ=="}
