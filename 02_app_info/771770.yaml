      story is set in the beautiful yet dangerous world of Etherion, which is made
      up of thousands of islands floating above a dense Miasma. Rising at night and
      burning off during the day, the Miasma spawns terrible creatures and is a constant
      menace to the people of Etherion. The only safe areas are located at the top

      airship is the main form of transportation on Etherion. These vehicles play
      a vital roll in all aspects of life on the Isles.<br><br><strong>Game play</strong><br><br>The
      environment in this game is completely destructible. Terrains and structures
      can be altered and destroyed. Monsters respond in a physics-based fashion. Fire
      propagates dynamically. <br><br>Perhaps the most important feature of the game
      is the removal of traditional definition of &quot;class&quot; or &quot;level&quot;.
      Instead, players have to venture into the world in order to acquire power and
      magic spells from monsters and lore books. And their increase in power is not
      represented in terms of simply dps but in physical effects. Let's use a fireball
      as an example, instead of a higher leveled player having higher dps, as you
      increase in experience and power in IoE, you would be able to generate fireballs
      of larger size and/or further reach. It, in a sense, removes a lot of the predictability
      out of character advancement, allows more freedom and enhances the sense of
      adventure. You can't grind and watch the numbers grow. You need to explore and
      interact with the world in order to acquire new skills, spells and power!
