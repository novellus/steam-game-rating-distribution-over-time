    review: "[h1] Great physics puzzle game [/h1] \nExcellent puzzle game that through\
      \ the use of lenses, mirrors, prisms and other objects challenges us to intelligently\
      \ solve the different levels by striking a beam of light on them to illuminate\
      \ the objective, all accompanied by excellent background music.\nWe have for\
      \ each puzzle a minimum of different options in which it can be solved and we\
      \ can also discover new ways that will help us achieve some game achievements.\
      \ I was so absorbed that I solved it in a run, it is a game with 31 levels that\
      \ can be done more than once and it can take us between 7 and 10 hours of play.\
      \ I recommend it 100% and I only suggest to the developers that it is good to\
      \ see the number of the puzzle we are in.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
      Excelente juego de puzzle que a trav\xE9s del uso de lentes, espejos, prismas\
      \ y otros objetos nos desaf\xEDa a resolver con inteligencia los diferentes\
      \ niveles incidiendo un haz de luz en ellos para llegar a iluminar el objetivo,\
      \ todo acompa\xF1ado de una excelente m\xFAsica ambiental. \nTenemos para cada\
      \ puzzle un m\xEDnimo de opciones diferentes en las que se puede resolver y\
      \ tambi\xE9n podemos descubrir nuevas formas que nos ayudaran a conseguir algunos\
      \ logros del juego. Me absorbi\xF3 tanto que lo resolv\xED de corrido, es un\
      \ juego de 31 niveles que pueden ser realizados mas de una vez y nos puede insumir\
      \ entre 7 y 10 horas de juego. Lo recomiendo al 100% y solo le sugiero a los\
      \ desarrolladores que sea mas sencillo ver el numero de puzzle en el que estamos.\n\
