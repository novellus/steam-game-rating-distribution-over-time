You manage operations in your country those being, deciding to close borders, schools, stores, events and the industry, as well as having the option to force masks. Depending on whether you decide to close down certain operations or force masks it affects the infection, death and recovery rate. As well as economic growth, unemployment rate, your overall reputation as leader and how how effective the health system performs that including vaccine progress.  This also ties into how much money you make for your budget to pay for different investments those being, vaccine research, health system capacity, economy propaganda, virus propaganda and business aid packaging. Each of those investments costing $10 each. It's somewhat hard to know what the right strategy is going in and what to spend your money on which is frustrating but I suppose you could argue it makes the game more challenging, but that is mainly the reason it makes the game less interesting to me.\n\nOverall its a basic simulation that may have a few hours of play time if you really enjoy these types of games. It's only $1.99 and goes for cheaper occasionally. I would personally recommend it to people if you're buying a ton of games on sale otherwise its not a must play.\n\n7.5/10","timestamp_created":1607567557,"timestamp_updated":1607650936,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzNDdp/YCe7XDuAI="}
