    review: 'An unusual German route for TS as it''s not electrified for most of its
      length.  In real life it''s part steam heritage, part regional railway, and
      part mothballed, so you can convincingly run almost any non-electric German
      stock from the last sixty years.  The central section has some big loops, spiral
      tunnels and long viaducts, but the gradient isn''t too extreme. It''s nicely
      modelled and has quite a charming rural feel to it.


      The stock and scenarios are bizarre. The BR 86 is valid, but having it pull
      modern wagons is not.  I don''t know why DTG didn''t throw in a regional diesel
      MU, that would have been good.


      It''s a nice place to run German stock in quick drive as AI is minimal in real
      life, so you won''t miss it. I give it a qualified recommendation, which means
      buy it in a sale.'
