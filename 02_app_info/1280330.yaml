      \ necessary.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[b]Bimirror World Mirage[/b] is a\
      \ lewd RPG about two sisters' quest to return to their home world.\n\n[h1]Game-play[/h1]\n\
      A stereotypical, unbalanced RPGMaker experiance \u2014 spam \"skills\" 'n \"\
      heals\" to win. Enemies can and will stun lock your party and kill you by a\
      \ [i]thousand cuts.[/i] There is a distinct lack of interactivity with the environment,\
      \ which left me with little motivation to explore the world. [i]Better[/i] RPGMaker\
      \ games have plentiful interactive objects, encouraging players to peek inside\
      \ every nook and cranny.\n\nThis is the first RPG I've played where [i]so many[/i]\
      \ enemies can spawn that they spawn off-screen during battle.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\
      Ymir was chatin' with her pal, Memiru about a nearby \"waste factory\". She\
      \ wanted to give it gander, and Memiru didn't want her doing so alone. As it\
      \ turns out, the facility was [i]no factory[/i]\u2014 rather, it was a front\
      \ for an interdimensional portal. The two ladies were sucked inside, and after\
      \ a near-death experience were rescued by a Hedne, a powerful warrior. He explains\
      \ that they need to find the [i]Tower of Mirror[/i] to go home. They are lost\
      \ in the Bimirror Field, a conglomeration of two worlds, held together by the\
      \ [i]Mirage Mirror.[/i] Their journey to the Tower will be an arduous one, \n\
      \nYmir and Memiru stumble upon a confrontation between the Imperial army. Captain\
      \ Biged has been extorting towns for money, imprisoning any who oppose or can't\
      \ pay. He abducted a young lady, as \"compensation\" for a villager's lack of\
      \ funding. Ymir and Memiru decide to pursue him, and end his reign (that is,\
      \ on their way to the Tower of Mirror). During their journey, they will get\
      \ sidetracked by thieves and scoundrels, and [i]rapey[/i] monsters.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\n\
      The titlescreen was a bit of a mess \u2014 difficult to read, and lacking any\
      \ sort of user configuration. The game boots into fullscreen by default, but\
      \ it can booted into a [i]dinky[/i] window using RPGMaker's in-built options\
      \ (by pressing \"F1\"). The in-game interface was good enough, but riddled with\
      \ strange translations and misspellings.\n\n[b]- Goodies -[/b]\nThe artwork\
      \ looks great, on par for any good hentai game. The monsters look plasticy,\
      \ but the heroines are excellent. There are a total of twelve unlockable scenes,\
      \ each based on one more (static) CGs (with many variants detailing sexual progression).\
      \ The poor English translation makes the sex scenes difficult to read. Expect\
      \ female nudity and male-on-female intercourse.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nI don't\
      \ recommend this title. It's a poor RPGMaker experience \u2014 the gameplay\
      \ isn't terribly fun, and sexual content (though well drawn) scant and poorly\
      \ translated. Twelve CGs and a few nude portraits isn't much for an RPG, especially\
      \ for one priced at [i]nine USD.[/i] This game suffers from a lack of balance\
      \ and content.\n\n[h1]Support the Wombat[/h1]\nIf you enjoy my reviews, please\
      \ follow my Curator page. Trust me, [b]you want to.[/b]\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/curator/36272124-Wombat-Trap/\n\
