    about_the_game: "Ultimate Survivor Bundle<br />\r\nSuit up your survivor with\
      \ the best gear and weapons in Harran by turning him into the Ninja, the Secret\
      \ Agent, or the Urban Explorer. Craft four extremely powerful tools of destruction\
      \ and bring fighting the Infected to a completely new level. Grab all these\
      \ bonus in-game items in one go.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBuzz Killer Weapon Pack<br\
      \ />\r\nSledgehammer with barbed wire around the head and working buzz saws\
      \ attached on each of its ends. Especially effective against big, armored enemies\
      \ as it cuts easily through their plating. If you had trouble fighting the Demolishers,\
      \ the Buzz Killer will now make short work of them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNight\
      \ Club Weapon Pack<br />\r\nSteel pipe coupled with a glow tube protected by\
      \ a metal casing. At night the tube flickers giving scant illumination. But\
      \ every time you land a critical hit, the tube produces a short but painfully\
      \ bright flash that blinds all enemies in range, making their execution a mere\
      \ formality.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Lacerator Weapon Pack<br />\r\nAn improvised\
      \ weapon resembling a rake but definitely much more lethal. Its long sturdy\
      \ shaft is crowned with a head of six shredded blades that cut deep into enemy\
      \ flesh. With the Lacerator, you can make broad swings that will painfully wound\
      \ multiple targets at once!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Constable Weapon Pack<br\
      \ />\r\nThe Constable is a tough police baton wrapped in electrified barbed\
      \ wire. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, it\u2019s tipped with a spiked head that\
      \ generates plasma-like discharges \u2013 electrocuting those who dare come\
      \ too close.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNinja Outfit<br />\r\nDon a mask of a Japanese\
      \ assassin and blend into the shadows of the quarantine zone.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nUrban Explorer Outfit<br />\r\nGet ready to dive deep into the city jungle\
      \ with a protective vest, knee pads, and sturdy boots. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      Special Agent Outfit<br />\r\nDress in style and elegance as you dismember zombies\
      \ in fountains of blood."
