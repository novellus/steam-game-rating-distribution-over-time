There are three different areas to experience and depending on your actions you can reach up to three different endings.\nThe music and sound effects create a surprisingly relaxing atmosphere.\n\nI only encountered a minor problem after replaying the game again where the first stage kind of shifts and looks broken.\nBeyond that I thoroughly enjoyed my time spent in this surreal world.","timestamp_created":1594746309,"timestamp_updated":1594746309,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mLGSp/MCfPqilQI="}
