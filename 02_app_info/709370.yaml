    short_description: BadRobots VR is an action shooter where your goal is to stop
      the boss from turning robots bad, use your bullet-time ability to finish off
      larger groups of robots from one wave. Be careful tho, you'll never regain hitpoints
      after each wave and you only got three charges of bullet-time.

    review: "Is this game worth a buy? I'd simply say: \n\n-Yes! For being a fast\
      \ shooter game i had lots of fun with it. It's both fun and challanging (at\
      \ times) \nIf you're looking for a story driven game, this is not for you. However,\
      \ if you're trying to kill some time i recommend this game. If gaming alone\
      \ ain't for you and gets boring, compete with your friends for the highest highscore.\
      \ This is simply a download and play type of game. No real introduction is needed.\
      \ \n\nI love the bullet time feature in the game. At times it gets stressful\
      \ with enemies coming all around you, if you're not on high alert on your surroundings\
      \ you will probably die within minutes. The bullet time helps you relax a little\
      \ bit in the stressful environment. \n\nAnother reason why i like this game\
      \ is the surroundings. I feel there's some variety between the diffrent stages.\
      \ Wich helps keeping you intressted. However, i would like to see a more variety\
      \ of weapons in a form of DLC(?) But as for now, i had a great time playing\
      \ it. \n\nAs of my understanding BeBold is a fairly new game devoloper thats\
      \ a little bit rough on the edges but got a really good start. I can't wait\
      \ to see what you hold for other games in the future. I'm a though critic but\
      \ i'd rate this game 8/10 there are room for improvement like always in newly\
      \ released games. \n\nKeep up the good work."
