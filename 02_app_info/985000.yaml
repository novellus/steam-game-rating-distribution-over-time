    review: I liked Garden Paws and wanted to give this a try. I love Halloween and
      the spooky theme did not disappoint! I do hope they add costumes like witch
      or zombie or vampire and other skins. It would be cool to make the house look
      even more spooky with my own cobwebs or graveyard upgrades. But I found the
      material gathering to be easy and simple and enjoyable. It is a little grindy
      but that is too be expected in a game like this. I do think there should be
      a few more tutorials. You can drink OR throw a potion but there is no guide
      saying what the potion does or what will happen if you throw the potion versus
      drinking it. I like the little notes from the previous house owner. I think
      the forest is easy to navigate. And the graphics are super cute! I have only
      just unlocked the earth zone, I was a little confused because of all the green
      smoke surrounding the sign. I thought I needed a potion to get through, but
      it turns out you just walk in front of the sign and it asks if you want to enter
      the earth zone. I would get rid of the smoke there or make it more obvious how
      to enter. I am also relieved we can sell raw materials and not just potions.
      All in all I am enjoying this game so far and will continue to keep playing!
