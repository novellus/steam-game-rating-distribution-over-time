    about_the_game: "You are the elusive hacker, edie88, and your job is to bring\
      \ down the corrupt owner of Waylife Bank by guiding your trusty partner in anti-crime,\
      \ Bit, into the mainframe of a 1988 bank's computer system and revealing the\
      \ fraudulent transactions of CEO Peter Mohw.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPower your way\
      \ through 11 computer systems, totaling 88 levels of increasing difficulty and\
      \ speed. Swing from point to point, revealing the data in the code and avoiding\
      \ the anti-invasion programs, ranging from simple electrified walls to vicious\
      \ spider-like assailants. Fire your pulse shot to destroy them, or to reveal\
      \ the hidden lights for a moment to aide you in your quest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThe better you perform in each system, the more upgrades you earn, not only\
      \ to spruce up Bit with new colors, but gain useful improvements to your abilities.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThe three-button control scheme seems simple at first, but\
      \ may prove a greater challenge than you expected. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures:<br\
      \ />\r\n- Difficult controls that are rewarding to master<br />\r\n- 88 Levels\
      \ of varying difficulty<br />\r\n- Several upgrades, both colorful and mechanical<br\
      \ />\r\n- Fun patterns and intense challenge levels<br />\r\n- Obstacles and\
      \ enemies of all sorts<br />\r\n- Engaging story"

    review: "Its very simple, palyed it while watching esports tournaments. and chatting\
      \ with people. \n\nI RQ at the last last level of the 1st system (world) and\
      \ only picked up this game again months after and basicly run through it and\
      \ it was a blast with a great ending that does gain value if you're a WhompComic.com\
      \ reader (you should)."
