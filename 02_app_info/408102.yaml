    review: Another useless DLC to suck our wallets. The dragons have the same AI
      as the other NPCs from the game, purely stupid. Why do the dragons have wings
      here, if they don't even fly? Between these dragons and the dinosaurs, there
      is no difference. We can kill them way before they can even spit fire. I assume
      these are also pre-made models.
