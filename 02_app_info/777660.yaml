      /><br>Welcome to the contested area of space at the crossing of borders of 3
      space superpowers. After the great war between the civilizations of humans,
      reptiloids and insectoids, the borders were redefined, and only one cluster
      of space remained without clear status, as each of three races continues to
      claim it. As a result, this region became an area of never-ending war, attracting
      not only regular military, but also mercenaries and adventurers of all kinds.<br>Three
      distinguished heroes, each with his or her own story, came into this region
      as well. Choose one of them and start fighting for your cause!<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/777660/extras/2.png?t=1593664695"

    review: 'I thought this game had some kind of campaign or objectives when I purchased
      it but unfortunately that wasn''t the case. Each character''s ''story'' is just
      a tooltip on the upgrade page.


      This game is basically just a deathmatch arena vs bots of random ship classes.
      So theres a chance that if you spawn in with your D class ship, a couple A class
      bots may also spawn to just instantly destroy you on sight. Likewise You may
      spawn in as an S class ship and all the bots are B class or lower, making for
      zero challenge.


      I purchased this on sale so I wasn''t extremely disappointed, but I also felt
      like there was plenty of room for improvement.


      For achievement hunters: this game is probably going to take around 5-6 hours,
      and some of the achievements are impossible to get unless you use a modified
      config file from the games single guide.'
