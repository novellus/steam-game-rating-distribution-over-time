The combat mode on a steam-pad is very intuitive and in combination with the character customisation options and the abundant loot, this game made me lose sense of time. I´m very eager to get deeper into this world, solve more quests and to see things getting darker and darker! :D \nOverall it´s a very unique gaming experience, I can`t wait this juwel to grow and looking forward for more DLCs!","timestamp_created":1523531393,"timestamp_updated":1523643326,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510638296604156494","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw44OO4OICdqqGngE="}
