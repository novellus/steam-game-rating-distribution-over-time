    review: I'd definitely say the deluxe edition of "Flinthook" is worth purchasing.
      For only a few bucks more than the original game, you get an awesome art book
      (I'd estimate 100 plus pages of illustrations, concept art, etc.) plus some
      nice backgrounds (some of them are a bit repetitive but some of them are really
      quite nice) and the crowning jewel.. the OST! I'd say the OST is worth the extra
      few bucks in itself, just because the music in this game is fantastic, reminds
      me a lot of retro style or retro inspired soundtracks like Mega Man or Shovel
      Knight, for example. If you enjoy "Flinthook" which IMO anyone in their right
      mind would enjoy this game, then I'd say the deluxe addition is worth it!
