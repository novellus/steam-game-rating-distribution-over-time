      \ or doesn't have enough power to fire its weapons \u2013 that\u2019s okay.\
      \ You decide what you drive. When you take out other players, you can scavenge\
      \ from the wreckage too, and use it to repair or upgrade your own vehicle in-game.<br><br>Your\
      \ design choices aren't just cosmetic - they're truly functional and at the\
      \ very least affect the weight and balance of your vehicle.<br><br>In the full\
      \ version you can Battle in single-player against the AI, on LAN, or over the\
      \ Internet, plus easily host your own LAN or Internet games."
