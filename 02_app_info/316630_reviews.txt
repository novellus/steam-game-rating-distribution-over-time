I could have gone to rpg makers page and got more sprites and they would be put in my game file instead of having to search for them. this is not acceptable for a product you have to pay for. not to mention this problem has been going on since 2015 and has not been addressed or fixed by the creator. I don't know how steam allows it to still be here.","timestamp_created":1581580790,"timestamp_updated":1581581251,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m9blnvACe8b48QE="}
