You got your standard double jump and dash and that's pretty much it \nand it could be fun if it wasn't for the very uninspiring locations and lack of challenge.\n\nPuzzles: \nBraindead. \n\nCombat: \nCombat feels really chunky and unsatisfying, there are only 2 combos in total and the light attack combo is pretty much\nuseless since the heavy one deals with the enemies quicker. Later on you unlock 2 skills which add no depth to the combat at all. There are 5 enemy types in total plus one boss that you have to fight 4 times. The enemy types are all pretty early revealed \nin the game so combat pretty much feels like a chore you don't wanna do. This all wouldn't be to much of a problem if the game wasn't that combat heavy, but it is, and it's fucking boring.\n\nStory: \nAllright I guess? The cutscenes don't have any other animations then Garland just walking around and a camera showing you\nthe location, I think Garland the protagonist is the only one who has mouth animations when he talks but the Witch (Main Antagonist) doesn't for some reason. Quick sidenote: I think there are only 3 voice actors in this game but for some reason during the bossfights with the witch they only managed to have her record ONE WORD for all of her attacks, which was sooooo fucking annoying to listen to, it's like every 20 seconds a fucking HYAAAH. Is there literally no other sound she can make or say, do they have to pay the voice actors millions of dollars for one word?\n\nVisual/Graphics: \nIt's quit nice... but it get's underwhelming quit quick cause the most colors you are gonna see is white, red and brown/grey tones. Although the vinyard was a nice change but idk it didn't really change much. \n\nOverall if you have a big love for platforming games you can get that game when it's on sale for 10 or 5 bucks or whatever\ncause 20 is way to much for a 5 to 7 hour long game with a result that is gonna leave you unsatisfied. Quit dissapointing but who knows maybe they do better games or a better sequel if this blows off.","timestamp_created":1609964589,"timestamp_updated":1609964589,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/MHX7PYCfvSMwQI="}
