I has no changable settings whatsoever. You are forced to go through the tutorial every time you play. OH and its literally 1 FCING ROOM!!!!! The whole game!!!!. This game is worth 42 cents......for 5 bucks I want at least 30 minutes of entertainment.......the only thing I can say positive about it is it works and your not stuck in one spot the entire time. I experienced no problems running it....Although even running a 1070 i experienced some fps dips.....but that aint saying much for a game thats over faster than i can take a dump......\n\nThe textures are washed out.....the animations are stiff and theres 3 enemies total in the game....flyer..... crawler.....walker.......I believe theres a total of 5 sound files in the game........\n\nEvery one of these games that has chinese writing in the titles has been a short cash grab.....never again will i waste my money\n\nGarbage like this is whats ruining VR and making people who are on the fence of buying VR hardware think twice before investing their money......STOP MAKING THIS JUNK!!!!!!","timestamp_created":1487912170,"timestamp_updated":1487987231,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.736315608024597168","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1488268436,"developer_response":"Dear SGT, \n\nIt's a pity that our game didn't provide you with pleasant experience, while also leaving you a bad impression on Chinese VR games.\nSureal is a startup team focusing on VR game design and production. We strive everyday for our dream, hoping that one day we could be able to make our own high-end games. We are desperate to see that someday Sureal could make this game that only\"took 1 guy a week or 2\". The Souce of Evil is our first VR game, there's still room for improvement, but we did make it with all our hearts. \nAs a startup team, we did put a lot of effort, resource, time and money in this 'simple' game as in your eyes. Like most game teams, we hope to gain a little revenue via Steam to subsidize our expense, but we hope for more encouragement and support from players to motivate us to fulfill our dream.\nThanks for playing and leaving your feedback. You have offered some good advice to a team that is charting a path toward VR business. We will keep working on this game and release more interesting contents.\n\nThank you for your support. Thanks for all the player's support!"}],"cursor":"AoJ4kem8udoCdeX5cg=="}
