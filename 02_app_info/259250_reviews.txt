However, because multiplayer is mostly inactive, I'd only recommend purchasing this if you want extinction, which albeit fairly repetitive, is pretty good. Furthermore, this DLC is included in the Gold Edition of [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/209160/Call_of_Duty_Ghosts/] Call of Duty: Ghosts[/url]. So when you buy that edition, you won't need to purchase this separately.","timestamp_created":1596239583,"timestamp_updated":1596239583,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48eLS0/MCdYXZmAI="}
