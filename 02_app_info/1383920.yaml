    about_the_game: 'Shattering Obsidian is an epic, Indie, fantasy and steampunk
      rpg, which centres around exciting narrative and character development. A setting,
      and story, unlike anything you have played before.<br><br>The world you have
      known crumbles before you. With a rag-tag bunch of refugees, you''ll struggle
      to survive in a hostile, war-torn land. Your fellow survivors each have their
      own tales of tragedy, comedy and betrayal, <br>Uncover the darkest secrets governing
      the planet. Make choices which will transform a broken world.  Embrace resistance
      or surrender to wealth, power and influence. <br><br>You''ll play NOT as a warrior,
      but as a healer called Nisha, a Runeward who can manipulate elemental essence.
      Starting out inexperienced and naive, her skills, understanding and power grow
      throughout her journey. Some whisper that Nisha must be a prophetess of future
      portents and signs. To others, she''ll never be anything more than a serving-girl
      who knows how to patch up scrapes and bruises.<br><br>Desperation and treachery
      await, as a world slowly dies. But there is always that spark of potential to
      be found within unknowing heroes. A spark which could ignite the flame of hope.
      Can you find that spark?<br><br>KEY FEATURES:<br>-Epic, Indie fantasy role-playing
      adventure in a unique world.<br>-Experience playing as a Healer and break the
      heroic mold.<br>-Uncover the fascinating lore of the Obsidian Tower, and the
      surrounding world.<br>-Many different endings. Your choices will change the
      world.<br>-Hand-crafted graphics and music.<br>-Based on a collection of short
      stories, the first of which has been published in ''Bards and Sages'' magazine.<br>

      with the embattled survivors of the Obsidian Tower, finally arrive in Ironfort.
      Though the citizens keep telling her that this is the perfect, most wonderful
      place to be, the fear in their eyes, the tremble behind their smiles, belies
      something sinister.</strong>'
