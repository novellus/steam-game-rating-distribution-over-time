    about_the_game: 'WoodZone is a unique opportunity to become an entrepreneurial
      lumberjack. Imagine that you have a company that grows in front of your eyes
      or you go up the ladder in another corporation to eventually become the boss
      in it. The player has a lot of &quot;sandbox rakes and blades&quot; that open
      up new possibilities. Lighting in the sawmill can be built on the principle
      of &quot;put and work&quot;, but a more demanding player can develop them using
      logic gates and cables. For example, it can be lit when entering the building,
      the place for wood is full or there are no raw materials. The game provides,
      among others, conveyors, computers, cameras, sensors, logic gates, cabling,
      vehicles, robots, construction parts and much, much more! This allows you to
      create excellent mechanisms that automate work: wood sorter, a machine that
      checks the quality of wood, production efficiency meter, automatic feeder and
      so on.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/924380/extras/WZ_bannerSteam_MultiplayerMode2.png?t=1602849650"

      Multiplayer allows you to interact with players from other parts of the world
      who have access to raw materials found on specific biomes. It may turn out that
      the start-up location does not provide the goods required for the production
      of desirable constructions and inventions. Demand for limited materials dynamically
      shapes the game market and requires players to cooperate. This cooperation can
      be, among other things, by setting up your own or a joint company, employing
      players as employees, establishing partnership agreements with other corporations,
      as well as acting as a freelancer. The player can be employed as a lumberjack,
      driver, carpenter, builder, manager and many other professions. Each field is
      associated with other duties and permissions.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/924380/extras/WZ_bannerSteam_Economy2.png?t=1602849650"

      the year. The player is able to set up his own company, which he can run alone
