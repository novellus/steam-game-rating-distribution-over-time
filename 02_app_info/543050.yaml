      \ the uniqueness of the planet: a raw and powerful energy that could tame the\
      \ chaos of time. From this discovery, the ARC was created, a device capable\
      \ of controlling the rhythm of life itself. With this power, a civilization\
      \ flourished for centuries and disappeared without reason. Modern day Taraanians\

    review: 'Great game if you miss the old days of 3rd person shooters, the end 2000
      era (Gears of War, Uncharted, all the xbox 360 shooters), It''s a great solo
      game with great level design, good gameplay, really nice unreal engine 4 graphics,
      smooth running and greatly optimised.


      I would recommend to all the 3rd person shooter lovers )))


      To me would really need achievements soon. Because its really polished and a
      nice polished solo game needs achievements.'
