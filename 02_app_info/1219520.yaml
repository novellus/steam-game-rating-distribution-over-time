    review: 'The game had a great motive. I enjoyed the artwork of the game play;
      however, just like one of the other reviews the frame rate is horrific. I have
      a medium to high end rig and it was just too much for my eyes. I wish I could
      play more, but the FR is just way too low even on high/medium/low "graphic"
      settings.

      I was able to meet enemies, but they would not register that I was near them.
      The enemies would just stand there when I shot. If i did shoot an enemy their
      health would MAYBE drop a little. It did not always drop, but sometimes it did.

      I think if this game got updated then it will be crazy fun!'
