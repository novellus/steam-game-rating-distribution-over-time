    review: "The game's concept is somewhat interesting. Super Stone Legacy brings\
      \ a twist on your standard class-based 'arcadey' hack-n-slash; you get to play\
      \ 6 classes at the same time but if one dies it's locked out for the rest of\
      \ the run.\n\nThere's a bunch of bosses and they're, honestly, quite fun to\
      \ fight. I had a blast unlocking all of the bosses 'no damage dealt' achievements.\
      \ The classes are 'varied', but totally unbalanced. You'll notice that some\
      \ classes are pretty useful while others are completely obsolete. The difference\
      \ between the damage dealt by your hold attack vs main attacks is kind of dumb,\
      \ you'll never switch as one is always better. It's kind of a let down. \n\n\
      There is an Upgrade/Shop system where you can purchase stats. I could barely\
      \ see any difference at all and the whole system could have been stripped, but\
      \ that's purely based on the terrible execution. I can see why it would fit\
      \ in the game loop as if you invest a lot in a character and it dies, you get\
      \ punished, rewarding risk.\n\nThe 'dungeon' areas, are terribly boring and\
      \ require no skill at all. They keep getting larger as you progress, amplifying\
      \ the mind boggling nonsense. The worst part is that I kept getting playthroughs\
      \ where monsters would get stuck in/beyond walls, forcing me to abandon my run.\
      \ The chance of this issue kept increasing as I got closer to the final boss.\n\
      \nIf it wasn't for the frustrating technical issue where monsters get stuck\
      \ in walls, I would have recommended you to get this game on sale.\n\nTLDR:\
      \ Game is not so bad, but monsters glitch behind walls and force you to abandon\
      \ runs."
