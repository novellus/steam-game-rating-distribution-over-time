    about_the_game: "The Empire: Total War demo will take you through the basics of\
      \ land and naval command and then let you loose on two historic scenarios. As\
      \ one of the greatest British development studios, The Creative Assembly invites\
      \ you to try Empire: Total War from the position of their &quot;home&quot; side!\
      \ Playing as the British Empire, you'll take on the American Army in the pivotal\
      \ &quot;Battle of Brandywine Creek&quot; and then the French Navy in the decisive\
      \ &quot;Battle of Lagos.&quot;<br>  <br>\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Battle of Brandywine\
      \ Creek</strong>   <br>\t\t\t\t\tAfter landing from his transport ships on the\
      \ American coast, Major-General Sir William Howe led the British troops eastwards,\
      \ with the intention of capturing Philadelphia.   <br>\t\t\t\t\tIn preparation,\
      \ American General George Washington readied most of his units to defend from\
      \ this frontal assault around the narrow crossing of Chad's Ford on the Brandywine.\
      \ The Creek flows through the countryside of Pennsylvania, enveloped by sheer\
      \ cliffs and heavily wooded hills on both sides. Knowing that much of the fast-flowing\
      \ creek could not be crossed, Washington was confident of holding his position.\
      \   <br>\t\t\t\t\tHowever, more detailed surveillance of the terrain would suggest\
      \ that alternative routes could turn the battle in the favor of the British.\
      \   <br>\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Battle of Lagos</strong>   <br>\t\t\t\t\tAs so often\
      \ in 18th Century warfare, French plans to invade England during the Seven Years\
      \ War were reliant on ships from the naval base at Toulon joining ships from\
      \ Brest. The British had both ports blockaded, and the French had to wait for\
      \ one of the blockading fleets to withdraw for re-supply before attempting any\
      \ rendezvous.   <br>\t\t\t\t\tThe opportunity came when the British fleet under\
      \ Admiral Boscawen at Toulon withdrew to Gibraltar. The French under Jean-Fran\xE7\
      ois de la Clue-Sabran left Toulon, and began to make their way towards Brest.\
      \ Passing the Straits of Gibraltar, the French were spotted by Boscawen's lookout\
      \ ships.   <br>\t\t\t\t\tGiving chase, Boscawen's fleet was only slightly larger\
      \ than the French force, and caught up with them off the coast of Portugal where\
      \ battle was joined.   <br>\t\t\t\t\tTake control of the British and defeat\
      \ the French to end the invasion threat to Britain.     <br>\t\t\t\t\tNote:\
      \ This demo is presented in English language only. However, the full game contains\
