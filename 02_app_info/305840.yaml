    review: This game had so much potential but I can only say that either a lack
      of player testing or just sheer laziness is the ultimate downfall of this game.  The
      tutorial is confusing and seemly written by someone who has never played the
      game.  There are functions that are complex for no reason.  The tutorial itself
      is interminable and seems to go on without end.  I never completed it because
      I simply could on figure out how to make containers.  Plus the player cannot
      simply skip the tutorial.  The gameplay in the Quick Battle is similarly fraught
      with buggy control.  Focusing and attacking does not always work.  Great ship
      models and I like the elevation system but the controls are uncontrollable.  This
      is basically an incomplete game.  Somebody please complete it!
