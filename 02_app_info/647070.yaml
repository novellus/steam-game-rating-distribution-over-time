    review: 'The base game favors the produce/consume engine. This DLC introduces
      goals that let you earn victory points (VPs) in new ways and potentially compete
      with p/c engines of other players. It also let''s you switch strategies easier
      during an ongoing game. Each game will select 6 goals from a pool of goals.
      Take a look at the screenshots on the steam page above. You can see a column
      with symbols (column including the red 6+ symbol) between the played cards area
      and the draw pile & OK button section. These are filled up to 6 in total. Here
      are some examples of goals:


      Be the first to play 3 alien cards: 3 VP

      Be the first to discard cards by a full hand: 3 VP

      Be the first to play a development 6 card: 3VP

      Be the first player to own 5 VP chips: 3 VP

      Be the first to own every type of production world: 3VP

      Be the first to own a bonus for every action: 3VP

      Highest military count at the end of the game with at least 6 military: 5 VP

      Most production worlds at the end of the game: 5 VP

      Most development cards at the end of the game with at least 4 dev cards: 5 VP


      Playing with goals is optional though, if you don''t like it you can switch
      it off and play with the new cards.


      Pros:

      + I get the impression that the AI is better than the base game AI and it''s
      very competent at making use of the new DLC features.

      + Goals

      + Goals can be switched off

      + There is a little more reason to go for alien cards due to the alien goal

      + New starting (home) worlds, New cards

      + Military strategy is a bit more viable due to the military goal


      Cons:

      - Most of the green cards are still worthless


      Final verdict: Recommended but only when you have experience with the base game.
      The DLC is not suitable for first-time players.'
