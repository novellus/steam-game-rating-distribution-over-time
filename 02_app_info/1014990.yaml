    review: 'i didnt know how to rate it correctly.

      most content is not flexible enough like a given story what u can do and what
      has to be done in the game.


      and the use of the creatures is always the same, as i could see up to now.

      so the game will become boring with the time. and it needs so much time to get
      up high and get new parts for the creatures and do a bit more. i hope there
      will be more content with the time'
