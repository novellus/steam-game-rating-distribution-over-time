So let me try to describe my experience and help those that can't pick them all or are scared to invest more money.\n\nSunken Treasures most importantly adds a brand new and dare I say most crucial region. Trelawney. You are getting access to a large maps with a monstrous sized island that will accommodate you. period. You won’t play a single game long enough to fill this island. It’s just that big. And that’s good as it will become your capital rather soon and should be your focus from the start of the game to relocate there.\n\nWith this DLC you get access to this region obviously, but also story connected to it. I won’t spoiler anything, but the story while sometimes a bit boring is at times really interesting. Especially that it does hint a lot about relations between the Empire and La Corona (that’s how plebs calls it ;)  ) Very enjoyable for fans of Role Playing. \n\nExpect that you get access to famous Junker that is in every game and his wares, and some of these are extremely useful. Of course you also get chance to hunt for sunken treasure which if you invest time an money will be not only lots of fun, but also profitable and it transcends regions and DLCs!\n\nSumming this up Trelawney is your base of operation for the entire game. While it’s totally doable to play with your old islands and win game or building great cities, the sheer scope of Trelawney will be sure to make your Capital memorable and most importantly it will help a lot in all sorts of expeditions. \n\nIf you want to buy only one DLC go for this one. It’s about the most crucial one! Of course if you prefer a different region such as Arctic or Africa (not release as of yet) then go for it. But personally I believe you should develop your Capital here first and then explore these new lands with economic powerhouse at your back. That way you will really feel like imperialist! I give this DLC 10/10 I’m honestly not having any problem with it!\n","timestamp_created":1597936383,"timestamp_updated":1597936383,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wcabhvQCdIbTnAI="}
