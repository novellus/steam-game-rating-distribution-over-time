I'll make a map, save it, continue making changes, and save it again. I'll re-save over the previous one, clicking 'yes' that I would like to overwrite, but when I close out the program and re-open, my changes are not retained.  I've lost a lot of work that way :( . For a while I could save it by giving each save a new name but now each map, no matter what, loses all details and lighting and just keeps the footprint every time I reopen a map from close.\n\nSadly, this makes the product unusable so I've changed my review from 'recommended' to 'not recommended'. \n\nPrevious review:\n\nI love all the extensive dungeon items and tiles! I wanted to create a burial chamber with coffins, offering urns, chests, skeletons and motifs on the wall. To my surprise, everything I wanted was available as an asset, plus more! Also the lighting is awesome, really makes the map come alive. Each object reacts to every light you place in the dungeon, and each light has different brightness according to its size. \n\nOnce I got the hang of how to move, scale, and rotate items, I was able to build a dungeon for my roll20 game very quickly! If there was a way to search assets, that would be great, because there are a lot of them! (Any expansion packs down the road...? I'm interested!). \n\nYou can even rotate tiles! I was frustrated at first because I was using 1x1 tiles and each time I put down a tile, it looked the same. I wanted to see some variation in the narrow tunnel I was making. Then I figured out you could rotate tiles and voila! Problem solved.  \n\nAll in all, this was exactly what I was looking for. I wanted a nice looking map that I could put together quickly with pre-made elements, and this software delivered! I can't wait to show my players the map! Our last one was nice, but there was no color, lighting, or textures. This is way cooler :)","timestamp_created":1588039087,"timestamp_updated":1608333255,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lbyIvPYCc5L9gwI="}
