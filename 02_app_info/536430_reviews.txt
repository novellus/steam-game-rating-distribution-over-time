The Revenge of Johnny Bonasera is a 4-part episodic series by independent developer Rafael García.  The series began in late 2016 and concluded in early 2020.  The developer has floated the possibility of doing a fifth game at some point in the future, but the series is currently finished; The four games that are out tell a complete story with no loose ends.  Each game in the series takes about two to three hours to complete, and each successive game is a bit larger and more ambitious than the previous entries.\n\nThe series follows a physically weak but terribly ruthless young boy.  In the first game, which works as a standalone title, Johnny takes revenge on some teenaged punks who ruin his sandwich.  The second, third, and forth games change course a little bit and follow a whole story arc as Johnny takes revenge on some aliens who have abducted his mother.\n\nMy overall impression of the series as a whole is positive.  Johnny is not as big or as flashy as many other games; but it doesn't feel like it is even trying to compete with those.  I am writing these reviews on Jan 2, 2020, the day after Adobe Flash officially died.  Johnny feels like exactly the kind of game that would have existed and thrived as a mega-hit on a site like Newgrounds or Kongregate had it come out 15 years earlier.  With the basic cartoonish art style, large and crudely animated sprites, vaguely adolescent humor, and simplicity of design, the series brings me a certain nostalgia for that era of gaming.[/i]\n\nThis is the first entry in the series, and while I like it, I think it is the weakest of the bunch.  I know that this particular entry frequently goes on deep discount and has even been given away for free, in order to draw players into the series.  If you would like to buy this to test it out, keep in mind that the best bits are still yet to come.  I believe this one was made as Rafael García was still finding his stride as a developer.\n\nIn this entry, Johnny is up against three teenaged punks who lightly bully him.  He decides to pay back the minor slight by absolutely ruining the bullies' lives.  The punishment he doles out is way worse than the initial incident.  While Johnny does some real ruthless stuff in all four of the games, he has absolutely no chill at all in this one.\n\nThe first entry ends on a cliffhanger that sets up the remaining three games in the series.  It also includes a very short but enjoyable bonus game, accessible from the main menu, which gives us some backstory for one of the game's minor characters.\n","timestamp_created":1609637166,"timestamp_updated":1609637166,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwu7/24vYCc9D1vwI="}
