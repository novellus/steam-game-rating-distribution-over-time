    review: 'I guess it''s cool to use a lightsaber... but don''t expect much more
      than a few moments of saber swipes.


      + a solid test of what can be done in future VR experiences. I''m looking forward
      to things to come

      + the lightsaber felt great!

      + blocking the energy bolts felt VERY real, not too easy


      - very little world interaction, the ''press the buttons to fix the ship'' hook
      was very egh

      - short, ''feel the saber and over'' experience

      - the room-scale requirement is larger than it needs to be, and a bit larger
      than most other games, forcing some recalibration on my end


      A down vote might be a bit harsh.. i would rather have a neutral vote, an up
      vote is too strong as well.'
