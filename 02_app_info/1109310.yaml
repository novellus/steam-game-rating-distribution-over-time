    review: 'It is cheap, and it gave me exactly what I was looking for : a short,
      enoyable  and quirky experience. I have found the main mecanism fun and original,
      which naturally creates 3 mains phases in the game (exploration, expansion and
      struggle, massive conversion)

      Make sure to read the instructions (top right button), and bear in mind : it
      is a game made in a game jam, so it is far from perfect !'
