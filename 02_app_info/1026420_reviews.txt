I manage to win the game on my first run without any character dying. The mechanic is pretty basic, I like the movement on the map, but there is nothing else to mention much. However, I really love WW2 theme and the art style is very nice, every character look very lovely, so that is probably the main point they got me.\n\nNow. for the things I don't like. \nOne, the permanent stacking minus district morale system. Every round, you are force to choose 1 of 3 random district missions to do, the 2 that you won't do will keep stacking and minus district morale everyday, and there is no way to remove it later, which is very annoying. \nTwo, equipment is very hard to get one, and it is random. That's not all, you have to pay supply to identify it first, so if your luck is really bad you will just waste supply to repair the equipment that you already have, or lower tier than the one you got. \nThree, supply can be used to raise district morale, but wait, they are random. The game will random the district that will ask for supply and random the amount of morale they will raise, so yeah if you got a low morale district that never ask for your help. Yep, you are doom.\n\nBut I like the game anyway,\njust don't expect the AAA game, and you will have some enjoyment time as mine.","timestamp_created":1610121512,"timestamp_updated":1610121512,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxJCu8fYCcv7IwQI="}
