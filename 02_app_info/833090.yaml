    about_the_game: 'Swords of Gurrah is a real time multiplayer sword fighting VR
      game. Fight with or against friends, with battles up to 12 players.  Choose
      from over a huge variety of weapons and create a fighting style of your own!<br><br>Fight
      in front of a blood thirsty crowd as a Sci-Fi Gladiator in Swords of Gurrah.
      Swords of Gurrah is a virtual reality game focused around hand-to-hand combat
      weapons. Fighters come from all over of their own free will to risk their lives
      against man or beast!!!! Fight to the death all to experience the thrill of
      victory - and if defeated to die for glory! <br><br>Gurrah is a single player
      and multiplayer online game. It takes skill beyond typical gaming to keep up:
      swing, slice, slash, dodge, duck, and destroy. VR does amazing things to bring
      life-like hand-to-hand combat into your home.<br><br><strong>The Weapons:</strong><br>These
      weapons are designed to shatter and regrow on every collision. This allows you
      to block and parry in a way previously never before seen in Virtual Reality
      due to the limitations of the technology. No longer will VR sword fighting feel
      clunky and inconsistent; the weapons are light weight, fluid but pack a punch.
      <br><br>Gurrah has a wide selection of weapons: one hand swords, shields, glaives,
      spears, axes, heavy-class swords, double-sided sabers, daggers, and throwing
      stars. Select and train, the choice is yours! <br><br><br><strong>The Beasts:</strong><br>The
      arena presents many threats to keep gladiators on their toes. Fully armored
      bulls, tigers, hydras and more are ready for battle. Bred and bio-engineered
      to fight with ferocity.  Each beast presents a new challenge, testing the ability
      of a warrior to adjust on the fly. The crowd must be entertained!<br><br>We
      have a lot of things in the works!'
