    short_description: Waldsee is an 10 acre venue hidden deep in the famous forests
      of Germany. An intimate venue with wooden platforms surrounding the lake but
      still plenty of different features to fish towards.

    review: 'Out of the 3 DLC lakes I own, Waldsee is my favorite one.  The owned
      DLCs ranked:


      1.  Waldsee

      2.  Manor lake Farm

      3.  Bergsee.


      I can''t believe I spent $18 on the 3 lakes, more than I spent on the game when
      I bought it on sale.  It is nice having a big choice of lakes and the 3 DLC
      lakes flesh out the game.


      The forest seems a little blurry in Waldsee (not a deal breaker), like playing
      in an average skill painted painting.  But it still looks fairly nice being
      surrounded by forest and there is an island in the middle of the lake you can''t
      fish from


      I am glad I bought all three lakes, makes upgrading my fishing gear more fun.  I
      only have 1 hour with each lake,  but I feel I can review them in an early impression
      kind of way.  I mostly fish at 7 A.M. so I still have the graphics during the
      middle of the day and end of the day to look forward to which I haven''t seen
      yet in most cases.'
