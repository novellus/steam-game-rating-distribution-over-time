      /><br><br>Hitbox centers around fast, slick shooting. With all unnecessary distractions
      removed, we've focused on the core gameplay of moving and shooting. Position
      yourself nicely, practice your aim, and improve your reflexes to excel. A friendly
      and inviting style makes it approachable and easy to learn but experienced players
      will find it hard to master. Our stylish and colourful graphics help ensure
      the game runs smoothly on many different computers so your experience never
      drops frames and the gameplay stays on top.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/341890/extras/Multiplayer.png?t=1568752514"
      /><br><br>With online, local and split screen multiplayer we've made sure you
      can play with whoever you want. When you need a bit of practice before going
      against real players we have bots to fill games with so you can hone your skills
      or just get a feel for a new map.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/341890/extras/Classes.png?t=1568752514"
      /><br><br>Four different classes distill different play styles of the game.
      You can be a careful sharpshooter, or a mad gunman running around and confusing
      the enemy. Each class wants to counter another and choosing the right class
      will always give you an upper hand in a fight. The Tactician can blow your enemies
      away with his shotgun, while the fast firing Flanker than can get up close and
      personal and unload lots of bullets. The Marksman is the man of accuracy, a
      tough class to play but can deal devastating amount of damage. The Trooper is
      the jack of all trades, able to fit into many situations, but might not be ideal
      when pressured.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/341890/extras/Features.png?t=1568752514"
