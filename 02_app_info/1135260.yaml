    review: "If you enjoy exploring, the sea, and giant falcons then this game is\
      \ for you. While the main story takes its time telling the history of the world\
      \ chapter by chapter, I found I enjoyed the missions and world building it has.\
      \ This stormy world has an eerie ambience that I don't see often in other games,\
      \ and absolutely love. \n As far as how the falcons handle, I used a ps4 controller,\
      \ and found no issues with the flight controls."
