    review: Very cute. Surprisingly challenging! The UI and the cats themselves have
      about two paintings that switches. It's a really simple animation, if you can
      call it that. Yet it really makes the game come to life. Great style choice
      fron the devs. This games feels very loved. And it makes you feel loved! xD
