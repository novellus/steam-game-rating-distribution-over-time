There's only about 5 levels but they are pretty hard! The music goes super well with the pacing of the game, and it has a bunch of cool enemies to destroy. It's also rediculous that the game designer put himself in as the pilot. Definitely worth the price.","timestamp_created":1522124961,"timestamp_updated":1522124961,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524680078029632568","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zvbtsuICd9jYnAE="}
