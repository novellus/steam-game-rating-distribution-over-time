    review: "An autoclicker + a skin. Maybe a bit overpriced for what it is but the\
      \ base game is free and very addicting. I thought after 200+ hours, i could\
      \ give them 10 bucks to support them. \n\nI chose the cute reindeer because\
      \ that's it lol. Best part of this is that you can actually go ingame and see\
      \ the skins before you buy them so no reason to be disappointed.\n\nSo yes,\
      \ overpriced for what it is but not pay to win because you can earn rubies to\
      \ get autoclicker in game for free. And the skin is cool but it's just a skin.\
      \ Nothing unbalancing the game.\n\nSo yes, have fun getting one as it will carry\
      \ you for hours without having to use a third party software!"
