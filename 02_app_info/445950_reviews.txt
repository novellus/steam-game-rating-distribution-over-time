Backers were never informed of the Steam release, nor were they given the Backer Rewards they paid for.   \n\nThe last Kickstarter update was April 22, 2016, and backers were subsequently surprised to find this game for sale on Steam.\n\nThe game seems fine so far; the graphical style is coherent and interesting, gameplay is entertaining; but the unethical behavior of the developer is alarming.","timestamp_created":1549435191,"timestamp_updated":1549435400,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.454545468091964722","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9P3i4OgCdauQugE="}
