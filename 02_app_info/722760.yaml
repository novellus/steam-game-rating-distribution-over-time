    review: "Captain Firebeard And The Bay Of Crows is an adventure visual novel both\
      \ developed and published by Sapphire Dragon Productions. This title follows\
      \ the adventures of the swashbuckling Captain Firebeard and his band of pirates\
      \ as they attempt to pull off one of the biggest heists in all of history. Prepare\
      \ to set sails for a thrilling escapade ripe with dangerous combat, dubious\
      \ encounters and bountiful riches to be accquired as you attempt to make Captain\
      \ Firebeard the king of all pirates...Blackbeard be darned!!!\n\n[h1]PRESENTATION[/h1]\n\
      \nThis visual novel has a fantastic presentation that includes some beautiful\
      \ artwork on the characters and backgrounds throughout the story. The illustrations\
      \ are filled with bright eyecatching colors and shading. Also, the characters\
      \ change facial expressions depending on their current mood so that really helps\
      \ with immersion although I must admit that there is a lack of ambient sound\
      \ effects which, on the other hand, hinders immersion. One very noteworthy aspect\
      \ of this V.N. is the inclusion of a very fun minigame that you play in order\
      \ to accomplish various goals during the story such as sneaking into an armory\
      \ to pillage weapons or assaulting a military compound. The minigame itself\
      \ plays much like \"Pac Man\" if I had to compare it to anything. By replacing\
      \ Pac Man with Captain Firebeard and the ghosts with enemy soldiers this is\
      \ the basic framework of said minigame. \n\nYour objective is to collect a certain\
      \ amount of coins scattered across the map while avoiding death at the hands\
      \ of the cutlass wielding patrolling soldiers. There are a couple of cutlasses\
      \ laying about which once accquired by Firebeard gives him the chance to kill\
      \ the soldiers for a small amount of time. It's a very simple game but still\
      \ quite entertaining nonetheless and it also adds a nice bit of gameplay to\
      \ the visual novels narrative which is always a welcome addition in my opinion.\
      \ The dialogue is also brilliantly voiced as the actors do a fantastic and highly\
      \ believable job of capturing the spirit of this V.N.. The soundtrack is excellent\
      \ and fits in well with the story and really kept to the overall pirate and\
      \ caribbean theme. In summary, this wonderfully stylized novel takes you on\
      \ quite a fascinating adventure from start to finish. \n\n[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]\n\
      \nI'm a big fan of pirates and adventure so I was pleasantly surprised at how\
      \ much I truly enjoyed this visual novel because at first glance I was expecting\
      \ it to be merely okay yet it turned out to be a much more enjoyable experience\
      \ than I had anticipated. The story is engaging, the characters are very memorable,\
      \ Captain Firebeard is hilarious and the inclusion of the minigame is a fantastic\
      \ compliment to the wonderful narrative. As options go, there are a small amount\
      \ of Steam Achievements to hunt down but sadly no Steam Trading Cards to collect.\
      \ The basic visual novel settings for sound/volume control and text speed are\
      \ present. Also, there is D.L.C. in the form of an orchestral soundtrack and\
      \ \"The Curse Of The Golden Crab\" which tells an extended new story with one\
      \ of the members of Captain Firebeards crew. In conclusion, Captain Firebeard\
      \ And The Bay Of Crows was a thrilling adventure that any fan of the visual\
      \ novel genre would be proud to be a part of so this title is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
