    about_the_game: The single engine Piper Cherokee is one of the most common and
      standard general aviation aircraft, designed for flight training, air taxi and
      personal use.<br><br>The first PA-28 received its type certificate from the
      Federal Aviation Administration in 1960, and the series remains in production
      to this day. All members of the PA-28 family are all-metal, unpressurized, single-engined,
      piston-powered airplanes with low-mounted wings and tricycle landing gear. They
      all have a single door on the copilot side, which is entered by stepping on
      the wing.<br><br>The Piper PA28 Cherokee 180F from Carenado includes a highly
      detailed interior and exterior model, full moving and animated rudder and flaps,
      light effects and also a brilliant interactive virtual cockpit. The ultra-realistic
      performance is based on a detailed documentation and observation of experienced
      Piper pilots.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>External
