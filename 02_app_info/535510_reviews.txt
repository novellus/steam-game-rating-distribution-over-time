Take it. Take it all. These guys are great, and make an awesome, awesome product. It's gotten to the point where I'll buy basically every DLC Dragom puts out. This, combined with the landscapes DLC will get you just about everything you need to make 90% of the maps you need - with a little creativity.  Ijust wish I hadn't spent two weeks painstakingly crafting a Yartar harbor map, because this is clearly the better way to go. Thanks for making my work redundant Dragom!","timestamp_created":1475940394,"timestamp_updated":1475940394,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552040398120880127","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwweS50tcCefjzYg=="}
