The initial premice sounded exactly like something I would be into. A return to the pure and uncluttered PC FPS. Designed with the community in mind, it would take us back to the good old days and would have some of the most respected CoD 4 modders working on it. Guy's like Sam a.k.a Joker {eXtreme}. Creater of the eXtreme mod for CoD and the man largely responsible for the inclusion of the AC130 in MW:2. \n\nMy hopes were high. However, after Crosshairs went off air I lost track of the game until I saw it appear on Steam. Sadly, I'd not followed the development of the game and had no idea that Joker had left the team well before release. Having now played the game, I think I can understand why. \n\nThis is a bad game, pure and simple. In my opinion the game was not even finished when it was released. Whilst the numerous game breaking bugs are slowly being patched, the terrible core design and gameplay mechanics can never be sorted.\n\nAt this point the servers are a wasteland with almost nobody playing and if you do find a populated server, chances are it will have a ping of well over 150ms.\n\nI hate to say it, but don't waste your money. With the exception of a couple of decent maps, this game has nothing to recommend it. A sad ending for something that could have been great.","timestamp_created":1392197161,"timestamp_updated":1593184554,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.605584442615509033","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwweHM+PICevfIIg=="}
