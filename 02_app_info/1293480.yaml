      tactics to their advantage.<br></li><li>Resource Management - You'll manage
      your core resources and will decide what to take with you or what to leave behind.
      Every decision in that regard will open another option for you but close the
      other one.<br></li><li>Develop Your Play Style - There's more than one way to
      play the game. You can go fast and quick, or slow and steady. You can mix aggressiveness
      with stealth or trap your enemies with intricate tactics. As you progress in
      the game, you'll develop your style and that will be unique to you.</li></ul>
