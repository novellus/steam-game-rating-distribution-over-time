Some cards provide a direct benefit for banishing them on top of their usual effect. Most importantly none of the cards in this set actually force you to banish a card, so no banishing cards you would otherwise have liked to keep.\n\nThere are 5 events respective to all 5 categories in the game which are flavorful and well designed, and can be acquired as a card with its own effect after paying its cost. Some cards in this set will also allow you to benefit from monsters in your deck.\n\nThe beauty of this expansion is that it can integrate nicely with other expansions and it accelerates synergies within decks. Essentially helps and rewards you for building decks in a game where you build decks.","timestamp_created":1600740435,"timestamp_updated":1600741073,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hszm2fQCfu+kowI="}
