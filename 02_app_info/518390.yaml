    about_the_game: When Takao decides to skip school one day in favor of sketching
      in a rainy garden, he has no idea how much his life will change when he encounters
      Yukino. Older, but perhaps not as much wiser, she seems adrift in the world.
      Despite the difference in their ages, they strike up an unusual relationship
      that always occur in the same garden on each rainy day. But the rainy season
      is coming to a close, and there are so many things still left unsaid and undone
      between them.
