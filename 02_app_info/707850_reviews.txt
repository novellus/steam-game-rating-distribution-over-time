I would have put an option to enable/disable it though for those that don't want to have the click without holding feature.\n+I like the shape of the puzzle pieces\n+Visually, puzzle pieces have a nice shadow making them look very real\n+There is a shadow when moving pieces around\n+Accuracy to pick up the pieces is on point! <3\n[u](new points)[/u]\n+Puzzles shapes are fun to place on the board\n+I like that all of them are paintings/drawings. I think that most of the images have nice elements that makes them fun to solve.\n\n[b]Suggestions~~~[/b]\n[u](new points)[/u]\n~Some of the images could benefit from having their color adjust a bit to be more vibrant.\n\n[b]Negatives---[/b]\n[u](same points)[/u]\n-F12 to take Steam print screen doesn't work.\n-Puzzles doesn't save when you quit the game and start it again.\n-You need to select a puzzle from a Steam menu and quit the game to select another puzzle. It would be much better with an in-game menu.\n-No achievements\n-Snapping is a bit too short so that sometimes I have to pick and drop multiple time for my pieces to snap. There is no option to change that either.\n-No sound setting\n-No settings to change the number of pieces by puzzle. Each puzzle only has a fix number of pieces and you can't change it making this game having little replayability.\n-I wish that there was an option to enable dragging instead of having it by default when you click on the background because sometimes I miss-click a piece of puzzle just a little bit and then the dragging occurs.\n[u](new points)[/u]\n-Contrary to his successor \"Cabins: Jigsaw Puzzles\", this one doesn't indicate how many pieces a puzzle has. It wouldn't take much time to update this older game if the code has already been written for more recent games. I think it is nice when a developer take the time to update his older games.\n-Puzzle pieces are not shuffled. Each time you enter a puzzle they are displayed in the same position.\n-This is a big downer: each puzzle used the same puzzle pieces. Add that to the fact that every puzzle begins with their pieces in the same position and it's like you are doing the same puzzle all over again almost exactly the same way :O! I got curious to see if this has changed in the most recent game \"Cabins: Jigsaw Puzzles\" but it's the same! (At least the Cabin game has a different number of puzzle pieces, but each 70 pieces puzzle, for example, still begin with the pieces layed out exactly the same and all the pieces shapes are also the same ..).\n-The game is quite short. I timed myself doing a puzzle and it takes about 3min to complete a 48 piece puzzle. With 16 different images it would only take 48 minutes to complete them all once. Since there is no setting to change the number of pieces, there is little replayability. Even if the game is cheap, I think it's too short.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\nThere is 16 available 48 pieces paintings/drawings to solve. The puzzle shapes and the snapping are satisfying. Discovering that there is only 1 cut of puzzle and that each puzzle have the same numbers of pieces and use the same puzzle cut is a disappointment leading me to not recommend this game. It's also pretty short (under 50minutes to finish all puzzles).","timestamp_created":1584900012,"timestamp_updated":1584900023,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4reTZgfECfsuQ+gE="}
