      notes: The game includes frequent occurrences of cartoon blood, gore, and violence.
        Due to the game being heavily designed around player choice the player will
        always have the option to solve situations with violence. Our world is designed
        to look bright and happy but is filled with dark themes that include the use/discussion
        of drugs and alcohol. At times the game may allow the users to coerce or even
        force other characters to inflict harm upon themself leaving them wounded
        or even dead.
