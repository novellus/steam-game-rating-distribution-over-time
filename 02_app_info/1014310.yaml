    review: Get two competitive people in a room, and Top Torch is an absolute blast!
      Facing off on the same screen and keyboard as your opponent leads to some truly
      exciting gameplay.  Visually, Top Torch is stunning, and it comes with some
      great music to play to, as well. Definitely worth the $2.99 price tag, Top Torch
      will provide hours of entertainment.
