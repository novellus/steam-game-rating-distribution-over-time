    about_the_game: "The Polynesian Scenario Pack brings you both the Polynesian Civilization\
      \ and a new Scenario, Paradise Found. Rule the world as Kamehameha, unifier\
      \ of Hawai'i, with your powerful navy and imposing Moai statues!<br>\t\t\t\t\
      \t\t<strong>Scenario Description</strong><br>\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Paradise Found,\
      \ players take on the role of one of the four great Polynesian kingdoms as they\
      \ strive to become the dominant culture in Polynesia. All-new technology and\
      \ social policy trees unlock powerful advantages to players, including the fearsome\
      \ Maori Warrior and the enigmatic Moai. Special changes to the game rules allow\
      \ players to build expansive kingdoms quickly without impeding their cultural\
      \ growth, but the seas of the Pacific are huge and land is at a premium  among\
      \ the atolls and islands. Take the best islands for yourself, and prove your\
      \ mana as a ruler as you build Polynesia to stand the test of time!<br>\t\t\t\
      \t\t\t<strong>Polynesia Ruler \u2013 Kamehameha</strong><br>\t\t\t\t\t\tKamehameha\
      \ was the first ruler to unite all of the Big Islands of Hawai'i under his rule\
      \ in 1791, and reformed many of the island's laws to protect its people. Because\
      \ of his strong rule and wise policies, Hawai\u2019i remained an independent\
      \ kingdom long after Kamehameha\u2019s death in 1819."
