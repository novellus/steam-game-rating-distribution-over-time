    short_description: The Rain fell, and washed away all that was good. Ancestors
      of the survivors face a world plagued by deadly disease, hostile landscapes
      that offer no safe haven, and brutal warlords beholden to a malevolent A.I.
      that seeks to enslave mankind and control the natural world. This is life After
      Rain.

    review: I can highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a great platform
      shooter. This game is the perfect balance of challenging yet rewarding gameplay.
      The gameplay is simple enough virtually anyone can play and yet certain moments
      will leave even the most experienced gamer trying their hardest. It also balances
      the feel of an old-school 8 or 16 bit game with the visuals of a futuristic
      one. The developer continues to work on DLC and adding to an already great game.
      Once again I can highly recommend this game and give it a 10/10.
