    review: 'Mod Kit is just bugged in Steam. After installing SF3 including all expansions
      => mod kit does not appear in library. Downloading button will just result in
      starting the original spellforce 3 game, instead of installing/startung Mod
      Tool Kit...

      Seemslike there are some major issues with the game link inside Steam.'
