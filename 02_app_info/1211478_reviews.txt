I'd personally only buy in the sales (they normally surface monthly) It's clear that there has been some effort into the route, but the track laying is the only reason why i'd only recommend it in the sale. \n\n4/5","timestamp_created":1609963300,"timestamp_updated":1609963300,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyszS7PYCcqGMwQI="}
