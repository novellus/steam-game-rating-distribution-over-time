      BGG Rank: 746 Overall - Strategy 405\n2018 Golden Geek Best Card Game Nominee\n\
      Tom Vassal of The Dice Tower rates this his #1 two-player board game of 2018!\n\
      [hr][/hr]\n\nIgnore the playtime on steam, I have about 20 hours in the mobile\
      \ version (iPad).\n\nShards Of Infinity was created by the same company that\
      \ made Ascension as a follow-up. Temple games did the wonderful digital ports\
      \ of Race for the Galaxy and Roll for the Galaxy all using an advanced AI that\
      \ is something special.\n\nIf you have ever played Ascension, Dominions, and\
      \ even Star Realms you already know the basics of how to play this.\nThe boardgame\
      \ port is great and works. The real shining star in this game is the AI. It\
      \ is a neural net trained AI that evaluates the best decisions based on learning\
      \ from thousands of games. It will give you a challenge.\n\nTwo ways to win,\
      \ attack, and destroy the opponent. Or collect enough mastery points to obliterate\
      \ the opponent and win instantly.\n\nThe game is aggressive, fast, and fun.\n\
      \nAsynchronous multiplayer. Games are 15 minutes or so. Can handle up to 3 other\
      \ players AI or Human.\n\nThis is a solid addition to your digital board game\
      \ library. I look forward to the expansions being released and converted."
