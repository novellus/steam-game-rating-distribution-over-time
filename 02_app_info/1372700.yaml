    review: Mechanics are way off.  I know throwing mechanics are one of the hardest
      things to do right in VR but everything about this games mechanics are off relative
      to actual disc golf.  Putting is ridiculous and landing a shot on top of or
      leaning against the bottom pole counts as in the basket.
