Basic idea behind it is \"less is more\" and it serves this game so well! I honestly wouldn't change a thing. Game is great fun to play. It is both challenging and rewarding. I played 5 hours straight without even noticing it. Very refreshing.\n\n\n[h1]NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS[/h1]\nThere are a couple of things I would like to point out merely in hopes developer reads this review and takes them into account for future games. You can find them in comment section.","timestamp_created":1478531885,"timestamp_updated":1609064487,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.653270304203033447","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hfPt0fYCep7/ZA=="}
