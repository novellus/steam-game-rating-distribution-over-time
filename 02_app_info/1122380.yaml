    about_the_game: Build, climb, explore and fight back against a robotic threat
      in an open-world persistent MMO created from the ground up for VR. This is the
      world of <strong>Neon Exile</strong>, a world where your actions matter because
      anything you build, craft or even drop, will persist in a single shared multiplayer
      instance of this groundbreaking dystopian world. <br><br>Will you explore the
      wasteland in search of enemy bases or will you stay back to defend your base
      from attacks? Will you collect valuable resources or will you build structures
      to expand your territory? In <strong>Neon Exile</strong> you choose your own
      path, whether you want to join a team or play by yourself, the live simulation
      will always be there, shaped by the players.<h2 class="bb_tag">DEMO NOTES</h2>The
      demo is limited to the full game's tutorial and training course. This is a single
      player experience to show some of the mechanics used within the full MMO world
      of Neon Exile.
