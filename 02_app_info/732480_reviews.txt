EG drums were outside the usable zone.  I had a refund due to the game crashing every time I clicked on the ball bouncing section.  The game was like glitchy too with the screen shimmering and flickering.  As for the lag on playing instruments the only ones that had any preciseness to them were the huge kettle drums cos you can smash them like a maniac and not notice.  I doubt anyone can play more than a few drum beats in a second so more of a toy app than an actual way to play instruments.  Be better if they just did a single drumkit properly.  Dissapointed.","timestamp_created":1602709668,"timestamp_updated":1602709668,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwipi8lPUCfcTypwI="}
