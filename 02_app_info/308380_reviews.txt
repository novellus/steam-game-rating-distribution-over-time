Despite all the nice concepts this software piece presents, for the \"mainstream\" gamers it is barely just a bit more than an engine demo. Especially if you're playing the games for the world immersion and good stories, and not for the \"pure gameplay\" only (like we had in the '80s). Therefore I suggest thinking not even twice, but at least 7 times before buying yourself into it. Even with 75% and more discounts. Good thing is that you can download the freeware trial version right from the store page, and try the game pace by yourself (it is slow indeed, the question is how do you feel about it?).\n\nSo, Airship Dragoon. Accurate combat simulator where you control a group of soldiers fighting in turn-based mode with other groups of soldiers. In full 3D on the big procedurally-generated maps of some presumably dystopian world made in steampunk aesthetics.\n\nThe game has a major campaign mode, plus another one bonus campaign, plus the most default game mode, one-highly-customizable-battle-long only. There is no multiplayer option, which is no wonder, for it's kinda heavy for the one-man-game-studio to provide worldwide server support.\n\nIn the main campaign, you have 6 nations to choose from, all based on the late-19-early-20-century real-world-empires... but it is not going any further than the colour of the banner and the set of names for your soldiers. You start on some quite big map made up of hexagonal cells, which you need to conquer before other PC-controlled nations will do it. And it means hundreds of battles, all following one pattern. Yes, there will be some randomness in the quantity and quality of enemies, in the terrain features and the current amount of your funds and reserves. But in any battle, after you know how many people you and your opponent have after you set inventory (weapons, ammo, and armor which they carry) for each of your soldiers in a strictly manual manner... And considering some variety of weather and terrain conditions on the battle site... It is the same fight again and again. Same goals, same collisions, same tactics from the opponents.\n\nSo please, don't raise any high expectations about Airship Dragoon. Yes, visually tactical map where you move your troops looks somewhat like Valkyria Chronicles... But that doesn't mean Airship Dragoon is somewhere close to Valkyria serial. It's a totally different title, where all where you spend your time on is about battles... and preparing for them by a very long manual process of arming and re-arming your squads, one man at the time. And it is normal to have battles there like 20 on 20 men or more... \n\nHowever, as a pure wargame, without any story as a side dish - the game's good. Boring, if you're not a big fan of turn-based tactical firefights, but deep enough to give the game 5.8/10 mark and my personal upvote - for gameplay only.\n\nPS: read all the manuals - it is the only tutorial in the game!","timestamp_created":1572441574,"timestamp_updated":1572445509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":26,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.787016868591308594","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42MrDju4Ce4Sg1QE="}
