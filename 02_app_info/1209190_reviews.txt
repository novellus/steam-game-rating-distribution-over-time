But that is where the positives stop. The game is, in essence, unplayable. The game offers you very little tutorial, never outright showcasing the controls. There are no settings or places to see these controls. \n\nThe game is also unplayable because there is no form of locomotion or teleportation. If you do not have a play area larger than that of each car, you will most likely not be able to complete the puzzles. I am unable to even complete the first car because I cannot reach the wall opposite of the window. \n\nThe screenshots and videos on the store page show an environment and possible story that I would love to explore, and would likely be a 4 or 5/5 game. But physically I cannot play it. The game needs to be updated with even a simple teleportation system.","timestamp_created":1585944395,"timestamp_updated":1585944395,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568627476692199707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4z9/poPECecHk/QE="}
