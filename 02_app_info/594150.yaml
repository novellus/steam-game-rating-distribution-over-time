    review: "This game is actually one of the better runner VR games out there.  The\
      \ reason is because it actually adds something besides visuals to VR (although\
      \ the visuals aren't terribly great here).  You can use your touch controller\
      \ as a flight stick (HOTA? well not really).  So this brings a level of immersion\
      \ for those of us without a flight stick controller.  It also adds verticality\
      \ to the classic runner formula.  Keep in mind, this is a seated experience,\
      \ but in the VR world you are seated in the plane so it actually fits the game.\n\
      \nYou have to fly up to avoid danger.  And you have to fly down to get some\
      \ coins to keep flying or you'll run out of gass.  You have to judge how low\
      \ you can go to clear obstacles.  And all the while you still have to move right\
      \ or left to avoid obstacles. Your speed is always constantly fast, so you have\
      \ to think and move quickly.  \n\nDefinitely recommend this game at $2 and it's\
      \ just fun to fly haphazardly for as long as you can.\n\nRating 7/10"
