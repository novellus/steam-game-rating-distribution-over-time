    review: 'Thought I''d buy this game when I saw how cute it looked on a random
      deep dive into the store. I regret it pretty instantly, I''m sure the game would
      be a fun time killer if it didn''t cause my mouse to scroll out of the window
      constantly until i close the game; even when minimized. That could easily be
      remedied in fullscreen but of course the game has literally no options menu
      whatsoever so enjoy losing constantly or moving your mouse up and the right
      constantly. Really didn''t think a game as simple as this that only cost me
      $.59 would disappoint me so immensely but it does. Judging by this companies
      massive roster of games all released in like the past 2-3 years and almost all
      mixed reviews I should have know.
