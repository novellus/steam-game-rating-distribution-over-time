We just want to give a shout out to the amazing players who have participated in our Early Access development for Beach Buggy Racing 2.  Your feedback has been so helpful; we literally couldn't be doing this without you.  You've helped us identify bugs, suggested great ideas and pointed out stuff we wouldn't have thought of on our own!<br><br>For those of you new to the game -- we're going to be tweaking and polishing right up until launch, so there's still time to make your mark.

Which by the way is totally not going to happen (knock on wood.)  Us getting hit by a bus.  And even if it did happen at this point, I mean... it would be bad for us but would it really be so terrible for you?  We're pretty close to done, so worst case scenario you get a fun, almost-done game at a crazy cheap price.  What could possibly go wrong?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What's this game about?<\/h2><br>BBR2: Island Adventure is a mayhem-filled kart-racer with an emphasis on split screen fun and game rule customization.
