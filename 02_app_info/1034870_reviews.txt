I've been playing for about  3 and a half hours and I just received a slow down ability. I am at the feet of a giant statue of the King's daughter, the princess.  I'm stuck in this small area.  I have bounced in every square inch of the area and tried to press B to slow things down and every other thing I could think of. I'm just stuck there.  How do I get out? Update:  I finally figured it out.  The game doesn't seem to explain these things very well, but I needed to change the ability to a lightning charge to break through rock walls.","timestamp_created":1593965426,"timestamp_updated":1594610464,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0JaMo/MCe7mGkwI="}
