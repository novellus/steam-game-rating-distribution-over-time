It probably wont work unless you have Win XP computer. I am using a Win 7 . Set your Steam icon to \"run as administrator\" and play the game directly on Steam on the desktop- either in windowed or full screen. It works just fine that way. In administrator it allows the game to reconfigure itself for compatibility issues. This is a great game.  Somewhat addictivly fun. I love the different ways Granny gets to defend herself. You know Practical items that a granny could have like a loaded purse and a frying pan.  I'm only in an earlier level so not sure what else there might be but so far it is a fun game. Not a shoot-em-up. You only get knocked down by dogs and Tiki-men.  Look for the Tiki-man eating plant it's very helpful.  Enjoy.  Great for kids too.","timestamp_created":1601583445,"timestamp_updated":1601583445,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wP7z8vQCeMyipQI="}
