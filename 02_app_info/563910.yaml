      they improved, explored, and discovered, but they wanted more.<br>They became
      greedy, they wanted to be kings and rule the world. <br>Unnecessary fights,
      murders, wars... Gods decided to stop this. <br>At the end of every year, during
      December, they opened gates to Hell so demons could freely punish, torture and
      kill. <br>The world began to become part of hell. People stopped fighting each
      other, they united, but that was not enough to defend themselves.<br>One demon
      was different, much stronger than everyone else, who once was a man, an assassin,
      who killed others to live, which in turn landed him in Hell.<br>But after some
      time in Hell, he had grown weary and regretted his past life and wanted to help

      that his armies were being slain, so he offered a deal: no demon will ever come

    review: "DISCLAIMER: l'ho giocato sopratutto offline, per cui Steam non ha registrato\
      \ il tempo reale di gioco, che in realt\xE0 \xE8 tra le 7-10 ore.\n\nRagazzi,\
      \ vi dir\xF2. A molti potrebbe non piacere. Se guardiamo il lato tecnico, allora\
      \ ne abbiamo di lamentazioni da fare. Ad esempio la mancanza di opzioni, se\
      \ non le opzioni grafiche modificabili nella schermata di lancio del gioco propria\
      \ di Unity: Personal Edition, l'engine su cui gira Guardian Of December. Avete\
      \ capito bene, Personal Edition. Per\xF2, per una volta, \xE8 stato usato, secondo\
      \ me, in maniera decorosa. O perlomeno decente. La grafica \xE8 semplice, non\
      \ \xE8 particolarmente appariscente, non \xE8 per un cavolo fotorealistica.\
      \ Le animazioni sono molto legnose. Per\xF2, ha stile. E vi dir\xF2, io lo apprezzo.\n\
      Purtroppo soffre di qualche problema di lag (perlomeno sul mio pc), anche piuttosto\
      \ evidente, coi settaggi grafici al massimo, ma essendo un gioco in cui i riflessi\
      \ non contano, dato che \xE8 un \"RPG\" (uso questo termine con le pinze, dato\
      \ che \xE8 pi\xF9 che altro un gioco d'avventura con un accenno di RPG), direi\
      \ che si pu\xF2 anche chiudere un occhio.\nAlla lunga ammetto che pu\xF2 risultare,\
      \ ad alcuni, ripetitivo. Io diciamo che ho sentito questa sensazione soprattutto\
      \ nel livello/dungeon della caverna di ghiaccio, dato l'ambiente spoglio e le\
      \ inquadrature spesso ripetute.\nParlo di inquadrature perch\xE9 per tutto il\
      \ gioco ci muoveremo all'interno dei livelli con la telecamera in stile Resident\
      \ Evil per PS1.\nIl sistema di combattimento \xE8 a turni, come appunto in un\
      \ RPG (pi\xF9 JRPG), dove noi potremo selezionare le nostre Skill ed utilizzarle\
      \ a dovere in base alla quantit\xE0 di Mana che avremo, il quale aumenter\xE0\
      , assieme alla salute, di 20 punti ad ogni aumento di livello. Possiamo anche\
      \ comprare nuove spade per aumentare il danno da noi inferto. Acquisiremo inoltre,\
      \ nel corso dell'avventura, degli Elmetti e delle Ali, che serviranno, almeno\
      \ mi \xE8 sembrato, semplicemente a personalizzare il nostro Guardiano, di cui\
      \ potremo anche scegliere il colore ad inizio di una nuova partita.\nUna cosa\
      \ che ho apprezzato particolarmente sono le soundtrack del gioco, tutte composte\
      \ apposta per il gioco. E vi dir\xF2, secondo me, sono ottime, almeno per la\
      \ maggior parte.\nSe vi interessa, esiste su Gamejolt una versione introduttiva\
      \ che pu\xF2 fare da demo. Vi consiglio di darci un'occhiata!"
