    review: "Sigh. So this game has screwed me [i]twice[/i] in the exact same way\
      \ now, so I didn't get to complete it. That's okay, though...there's this newfangled\
      \ thing they've got on the interwebz called YouTube, and some nice folks have\
      \ posted up videos which verify that: a. this game is barely twenty minutes\
      \ long, and b. it's not worth the effort of playing anyway.\n\n   What's the\
      \ problem I had, you ask? Well, I \"solved\" a small laptop \"puzzle\" within\
      \ the game, and got shown the location of a key. Went to said location, spotted\
      \ a key, but couldn't pick it up. Decided what the hey, I could speed-run my\
      \ way back to this in a jiffy, let's just uninstall, reinstall, and try again.\
      \ NO KEY this time. \n\n   Posted a question to the dev in the game's forum,\
      \ and in all fairness, he did try to offer a work-around...though this work-around\
      \ led to a problem of its own, where the game now had \"content locked\" and\
      \ refused to download the executable file. Looked up the \"content locked\"\
      \ problem on Google, and it's a fairly common Steam error it seems. (Just one\
      \ I'd never encountered on any other game prior to this one!) Again, the couple\
      \ of \"solutions\" offered up failed to work, or simply seemed too difficult\
      \ to bother.\n\n   Waited a couple of weeks, reinstalled just to see. Presto!\
      \ Works again. Repeat early steps of gameplay...NO KEY again. Feck it, I'll\
      \ check a walkthrough, see if it's even worth the fuss. Answer: IT'S NOT.\n\n\
      \   Look, maybe I would've been willing to go to the ends of the earth to play\
      \ this through if it was a game of some length and/or some note, but it's neither.\
      \ It's a mediocre asset flip - same house as The Survey, but with less furniture\
      \ - in which you walk around a [i]very[/i] empty house, find a few notes in\
      \ otherwise empty drawers and cupboards, solve a couple of non-puzzles, and\
      \ get an abrupt and unsatisfying ending for all your troubles. I wouldn't be\
      \ recommending it if it [i]didn't[/i] have such extreme technical problems,\
      \ so I'm sure as sh*t not going to when it does. \n\n   Just do as I did and\
      \ watch a walkthrough, if for some strange reason you still feel compelled to.\
      \ Might as well save your money. Your chances of being happy with your purchase\
      \ aren't very high even [i]if[/i] the fecking game works for you. Mildly atmospheric,\
      \ with a couple of passable jump-scares, but cliche-ridden in the extreme and\
      \ chronically boring even by the standards of a walking sim junkie like myself.\n\
      \n   Oh, and for what it's worth: the YouTuber with the twenty minute video?\
      \ Spent an awful lot of time walking around in circles trying to trigger events,\
      \ so you can probably speed-run the game in less than ten.\n\n   Verdict: 3.5/10.\n\
      \n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages:\
