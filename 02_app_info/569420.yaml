    about_the_game: 'VRQB is the definitive arcade VR football experience. <strong>You</strong>
      are the quarterback, driving down the field while racking up as many points
      as possible. Experience the excitement of classic arcade football from the quarterback''s
      perspective!<br><br>Players can choose from five different footballs that each
      offer their own unique play style. VRQB currently features three game modes
      with three different difficulty levels: <strong>Classic</strong>, <strong>Two
      Minute Drill</strong>, and <strong>Scramble</strong>.<h2 class="bb_tag">Classic</h2>In
      Classic mode, the player drives down the field by hitting groups of three targets
      spread out across the field.  Clearing each set of targets gives the player
      a first down, enabling the player to move down the field.  The player tries
      to reach the end zone while increasing their multiplier by hitting consecutive
      targets.<h2 class="bb_tag">Two  Minute Drill</h2>In the Two Minute Drill, the
      player has two minutes to score as many points as possible. The player has the
      option of hitting three different targets, moving to the location of the target
      hit.  Players must weigh hitting the closer, reliable targets to build up a
      streak multiplier, or airing it down the field and going for the big gain.<h2
      class="bb_tag"> Scramble</h2>In Scramble mode, the player dodges the VRQB tackling
      dummies while trying to score as many touchdowns as possible. Be careful, as
      after each touchdown scored, the dummies will increase their speed and spawn
      rate. You can be tackled three times before your round is over, so don''t give
      up after taking your first hit!<br><br><br>Try to beat your own scores on the
      local leaderboard, or try to be the top in world on the online leaderboard!'
