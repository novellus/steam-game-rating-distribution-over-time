This is a really fun combo of final fantasy tactics inspired job/class progression, turn based combat and giving you a world with multiple pathways to explore in the order of your choice with little to no handholding (but hints on which area is next on the difficulty ladder if you specifically ask NPCS for it, otherwise they just let you explore).\n\nThe world has some pretty unique interaction that I don't see very often in RPGs. I think it's fun to discover what and how so I don't want to spoil it with too many examples, but the skills, weapons and items you find can be used outside of combat to interact with the world and help you make new pathways through the various areas you explore. Some of the hub areas also competently loop around into themselves with unlockable shortcuts.\n\nThe story is very light but it's competently written and clear and given the game is more about exploring and fighting I think this is the right fit.\n\nThis game really creatively uses the things that have inspired it and I highly recommend it if you enjoy turnbased rpgs or FFT style mix and match job progression. :)","timestamp_created":1609940954,"timestamp_updated":1609941015,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ncv96/YCf8mAwQI="}
