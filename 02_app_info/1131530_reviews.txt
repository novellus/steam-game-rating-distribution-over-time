Dum-Dum succeeds in being both an OS Simulator, and a full fledged adventure game in its own right. You take on the role of an everyday person who unknowingly uncovers a sinister plot lurking beneath the Hogo Company. Turns out, there's more than just computer manufacturing going on, and YOU are the only one who can help the employees.\n\nIn between various story scenes and puzzles, you are free to play around on the in-game desktop however you like! It really does feel authentic. Plenty of games and applications including Solitaire, an animation tool, 3-D mazes... there's even E-books! At the time of this review, the developer is currently working on adding more content to the game via free update patches.\n\nIf you're into computer history, or Sci-fi, give Dum-Dum a go!","timestamp_created":1604335660,"timestamp_updated":1604335660,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwvu32xPUCeJrrqwI="}
