There are a couple negatives to the game that could be changed imo. First, I really think that having the option to play with my pc xbox controller would make the game play so much more enjoyable since you always are walking around doing multiple things. Secondly, I find the days are way too short that you can only choose to do about 1 main task before you have to go back into your home and go to sleep in your bed and if you don't before it gets too late you'll be robbed of some of your coins that you've earned by doing tasks and selling potions, etc. I hope the dev. decides to somehow add the option of controller, it just would make it a way more enjoyable experience. I also don't play my games with WASD keys but have found that I can use the arrow buttons instead for anyone wondering that. Right now I would rate this game a 3.5/5 stars. If it were controller compatible and the days were not cut so short it would be a 5 stars for me. Still a very cute game worth checking out and would recommend!","timestamp_created":1608797491,"timestamp_updated":1608797491,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511002421379089355","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ487HzyfYCdubavAI="}
