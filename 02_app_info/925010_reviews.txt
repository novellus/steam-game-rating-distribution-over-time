That is a big plus but...\nCannot shake the feeling I'm playing some moded Systemshock2...\nDo NOT trust the Dev public screenshots... game looks ok but not as detailed as in those screenshots.\nTwo things are a bust:\n1. Interaction mechanics - they feel \"plastic\" is you know what I mean.  \n2. Animations [,ostly enemy] - stuff a corpse full of straw and tell it to run around and you get something better than you have in the game. \nThose two things are a big STOP sign for me... the game feels like an Alpha version. Seriously.\nAt the current state I cannot recommend it to anyone.","timestamp_created":1609608975,"timestamp_updated":1609608975,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qfqK4vYCedjlvwI="}
