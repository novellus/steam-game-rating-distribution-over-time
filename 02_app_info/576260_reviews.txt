It is fun watching ships sail into port and leave hopefully doing what you wanted. If not rewrite the instructions and try again!\nPeriodically you have to hone the trade routes if your money is vanishing. Sometimes the prices change, making another port a better one to sell at or buy from. \n\nI like to have only one or two fast ships to free trade/explore the options/smuggle, while the rest zip about by themselves, hopefully making hay while the sun shines.\n\nIt is easy to group ships into a convoy so that you can escort a vulnerable capacious slow transport.\n\nTurn based combat takes some getting used to but can be fun. (It works better than Endless Legends). As you buy more ships then the attacks seem to lessen and there is a higher probability that your automatic ships in the vicinity will be able to join in the fight! This improves the odds considerably for that one lone ship.\n\nIt is amazing when you are caught short, with no options and only two of your ships sink all six of theirs. YES!\nI like that it isn't all a forgone conclusion. Maybe you can get away or bribe them (you coward ACTUALLY AN ACHIEVEMENT) OR fight and get sunk. Upgrading your Captain and the ship will help too.\n\nSmuggling is laborious because of the interface and cannot be done on auto but it is fun and lucrative. If the odds are less than 100% you can win or lose big. How much of a gambler are you? \n\nWhen trading: if you only check the headline price before you set sail then you can be disappointed when you arrive and attempt the trade and they don't want most or even any of your goods. I don't remember ANY of the other games giving you a warning before letting you continue with a poor sale - a nice touch! Size of the port is important for trading quantities (and smuggling too).\n\nBuy shares or fail at the game. I tend not to invest enough and being too cautious hinders me later in the game. Others sagely advise borrowing early to make investments but when I tried that I failed. I didn't realise that I should have continued until the oh so 'bitter end' (an appropriate nautical expression relating to the anchor chain) to gain the achievement instead of restarting the game.\n\nGetting your own mining camp/facility adds another twist to the already established world economy - a new cheap FREE super producer. Many of the trade routes will urgently need fine tuning now!\n\nIt is a strange game where your role seems to be to make money by trading however you usually have to set up some permanent loss leader routes to kick start a port's economy. Next set up a warehouse to snaffle those lucrative goods to splice into your trade routes or free trade with.  \n\nThere is a lot to this game. It doesn't feel like the other sea trading games. In Port Royale 2 for instance, I played for hundreds of hours, ALL manually trading. I was able to do all of the missions to get all of the player owned new cities manually. It just wouldn't be possible with this game. You have to study what is happening to succeed. Look at the industry tab. If something is pink then you will need to deliver the missing resources to get rid of that problem and free the log jam in the production.\n\nMost cites can be stimulated (at a price) to produce most goods. This makes it a huge puzzle. \nIt is best to help the cities of your 'own' nation and ports that you have shares in their economy.\n\nPlays fine on Win 10 with a 1060 card.\n\nI nearly forgot that there is a bug which sometimes makes it difficult to control the speed of the game. You may not want it to be permanently zipping along at full steam ahead. Even if all is well and it is plain sailing: the spacebar will pause and unpause the game. A godsend.\n\nYou probably shouldn't write a review late at night while drinking wine but Hey Ho - its Xmas.","timestamp_created":1606820767,"timestamp_updated":1607224539,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504412412643432617","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ494aDm/YCfoystgI="}
