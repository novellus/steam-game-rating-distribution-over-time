Have it on NES, but had to pick it up for steam as well.  Love the setting, changing environments, boss battles, and the music.  The game has a good mix of platforming with the brawler style to keep it interesting the entire time.  Even though the settling is Halloween themed, you will pick this up to play anytime of the year and enjoy it just as much.  Controls are easy to get used to and you unlock new abilities along the way as you progress in levels.  Your new abilities can be used for both of your characters, brother and sister (you can switch on the fly).  The bosses offer quite a bit of a challenge.  Pay attention to their patterns and what is available on screen and you will make it through them eventually.  All and all, highly recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1604100205,"timestamp_updated":1604100205,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nNX0vfUCd7yWqwI="}
