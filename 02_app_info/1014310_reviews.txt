Facing off on the same screen and keyboard as your opponent leads to some truly exciting gameplay.  Visually, Top Torch is stunning, and it comes with some great music to play to, as well. Definitely worth the $2.99 price tag, Top Torch will provide hours of entertainment.","timestamp_created":1550805545,"timestamp_updated":1550805545,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gtbNiekCdaG+uwE="}
