It's not going to have as much deck-building depth/synergy as some other games like STS.  However, it has a fun atmosphere and overall concept.  Well-done for a 2 dev team.  I wasn't a huge fan of the danger level mechanic in general, but there is an easy mode that does make the game more manageable for those that are struggling.  Recommended to grab on sale if you like this kind of game.\n","timestamp_created":1606004872,"timestamp_updated":1609266138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuZHv1/YCdMTjrwI="}
