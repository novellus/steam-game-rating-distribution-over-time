    review: 'There''s nothing overly special about Snake Treasure Chest.  It''s a
      game concept that''s been around for a very long time I remember playing very
      simplistic versions of the game back in the late 80s to early 90s.  This version
      has a very fancy looking snake (seems magical or mechanical or something).  The
      graphics are nice for a snake game but there''s nothing new to the concept.  This
      snake eats coins, every coin it eats makes it grow 1 unit, don''t run into walls,
      don''t run into yourself, get all the coins to unlock the key then get the key
      to unlock the exit.  Simple enough.  Sure sometimes snake games are challenging
      but the game seems to me to have some issues with response times.  Sometimes,
      it''s working fine other times you push the button to turn and the snake just
      doesn''t turn.  Usually the response time between when I hit the botton and
      the program responds by turning the snake has a slight delay ocassionally that
      delay is longer and ocassionally it is almost instantaneous.  I can learn to
      adjust to either one if it is consistent but the response time is not consistent.  I
      don''t know if this has something to do with being designed more for mobile
      or if it is something to do with my processor or if there''s something in the
      game.  I admit sometimes I screw up in the game but othertimes it really feels
      like the response time is off enough that I don''t think it''s just me being
      a butterfingers.  This makes the game frustrating to play and not so fun.  I
      mean snake games generally aren''t like the funnest games out there, they mostly
      just serve as something you can use to pass a little time but passing the time
      like this leaves a lot to be desired.


      In addition tot he usual gameplay you can also play word games (you move around
      gathering letters to make the word instead of coins or math games solving a
      math equation in order instead of collecting coins. Those are a little less
      frustrating since slow response time is less problematic in them.


      I purchased this because it was really cheap during a sale and I like to explore
      games that might possible have a Middle Eastern theme.  This one does have Turkish
      as a language option in the word game portion but nothing else (even the desert
      level) feels particularly Middle Eastern in theme so that was a disapointment.  However
      if I ever want to work on my Turkish maybe I can play the word game in Turkish
      for a challege.'
