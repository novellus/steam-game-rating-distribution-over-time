    review: I bought it at a discount and I dont regret it at ALL! This has the potential
      to be one of the BEST multiplayer strategy games out there! I finished most
      of the campaign on easy in a few hours just to get a full tour of the game and
      its awesome! I cant believe this was all done by a single person!!!
