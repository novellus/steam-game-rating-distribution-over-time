It's not.\n\nAnd some bug prevents the Vortex Cube from shattering, so I cannot gather the game resource to unlock ships, etc.\n\nYou pretty much just dodge snakes and collect the power-up meter items.  When your power meter grows you \"shudder\" the enemies then collect their body parts for ship upgrades like speed, score multiplier, etc.\n\nI suppose for some this might be fun, but I find it very boring.  And they sell it as a twin-stick shooter, but it is a single-stick dodging game with a single button to use the shudder mechanism.  This game is extremely boring. I tried my hardest to get into it and find the reason to keep trying, but it simply doesn't hook me.","timestamp_created":1552076541,"timestamp_updated":1552076541,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528186261653900146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1554406699,"developer_response":"Hi there. Sorry you didn't enjoy it. We can't like everything. In regards to the bug, were you shuddering the cubes with the appropriate colour shudder bar? If you want to crack a red cube, you need the bar to be at the red stage, orange for orange cubes and so on. I had someone else say they couldn't crack the cubes and this turned out to be the issue."}],"cursor":"AoJ4xJG+r+kCcPfMvAE="}
