Unfortunately it's teleport-only, there's no configuration, and the only way to turn without physically turning is by pressing a button which turns you some amount to the right (what a terrible way to do that; note I use Oculus Quest and Link, so MAYBE something was screwed up and there should be a button to mash to turn to the left? Still absolutely terrible mechanic). I prefer smooth locomotion but I can enjoy teleport in games, but the fact I have to physically turn makes it unplayable for me and the setup I have.\n\nI really think you should have smooth locomotion in this game, teleportation doesn't seem efficient for the goal of moving around quickly and knocking things off of surfaces.\n\nAdmittedly I did not play the pancake (2D) version, I was expecting it to be the same in VR but it appears to be significantly restricted.\n\nEven if there was a turn mechanic better than hitting a button to turn one direction, I don't think I could play this with teleport mode. Seems way to sluggish to teleport around instead of smooth motion.","timestamp_created":1589257373,"timestamp_updated":1589257373,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41ODHg/ICfP+WhwI="}
