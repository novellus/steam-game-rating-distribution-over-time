    review: 'Fun little brain-teaser that''s satisfying to play and has a decently
      challenging difficulty-curve.

      It feels a little bit like it''s more optimised for a mobile device, based on
      where each piece snaps to the cursor, and that made it a bit awkward to put
      pieces down sometimes, but that might just be me. All in all, very glad I stumbled
      upon this hidden gem in Steam''s library of puzzle-games.'
