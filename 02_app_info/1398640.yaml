      four levels of the game.<h2 class="bb_tag">Weapons: from familiar to foreign</h2>From
      the classic pump-action shotgun to a sword powered by eldritch energy, White
      Hell provides a familiar although unique arsenal of weapons.<h2 class="bb_tag">A
      journey across a frost-bound land ...and beyond</h2>After humble beginnings
      in an apartment building, your journey leads you through overtaken cities, secret
      research facilities, dangerous wilderness, and into another dimension.<h2 class="bb_tag">The
      enemy of my enemy is my enemy</h2>The dystopian civilization of White Hell is
      firmly divided into two factions: the fascist Order of the Blue Eagle and the
      communist Red Tomorrow. Both parties are more than willing to exterminate outside
      threats, which include you.<h2 class="bb_tag">Unleash the power of SISU</h2>Jarmo
      can harvest magical SISU-energy by eradicating his enemies after unlocking his
      hidden powers. This energy can be used to activate SISU-mode where your weapons
      transform into super-powered versions with new features.'
