I passed over this one for years and only got to it recently.  It looked awesome but the few people that I talked to that played it were pretty lukewarm on the game.  Well, you can sacrifice me to Quetzalcoatl because once I finally got to this one, I thought it was a blast!  \n\nThe plot's simple; you're one of your civilization's most able warriors and it's up to you to save everybody else by finding the mystical items necessary to put a stop to evil.  Of the slew of Metroid/Castlevania/Megaman homages I've went through over the last couple of years, Aztaka had some of my favorite art design of all of 'em.  The detailed backgrounds, variety of ruins/temples/forests/caverns/wastelands that you explore, the barrage of beasties you must fight (including bosses) and the different powers you wield all are rendered great.  It's a classic SNES/Genesis look but with a new set of paint on the hood.  The soundtrack also features a few memorable tunes that will get stuck in your head as you wield brute force and magic on your way to the evil warlord you must vanquish who wants the 7 phonograph relics that you seek for his own dastardly desires.  \n\nYou'll explore high and low, earn experience by beating the tar out of each area's unique foe roster, do some puzzling and figuring out where to go, find items that you need to progress or backtrack with and basically do all of the tried n' true formula things that you expect in this type of game.  The packaging of the audio/visual world is certainly gorgeous and something different but if you were hoping for something that completely reinvents the type of experience I'm describing then you are barking up the wrong ancient pillar.  \n\n...And that is perhaps Aztaka's biggest flaw; it's only the setting that is unique.  Everything else is EXACTLY what you would expect in a game of this type.  It doesn't detract from the overall experience, it's just a matter of how much Metroidvania can YOU handle?  Whether that's a flaw of the game or a strong point is in your hands to decide.  At the time I purchased this, it was exactly the kind of game I was hoping it would be and had a lot of fun beating it.  It also controlled well on PC and I didn't have any problems with glitches or bugs for an older game on Steam.  Aztaka is solid like an ancient Aztec ruin, through and through.  \n\n","timestamp_created":1608158236,"timestamp_updated":1608158467,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u9rttvYCe8XnugI="}
