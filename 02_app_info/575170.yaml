      many styles, environments, and gameplay modes in a short amount of time solo
      or with your friends.<br><br>This game is an answer to the pain of demoing VR

      timing... Don't Mess Up features super simple local multiplier for up to four
      players, competing in a playlist of wacky, fast paced action games. To keep
      things interesting, each game features multiple ways to mess up and loose the
      game, secret bonuses to win points creatively, and a dynamic camera system to
      keep players waiting interested.<br><br>Don't have friends? Don't worry! Every
      game is available in Solo mode, with an option to tailor the experience for
      livestreams and let's plays so that viewers focus on the action rather than
      on the tears of loneliness slowly dripping through the headset's nose-gap.<br><br><i>Currently,
      Don't Mess Up is still a work in progress. Grab the fully-featured demo to try
      it out, and stay tuned for the full game release!</i>

      date: Soon, who know? Maybe not. I wonder how long this message can be. Pretty
        long I guess. It's coming, don't worry. Just not now. Read the announcements
        to be up to date. Also Valve, I can't believe this has no max length...
