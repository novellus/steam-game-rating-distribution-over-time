Half interesting concept, but I don't get it.  Got through a couple levels, all they tell you is you can click on black objects.  3rd level I have a piano, street signs, rope (hose?) and a truck.  The guy never goes in front of the car which is the only thing I can seem to move.  Somehow the piano moved to the back of the truck, not sure how that happened, but can't seem to do anything.","timestamp_created":1576380168,"timestamp_updated":1576380168,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509536802768707275","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9I7lg+8CfMK05AE="}
