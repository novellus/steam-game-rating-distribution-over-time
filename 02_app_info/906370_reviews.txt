Every level feels very satisfying to clear, and the combination of a puzzle/bullet hell game makes it very skill intensive.\n\nThe music is also very good, the songs are really catchy, and you won't mind having it play for a couple hours.\n\nIn terms of visuals, its simple and clean. The only problem I have with it is that every world has the exact same theme, which isn't that big of a deal, but I think changing up the colours or something in each world could make the player a little more excited whenever they enter a new world, and it would help keep the game fresh.\n\nNow there is one big issue I have and that's the lag. When I first started playing the game it ran fine, but as time went on the game just kept running slower and slower. Now, every time I open the game and start a level, it feels like its running at 10fps (exaggerated but you get the idea). I don't have the greatest laptop but I can run much heavier games without any issues, so I feel like the game could be optimised better. I'm not sure of the exact cause of this, but I feel like dying a lot can cause the game to slow down a ton, or it could be something else entirely. Either way, please fix this! (Also, having a way to see your frame rate would be neat)\n\nEDIT: Another feature I would like is a restart world button, instead of having to go back to the level select every time.\n\nBut overall, I highly recommend this game if you're looking for a fun challenge.","timestamp_created":1584845613,"timestamp_updated":1584929067,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/8nIgvECca/4+QE="}
