For the most part, I thought the clues, whether presented in explicit notes, or from your own theories of how things work based on experimentation, were quite adequate. Sometimes the clues may be slightly incomplete (I believe by intention, unless I missed a clue) requiring a very small amount, like maybe 5 or 6 attempts of trial and error to get the final solution. Overall I was very satisfied by the puzzles in this game.\n\nThe quality of the graphics, modelling, textures etc are merely adequate for this day and age,  but they get the job done. The game engine allows real-time first person movement (not slide show) but looks like it is a home-brew engine and it is barely serviceable. Movement and animations are clunky, there aren't many options, no invert Y axis etc.\n\nThis is not a pretty game. The main job of the graphics and engine in this case to is to present the puzzles which are well-integrated into the world. By that I don't mean these are abstract stand-alone puzzles that you've seen before, but rather science or math based puzzles plausibly related to the game world.\n\nThere is a story told through in-game notes and journals that are fun to read and add to the sci fi/ steampunk atmosphere. More importantly, the in-game texts often provide vital clues.\n\nI did run into one bug that prevented me from picking up an item.  I spent a frustrating two days combing through the game world for something else I thought I had missed that was blocking my progress. I eventually broke down and consulted a walk through which made it clear that I had run into a bug. I posted a question on the forum and within a day or two the dev confirmed it was a bug and within another day or so fixed it.\n\nIf you like hard but fair logic/science/math based puzzles in a sci-fi atmosphere and don't mind looking at dated graphics and using a rather clunky game engine, then is I strongly recommend this game.  I certainly enjoyed my time with it.","timestamp_created":1602131565,"timestamp_updated":1602131601,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557046949863433838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45oSfg/UCd6TFpgI="}
