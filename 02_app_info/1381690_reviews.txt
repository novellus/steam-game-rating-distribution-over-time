The game starts in what I am assuming is Chinese but there isn't a whole lot of options so its not hard to figure out how to switch it too English. Middle button on the home screen brings up options, button on the left in the options menu switches the game to English. \n\nThe controls are really hard to get a feel for. Jumping is incredibly delayed by about a second after pressing the spacebar which makes it very difficult to try to jump on anything. Running is slow and you can watch your character take 3 or 4 steps in place before moving forward so it always feels like you are walking through sand. The camera angle  will sometimes bounce off of objects and other times it will clip through them so you are always dealing with a shaky camera. You cant fire your gun from the hip you always have to be zoomed in and while zoomed you not only move slower but you can no longer strafe. The biggest annoyance is the sound you make when you run which in my opinion is way to loud and repetitive and doesn't sound like foot steps but more like someone knocking on wood.\n\nCombat is lacking. Aside from not being able to strafe or fire from the hip the zombies aren't able to understand pathing very well. You can hide behind an open gate or some sandbags and pick zombies off one at a time and they don't pose much of a threat unless you get more then one on you at a time then all of them can hit you all at once. Until you reach the first boss that is. Not only does the first boss throw projectiles at you they can pass through walls, lock on to you, and deal aoe damage. The only way I could figure out to avoid this is by getting lucky and having his attacks clipped through the floor. After watching the store page video I see that's as far as the dev got too.","timestamp_created":1601419567,"timestamp_updated":1601419567,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529411792755126953","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+euC7vQCdY/1pAI="}
