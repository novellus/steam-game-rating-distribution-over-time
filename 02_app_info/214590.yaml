    review: 'Fairy Bloom Freesia is a pretty dull and uninspired beat''em''up that
      feels unpolished.


      There is no sidescrolling, you''re confined to small, repetitive arenas with
      enemies spawning out of thin air. The enemy roster consists of a grand total
      of 3 enemies that get slight recolors every now and then. The combat feels button-mashy
      and seems to require a fair bit of grinding to get the most out of it. There''s
      no way to replay stages either.


      When you enter the first stage, you''re met with a "tutorial" in the form of
      text prompts at the bottom of the screen that fade away in 2 seconds, and you''re
      expected to read all these in the middle of combat. Missed anything? Too bad,
      no way to get that information again, better go look it up, along with other
      mechanics that are never explained to you.


      There''s a story here, but... let''s be honest, it doesn''t really matter. The
      actual plot is minimal, and in typical anime fashion, characters take 20 dialogue
      boxes to say what could be relayed in a few words.


      Overall a mediocre game with little to recommend it, not even on sale.'
