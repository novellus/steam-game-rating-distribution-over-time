It's music is solid and it's sound design is competent. But I feel it's making a few mis-steps that are preventing it from becoming an excellent game. \n\nFirstly, the controls feel a little twitchy. There are times when I would try to nudge myself along and found myself careening off of a platform to my death. As death is cheap and there are frequent save points throughout most levels, this is not a huge loss. But I feel if the pace of the PC, platforms, and the like were slowed by 25% it would feel as though the player had better control over their character.\n\nSecond, I feel the weapon options are too plentiful as to be overwhelming. Throughout the course of the tutorial, you're given access to six different weapons, and told you can rotate between them at any time. Additionally, you can change the color of the particles you shoot, which will change the damage the particle deals to the enemy based on it's color. You're instructed on how to use them and some neat tricks you can do with them (like rocket jumping). Unfortunately, when given the option you'll likely only use two or three of the weapon types. On a more frustrating note, there is a later level which restricts your ability to use alternate weapons. I believe this could be improved by restricting weapons to power-ups found in the level themselves, and potentially having blocks that modify your weapon's color in addition to your own color. \n\nFinally, from my play time of the game, the time I spent on the final level was nearly equal to the time I spent on all the levels previous to it. I don't mind an increasing difficulty curve in a game, but that was much more of a spike than a curve. I feel it could be improved by slowing the pace of the auto-scrolling wall so as to give the player a little bit of lee-way.\n\nUnfortunately, with it's abruptness and control issues, I do not feel I can currently recommend this game. As this is early access, I do not consider this a final state of affairs. I look forward to seeing how the game is refined and hope to change my recommendation later in development / upon release.","timestamp_created":1536325848,"timestamp_updated":1536325848,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwvIGK2uUCcq2YqgE="}
