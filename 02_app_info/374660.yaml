    review: "I have decided to revise my review and make it positive because while\
      \ it isn't what I would call a complete resource pack, so long as you know what\
      \ it is you're paying for, $3 is certainly reasonable for what is there.\n\n\
      [Original review]\n\nThe toolkit, right now, is extremely skimpy. It's mostly\
      \ comprised of character sprite sheets and faces that could have come straight\
      \ out of Game Character Hub (and many may have) and a handful of very short,\
      \ simple scripts that do one specific and not particularly challenging thing,\
      \ like picking random music when you start a level. There are no additional\
      \ level design sprite sheets (the game itself comes with the standard RPG Maker\
      \ VX Ace sheets that you already have) and only one tiny sprite sheet with 12\
      \ very generic looking items, such as a gun and a first aid kit. \n\nJust so\
      \ you know, the game's music, which is NOT part of the Resource Toolkit DLC\
      \ but does come with the game is  NOT included in the license that allows you\
      \ to reuse the resources for your own projects. That's perfectly fair, but some\
      \ people might assume otherwise. To the developer: selling the soundtrack under\
      \ a similar license as the Resource Toolkit DLC might be a good source of additional\
      \ revenue, assuming the author allows it (he/she will probably want a fair cut\
      \ of the proceeds).\n\nSince the game is in early access, it may be that the\
      \ Resource Toolkit DLC will also grow and improve over time and if it does,\
      \ I will change my review. However, in the state that it's in now, I can't recommend\
      \ it for any reason other than to encourage the developer or, like me, because\
      \ you're curious and have hopes that it will grow to a reasonable size, comparable\
      \ to the usual RPG Maker VX Ace DLCs."
