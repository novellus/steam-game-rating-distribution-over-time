      /><br>The Order of Things... Disrupted<br>&quot;Many years in the future, humanity
      looks upward in despair at plants, now standing atop the food chain. How could
      they have been so arrogant...&quot;<br>Only when plants began sprouting arms
      and legs and developing self-awareness did humanity truly begin to understand
      the menace that these once photosynthesis-dependent creatures posed. No one
      could understand how the plants took this large evolutionary leap in such a
      short time, something that took their animal counterparts millions of years
      to accomplish. One thing is certain, now is the time for humanity to make their
      stand in order to stay at the top of the food chain.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/732370/extras/FP_footer_2.jpg?t=1609223396"
      /><br>Gameplay<br>As one of the first explorers of the newly discovered plant
      empire, you must continuously drive deeper and deeper into the enemy''s lair.
      Defeat bizarre and colorful fruits while retrieving new gear, weapons, and resources
      to defend yourself and expand your base camp.<br>If you''re unable to defeat

    short_description: Juicy Realm is a roguelike game in which players must square
      off against bizarre fruits all across the world. The line between the animal
      and the plant world has become blurred, and the food chain has been completely
      disrupted.

    review: 'I almost like this game.


      I love Binding of Isaac.  I love Gungeon.  I (mostly) love Nuclear Throne.  It
      seems like i should enjoy this one.  But it is visually a total mess to me.  There
      are puddles of various colors on the floor.  Projectiles of various colors flying
      around.  There are things moving on screen that are enemies, and some moving
      things that are not.  There are some obstacles on screen that you can walk through,
      and some that you cannot.  The boundaries of the arena are clear in some cases,
      and in some cases they are not.  Some enemies immediately die upon reaching
      zero health, and some enemies do an elaborate death animation.


      All of this adds up to make it almost impossible for me to tell what''s happening.  I
      have no idea what causes me damage about 50 percent of the time.  Even when
      i CAN tell what hurt me, i''m often incredulous because i was certain i was
      in a safe spot on the screen, or because i thought some moving thing was just
      part of the background.  This is all made worse by my own character''s projectiles
      and the various pets who are also frantically running around and shooting.


      I don''t hate this game.  Maybe i''ll even put a few more hours in it, to see
      if i feel better about it.  But i just can''t recommend it.  It''s pretty to
      look at, but a visual mess to actually play.'
