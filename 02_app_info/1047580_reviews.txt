Love the pixel art and chip-tune throwback.\nDISLIKED: Starting levels can get tedious causing some early mistakes in what would be perfect play.\n\n[b]===== Mood After 30mins =====[/b]\n☑ Addicted\n☐ Afternoon delight\n☐ Grindfest\n☐ Frustrated\n\n[b]===== Will I Revisit =====[/b]\n☑ Yes, I aim to 100% complete\n☐ Yes, but only beat the game\n☐ Eventually. Until then, back to the pile\n☐ No, on to other games\n\n[b]===== Price =====[/b]\n☑ Full price worthy\n☐ Discount\n☐ Deep discount\n☐ Pass\n\n[b]Disclaimer:[/b] [i]I'm aware 30 minutes is not enough time to properly review any game. Historically, I'm a big completionist when it comes to gaming, but my backlog will just not die and adulting obligations continue to mount. I needed to find some sense of accomplishment with my backlog other than buying them at great discount. Dedicating at least 30 minutes of play per game will be my arbitrary sense of achievement. It may not justify my gaming spending habits, but I'll suffer less buyer's remorse. Who knows, in 30 minutes I might discover a great game I want to revisit and something you want to purchase. GGs![/i]\n\n======================\n\n[h1]Postmortem Review[/h1]\n\n[b]LIKED THE MOST:[/b] Addictive gameplay deserves turned into an arcade. Enjoyable chiptunes which are Megaman-like.\n[b]DISLIKED THE MOST:[/b] The sound of getting hit, the grind of climbing past the beginning/warm up levels.\n\n[b]===== If I Could Speak To Myself Prior To Playing =====[/b]\nNon-spoilers: I did not know I could stun enemies by boosting into them.
