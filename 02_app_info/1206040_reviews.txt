(This is where most of my playtime came from)\n-The trophies that the game gives you feel tacked on and unnecessary.\n\n[h1] The Bad [/h1]\n-The game is far too short. Other than the marathon mode, there are only 4 levels in the campaign, and they can all be beaten in around 15 minutes (In my experience).\n-Building off of the last point, because the game is very short, the difficulty curve is extremely steep.\n-The hi-res pixel art is a bit rough sometimes, and it makes me think that the game would have been better off using smooth art instead.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nOverall, Rhythm of the Gods gets a [u] [b] 6.5/10 [/b] [/u] from me for being fairly enjoyable, but a bit too short for the price point. If Lyrelark updates the game with features such as latency calibration and some more content for the campaign, I think this game has the potential to become something really great.","timestamp_created":1595563663,"timestamp_updated":1595564223,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542483627796173096","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ob3Cv/MCdqWalwI="}
