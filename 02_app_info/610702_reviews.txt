Watching the pieces move around into their spots is a spectacle akin to winning a game of solitaire on a windows 98. It will also set up in either 1-2 player configuration or 3-4 player depending on how many players are seated.\n\nThe how to play book is also scripted for easy one click back and forth page turning. A very nice feature.\n\nThe table and background look beautiful, in alot of ways, the $6 your paying, is mostly for the looks, and it's almost worth it.\n\nThe tokens snap together perfectly anywhere on the board so your beehive's always look beautiful.\n\nThe map is uncluttered and simplistic, there's nothing on the table that doesn't need to be there.\n---------------------------------cons-----------------------------\n\nWatching the script you can clearly see which age of end card is being put on the bottom of the deck. This kind of ruins the surprise and give an edge to anyone paying attention.\n\nThe script automatically deletes the rest of the age of end cards. Which is bad because Destiny of the Delvers requires you to pull two more age of end cards. \n\nThe table is lumpy on the sides which means you can't draw on some parts, which makes final score calculation a chore.\n\nThere is no automatic score calculation. I understand this would be a taxing feature to implement but as it stands, there's not much setting this paid game apart from the free versions already available.\n\nThe board is kind of small, it can get crowded fast\n\nAn additional script for calculating what dice totals are already on a ruin as well as a deal button for passing back dice, delve cards, and the claimed ruin would be nice.\n\nFinal Notes: \nIf you really, really, really like to play unearth, go ahead and buy this. It looks better and plays better then any of the other mods on the workshop. But if you just want to play a few games and have a fun time discovering ruins, save your money and go to the workshop.\n\nFinal score: 7/10","timestamp_created":1577423272,"timestamp_updated":1577423272,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.720389604568481445","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhJ/wou8CeYmt5wE="}
