I saw my son watching youtubers play this ages ago and since we finally got an oculus quest 2 for christmas this year (which i'm thoroughly testing before santa drops it off on the 25th LOL) this is my favourite game so far. It definitely needs some polishing as there are some clipping issues. \n\nI'm not sure where development is, but this game really needs a boost. It has so much potential. Right now it's easily worth your money as it's very cheap. \n\nGreat graphics, great audio, great playability, original idea. 9.5/10, they can have the other .5/10 if it makes it out of early access\n","timestamp_created":1607882608,"timestamp_updated":1607882608,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw2LHRrvYCedPzuQI="}
