So this game is a lot like most music ryhthm games.  Perhaps even simpler.  You basically have good potatoes that you need to catch and bad potatoes that you need to avoid.  There's a pretty good music soundtrack going while you are doing this. \n\nSo what's so good about this game?   Well, the fact that you need full roomscale to move around to avoid said potatoes or to catch said potatoes.  You will move left right, up and down to catch these giant spuds or avoid being hit by them.  It's such a simple premise, but it's executed brilliantly here.  I stopped playing after 7 minutes because I got all sweaty, but I had fun.  I think you need more than standing room if you really want to do well in this game.  \n\nThere just needs to be more content.  Give us more potato environments, more tunes, how about a tomato? \n\nRating 7/10 worth the $1.79 price just for the musical workout","timestamp_created":1508375875,"timestamp_updated":1508375967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553571403026580811","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40daNmd8CcJTXiAE="}
