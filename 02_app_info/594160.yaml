    review: 'The Last Patient is an FPS game developed using GameGuru, "The Easy Game
      Maker". Its a pretty short game, it can be completed in 30 minutes or less.


      It has the usual GameGuru issues, awkward movements, stiff reloading, useless
      iron-sights, dumb AI, and choppy framerates. I can''t blame the developer for
      these issues, as these issues should be fixed by the engine makers, The Game
      Creators (TGC). However, I will blame the developer for picking GG over Unreal
      and  Unity.


      Unlike some other GameGuru games, The Last Patient has a price tag slapped on
      it. I think I paid $0.49 for this game, so you can say that I got ripped off.
      This game is not worth $0.49, and its not worth your time.


      Conclusion:

      Avoid it.'
