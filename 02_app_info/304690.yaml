    review: There's currently a massive rework of the entire game in progress. This
      rework will render the game absolutely unfun to play and the devs are resisting
      any and all critiques about the rework from its playerbase. The owner of the
      game forces whatever he wants into the game without any QA or supervision. Any
      investments into your characters are being dashed as over 40% of all items in
      the game are being changed to suit the owner's vision.
