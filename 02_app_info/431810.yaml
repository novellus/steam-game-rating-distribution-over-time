    review: Picked this up on Holiday sale for 63 cents.  It's worth more than that.  So
      many critics write "I can't figure it out, sob, the developer won'tr hold my
      hand..."  Well, this is a throw back to the golden era where you didn't need
      instructions to play, but you learn by playing.  It's a dungeon crawl, in a
      post-apocalyptic theme, with great ambient sound and a lot to figure out as
      you play.  It's difficult; "EASY" is by no means easy, but at least lets you
      keep your items when you die and restart.  The game is a crawl, and is fun to
      whittle away the time.   It's likely a mobile game with very little PC polish,
      but it's fun, and for 63 cents, who can complain.  I like that you need to use
      your imagination and fill in a back story as you discover scrolls (story notes).  Its
      an inexpensive amateur game that lets you feel a little bit of wonder.  I could
      imagine this exact game on the C64 back in the day.
