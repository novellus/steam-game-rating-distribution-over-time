    review: "Only leaving a positive review because of the low price. The equipment\
      \ provided is quite redundant. The Borne tractor is basically the same as the\
      \ starter tractor, and the \"Gecko Strong 09\" is very similar to the other\
      \ Lindners (now \"Gecko\", I guess they lost the Lindner license).\nThe tippers\
      \ are OK I suppose but there were already several large and small trailers in\
      \ the game, so no real need for more. \n\nThe only piece of equipment that really\
      \ adds anything is the seeder. It's slightly wider than what was in the game\
      \ before, so that's nice if you do a lot of manual sowing. Would have been more\
      \ interesting if they gave us an even wider, foldable seeder and/or a direct\
      \ drill, though."
