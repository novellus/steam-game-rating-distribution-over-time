    review: "Attention: If you do not see the soundtrack files in the music folder\
      \ for the game files then you only need to do a simple step. \n\nWhile in your\
      \ games library, click the drop down menu and deselect everything but 'soundtracks'.\
      \ \nYou should see 'Stellaris: Original Game Soundtrack' in there. \nJust select\
      \ it and click download. Done, the soundtrack should appear on your system after\
      \ finishing!"
