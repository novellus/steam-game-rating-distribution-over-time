Then out of the blue they just change it to VR only so people like me cant even play it anymore, and I dont know if i can even get a refund because i bought it so long ago.\n\nIts a shame really because it had a lot of promise. \n\nIf you want a game you can control a dragon and fly around as, check out Day of Dragons, currently in development and they are making good progress","timestamp_created":1606383934,"timestamp_updated":1606384013,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501587331295013428","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47Nn8gfYCd6GBsgI="}
