    review: 'Pros

      - Graphics are good.

      - Cheap


      Cons

      - Only three weapons to select and they all have CD or easy overheat.

      - Storyline is weak.

      - Campaign is short and there are bugs keep me from proceeding.

      - The mission objectives may be very unclear. I realized sometimes I just need
      to wait and sit there doing nothing for something that will automatically happen
      when the time is up.  This is very frustrating.'
