It has made solid progress, and I can only imagine it would be much more fun with co-op.\n\nWith that in mind, let me start by saying I play mostly Solo play, although that doesn't really cause me any problems, personally. I've played Zomboid, and even dabbled in CDDA. I can handle an unforgiving start in a zed game (I actually quite like the feeling of frantically trying to keep my needs met while I establish an outpost...)\n\nThis review is mostly going to be negative, because I hope the Dev will address these problems at some point, but the game has been exceptionally fun, even as I'm reaching my limit on the BS I'll soon write about, I'm enjoying the game. It's really interesting and creative, and.. well.. fun. \n\nMy biggest complaint, honestly, is the auto targeting. It tries to auto target for you, and there's no way to disable this, so if three zombies are close enough to lunge at you at the same time you lose. End game. There's no fixing it, because the auto aim will rapidly spin you around to the one that's starting it's lunge animation, and refuse to swing at the ones who lunge or the ones on the ground. A solid 80% of my deaths end this way, and usually against only two or three zombies. If there's enough spacing where multiple zombies don't enter the lung animation too close together, so that I can actually lock onto a zombie and, yano, attack, I can usually take 6-8 zombies down in one go.\n\n*UPDATE* I had lowered the sensitivity down previously, and it didn't seem to do anything but on reboot it's far more functional now, so I'll rescind that.\n\nBeyond that the AI can be incredibly, frustratingly stupid. I was trying to build a camp fire, and my character kept stopping in the middle of chopping logs to try and walk to a near by base to go set by the fire.\nI had done that before going to my base, got her Temp up to 35. Walking to my planned base-site took her between that and 32.  Not at 32. I felt like I was fighting my own character to do a simple task, which is just a huge drag. I get why that's important, but if I'm actively controlling a character, maybe have it just show the need above their head sims-style until it's an emergency? (I usually would go back to the camp at temp 28, refill to 35, then continue with whatever I was doing)\n\nHowever, in my so-far-EXTREMELY-limited experience, if their needs are generally well met and you have supplies in camp, the AI works really well. It's just super frustrating while you're already struggling to meet your needs, and lay out a foundation so that you won't have to continue to struggle to meet your needs, to fight the AI, and I had to completely stop my last game because it simply dovetailed too far, where my character wouldn't even go to do a need before stopping to do something else. It reminded me of two sims trying to use the stairs at the same time in sims 2, where they end up dead in a puddle of their own urine because they don't know what to do lol.. but, yano, much more frustrating.","timestamp_created":1609877085,"timestamp_updated":1609877545,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4gryL6vYCdfTmwAI="}
