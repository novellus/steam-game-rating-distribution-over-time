    review: "Sometimes you wanna play some fun jank, and this is one of them.  \n\
      Feels like someone learned programming cause they really liked Ocarina of Time,\
      \ which isn't a bad thing at all.\nLots of hidden stuff, pretty freeform, and\
      \ from what I've played (including some non-steam time in the demo) it keeps\
      \ you on your toes with weird stuff all around.\n\nUnlike a lot of jank this\
      \ seems more fun than pain.  Exploring actually feel oddly rewarding and the\
      \ content is pretty varied. \n Combat ranges from pretty fun to button mashey\
      \ and random.  Overall, the game is pretty easy at the beginning though and\
      \ I mostly died to platforming. I did have some bug that blocked progression\
      \ (like in the crypt fighting the green guy the fight never ended). The UI is\
      \ really unintuitive and it's easy to destroy items by accident.\n\nUpdate:\n\
      Yeah, this just needs a few things to be more playable:\n- Some kind of hit\
      \ effect. It's super hard to tell when you take damage\n- Make it easier to\
      \ hit those tiny crates (why are they so tiny?)\n- Reduce the bow aiming sensitivity.\n\
      - Add a confirm to destroy item\n- Lower the price: it's a bit steep for this\
      \ quality\n\nUpdate 2:\nThis game gets really hard towards the end if you're\
      \ not playing very well.  It's fun if you don't mind trying to cheese out enemies\
      \ and bosses.  It's never straight up unfair, but you do lose your healing items\
      \ on death so you have to play either perfectly or very carefully."
