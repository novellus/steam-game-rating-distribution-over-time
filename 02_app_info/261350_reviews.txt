Early in 2017 the publisher responded saying that it wasn't abandoned but they'd lost much of their team, progress was slow, and kickstarter.com was the place to check for updates on progress. Today, the kickstarter page hasn't been updated since 30 Jan 2019. No notice of progress or even a news item in a full year.\n\nMaybe now it's safe to say this project has been abandoned?\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPREVIOUSLY UPDATED REVIEW (JAN 2017)\n\nThe team developing the game has changed radically in the five years since its release on Steam. The game's progress has gone up and down, back and forth in that time. Complete redesigns of systems, etc. This development cycle is part of the deal with early access. We all know that by now.\n\nThe team doesn't push updates to Steam, but instead you need to refer back to their Kickstarter over and over to find out what's happening. After five years, the game is listed still in pre-alpha phase 1.\n\nThe game might get finished and it might be great when it is, but right now there isn't much going on. Wait for a finished product before parting with your dollars on this one.","timestamp_created":1482500236,"timestamp_updated":1579786437,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4mICn6e8CcYz6bA=="}
