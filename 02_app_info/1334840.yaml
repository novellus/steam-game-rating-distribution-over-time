    detailed_description: "<h1>Update Notes</h1><p>In 2020, on December 25, GOHOME\
      \ received a major update.\r\n\r\nUpdate contents\r\n\u30FBFixed a bug that\
      \ caused the language to be initialized on every launch.\r\n\u30FBFixed physics\
      \ bug in the last stage.\r\n\u30FBNew maps and characters added (after clearing\
      \ the night town stage)\r\n\u30FBThe background and some of the effects have\
      \ been changed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, we had prepared a 2D mini-game for\
      \ the second week after clearing the last stage, but due to a mysterious bug,\
      \ the game itself may crash when the game over in the 2D game. Please don't\
      \ die.\r\nI haven't found a solution yet, so if anyone knows how to fix it,\
      \ I'm afraid I'd like to know.\r\nThe mini-games have nothing to do with the\
      \ story, they are just an added bonus.\r\n\r\nIf the game doesn't start after\
      \ the update, please uninstall and reinstall it.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>This\
