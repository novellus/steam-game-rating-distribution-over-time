I absolutely love the different elements in this game, like the sidequests and the cooking features. There is blood and quite a few ways to die, so if you're squeamish about that it might not be the best idea to play. However, even with the horror elements, this game is adorable","timestamp_created":1576648394,"timestamp_updated":1606605436,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxq7JiPYCeK6L5QE="}
