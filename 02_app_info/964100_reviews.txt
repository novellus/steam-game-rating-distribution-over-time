It's not that easy to get into it since it is quite challenging in its complexity. Nevertheless, I like the idea of this meadow where flowers grow on their own. It is weird, but the flowers are equipped with different weapons. It seems like they pass on those those weapons through their seeds to other flowers.\nThere are litte spheres with which I can do changes in the flowers. Soon I realized that this is a game with a highly strategic component. Different mods can be combined, but the meadwo itself constantly brings challenges one has to handle. Brain-workers welcome ;)","timestamp_created":1552296160,"timestamp_updated":1552296160,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.603960394859313965","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsPWDtukCeuTovAE="}
