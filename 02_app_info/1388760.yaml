    review: 'Really glad to see this project; especially as the website Jocly is no
      longer available which used to provide different chess variants to play against
      the AI or with another player. Chess++ is already good by providing Raumschach
      in it''s original German format of 1907 which was designed to represent the
      recent innovation of flight and its use within modern warfare. The AI is difficult
      on hard but it would be good to have more difficulty options as easy may be
      too easy for some players. I would also like to see some alternate display options
      for the board; although I think the cubic format is effective I think personally
      I prefer to have 5 flat boards placed ontop of each other without vertical lines
      interlinking them because I found this made it more difficult to see through
      the board when viewing from the side. The best idea I think would be to be able
      to toggle different guidelines on and off at will.


      I really look forward to the Chess++ progressing and expanding to include new
      variants: Some variants I would really like to see included in order of preference
      are:

      1) Hexagonal Chess - which has 3 board colours and thus 3 different bishops:
      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_chess

      2) Star Trek''s Tri-Dimensional Chess - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_chess#Star_Trek_Tri-Dimensional_Chess

      3) Hnefatafl - Nordic chess like asymmetrical board game about the king escaping
      an ambush: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafl_games

      4) Shogi - Japanese variant of chess with more versatile movement options: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi

      5) Kriegspiel Chess - where you cannot see your opponents pieces and their location
      must be inferred https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriegspiel_(chess)

      6) Fischer Random Chess - where starting position is randomly selected from
      960 possible options: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer_random_chess

      7) Customizable option to create your own chess variant e.g. victory conditions,
      pieces number/type, starting position, board size, difficulty etc.'
