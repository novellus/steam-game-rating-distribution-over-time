    review: The Orchard of Stray Sheep is a relatively short (can be finished in 4
      hours) VN where you're drawn into the mysterious workings of the Academy on
      this island and discover some Dark Secrets (although anyone with sense can see
      the twists coming from a mile off). I recommend this game, but with some caveats.
      The artwork is lovely, the music is very nice, and some of the characters are
      interesting, but the game has a rather slow start, which means more of the game
      is slice-of-life, atmospheric stuff than conspiracy, intrigue, deception, etc.
      There's only two choices in the VN, both of which are very close to the end.
      The plot is...well, some people may like the writing more than I did. There's
      a lot of things happening in short succession with very little rhyme or reason,
      and the worldbuilding doesn't make a lot of sense when you think about it. Also
      the MC is a complete prick. But besides that, as I said, the music and art are
      nice, and the slow build of the mystery is interesting. My rating would be maybe
      a 6/10--recommend it, but just barely.
