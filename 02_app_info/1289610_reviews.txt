I buy it thinking of another simple visual novel and... NO. This change my memory in each text, each happening and each choose I get on game. Im playing again now and I want to see all the possible finals. The gameplay is never the same and the game seems to give you more and more new stuff. I tell everyone who like a original and new game (Which unfortunally great games miss this) should play this amazing indie.","timestamp_created":1594332658,"timestamp_updated":1594333026,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7erpmvMCe+6UlAI="}
