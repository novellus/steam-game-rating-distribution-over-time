    about_the_game: So you think you are pretty good at throwing ping pong balls into
      plastic cups? Well we will see about that hot shot. Welcome to VeeR Pong, where
      you can test your skills against anyone at any time of day, or if everyone is
      passed out play against a bot who will keep your skills in check.<br><br>Features<br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Multiplayer:</strong> Seriously, what good is a party
      game that you can't play with other people in real time?! VeeR Pong supports
      multiple modes of multiplayer because sometimes you want to chill, and other
      times you want to compete.<br></li><li><strong>Fully Active Gameplay:</strong>
      Want to adjust your angle, take a step to your side. Want to add spin to your
      shot, twist your controller in that direction as you shoot. <br></li><li><strong>True
      to Life Scale:</strong> Objects in this game have been meticulously crafted
      to achieve the same scale as they would be in the real world.<br></li><li><strong>Casual
      and Competitive Modes:</strong> Play with whatever custom house rules (bounce
      shots, &quot;death&quot; cup, island cups, etc) you want in FreeForAll where
      rules are enforced by the people playing the game. Looking for something more
      competitive and less up to interpretation, then play in Competitive Mode where
      a slightly modified version of the rules used in the World Series of Beer Pong
      are automatically enforced.</li></ul>

    review: "Save yourself $9.99 and Stick with the demo!\n\nThe full game is buggy\
      \ as heck and unplayable in its current state. I have W7 x64 Ultimate. i5 4670K\
      \ OC @ 4.4ghz. GTX 1070 FTW. 16GB RAM. 500GB Samsung SSD. No problems with any\
      \ VR games with my VIVE.\n\nWhen you try to play against AI, the game bugs out.\
      \ Framerate drops. Nonstop stuttering. Flashes of white across the screen. And\
      \ the blank SteamVR background, chaperone, and VIVE controller will randomly\
      \ appear and disappear during play.\n\nWhen you switch it to practice mode,\
      \ the game runs smooth as silk. \n\nTo top it off, it seems the developer isn't\
      \ around so expect seldom updates if any."
