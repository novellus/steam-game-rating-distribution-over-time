    review: 'As the description goes this is one of the selection of more ''realistic''
      coasters, though it might get a little warm on this one.


      This is a pretty plain coaster overall there are plenty of hills and curves
      in the track taking you down very close to the lava which along with the rocky
      landscape is quite well realised.


      The only real thing I will say is that the smoke coming out of the volcano is
      very disappointing, low frame rate and very obvious pre-rendered puffs.


      When I wrote this review the Shooting and Racing options have not been completed.


      It''s a hesitant Yes from me for this it''s okay but it''s not as interesting
      as some of the other coasters.'
