What we have here is not a proper new story campaign. Not like you can ask much from a [b]$4.99[/b] [b]DLC[/b], but what we have here is just... one mission. That's right. One... bloody... mission. Nothing else. Literally. Nothing. And it's not like it comes with a brand new map either. It's just a map from the main game ([b]Casta DeVitt[/b]), updated with new goals and enemy placement. And you know what? It's a joke. I mean, as you probably know, in the [b]PC[/b] version of the game you can use some special cheat codes to customize the existing maps. You can even share those edited maps with your friends by sending them your save files. And it's an official thing, not a custom modification. Heck, it even explained on [b]Mimimi[/b]'s website! So, having a customized version of [b]Casta DeVitt[/b] for [b]$5[/b] feels... pretty lame, really.\n\nSure, there's heck of a lot of [b]DLC[/b] around that feels worse than this. Way worse, actually. Those greedy publishers sure sold us a lot of crap through years, can't argue with that. But after godlike main game, something as poor as this... is not what you expect. Even the story here is a big disappointment. I mean, come on! There were so many possibilities... So many things in [b]Desperados III[/b] were left untold. I wanted to know about [b]Marshal Ross Cooper[/b], I wanted to learn about how [b]Doc McCoy[/b] lost his eye, I wanted to learn about what happened with [b]Hector[/b] and [b]Isabelle[/b] before the events of [b]Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive[/b]... But what did I actually get? [b]John[/b] and his gang robbing [b]Casta DeVitt[/b]. Like... seriously? [b]Samuel Williams[/b] from previous [b]Desperados[/b] games will be mentioned, which will give us some hints about when [b]John[/b] met him, but that'll be just that – a short mention. Sure, you can't tell much story in one mission, but it's not like anyone even tried much here.\n\nI kinda admire the fact that, even though [b]THQ Nordic[/b] asked for [b]DLC[/b], [b]Mimimi[/b] decided to focus on the main game and make it their number one priority, while filling the season pass with something basic (instead of cutting things from the game and sell them separately), but still, it doesn't really make this [b]DLC[/b] to feel any better. As the result, you should either get this as a part of [b]Deluxe Edition[/b], which is only [b]$10[/b] more expensive than the basic one and comes with all three [b]DLC[/b] maps and soundtrack, or ignore this mission completely. As long as you're not one of those rich kids who just blindly buy everything in [b]Steam[/b], it just... doesn't worth it. It breaks my heart saying something like this about [b]Desperados III[/b], which quickly became one of my most favorite games ever, but still, it just.... doesn't.
