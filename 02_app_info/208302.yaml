    about_the_game: 'The Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway (S&amp;DJR) is a fondly
      remembered name in the minds of steam fans everywhere, and now you can drive
      along this wonderful railway line from the golden age of steam in Train Simulator.
      <br><br>The S&amp;DJR was formed in 1862 during the great era of railway building
      in Britain, and was a challenge from the beginning as it required building the
      line over the Mendip Hills, resulting in some tricky gradients. The line carried
      local freight and passenger traffic, and was particularly busy in the summertime
      as it carried families from northern England down to the seaside resorts in
      the south. The line became part of the British Railways Southern Region in 1948,
      and remained busy throughout the 1950s and 1960s despite more and more cuts
      being made, culminating in the final closure of the line in 1966. The Somerset
      and Dorset line for Train Simulator runs from Bath Green Park to Templecombe
      and includes the classic 7F and Black 5 steam locomotives with rolling stock,
      as well as scenarios to put you to the test on this wonderful line.<h2 class="bb_tag">Key

    review: This is just the Bath to Templecombe route from Rail Simulator way back
      in 2007. However it is still a good route with good scenarios and a very nice
      driving experience. The scenery looks empty by more recent standards but you
      probably won't care when you find how great the route is. It was great to get
      back to this route after so long not playing Rail Simulator (doesn't work well
      in modern pcs)
