For a rogue-like, the selection is hardly noteworthy. One pistol, one shotgun, one SMG, a decoy, a grenade, a grenade launcher etc etc. They all have kooky names & fancy looks, but their use-case is like every gun in every shooter ever.\nThere's only straight stat upgrades - no random variants, nothing to break up the monotony.\n Try playing Synthetik: Legion Rising, if you're looking for a huge variety of guns, guns with gimmicks & fun meachanics, and random variants & upgrades of such. \n\nThe environments are generally well stylized and I like the artstyle, but again, there's kind of too little of it (especially for the \"budget AAA\" pricetag).\nThere's a bare handful of shiptypes, all with their own tile-sets that used get over and over and over again - well past the point of providing anything unique.  The 'random' levels aren't much help - seen two or three examples of a ship-type (which is [i]nothing[/i] in terms of total game progess), and you'll recognize the pattern in all of them.\n\nAlso, the humour isn't nearly as clever or repeatedly funny as it believes it is. There's like a handful of good jokes presented through the environment, but not much else. Enemies reuse the same, \"funny-voice\" callouts constantly. The Story-Missions are all the same: 'Collect scrap item de jour - repeat ad nauseum'\n\nThis may be [i]inspired[/i] by Bioshock, but it forgot that - past the zany, wacky, art-deco surface - Bioshock actually had writing more complex than \"funny english accents, haha\".\nAnd comparing it to System Shock is almost an insult for the venerable old games bearing that title.\n\nAt the end, I don't see how this game is supposed to work as a rogue-lite/like, because there's basically no replay value...\nAt the end of my 12h playtime, I decided to finish what little 'story' there is - not to come to a thrilling conclusion, but to just put the nail in the coffin and stop milling about.","timestamp_created":1584296446,"timestamp_updated":1610141580,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":89,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.750133812427520752","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrtf68fYCduis+AE="}
