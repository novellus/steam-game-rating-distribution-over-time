There's half an hour I'm not getting back.  Apart from brevity, an interesting premise is all it has going for it.  Which is about as positive as saying the game had potential until I started playing it.\nSo bad it's almost a joke.  You walk round, clipping off every surface imaginable, finding keys and opening doors, and that's the height of it.  No attempt to build any sort of suspense.  There's like all of 2 jump scares.  Also there's some very poorly crowbarred in \"eerie\" sound effects seemingly randomly throughout an otherwise silent world which results in an absolute mess of an audial experience.  Same goes for visuals.  This is a particularly ugly game.\nThere are enemies at one stage which move at the same speed you do so if you get spotted the only way to throw them off is to turn a corner sharply and hope they get caught on the scenery and you don't.  Not that they seemed to cause any tangible damage when they did catch up with you.\nAnd the \"run\" section at the has the most questionable camera work I've ever seen in a video game.\nJust avoid.","timestamp_created":1444086305,"timestamp_updated":1444086305,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4joqQndACd+n+RQ=="}
