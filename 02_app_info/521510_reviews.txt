Even if it's a childish goal, it's her heart's wish all the same. \nIn pursuit of that dream, she finds: the Tower, an ancient proving ground to determine who is worthy to enter the magical land of Celestria; and Salamander, an adorable magical being who teaches her the beginnings of magic.\nTogether, they face the Tower's trials, add other magical beings to the party, and gradually discover the truth behind why Celestria separated from the mundane world so long ago...\n\n\nCharming.\nThe characters are lovable and the story is classic.\nFully voiced in Japanese, and decently translated into English. Nearly every input you make will have a corresponding response from your character.\nIt's gameplay is rather straightforward. Climb the 2.5D spiraling tower. Fight or avoid the enemies in your way. I especially like to find ways to chain spells to rocket around the tower super fast. (Your character's face on the HUD will change expressions based on what your doing or what they're saying. It's a very simple detail, but it's just too cute.)\nThe animations are a little wonky, but honestly that just makes it even more charming to me.\n\nThis game didn't screw with my brain, yank the rug out from under me with groundbreaking twists in the narrative, or depress me with a nihilistic world of living death. \n10/10\nI absolutely recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1609571791,"timestamp_updated":1609571791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iY794PYCcuTSvwI="}
