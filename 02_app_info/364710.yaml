    review: "Well, this game still needs a lot of work, to say the least.\n\nHowever,\
      \ it's got promise as a good game, if the developers want to work on it.  Sadly,\
      \ they seem to have abandoned it. \n\nThis game concept has so much potential\
      \ I am disappointed that the developers didn't fix all the issues and expand\
      \ the game.\n\nI would have loved to see lots of stuff added, like level editors,\
      \ modding kit, and more game modes.  It is a real shame that the developers\
      \ decided to leave the game how it is.  \n\nDue to the fact the developers seem\
      \ unwilling to update the game or improve it, I'd only recommend it if you can\
      \ grab it for next to nothing on sale like I did. Honestly, if you're paying\
      \ next to nothing for it, the game is good for a few laughs and an little bit\
      \ of entertainment, even if it's not perfect, and certainly not a finished product.\n\
      \nWho would like this game:\nPeople who love quirky silly games (Goat simulator\
      \ fans, and I am Bread fans, you'll like this one.)\nThose who can get it on\
      \ sale for next to nothing. \n\nWho would not like this game:\nPeople who are\
      \ infuriated by bugs.\nPeople who can't handle oversensitive controls.\nPeople\
      \ who can't enjoy a game that is clearly not finished.\nPeople who lack a sense\
      \ of humor or don't like silly little toy games."
