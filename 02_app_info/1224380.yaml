      We trying to make a cheap game for horror lovers. The game is still open to
      early access. Some errors may occur.


      Chapter one has been completed and improved.

      All criticism will lead the game to a better place.'

    review: "In comparision to the old version before the game looks quite good now\
      \ as well as the game menu was rebuilded and i can do all the changes regarding\
      \ graphics, sound and mouse options. The performance is much better now, but\
      \ unfortunately it has the same issues like many other of these cheap horror\
      \ games : i don't know where to find the first key in these darkness. The batteries\
      \ of my flashlight are empty, all drawers are locked, the first door, too. I\
      \ stumbled around without any light source, find another door, locked of course...minutes\
      \ later i came to a wide gate to access an bigger area in the game and what\
      \ happened?. Right, nothing ! I need an item to break it open. What a surprise.\
      \ Some time later i figured out how to open drawers, you have to hold \"e\"\
      , press left mouse button and pull with your mouse. Furthermore the game has\
      \ bad checkpoints. If you die a little later, you'll have to play the entire\
      \ first part again. Very nice ! A pity, is it too much effort to make these\
      \ games more beginner-friendly so that you don't lose the joy playing the game\
      \ in the first 10 minutes? \n"
