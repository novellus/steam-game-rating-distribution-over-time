    review: As for a DLC, it's very great to see these two squads meet and do a couple
      missions and have their own story and to find out that [spoiler]The ambassador
      asks squad E to join him in Randgriz[/spoiler] . But every character that voiced
      them from the first game, is different(At least in English). That changed my
      entire mood to this DLC. I went from excited to skipping ALL the dialogue of
      squad 7. I don't know if they had a short time in getting voice actors for the
      game and just had to make do with what they had, or they didnt care because
      it was a DLC but it ruined my entire mood to this DLC. They also join Squad
      E for some reason? Why? Makes no since to the story or continuity. I know this
      review is just a rant but it threw my entire mood for the love on how the old
      VA fit their characters so well and having these other VA totally not get the
      feel of their character for a short DLC, out the window.
