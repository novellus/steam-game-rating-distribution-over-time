      !<br>Ever wanted to ride a futuristic motorbike floating over the ground, fully
      loaded with lethal weapons? Well, we''ve got you covered!<br>Put on your VR
      Headset and hit the track!<br>Challenge your friends in time-trial mode and
      weekly challenges with online ghosts, race against bots in a fun shooting feast,
      or play online in multiplayer with up to six racers.<br><br>V-RACER HOVERBIKE
      was designed for VR from the ground up. It''s not a port. It can''t be played
      without a headset, as the control system is VR-only.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668430/extras/HeadLiner_1.png?t=1596035227"

      to race on popular Earth tracks from the 20th century, built when cars and bikes
      still had wheels.<br><br>We started early access with 4 tracks, we now have
      30. Simple tracks are fairly flat, making them comfortable for anyone in VR,
      and easy to learn. More advanced ones include bends, hills and loops. For players
      looking for extreme sensations, we will shortly have jumps. For Sim racers,
      we have six GP tracks, ideal for time trials.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/668430/extras/Tracks.png?t=1596035227"
