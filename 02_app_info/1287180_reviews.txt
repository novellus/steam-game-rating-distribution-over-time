Its is local only so if you are solo player or dont know anybody near you, you cant really play a game of squares. was kinda hoping it would have online multiplayer. Also i found the control to be werid. Hard to explain. there not what you think it would be. anyways cool game. you can only play it if someone is sitting next to you.","timestamp_created":1590271856,"timestamp_updated":1590271856,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2NnlofICdeXsiQI="}
