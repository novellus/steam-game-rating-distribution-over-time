      \ fled into an unknown forest. Suddenly, a witch appears in front of you, pointing\
      \ to a house not far away, saying she can provide food, water, and a place to\
      \ rest. However, upon arriving at the house, the woman disappeared. Before entering,\
      \ you find that it is in fact a cave. Then you're informed by a note that the\
      \ witch needs you to enter the cave and find the Dragon Knight, Sowen, who has\
      \ a magical weapon that he intends on using to open the Gates of Hell. So you\
      \ descend into the dungeon and begin your search for the Dragon Knight and the\
      \ powerful weapon he possesses, hoping to stop him before he puts an end to\
      \ the world.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"></h2><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/823610/extras/Steam\u5546\

    review: 'DODK is a classic Dungeon Crawler, grid based, party of 4, mimics and
      the minimum of D&D-plot starters. This is all well and fine, but it failed to
      get me. In Legend of Grimrock, I was invested almost immediately, while LoG2
      repelled me in the second level by introducing spiders hopping in my face. The
      developer was so nice as to confirm for me, that THERE ARE NO SPIDERS in DODK.
      Really big plus!

      On the other hand, I didn''t feel my attacks make an impact, I didn''t know
      what I did wrong sometimes, and though death isn''t too punishing with liberal
      checkpoints/autosaves, I quit on my second death three levels down and won''t
      return. It looks good, but doesn''t feel good for me.

      Solid dungeon crawler, just not for me.
