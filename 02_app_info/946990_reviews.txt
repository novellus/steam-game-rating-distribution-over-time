We've been releasing regular updates and fixing issues as quickly as possible, but of course there's always more to discover.\n\nIt would really help if you could try to replicate the issue and send us an in-game bug report by pressing CTRL + F11. This will make it easier to identify what's going wrong so we can implement a fix.\n\nAlternatively, you can send us your game logs directly. Here's where you can find them:\n\nWindows:\n%userprofile%\\AppData\\LocalLow\\GameTrek\\Secret Government\\\nWindows crash logs:\n%userprofile%/AppData/Local/Temp/GameTrek/Secret Government/Crashes\nLinux:\n~/.config/unity3d/Gametrek/Secret\\ Government/\n\nSimply put the logs in a zip file and e-mail them to info@secretgovernment.world\n\nThank you for your patience and understanding.\n\nCedric\nCommunity Manager"}],"cursor":"AoJ466Wu3fYCcu2bvwI="}
