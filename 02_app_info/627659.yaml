    review: 'This course is really(!) good for beginners and the formular based concept
      is just working so great because it''s based realistic proportions and muscle
      structures. So you can''t go wrong with this as a basic male model for whatever
      you like to do. However for obviously reasons the biggest pro of this course
      also is it''s biggest con. Like if you want to create a child, a woman, an older
      person or even a bit more average and less muscled model you have to be more
      advanced as a beginner may be just because you have to tweak A LOT. On the other
      hand once you''ve understood the technics and the concept it''s not that hard
      and the results are even better. But remember all you get is a naked male basic
      model! No hair, no clothes, no animations. Don''t complain after!


      But anyway it''s absolutly worth it''s price even with the little disadvantage
      of only getting a stream version. I know you can download it at Udemy but considering
      atm it''s 3 bucks less on steam and the artist may get less from steam sales
      I can deal with that. Happy the artist even sales it for an acceptable price.'
