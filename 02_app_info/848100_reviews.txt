At times, i was able to follow a \"bad guy\" shoot him in the head, and he never turned around to see why he keeps getting shot in the head with arrows.\nTo end this review, ill say this. Although there are some quirks, i think the quirks made the game more fun. and a goofy, laugh at the games faults while you play it kind of way.\n\nHeres my gameplay, see if you like it and want to purchase it for yourself.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TMHCXmuhVro\n","timestamp_created":1525913825,"timestamp_updated":1525913825,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566569149494171143","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47qXjo+MCeOCFoAE="}
