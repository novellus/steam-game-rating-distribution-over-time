    review: 'Short visual novel which asks the player for choices about half a dozen
      times. Based on the choices you get different endings.

      One loop takes about 10-15 minutes. The game has complete voiceover dialogue.


      There''s no saving feature, so you have to take it in one go.


      One novel feature is that before starting a new game the program asks if you
      want "auto play" or "click play" experience. The difference is that click play
      requires you to press a key or mouse button to move forward the dialogue, while
      auto play makes no pauses during the dialogues. The developer argues that "auto
      play" is more immersive. I myself disagree, but it depends on the individual
      I guess.


      All in all, cool little branching story, although I think the character art
      and animations is quite horrible.'
