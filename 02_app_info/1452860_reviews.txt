Is it supposed to be a parody? The game is almost identical to super mario bros. All u are doing is going up and saving people with the occasional person with water sometime being available. The main screen is only a play button. There is no tutorial or explanation for the game. There is no \"Esc\" button. There is no place where I can find about scores? How well did I do; can I beat my personnel score??? This game should not have been released for even these simple options.\n\nReview at:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwZ5PtrjkQg","timestamp_created":1604667990,"timestamp_updated":1604667990,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1604849367,"developer_response":"I am sorry to hear that!
