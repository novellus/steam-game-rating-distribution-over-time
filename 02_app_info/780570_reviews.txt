The levels are incredibly well designed and increase in difficulty as you progress through the game. You need the reflexes of a cat, perfect judgement and nerves of steel to avoid the hazards and get through.\n\nThe levels are varied and colourful. The game mechanics work beautifully too. I am something of a platform game enthusiast and I can say with some authority this is a real little gem.\n\nGod bless the brave little robot. Please help him to save humanity!","timestamp_created":1598476804,"timestamp_updated":1598476804,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+ouplvQCf7P6nQI="}
