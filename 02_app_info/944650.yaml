    review: 'It was... okay.


      It''s the best story I have read of its kind in this format, but sadly that
      is not much to boast about. The one thing I have to praise it for is the rather
      masterful world-building of the author. For such a short story - because it
      isn''t overly long - the world-building was phenomenal. The options are there
      and they change surprisingly plenty depending on which path one decides to take,
      which is a fresh of breath air when paired together with the permission to be
      rather amoral if you had your mind to be.


      There are some points where what the MC was thinking didn''t quite align with
      the choices I had made, but nothing major. All in all, I liked the story for
      what it was, and what became a rather obvious rip-off of Frankenstein''s monster''s
      story quickly took a life of its own and had a much bigger story to tell.'
