I'm a huge lucas arts fan, but if I can't even see the video because it's turning to gray screen because of some bug  they leave me no choice to give a bad review.\n\nDon't buy this if you are on a 144hz monitor from Asus, if you want to see this, there might be other ways to see it, but it's not clear what the cause is.
