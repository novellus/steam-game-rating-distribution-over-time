    short_description: Bursting with equipment, Gwenaelle is set to deliver a holy
      relic to Fort Trista. With each swing of her blade and snap of her bow, they
      dull and break. Mind each item well to survive this turn-based combat game with
      a tactical inventory management twist!

    review: The unique resource conservation twist really makes this game stand out.
      The artwork is pretty good, but I'm not a fan of Lareissa Everbright's character
      design. It's definitely worth 7 dollars, and overall I would say it's a 9/10,
