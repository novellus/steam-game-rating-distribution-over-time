    review: 'It''s get''s repetitive very quickly, the game is very rough around the
      edges and the last level is just stupid:

      You are in a huge level and have to find one item. Problem: you are in space,
      everything looks the same and the level is full of asteroids and small red space
      ships. Unfortunately the item you have to find is also red and very small. Good
      luck finding that.
