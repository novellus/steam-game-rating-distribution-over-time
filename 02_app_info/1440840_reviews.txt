In this story, you're some poor soul who happens upon a haunted house and you need to explore every nook and cranny to discover all the secrets. \n\nMy first run-through was about 30 minutes before I got myself killed haha. But for the time that I played it, I was completely sucked in. Plus, there are achievements so there is a bit of replay value. This little title is easily worth the asking price. Thumbs up. :)","timestamp_created":1609036052,"timestamp_updated":1609036052,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.590831220149993896","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4raB0fYCds7MvQI="}
