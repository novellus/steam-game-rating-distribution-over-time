    short_description: While taking a walk through the Leaf Village, Sai comes across
      some kids who remind him of Sakura and Naruto. As he talks with one of the kids,
      Sai is amused when he is asked what the difference between a comrade and a friend
      is an answer he himself is not sure of.
