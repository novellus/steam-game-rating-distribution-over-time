    review: 'This is a great sound collection, and comes with a choice of formats
      including FLAC - which sound amazing.  These will download very easily onto
      PC. I sent the music to my Winamp folder, but it can also play within steam,
      too.


      Well worth it and hopefully this is a sign that CAPCOM has an eye on doing more
      with their classic JRPG series.'
