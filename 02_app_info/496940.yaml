    review: I feel like it's getting more difficult to find turn-based RPGs with an
      engaging story.  That said, Second Death was the best $3 I ever spent.  The
      tutorial was a breeze, and the story mode is so well-envisioned, I didn't mind
      dying over and over to get more pieces of it.  If you like turn-based RPGs,
      this game is a great investment!
