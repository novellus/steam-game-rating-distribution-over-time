With extremely simple gameplay they manage to create an immersive, highly challenging and entertaining experience with a story dealing with an incredibly profound issue.  I highly recommend it.\n\nEdit:  I very very strongly recommend reading all the journal entries as soon as they're available.  The context it provides and the backstory are amazing and very engaging, taking the experience to a whole other level.  It is not a short read, but it is well worth it.","timestamp_created":1598895013,"timestamp_updated":1599450048,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4Nyps/QCeJn+ngI="}
