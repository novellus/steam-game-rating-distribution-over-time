      /><br>So ... you're a brand new pilot with dreams to take on the world? How
      about building one of your own? You've always thought that things would be much
      better if you were in charge - now here's your chance! <i><strong>Icity</strong>
      is a flight sim ... and a city builder!</i> And like nuts and gum, they're together
      at last. <br><br>Your new job as the chief-pilot with the <i>Icity Development
      Company</i> means that you're now in charge of a bold project to build a new
      city on the Alta Ice Cap. An exploration crew has just discovered a reservoir
      of <i>Di-Hydro-Oxygen</i> crystals that could be very profitable if an efficient
      mining operation can be established. The company is willing to set up a base
      camp to try out a test mine, and if everything looks good ... well, the sky's
      the limit. <br><br>Why do you get to be the chief pilot? Because Alta is located
      high on a frozen ice sheet, thousands of miles from the nearest outpost, and
      no one else wanted the job. In fact, you're the only pilot, and until you help
      build something there, the company won't be sending any help. <br><br>Fly specially-designed
      aircraft to explore and build your own ice city of the future. Transport workers,
      deliver supplies, and collect the spoils of the crystal mines to help your city
      grow ... or just fly around and explore your new world. <strong>Icity</strong>
      puts the pilot in charge of everything. <br><br>This is your time to shine and
      show the world! Can you found a profitable mining camp and grow it into a city?
      Perhaps you might build an empire of your very own!<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Innovative aircraft with interactive controls, displays, and
      switches. <br></li><li>HUD and Autopilot-enabled for easy cruising and precision
      construction work. <br></li><li>Unique Payload and Cargo Modules for special
      missions. <br></li><li>Multiple cameras providing real-time views and map systems.
      <br></li><li>Complete control of city construction (direct or automated). <br></li><li>City
      economic system linked to growth. <br></li><li>Logistics controls for building
      supplies and product shipments.</li></ul>

      \ /><br>Thank you Everyone for making our 1st week on the Steam Store a Worldwide\
      \ success!</p><br><h1>December Update Now Available</h1><p><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/534740/extras/December_Update_2.png?t=1483579685\"\
      \ /><br><br><i><strong>Icity</strong> is a flight sim \u2026 and a city builder</i>,\
      \ and we have good news!  Our first game update is now available, and is based\
      \ on the great feedback that we\u2019re receiving via our website, social media,\
      \ and the <strong>Icity</strong> Community Hub on Steam. There are many improvements\
      \ and new features for flying and city building, including:<br><br> <ul class=\"\
      bb_ul\"><li>A key-mapping system with new keyboard layouts. <br></li><li>A \u201C\
      hot-key\u201D for attaching and releasing Cargo Modules. <br></li><li>A \u201C\
      hot-key\u201D to centre aircraft flight controls and hold position. <br></li><li>A\
      \ major overhaul of the Fine-Adjustment system for thrusters. <br></li><li>Data-overlays\
      \ on the Satellite Map view. <br></li><li>New velocity indicator on the HUD.\
      \ <br></li><li>A \u201Cbuddy drone\u201D camera view.</li></ul><br>And perhaps\
      \ most important of all \u2026 the pilot seats now have adjustable armrests\
      \ and cup-holders!  Building a city can be hard work, even while sitting in\
      \ the BA3\u2019s comfortable pilot seats (and the cupholders were a popular\
      \ request).<br>  <br>We\u2019re also getting ready to introduce multiple building\
      \ styles, and have included an early look at the upgraded Building Printer controls\
      \ to try out ahead of time, along with a new House style. <br><br>A nice slideshow\
      \ on the Main Menu presents more updates. Thank you everyone for your feedback\
      \ and suggestions!</p><br><h1>January Update Now Available</h1><p><img src=\"\

      \ /><br><br>Happy New Year from everyone at <i><strong>Icity</strong> -  a flight\
      \ sim \u2026 and a city builder</i>.  The January 2017 update is now available\
      \ with some big changes ... new aircraft and new buildings!!!  Pilots can now\
      \ try out the zippy little Firefly Mark.I and the larger Dirigible Mark.I, two\
      \ new aircraft which can be accessed via the Game Options menu (while in-game,\
      \ type 'G' with the default keyboard layout).  They share the BA3's control\
      \ layouts and startup procedures which means the Ice-City pilots are now cross-certified.\
      \  Awesome.  <br><br>The Building Printer module can now make 2 new houses,\
      \ 2 new offices, and 2 new factories, which will help Ice City develop with\
      \ new style!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/534740/extras/Description_Logo.jpg?t=1483579685\"\

    review: 'Unfortunately I can''t recommend this game at this price. If it was 5
      euros it would be somewhat acceptable. The flight controls are simple and the
      movement feels natural for the airship you are flying. Getting it off the ground
      is pretty easy as long as you follow the checklist but once in the air you don''t
      ever have to worry about anything again so it''s not really a "flight simulator"
      but it is still interesting.


      The game however sorely lacks in information on how to do certain things. In
      two hours all I managed to do was fly around land take off again attach modules
      and put cargo back and forth. The game offers no real instruction in what goes
      where specifically or how to do certain things. There is also an astonishingly
      lack of information to get online considering the game is about a year old by
      now. I refunded the game and will keep an eye on it and see if it turns into
      a better game in the future but for now all I can say is wait patiently. If
      you are desperate for city builder games there are numerous great ones already
      on the market "like cities skylines" as well as the free open transport tycoon
      deluxe.'
