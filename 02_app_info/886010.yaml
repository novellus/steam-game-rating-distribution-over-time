    review: 'This really isn''t a very good game. Each level (except for a couple
      of boss levels) is just killing a certain number of pumkins (which keep spawning
      until you reach your quota) and then rushing to the exit. There story is barely
      there. There are a few different types of pumpkin footsoldiers and only two
      weapons. The engine isn''t great and can be a bit buggy, and every time a punpkin
      touches, you, it''s an insta-kill.


      This is like an early-2000s freeware game. If you were on the Clickteam/Gamemaker
      scene at the ime, you''ve seen many games like this, and better than this, for
      free. Not super bad or unplayable, just amateur and too generic. The sort of
      game programmers make to get experience and hone their skills'
