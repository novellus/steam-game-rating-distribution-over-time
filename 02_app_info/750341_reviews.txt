What truly makes these DLC’s so amazing is the Reinforced Legendary Chest that comes packed full of legendary crafting materials allowing us to craft some mighty find equipment right off the bat, and that is not all, there are some permanent passive bonuses as well such as a +1 to your Healing surges or a percentage increase in gold and xp.\n\nThese DLC’s offers this and more, making them must buys, even if its just to support the Developers.","timestamp_created":1569434208,"timestamp_updated":1569434302,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563758373260498047","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw497ktO0CcZHv0gE="}
