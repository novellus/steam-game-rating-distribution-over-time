It was good jumping back into OG Ghost Recon again, and I enjoyed these new missions. The atmosphere is great, they're still tense as hell, felt compelled to play through them all which gets rarer for me with games these days.\n\nEncountered two bugs with objectives but didn't break the game or really have any lasting consequence. AI is still a bit aim bot like in some situations. But overall, net positive time.","timestamp_created":1605408775,"timestamp_updated":1605408775,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tbv05PUCeaO5rgI="}
