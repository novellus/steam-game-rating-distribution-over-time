In this game, you're punished for not having used an item before, and for simply not having enough MP to survive fights.  I took all the fights I could on my way to the boss in an effort to stay leveled properly, but around the last few levels leading up to it, there were more and more enemies together that just got tougher to beat without kiting them out 1 by 1 despite my effort to keep up in levels.  \n\nAdd to this what is possibly translation issues, or simply lack of any meaningful dialogue, that makes any advice a bit confusing.  At the start of the game, I used some items to find out what they do, ate some Onion chips or whatever and got \"Stinky\" ailment.  The game told me that I can check my status/afflictions by going to the menu. ... So I checked the menu, and my status just said \"Stinky.\" Nothing else.  Very helpful.\nRunning into the boss, my first spell was Mist Potion, which blinded the boss, but the witch came back in to tell me that I should use Blind to blind the boss because spells can't hit it when it sees, or something like that.  Used Blind, still was getting hit by its spells, and still was better off using Mist Potion to damage it than wasting turns on Blind.\n\nIt was during this fight that I used the Godly and Hot potatoes I mentioned at the start, which highlights another issue: the lack of item description before use, and the wanton item names.  You would think that a Godly Potato would do something... Godly.  But no, instead Tasty Crisps were the item I should have used, and had much, much more of than what I thought to be a rare Godly Potato.  Totally understandable to leave descriptions in the dark for items such as the colored Magicite, but for literally [i]every[/i] item?  The fact that crosses (that I've found) have no downside to equipping just to find out their description [i]have[/i] their descriptions hidden is the worst.  In a game that relies on resource management, forcing you to use your resources to know what they are is puzzlingly counter intuitive.  (The worst example of this is a Perfume I used to find out what it does, and I only got text on the screen that said something like \"the air is thick.\" Guess I won't find out until I get the item again and check its description.)\n\nAnother gripe I have is controller support.  Used a controller because there's no key rebind option (and I'm not a fan of the arrow key for movement with ZXC for actions Japanese default), but despite setting up my controller at the start, I'm only able to move diagonally.  (Using a brand new 1st party Xbox Series X controller that I've never changed the configs for on Steam.)  Buttons do work properly though.  Just strange that there would be any issues using a controller considering this has a Switch release.\n\nOverall, I don't have a strong disapproval for this game, but I simply don't have the patience to grind out the game.  If the game were a bit more compelling with a stronger story or more interesting levels and fights, I could give it another shot.  Instead, you're lazily dropped into the world and expected to make the most out of the bare minimum.","timestamp_created":1609415318,"timestamp_updated":1609415684,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543883919715881348","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+s2p3PYCfY2KvwI="}
