Eagle Dynamics seems to have left it to flounder.  Completely gimped compared to its somewhat agile real world counter part, the engine will fail if you get grazed by a stray bullet or just crap out and die if you run the throttle at anything above 70% for more than a minute or two.  Trying to turn at anything except 1/3 the rate of a german plane will result in a violent stall, with the latest patch this is now true regardless of altitude, so you can forget trying to climb into your historical \"sweetpot\" altitude.  So your 3 choices in a dogfight are 1) run 2) stall 3) lose the rate fight and get shot in the butt.  Good luck trying to fly these heaps of garbage against the german spaceships which can take 300 rounds without losing any performance at all.\n\nUPDATE: Since they introduced the new damage model, the P-51D has somehow gotten even worse.  The engine is more fragile than ever and will seize up after less a minute at full throttle and the wings can now snap off while doing a basic roll like they were made of paper and clothes hanger wire.   The flight model is also more unstable than ever, and you can violently roll right while banking left.  I don't know if the dev bias against american aircraft is coming into play or if they just enjoy making a mockery of the P51 in particular, but this plane is a joke.  If it flew like this in real life, then it would have killed more american pilots than the Germans.","timestamp_created":1602449706,"timestamp_updated":1607190049,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503348886966705322","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jr7/mfYCf5appwI="}
