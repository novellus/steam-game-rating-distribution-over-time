      \ no monsters to fight against, no weapons to equip yourself with, but you can\
      \ use various tools actually used for the art of pottery for a realistic indirect\
      \ experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Use your imagination!</h2><br><br><img src=\"\

      \ /><br><br>You can create pottery with both your hands just like in real life.\
      \ Turn on the actual-sized electric pottery wheel, place the clay on the wheel,\
      \ and make a pottery. Don\u2019t forget to apply water as you work. Use the\
      \ Trimming Tool to trim the surface of your pottery, or you can also measure\
      \ the size of it with a vernier caliper. You can paint pictures on the pottery\
      \ with a brush, or make wonderful patterns on the surface of it using a graver.<br><br>Not\
      \ terribly talented in drawing?<br><br>Then, there are more than 50 stamps in\
      \ the game prepared for you to engrave the patterns of your liking. Or do you\
      \ wish to do something which is more in your own style? You can also use a stamp\
