    review: "This is another failed game by JoyImpact (Korean Developer) and GamesinFlames.\
      \ The concept of Crush Online is to try to combine MMOs, MOBAs, isometic RPGs\
      \ and Pay To Win games into an ugly monster. The objective of the developer\
      \ is to make you sign up for a VIP level 4 package so that they can milk you\
      \ for all the money you have. With the VIP Level 4 package, you will gain loads\
      \ of crystals that you can use to buff your character, unlock inventory slots\
      \ and upgrade your weapons. There are a whole list of limitations that hide\
      \ behind a paywall in this game.\n\nYou start off by creating 1 of 3 different\
      \ classes, Saint, Punisher or Guardian. Each of them has a primary and secondary\
      \ weapon that can be switched by pressing Spacebar. Each weapon gives them 4\
      \ different abilities that can be activated by pressing QWER, similar to MOBAs.\
      \ As you level up, you can unlock a Main and Sub talent tree for your class.\
      \ Moving around the map is simple, it is exactly like any other isometric RPG.\
      \ Click and move. Along the way, you can even play a MOBA match for PvP, where\
      \ you rush to down the enemy's tower in a single lane battle.\n\nConclusion,\
      \ don't play this Pay To Win game. Hendrik Lesser, Achim Kaspers and Markus\
      \ Wilding are the ones who helped publish this game. GamesinFlames is a very\
      \ apt description of the games that make, they crash and burn to make short\
      \ term money.\n\n[h1][b]PROS[/b][/h1]\n1. They Made Something\nYou can run it.\
      \ Doesn't crash.\n\n[h1][b]CONS[/b][/h1]\n1. Pay To Win\nLet me list the ways\
      \ that the in-game currency, Jewels, help you Pay To Win. 100 USD for 95 Jewels.\n\
      a. Inventory Slots\nb. Weapons\nc. EP \nd. SP\n\n2. Copied PvP Directly from\
      \ League of Legends 1v1\nSeriously, it's the MOBA genre. It's trash.\n\n3. VIP\
      \ 1 to 4\nYou have to pay money to get Jewels to become a VIP to get special\
      \ privileges and unlock more Jewels. It's a neverending cycle of leeching.\n\
      \n4. No Character Design\nThe classes are the 3 basic pillars, Attack, Support\
      \ and Tank. Junk design.\n\n5. Red, Green and Blue Country\nSeriously? That's\
      \ the best you could come up with?"
