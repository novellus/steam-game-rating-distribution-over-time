    review: "Personalmente me gust\xF3 mucho m\xE1s la banda sonora y los gr\xE1ficos\
      \ que la novela, pues como historia dejaba mucho que desear; era bastante larga\
      \ y aburrida. Yo no la recomendar\xEDa, pero ya que estaba gratis pues tampoco\
      \ se puede reclamar mucho.\nMi consejo: Si busc\xE1is matar el aburrimiento\
      \ de una tarde cualquiera con esta novela visual... \xA1No lo hag\xE1is! Hay\
      \ mucha m\xE1s variedad con mejores historias que Cupid.  \n\nUn saludo ;)"
