In my opinion this mod is great just like the real-life boardgame. \n\nI don't find re-rolling the food in the birdfeeder or tucking cards to be an issue. \nOnce you understand where you have to put the dices for re-rolling the birdfeeder it's very simple. Tucking cards I find pretty quick and easy when one player just lifts up the card (or the pile of cards) from the board and another player puts the card that is supposed to be tucked on the board.","timestamp_created":1609893023,"timestamp_updated":1609893023,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40cHG6vYCfMHuwAI="}
