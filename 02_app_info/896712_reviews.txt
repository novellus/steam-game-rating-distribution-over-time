Another must-have.\n\nNote: In the descriptions for the scenario \"Roseville Hammerhead\" (in-scenario and in the scenario list), both say \"It is the year 1987, and a year after the Southern Pacific merger...\" For anyone that doesn't remember railroading history, the SP/UP Merger happened in NINETY-SIX, not 86. I know it's probably a typo, but for continuity's sake, High Iron, if you read this, can you please fix that? I am unable to do this myself as there's something that forbids me from editing the description.","timestamp_created":1578248081,"timestamp_updated":1578248081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45tG6u+8Ccr6O6gE="}
