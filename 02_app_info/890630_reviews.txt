Thaw a lake and dive beneath its surface or freeze a waterfall and scale it. This requires you, as the player, to reason about the same levels in interesting different ways depending on what elements you have at your disposal.\n\nAll in all, I recommend you give it a chance and discover some interesting elemental interactions!","timestamp_created":1561693633,"timestamp_updated":1561693633,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.600453019142150879","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nreMzusCc+vBxAE="}
