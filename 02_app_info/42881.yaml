    review: game is broke when it comes to level balance. its common to have enemy
      units flood your base far to early (half of the campaign levels you will get
      flooded by day 15). game is fun when the game isn't cheating and i know its
      cheating because i have to cheat to get as far as i am.  game needs to be balance.
      don't waste your money go play majesty 1. its far better then this game. want
      to love it but can't.
