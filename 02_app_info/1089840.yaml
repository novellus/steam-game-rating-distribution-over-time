    review: "Great game, though I only have 2 problems with it: \n1) I wish I was\
      \ able to split formations, for example, company to Platoons and Platoons to\
      \ Sections.\n2)This game gets a little bored without multiplayer, its basically\
      \ the AI spams artillery and then charges to my guns, if you are the attacker\
      \ it will be much better with the AI but this game needs multiplayer for replay\
      \ ability. And I think if it will have multiplayer it will be the ultimate Mid\
      \ to Late Cold War Wargame experience.\n\n"
