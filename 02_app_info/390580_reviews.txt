I'd go as far as to say, even more movies, like \"It Follows,\" is a good mix to get you in a spooky or pumped up mood, and I like this. Highly Reccomended.\n\n[h1] The songs [/h1]\n1.) A Smile Beneath Your Skin: A great start to the soundtrack, cute at first, industrial at the halfway mark\n2.) Amputated_Marshmallow: Again tones that sound like they should be in a SNES game, with a throbbing heartbeat in it.\n3.) Barophobia (demo): A slow intro to one of our first monsters, it's a mysterious sound track which leads into the next song.\n4.) Barophobia (Float Away): Long string instrument and wind instrument pulls, with a piano attempting to represent the sound of water dropping from the ceiling, or stars twinkling in the sky\n5.) Blood_stained_giggle: Not so much a song, more like the game over sound.\n6.) Breakfast Was Too Early: A prominent piano plays a somewhat lullaby song in the first of 3 songs that are titled like they should be in a goldilocks childrens song.\n7.) Breakfast Was Too Late: The song previously becomes distorted in this remake, with more computer effects, some higher highs, lower lows, and a bit more chiptune than actual piano.\n8.) Breakfast Was Too Water Damaged: The previous song becomes a distorted mess, of songs played so they sound like they are in reverse, and breathing deeply through a filter on top.\n9.)Down the Habbit Role: Tones fall in and out, light breathign can be heard, and a Kalediscope of sounds, feels like you're on a boat with Willie Wonka.\n10.) Dum Loopy Thing: Although it comes off like a nice market song for a video game, there is a low almost tibetan sounding tone that follows the entire song.\n11.)","timestamp_created":1593483765,"timestamp_updated":1608734857,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514925360679626465","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48rqEyPYCcPzAkQI="}
