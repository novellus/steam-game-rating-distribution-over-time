      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Strategise</h2>Build your own squads from a variety of
      units, including Grabbers, Flippers, Mortars and more. Each one has its own
      strengths, weaknesses and synergies with other units.<h2 class="bb_tag">Take
      on Everyone</h2>Built for multiplayer, there''s an ever-changing roster of maps
      available across both deathmatch and control game modes. Take your squads and

      role of player-manager, building and battling with your team across season-long
      leagues. Build your team from the ground up: buy and sell units, mod their stats,
      and grab sponsorships as you strive to take your team from chumps to champs.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Daily Challenges</h2>A new challenge awaits you every day! Battle
      against the AI on random maps with pre-made squads, competing for the top score
      on the daily leaderboards.<h2 class="bb_tag">Customise</h2>Change your appearance
      as often as you change your tactics: make your commander and arena your own
      and pick from an ever-expanding collection of interactive items. With hundreds
      of possible combinations, you can be sure you''ll stand out from the crowd.'

    review: What a wonderful little board game! From the first match, I'm in love.
      It's simple enough to understand, but like any board game, the depth is in the
      strategy you employ. Highly recommended.
