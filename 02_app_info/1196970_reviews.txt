The graphics and sound are good.  The story is minimal as you'll find a few pages to tell you what is going on and you're probably going to finish the game in around 35 minutes.  I paid 2.49 for it.  For 4.99?  I couldn't recommend it at that price but do with the info what you will folks!","timestamp_created":1584583732,"timestamp_updated":1584583732,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsp2j+PACevSN+QE="}
