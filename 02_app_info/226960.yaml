    review: "Ironclad tactics is a fast paced turn-based tactics game based on card\
      \ deck building. Since this description doesn't help, here is a slightly better\
      \ one: the player chooses various soldiers and weapons from a high number of\
      \ available ones. A card deck comprises 20 of these picks. Each deck has to\
      \ be chosen carefully according to the needs of each mission. The battles consist\
      \ of playing the cards (appearing in a random order) to send troops and give\
      \ them equipment. They move automatically forward on the lanes they are deployed\
      \ on, but the tactical possibilities are numerous with the ability to stop a\
      \ unit, sometimes switch lanes, use weapons that target specific lanes, add\
      \ a specific customization to a mecha and so on. The game seems like real time\
      \ to the player, but the actions are conducted by the computer in quick, seamless\
      \ turns.\n\nThis might seem complicated on paper, but in-game it works very\
      \ intuitively so that the player can fully focus on choices and tactical decisions.\
      \ And the fast speed allows for the battles not to drag on, they even trigger\
      \ a lot of adrenaline as the player has to think fast and is always kept on\
      \ the edge. The gameplay is really good and works well in these half fast-paced\
      \ half-slowed down conditions.\n\nHowever, where this game also really shines\
      \ is in the level design. Usually strategy games can be repetitive as the players\
      \ figure out their favorite strategy and repeat it to go through every mission.\
      \ In Ironcland Tactics, each mission is different with the levels having a specific\
      \ gimmick and the enemy deploying specific troops. While at first it can seem\
      \ overwhelming if using the deck that was tailored for the previous level, this\
      \ actually relates more to a puzzle game where the player has to figure out\
      \ a well suited tactic to win. Card decks thus have to be customized specifically\
      \ for every mission. So even if some might consider this very challenging when\
      \ they don't know yet which strategy to use, I find it brilliant. It completely\
      \ prevents the game from feeling repetitive with a single formula repeated ad\
      \ nauseam, and keeps me thinking on how to tackle each new battle and makes\
      \ me feel great for figuring out new strategies. Although, even if I mentioned\
      \ a puzzle game inspiration, this game is not as static and mind taxing as a\
      \ puzzle game, it remains very dynamic. \n\nThe story missions are linked through\
      \ nicely made comics, reinforcing the feeling that overall this game has been\
      \ carefully crafted. Additionally, the story can be played in online Coop as\
      \ the players fight together and have to coordinate their strategy (forget it\
      \ if you are not on voice communication, good communication seems pretty much\
      \ required to succeed without making stupid mistakes - well these mistakes still\
      \ happen on voice communication and can be hilarious, such as when one player\
      \ decides to give a speed boost to a unit from the second player who decided\
      \ that it should strategically hold position). And if you want to get revenge\
      \ on your teammate for a mistake, there is always the possibility for 1 vs 1\
      \ to settle things non peacefully. Also of note, some missions can add a nice\
      \ twist to the 1 vs 1 multiplayer such as the possibility for one of the two\
      \ players to use a boss deck.\n\nThis game bears the \"Tactics\" subtitle perfectly\
      \ well. I am very glad I discovered it in my Steam Library during its free week-end\
      \ and gave it a curious try, otherwise I would never have known that this game\
      \ is so good and keeps me so entertained while keeping my brain active."
