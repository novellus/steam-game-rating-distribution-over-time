      notes: Fighting is one of the major elements of the game therefore violence
        against (most of the time) fantasy creatures is occuring all the time during
        gameplay.

    review: "What did we want from [b]Titan Quest: Anniversary Edition[/b]? We wanted\
      \ fixed balance. Especially the part of it that was about loot. In case if you're\
      \ late to the party, the game that was was originally pretty fun to play was\
      \ seriously broken in its enhanced form. Nice example of how broken balance\
      \ can ruin all the excitement from playing an [b]ARPG[/b] title. What did we\
      \ get instead? We've got ourselves a second [b]DLC[/b]. Which... is even worse\
      \ than the first one. I mean, when [b]Titan Quest: Ragnar\xF6k[/b] appeared,\
      \ I was pretty excited. Even though I've already suffered quite a lot from terrible\
      \ changes in [b]Anniversary Edition[/b], the idea of getting more content for\
      \ the game I used to like back in the days? It felt great. But after finishing\
      \ it... let's just say I was less than excited.\n\nNow, let's look at [b]Atlantis[/b].\
      \ It's smaller (only [b]13[/b] quests that take place in only six areas), it\
      \ comes with even more confusing level design (like in [b]Ragnar\xF6k[/b], from\
      \ time to time you'll find it hard to see where you should go next), the balance\
      \ is still broken (for the entire playthrough of [b]Atlantis[/b] I didn't get\
      \ a single item that was better than my old equipment from [b]Ragnar\xF6k[/b]),\
      \ while every single story quest here just wants you to go and look for something\
      \ in the present area. Sometimes without even telling you what you're looking\
      \ for. At one point of this [b]DLC[/b] it'll be literally that. \u201CGo and\
      \ look for something unusual.\u201D What... the heck? Like... seriously, guys?\
      \ [i]Seriously?[/i] You took an ages old game and the best you can do is asking\
      \ us to \u201Clook for something unusual\u201D? Get the heck outta here.\n\n\
      So... yeah. You already decided that you want to give [b]Anniversary Edition[/b]\
      \ a chance, you may as well get this [b]DLC[/b] as a part of the bundle. Especially\
      \ when it's on sale. Just because [b]13[/b] new quests are [b]13[/b] new quests.\
      \ Even though all of them are pretty bad and [i]man[/i], I hate level design\
      \ here, the new areas looks beautiful, so... yeah. Why not prolong your experience\
      \ for a bit longer for a couple of extra bucks? I mean, you already in, why\
      \ leaving with some stuff unfinished? Right? [i]But[/i] if you're thinking about\
      \ this [b]DLC[/b] as a reason to return to the world of [b]Titan Quest[/b],\
      \ then you should start forgetting about it. Like... now. Not only this [b]DLC[/b]\
      \ is way too short and way too uninspired, it looks like [b]Anniversary Edition[/b]\
      \ ended up having the broken balance forever. And you just don't need it in\
      \ your life. Not in its current form. In other words, either stick with the\
      \ original, or go play something else. [b]Steam[/b] offers enough alternatives.\
      \ Dixi."
