    detailed_description: "<h1>About the release time and subsequent updates of the\
      \ first chapter</h1><p>We are sorry to have made such a decision. due to the\
      \ wrong estimate of the amount of text in the first chapter, the content of\
      \ the first chapter is now expected to be 500000 words, which will be five times\
      \ that of the preface. Therefore, we will not be able to launch at the original\
      \ time, but will go online before the Spring Festival. <br>In order to make\
      \ up for our mistakes, but also for the expectations of the majority of players,\

      innermost and darkest secret. What choice should you make then?
