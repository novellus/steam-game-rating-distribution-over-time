    review: "\"Halo 2: Anniversary\" is a step up in every single way from the original\
      \ \"Halo: Combat Evolved\", whether it be the more complex story, cleaned up\
      \ and innovated gameplay, or the stellar remastered graphics present in the\
      \ many set pieces and cutscenes that bring these moments to life in such a compelling\
      \ way.\n\nThis series, as one would be lead to believe due to its major success,\
      \ already started on a high note: many groundbreaking elements went into the\
      \ creation of the world the \"Halo\" saga takes place in. When playing through\
      \ \"Halo: Combat Evolved\", it feels like a game that, while a bit messy and\
      \ dated, held its own after twenty years past the initial release. The remastered\
      \ elements of the game, mainly graphical, opened it up to being more accessible\
      \ to wider audiences because, even if the visuals can be nostalgic, the title\
      \ isn't very pretty in its vanilla form. I feel as though the remaster worked\
      \ the best it could with a lot of the drab environments of the original \"Halo:\
      \ Combat Evolved\" and made each crevice of the map at least pleasing to look\
      \ at instead of like a grey blemish in one's eyes. This is not to say the world\
      \ envisioned did not translate well enough with such dated graphics, some places\
      \ still retained that beauty nonetheless, it's just that the remaster pushed\
      \ them to their maximum potential, leaving one stunned by the revamped visual\
      \ and audio enhancements implemented within.\n\n\"Halo 2: Anniversary\" takes\
      \ the initial formula of its predecessor and tightens every single aspect. The\
      \ environments are much more diverse and enthralling to traverse, the set pieces\
      \ and theatrical moments are more compelling and well planned, and the difficulty\
      \ feels more balanced than before. Once again, I played through this game on\
      \ Heroic and, even if there were some moments of tedium, I never felt as though\
      \ there was an excessive amount of dated barriers that frustrated me as much\
      \ as in \"Halo: Combat Evolved\". Even though this game has more levels than\
      \ the original, it has an overall more staggering amount creativity, leading\
      \ to more interesting objectives, demanding situations, and memorable moments.\
      \ Sure, \"Halo: Combat Evolved\" should be remembered for the standard it set,\
      \ but \"Halo 2: Anniversary\" should be remembered for how it improved it to\
      \ a nearly perfect model of what this series was and could be. \n\nOne of the\
      \ most shocking aspects of this game was when I got past the first few levels\
      \ and switched from the stalwart knight of humanity, Master Chief, to the imprisoned\
      \ and \"disgraceful\" elite commander, The Arbiter. Sure, I had been taken into\
      \ his side of the story as it played out in cutscenes during the game's progression,\
      \ but when I was given the reigns of what was perceived previously as a towering\
      \ enemy force in \"Halo: Combat Evolved\", it made me think more about the politics,\
      \ humanity, and history going on within the walls of the game itself. Sure,\
      \ plenty of forms of media went through this sort of realizing that \"any enemy\
      \ could be your friend if you took the time to understand one another\" and\
      \ that \"there are greater forces of evil than those we initially perceive\"\
      \ way beforehand, yet it wasn't something I expected from a \"Halo\" game. In\
      \ the original, I just felt as though I was blasting through one alien force\
      \ to the next in order to save my people from the looming threat of annihilation,\
      \ but as you are made to see, The Arbiter is doing the same exact thing for\
      \ his own people, sharing similar principles, codes, and ethics to the opposite\
      \ protagonist, Master Chief.\n\nIt's in these moments of critical dialogue and\
      \ a lack of clear-cut black-and-white ideology that make someone think and come\
      \ to a place of better understanding of others, not just those that support\
      \ their predetermined biases. Sure, \"Halo 2: Anniversary\" is an exciting and\
      \ adrenaline-pumping treat when the time comes to mow down those in your path\
      \ in many fun and interesting ways as you fight for your beliefs, but taking\
      \ those beliefs into consideration and understanding the many sides these forces\
      \ are working on are what truly elevate this game beyond what came before. The\
      \ great thing about it is, however, is that despite any political discussion\
      \ within this game, it doesn't have to be taken into consideration at all. Its\
      \ morality isn't ham-fisted or pseudo-intellectual babble handed down by some\
      \ character through exposition, rather you get the messaging through your personal\
      \ experience with it inside of the game. These basic moral principles are smartly\
      \ worked in, leaving many walking away from a video game contemplating life\
      \ a little bit more, understanding that not everyone with a different opinion\
      \ is \"evil\", and that there is inherent goodness and well intentions in even\
      \ those one opposes the most (or at least believes they do). Therefore, whether\
      \ you are  contemplating the ideas being discussed here or just eager to fight\
      \ otherworldly creatures and have fun with friends, \"Halo 2: Anniversary\"\
      \ is where the series took a turn for the more ambitious, creative, and overall\
      \ thrilling route.\n\n[RATING: 9.2/10]"
