    review: 'I am looking forward to seeing where this game goes.

      I like the graphics, the controls are responsive (controller support out of
      the gate which is always a plus).

      I am yet to really delve into how much content there

      is in this early access version (as I have only had a quick

      muck around before bed). But I would say it''s a fun little

      time waster at present and I look forward to seeing

      what the developer does with further updates.


      Construtive Criticism - If the character or enemy goes behind a wall

      there is no ghosting or the like to keep the player visible. This can

      lead to the player getting hit by enemies they can not see.'
