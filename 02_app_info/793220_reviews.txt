A wise man I admire taught that silence is the most eloquent kind of speech. And I think only silence could do this game full justice, but I can't be properly silent in a written review. So I'll say: this game shows how death imposes itself on love, and how love desperately smashes itself against death in retaliation, and how they painfully bleed into each other becoming one.\n\nCould it be more polished? Yes.\nCould it be an open space instead of linear paths closed off by hedges? Yes.\nCould it be comprised of completely original assets? Yes.\nCould the woman's throwing animation be better? Yes. \nCould its sky-opening skull-shattering brain-scooping heart-blending effect on me be an individual and accidental thing? Yes.\nDo I give even a quarter of a f–∏ck? No.\n\n[i]A Fine Mess[/i] is the best game I've discovered in the past seven years.","timestamp_created":1599922506,"timestamp_updated":1599922506,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.603135943412780762","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkYG0wfQCd6uuoQI="}
