    review: If you are looking for a fast destroyer this is a good choice. Although
      if you are looking for something that is a bit stronger I would say that for
      survival/tank destroyer the vigilant is by far the best. Although if you are
      looking for a destroyer that is fast, and powerful this is a good starship.
