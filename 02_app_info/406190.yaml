    review: "I recently bought Face Rig Classic and all of the avatars work really\
      \ well now after you calibrate your body and mouth before you start using it.\
      \ I personally use the werewolf to stream and the majority of people that watch\
      \ think it's incredible how realistic it looks. I think this pack is a pack\
      \ that anyone with face rig should try if they really love halloween or want\
      \ to give their streams or videos a different vibe. \n\nOverall, I give the\
      \ dlc a 9/10. Go ahead and buy it,"
