    reviews: "\u201CGunship! is pretty much everything we hoped it would be. There's\
      \ enough action in this box to make it more than worth the buy for any sim enthusiast\
      \ who's been looking for the right copter to fly. Even if simulations aren't\
      \ the bread and butter of your gaming collection, you may still want to give\
      \ this one a shot. It offers up a lot of action to the arcade gamer looking\
      \ for something a little different. Chances are you may very well be playing\
      \ this thing well into World War III.\u201D<br>8/10 \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/05/02/gunship\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >IGN</a><br><br>\u201CWhile Gunship!\
      \ has serious realism problems, it has absolutely gorgeous graphics. The terrain\
      \ is particularly impressive, and it conveys a great sense of being airborne.\
      \ In fact, the major reason that Gunship! should be considered a flight action\
      \ game is that its strengths parallel those of a good first-person shooter:\
      \ It looks pretty, and it's easy to blow things up. Therein lies the game's\
      \ appeal: While hard-core pilots will groan at the oversimplified avionics,\
      \ casual sim pilots will enjoy the &quot;point-and-shoot&quot; simplicity of\
      \ the game, as well as the ability to make just about everything on the map\
      \ explode. Even trees seem to be filled with some kind of combustible material;\
      \ they vanish with an explosion when hit by cannon fire.\u201D<br>6.7/10 \u2013\

    review: "Primeiramente, preciso dizer que comprei esse jogo por ter jogado a vers\xE3\
      o de PS One do Gunship, e ter me divertido horas e horas nele.  Jamais joguei\
      \ qualquer vers\xE3o para PC.\n\xC0 primeira vista do menu, a impress\xE3o \xE9\
      \ que se trada de algo bem arcade. As telas de configura\xE7\xE3o s\xE3o bem\
      \ confusas, e parece haver menos detalhamento.. Quando se entra na miss\xE3\
      o, a impress\xE3o \xE9 inversa, parecendo ser bem feito e detalhado.\nN\xE3\
      o consegui fazer funcionar com o esquema dgVoodoo, o jogo fica travando.\nNo\
      \ modo Software parece rodar bem, mas o gr\xE1fico fica ridiculamente baixo.\n\
      Concluindo: Acho que s\xF3 vale a pena mesmo para quem j\xE1 jogou e quer jogar\
      \ de novo, mas deixo de recomendar com ressalvas: N\xE3o conhe\xE7o nada semelhante\
      \ a esse jogo, principalmente por esse pre\xE7o (Aceito sugest\xF5es, ou um\
      \ Mod de DCS de presente...)"
