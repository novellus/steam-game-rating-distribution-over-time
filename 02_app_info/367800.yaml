    about_the_game: As Barry the miner, scurry around the mines collecting diamonds
      before the ghosts can capture you.<br><br>Life is hard as a miner; you have
      to get up early every day, get down underground and harvest gems by digging
      them out of the ground.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/367800/extras/screen1.png?t=1447373736"
      /><br>It is tough, dirty work with little appreciation. It is even harder when
      the only mines you have access to are HAUNTED! And these ghosts are very persistent
      spectres.<br><br>Luckily for Barry, he is not without his own tricks. Planting
      traps behind him to freeze these incorporeal guardians of the deeps seems to
      be just as important as belting walls with his pickaxe to get the gems.<br><br>Featuring
      retro style pixel graphics Diamond Deeps harkens back to the old days of simple
      but addictive gameplay. Not only is Diamond Deeps a a single-player game in
      its own right but also the ability for gamers to make their own levels to play,
      share and challenge each other is one of the best ways to let your creative
      spirit run.<br><br>Like sitting on the lounge?  No worries Diamond Deeps supports
      controllers and can accommodate any lounge sloth playing on their Steam Machine!
