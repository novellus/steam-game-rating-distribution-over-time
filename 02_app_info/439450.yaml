    review: "(This review is mainly a criticism of the DLC game modes when compared\
      \ to the main game mode available in the base game.)\n\nThis DLC adds 4 game\
      \ modes to Party Jousting.\nBagatelle [16 players] - Players drop their animal\
      \ like a ball, where they bounce through a bunch of pins while collecting as\
      \ many coins as they can. Players can drop 5 balls, and there are 5 rounds.\n\
      Golf [16 players] - Players play as the ball, with everyone scrambling to collect\
      \ as many coins as possible in a bird's eye view mini golf area. The hole appears\
      \ wherever the last coin was, and whomever lands in it catches a coin bonus.\
      \ There are 5 different levels.\nCar-Ball [8 players] - A team-based mode where\
      \ players control a car, accelerating automatically and holding their button\
      \ to turn left or right. The car turns in the opposite direction each press,\
      \ and turning also works as the car's brakes. You can ram into the side or back\
      \ of an enemy car to temporarily knock them out. When the ball falls in a team's\
      \ goal, the other team scores a point. One player can ride into the side of\
      \ the goal to become a goalie, sliding up or down like in Blasterball to bounce\
      \ the ball away. Score 5 goals to win.\nMatch3 [8 players] - This puzzle game\
      \ works similar to Puyo Puyo, where the player is given groups of 3 blocks at\
      \ the top of their board. These blocks shift from left to right to choose where\
      \ to place them, and you can rotate them as well. Match3 with the same block\
      \ type either horizontally, vertically or diagonally to clear them from the\
      \ board. (I think you can also send grey blocks to other players, which encourages\
      \ fast play). Whomever survives the longest wins.\n\nYou may notice that all\
      \ four of these game modes are very different from the main Joust mode. The\
      \ Joust mode is quite chaotic in that players can be knocked out at any time\
      \ during a round, without warning. Arguably, the fact that the animals are so\
      \ fragile is the most fun part of the game, and once you are out, you are out\
      \ until the next round. None of the other game modes do this quite the same\
      \ way. Bagatelle more or less has you in control of how often and when you use\
      \ your balls, and each round lasts until every ball is used. While Match3 does\
      \ have a knockout system like Joust, it is much more strategic in gameplay,\
      \ and the fact that each player has their own field can cause a bit of a disconnect\
      \ between the players, removing that fragility aspect. In Car-Ball, you respawn\
      \ shortly after being knocked out, making it more of a hindrance than anything,\
      \ and in Golf your ball can be stunned, but never destroyed. \nThe reason why\
      \ I point out that Joust's quick knockout gameplay is unique to the game mode\
      \ is that the other game modes feel a little dull in comparison. Playing the\
      \ other game modes with your friends is tough to do when they are used to the\
      \ swift deaths and epic plays that happen only in Joust mode.\n\nPersonally,\
      \ I think more game modes should be added that lean into the fast knockout gameplay\
      \ seen in the Joust mode. The Car-Ball mode could be transformed into an aggressive\
      \ Demolition Derby type mode, having the same one-hit KO and driving mechanics\
      \ of Car-Ball, but in a dirty and dangerous arena. Or how about removing the\
      \ walls from Golf for a game mode where players try to knock each other off\
      \ of a swiftly shrinking platform? What I think this game needs is more modes\
      \ like Joust, where players directly attack each other in a battle for the Party\
      \ Jousting crown.\n\nCurrently, I would not recommend this DLC if you are expecting\
      \ more stuff like the main Joust mode. This DLC includes more strategic modes\
      \ that are much less deadly, but a lot fairer to less skilled players thanks\
      \ to allowing them to participate throughout the entire round. As such, if you\
      \ feel like Jousting is a bit too hardcore or unfair, I would recommend this\
      \ DLC, particularly for the Bagatelle mode, which is probably the friendliest\
      \ mode of them all.\n\nSomething to note though, one of the Beta game modes\
      \ is a Super Smash Bros. spoof, where players move left or right automatically\
      \ and can do jumps and various attacks. The current moveset is really cool to\
      \ mess around with, and it would be cool to see the game mode developed further,\
      \ and possibly become more fun than any other mode."
