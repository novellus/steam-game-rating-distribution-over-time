    review: It's basically a "Golf" solitaire game (have to find a card 1 lower or
      1 higher than the face card). I was hoping this would be similar to Gridiron
      Solitaire, where you sort of feel like you're actually affecting a football
      game.  It has a baseball theme, in that there are 9 innings, but you just never
      feel like your cards in any way relate to the 'baseball game' being played in
      the narrated story line. For example, regardless of how you win the 9th hand
      against the Nevada Aliens, the story line says that you hit a walk-off grand
      slam to send the team to the playoffs.   The cards you play have no effect on
      the outcome of the story line; it's a separate thing altogether. There are some
      cards that have to be unblocked before you can remove them, like a lock that
      you have to find the key for, and a glove that you need to find a baseball for.  But
      one of these is an umpire, and to remove that card, you need to find his...WHISTLE?  Umpires
      don't have whistles.  Coupled with the horrendous English in the recap screens,
      it's obvious the creators aren't American, and aren't that familiar with baseball.
