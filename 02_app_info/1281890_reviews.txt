It feels like the title of the game has more to do with the technically/lazily flawed design of the game, more than any kind of metaphor.  The game also has some very bizarre, unexplained, dark moments...not \"relaxing\" at all. \nIt's like they literally knew they were packaging and selling a pile of junk...and we're the fools.","timestamp_created":1595624728,"timestamp_updated":1595624728,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.438596516847610474","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3KSpwfMCe/SrlwI="}
