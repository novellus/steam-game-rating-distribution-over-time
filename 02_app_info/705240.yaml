      /><br>Boom Box Blue is a frenzied skill-based physics game.<br><br>This is what
      you get if you merge Tetris with physics and throw some bombs into the mix!<br><br>Play
      as the hero box and avoid and clear out the constant flow of mean boxes with
      your bombs, while collecting stars and powerups to level up and upgrade your
      abilities and compete on the leaderboard.<br><br>Different kinds of mean boxes
      are constantly falling from the sky and you have to constantly avoid them while
      at the same time strategically dropping bombs to best clear up the build up
      of boxes stacking up on the bottom. Between rounds you can upgrade your abilities
      to have a better chance of surviving the next round. Different level effects
      will also come into the mix with events like blowing winds that will push the
      boxes around or a blackout that will prevent your vision for a time. Collect
      powerups to do things like slowing down time or shrink your box to have a better
      chance of survival.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/705240/extras/Description5.png?t=1513015135"

    review: Nice little game, not very challenging (took me about 45min to get all
      achievements)  but still super fun and best for killing time or when you're
      just bored. Not sure if I would have bought it alone but I got it in a bundle
      and so it was completely worth it.
