I feel like it has some wasted potential. Some things have changed since i last played it, so maybe i will give another shot some day.","timestamp_created":1502659446,"timestamp_updated":1567959082,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543020844459533691","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwZzpiO0Cf7/GggE="}
