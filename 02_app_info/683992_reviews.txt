Both activate faction abilities, so you usually want to time your purchase to help trigger combos.\n\nThe tertiary abilities on some heroes are more interesting than the base heroes set, mimicking some of the less-prevalent abilities for their faction, such as blob scrapping trade row stuff, or the trade fed hero that allows you to purchase a 3-cost card for free and put it on top of your deck (think Customs Frigate), to the star empire card allowing for draw-and-discard card cycling.\n\nExcept for machine cult. Machine cult is just scrapping for days. And I'm okay with that.","timestamp_created":1533336350,"timestamp_updated":1533336350,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.651653766632080078","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0/39gOUCcJfEpwE="}
