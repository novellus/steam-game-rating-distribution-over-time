Worked well with remote play together.\n\nThere is a bugged screen where player two starts inside of a wall, locking the camera in place and forcing player one to try to progress while offscreen. Fortunately, you can use the downstab to bounce on the other player and reach higher platforms than a normal jump would let you. This allowed us to sequence break past the buggy segment and skip one of the bosses. Felt like a retro classic. I appreciate it.","timestamp_created":1593677332,"timestamp_updated":1593677332,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563492059707641602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4sekh/MCd4KRkgI="}
