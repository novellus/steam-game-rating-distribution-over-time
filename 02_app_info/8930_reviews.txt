I tried to play 6 several times but get bored; and I do not the cartoon graphics. Civ 5 is very professional in almost all aspects, with wonderful music and portraits. One can always find things that could be improved but it is too late for that! BTW I recently lost all of my Savegames and History.. very strange! No problems with my latest game but I backup the files manually. .. I do take breaks from playing now and then but I always come back.","timestamp_created":1610130233,"timestamp_updated":1610130233,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46rLP8fYCdfXMwQI="}
