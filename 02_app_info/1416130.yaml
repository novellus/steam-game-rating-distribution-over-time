    reviews: "\u201CTaking around 15 minutes to play through, Perfect Vermin\u2019\
      s office smashing antics are an absolute blast. The way the normal office furniture\
      \ shatters and the vermin splat when you hit them is very satisfying. The narrative\
      \ is also perfectly executed, with lots of little clues about what\u2019s really\
      \ going on throughout and an ending that gives much more significance to your\
      \ vermin-splatting rampage. Highly recommended.\u201D<br>Highly recommended.\

      \ either way it was interesting. It's not really like. Well its actually kind\

      \ general is pretty fun. But the actual experience itself is very unique. I\
      \ think that's the best compliment you could give. I'm not using it as a sarcastic\
