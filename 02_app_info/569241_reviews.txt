Star Trek is a great game of pinball but the image quality issues are completely unacceptable, especially at a pretty premium price point. Get your act together and fix this, FarSight. I love you guys... but encountering issues like this, especially alongside the application itself being buggy, is not cool.","timestamp_created":1499714739,"timestamp_updated":1499714739,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.621236979961395264","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s9v9lt0CfrvHfw=="}
