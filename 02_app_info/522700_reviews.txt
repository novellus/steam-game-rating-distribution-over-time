No, not the crap-arsed promo pic with the garish red writing that looks like a three-year-old just discovered their first crayon...but the twisted photographic style in the game itself (resourcefully used as an alternative to finding an actual artist, one presumes). Regrettably, this is still a text-based adventure, and while the writing's vaguely passable...the story certainly isn't.\n\n   You know you're in trouble when one of your first decisions as a player is to use the elevator or the stairs, and choosing the former just gets you insta-killed with no warning whatsoever. It would be a tad hysterical to call this game \"bad\"...but, y'know, I'm not gonna go outta my way to call it \"good\", either. And that five-dollar price tag really is rather silly...\n\n   If you're gonna bother, you REALLY should wait for a sale.\n\nVerdict: 4/10.","timestamp_created":1483669493,"timestamp_updated":1604298574,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.68542855978012085","comment_count":4,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi7Hpw/UCcszobg=="}
