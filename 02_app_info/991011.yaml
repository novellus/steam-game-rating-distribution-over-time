      - thanks the help of many generous people, we were able to breathe life into
      the world of <strong>NAIRI: Tower of Shirin</strong>. Our sincere thanks go

      This art book is an opportunity to showcase how this world exactly came to be.
      Many of the numerous art assets in the game went through multiple stages before
      they were finally finished. We saved a lot of these earlier renditions, collecting
      a little history of the games development. <br><br>From desert cat bandits to
      mysterious underground labyrinths, with this art book in hand, you are free
      to enjoy the lovingly created world of <strong>NAIRI: Tower of Shirin</strong>
      any time you see fit!'
