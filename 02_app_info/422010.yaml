      was a very hard time for me, and platitudes have never helped me. but things
      are a lot better now than they were, for which i'm grateful.

    review: 'A personal review; great works affect one too deeply to offer anything
      else. And this, Reader -- this, I think, is a great work.


      I always appreciated literature; perhaps it was a way of finding representation
      that for me was not available in most instances of mainstream culture. Sometimes,
      I would find a fragment so relatable, so viscerally true, that I had to read
      it out loud.


      With most of Porpentine''s games, I found myself reading aloud more often than
      not. ''The parasite has spun a palace of my stolen years.''  ''But it hurts,
      being faceless.'' ''I returned, woefully, to myself''. ''Branded heretic accross
      the forehead''. I found the games seven years ago: a meaningful, hopeful melody
      in a terrible place. In spite of offering this hope, Porpentine never offers
      the platitudes that so often go with it. It''s the experience of someone who
      has really been there, converted into hypertext, the collective voice of a non-normative
      experience lived at the fringes of society; of how perilous this experience
      is not only emotionally, but also socially or economically. The pain is acknowledged.
      The fall is acknowledged. The ability to stand up and go on after that fall
      is acknowledged; so is the fact that often, to stand up will be impossible --
      and because of that, her message is empowering.


      The prose is evocative, melancholy, whimsical, often just plain weird. But this
      strange juxtaposition is a perfect fit for her chosen medium: hypertext.'
