The rest 10 percent is what makes this game challenging. You never know when your hero falls down to water, lava or just falls (there is fall damage), even though you're pressing jump key like crazy. Thanks to this clever feature it takes almost 40 minutes to finish the game, which seems fair for 0,39â‚¬ sale price.","timestamp_created":1609686632,"timestamp_updated":1609686632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5Jiz5PYCeZ2MwAI="}
