But it's too heavy. It lags sometimes and the controller has been missing quite a lot. I played all counter fight and this one is the only one lagging a lot and I dropped alot of plates because the grips just release or just wont hold. The tutorial is even worse lagging like crazy. \nFor a reviewer that asked how to make cheese pizza, it actually quite easy, just pour the cheese about 3 times as long as usual. \n\nGet the other counter fight if u must. Just skip this one.","timestamp_created":1605654848,"timestamp_updated":1605654848,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoJSf7PUCfoyDrwI="}
