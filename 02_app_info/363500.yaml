    review: "With about the same level of interactivity as salvaging research papers\
      \ for thesis material, this game is hard to get into.\n\nThe start of the game\
      \ is dull and nothing really prompts you to continue playing, besides a few\
      \ minor dialogue options. Though the game doesn't really change from this formula,\
      \ I started to enjoy it more and more as I played through.\n\nWith over 1,300\
      \ lines of dialogue, every character's personality is detailed enough that you'll\
      \ want to explore all their possible responses.\n\nDirection wise, this game\
      \ does not hold your hand. \nThis is a game where you have to play it in one\
      \ sitting, which is about a 3-5 hour playthrough. \nIf you start playing it\
      \ for a couple of hours and then come back to it weeks later, like what I initially\
      \ did, you will have a hard time remembering what quests you were on and will\
      \ most likely have to create a new save.\n\nThe majority of the game is spent\
      \ hunting for some important information amongst lots of insignificant choices\
      \ making it hard to reinforce why what you're doing is valuable.\n\nOn the other\
      \ hand, the massive amounts of dialogue gives you lots of resources that you\
      \ can use to piece together the game's backstory & gives you enough information\
      \ to keep the game interesting though your journey.\n\nThe interactions you\
      \ have between characters give the game plenty of personality, and doesn't hold\
      \ back mockery on how society builds off of outdated structures without questioning\
      \ why they were made in the first place. (Like how the QWERTY keyboard layout\
      \ survived unchanged from typewriters into the digital age.)\n\nMost puzzles\
      \ are very simple to complete, but some of the optional ones require a bit of\
      \ cross referencing to figure out.\n\nIt you're still unsure if you should play\
      \ this game or not, the demo does a good job introducing you to the mechanics."
