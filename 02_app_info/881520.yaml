      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Early Access</h2>This game is still in development. I was
      on a bit of hiatus (life is crazy) but I am back and working diligently on bringing
      this game to release. This version is in lockstep with the mobile free to play
      version of the game. If you want to preview the game I suggest downloading it
      for free first.<br><br><br>What is the difference in the PC version? Not much
      at the moment. The main draw will be better performance (especially with all
      graphics features enabled) and being able to play with a mouse and keyboard.
      I have no plans to compromise my vision for the game because it is a &quot;mobile&quot;
      game - the goal is a proper PC UI/UX.<br><br>Whether you decide to buy now,

    review: "This would be a decent little tower defense mobile port. Currently riddled\
      \ with bugs and incomplete features. Some the dev knew about 2 years ago. \n\
      \nWhile early access is designed to say 'My game is not ready'  its not really\
      \ a place where you are supposed to abandon paid games and linger there. \n\n\
      Due to the game being abandoned in early access, I do not recommend the game.\
      \ But for the dollar, I got my money worth out of it."
