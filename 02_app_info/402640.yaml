    review: He is an amazing character and I am so happy to be him, it is so strange
      playing as a character who started as a scared guy who would run away from any
      danger to a guy (or zombie) swinging swords at any foe near by along with his
      Pink mind reading arm of course (a zombie Ted as an ally, such a missed opportunity)
