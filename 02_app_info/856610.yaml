      \ death is only a minor setback. Each life you\u2019ll not only find weapons\
      \ and items to help you; you\u2019ll also be collecting DNA from the enemies\
      \ you defeat. After your inevitable death you\u2019re given the opportunity\

      \ physical mutations for your next clone's life.<br><br>In the search for your\
