It is more like a modern version of the classic Rogue dungeon game. Your goal is to explore several randomly generated dungeons, level up, get better gear, and find keys that let you through locked doors to new areas to explore. Beyond that, there are no deep meaningful quests (at least not yet). Like Rogue, it is about navigating a maze and COMBAT! The combat system is good with 3 different specializations based on stats (see below). Reading the reviews I feel like it has gotten a bad wrap because people expected it to be like World of WarCraft and it just isn't intended to be that. It is also an early access game, which unfortunately for some reason certain people expect to be all but complete. I don't know how it was before, but right now it seems stable and very playable. That said, I expect the developers will build on this base as time goes on.\n\nSo far I've played for about 10 hours and made it to level 14. I don't think I've even scratched the surface of the maps as I'm still on the first of 5 or so regions you can see from your starting point.\n\nHere's what I've learned about the classes so far.\nRight now I prefer archery (dexterity) which includes bows, crossbows, spears, etc. These weapons seem to trade range for damage. I also take some melee (strength) so I can bash enemies with swords and clubs when they get close, but I may end up dropping that so I can gain dex faster to get access to better weapons. Mages (intelligence) have several types of magic attacks that seem to trade speed for damage. Their playstyle seems similar to the archer, but it has the interesting twist of the different magic attacks working differently. For instance, blasts from physical attacks will ricochet around.\n\nIf you like a classic dungeon crawl, for $20 bucks it is well worth spending some time on.","timestamp_created":1605165153,"timestamp_updated":1605165645,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4zP/U3fUCfbfxrQI="}
