    review: 'I like the game.  I really do.  But the controls and the lack of modern
      standards make me give it a no.

      If you have a controller, you can only use the data pad.  On KB arrows to move,
      "l" to fire.  No remapping to anything that makes sense.

      You can hold down on ladders to go down but have to repeat the up button on
      each level to go up.  Getting off on a specific floor going down is very tricky.  Getting
      onto a ladder from above is also very tricky.  You might think you are in the
      right spot.  But be off by a pixel and you will be standing there getting shot
      instead of dropping.

      You can not adjust sound or volume levels so far as I can tell.

      The gameplay (outside of frustrating controls) is pretty cool.  Sort of a cross
      between "Donkey Kong" and Intellivisions "Night Stalker."  Climb around a ladder
      maze.  Shoot bad guys.  Collect Ammo and O2 to avoid death.  Basic stuff but
      cool.

      To me, this seems like something that needs a week more in polishing before
      leaving "early access."'
