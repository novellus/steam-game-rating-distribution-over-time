Love the animation and the way my mech looks. For 1.99, this game is a fun retro-ish shooter arcade game. Would love to see the developer expand on this more. Keep the graphics and controls the same but add more features. Add more weapons that can be switched too. Missiles, machine guns, Bombs and mines. Create an open world and missions to go on. \n\nThe game is very linear and the weapons feel pretty much the same.","timestamp_created":1518378346,"timestamp_updated":1518378346,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458370238542556763","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4dyZw+ECe5PQmAE="}
