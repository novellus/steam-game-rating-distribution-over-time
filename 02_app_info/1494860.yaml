    short_description: The development of science creates Utopia. But that's not for
      everyone. People are divided into &quot;chosen ones&quot; and &quot;unchosen
      ones&quot;. On the other hand, some will accept new values and others will stick
      to old traditions. Do you have the &quot;courage &quot;to find the truth in
      the &quot;ideals&quot; given by evolution?
