Loaded with obstacles you must cross or go around to get to your target, with unlimited angles and corners for enemies to hide in or behind makes this a must-have for anyone ehose found their way through so far.\nNo-one could call this game is easy, and I'd call anyone out on it who does, but this one is a doozy. Okay, you only get one map but you aren't paying $4 as Stardock would have you pay, and you are getting better value (yes you get a sub-faction with the \"Ashes...\n map, but one already created in the forst \"ashes...\"). Think of the time it took to create this devlish masterpiece, test it out and tweak it some more and you have more than your money's worth.\nDon't let this game die - support the Devs and crow about how you breezed though without a loss (and watch me call you out on it...hehe).\nKeep the content coming, guys. There are still players looking for more challenges.","timestamp_created":1492188308,"timestamp_updated":1492188308,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518984615802764893","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwotTWttsCds/kdg=="}
