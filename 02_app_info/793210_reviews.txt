First one was OK, had a good atmosphere and was kinda scary, to some extent. This one of the three was the least scary. I feel in a church/cathedral like at home, so I kinda enjoyed exploring the place, especially the catacombs. I was hoping for some ghosts in the library, but it was pretty abandoned, even by the ghosts. Get it on a sale.","timestamp_created":1589758029,"timestamp_updated":1589758029,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zM29kvICcqS/iAI="}
