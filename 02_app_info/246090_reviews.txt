It's a rimworld clone with the following exceptions:\n\n* lower performance compute\n\n* characters have one job rather than prioritizing an array of jobs\n\n* no tech tree\n\n* events are totally randomized and uncontrollable\n\n* no game goal\n\n* less than five minutes of music audio\n\n* worse graphics\n\n* no development in years\n\nIf I could get my money back, I would. If I could spend those dollars on a gofundme to give butt cancer to the publisher for accepting monies for this scam title it wouldn't bother me to drop the cash right in that project.
