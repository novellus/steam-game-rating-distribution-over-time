I am into solving crimes and story-driven games, and Memory delivers on both sides!\nMemory is a game developed by a small company, so I didn’t expect a AAA game but was still pleasantly surprised by a few things:\n- I especially like the fact that the author gave each character their own personality, only by using texts - pretty cool!\n- This game is loooong (that’s a very good thing in my book, pun intended) and be aware that the story takes some time before really taking off; like with any good crime story, the story seems at first to go into one way before completely changing direction.\n- I enjoyed that the search for clues is interspersed with short puzzles; also that a whole set of these puzzles are chapter titles! I love this kind of nerdy attention to details, ha ha\n- The phone booth to “jump” from one area/building to an other is a nice idea, but be still ready to do a lot of back-tracking (think Resident Evil without actions and zombies ;) )\n- It was challenging to get the “right” ending but ultimately very rewarding!\nOverall, I strongly recommend this game for whoever love a good crime story and enjoy looking for clues everywhere.","timestamp_created":1591314318,"timestamp_updated":1591314318,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511796951293945313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwq7DuwPICe6CajAI="}
