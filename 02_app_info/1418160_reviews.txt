Not just for the gem placement, but for what enemies you end up fighting as well. Some of the mechanics are interesting, but when enemies call for 50 reinforcements or you have no matches and die on turn 1, it becomes a very big headache.\n\nI restarted the game on easy mode after failing chapter 3 50 times. I can't even get past chapter 1. It's a massive grind that feels like a lottery, where the odds aren't in your favor. I have no idea what the endgame looks like with all of the upgrades. I just hope it's not as painful as the early game.\n\nEdit: Play Isekai Quest, if you want a game that has a better chance of winning. Stats are halfway upgraded and I've yet to take down chapter 3. I reached wave 9 (out of hopefully 10) and the enemies doubled to an unbearable amount. The cheap, randomized combos you get whacked by are the biggest issue. The fight gets out of control and you take a LOT of damage in 1 turn.","timestamp_created":1609864243,"timestamp_updated":1609983666,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9aSg7fYCesnfwAI="}
