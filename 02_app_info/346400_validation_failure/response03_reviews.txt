It was about speed, and only speed. No powerups, no performing tricks, no gimmicks. Just speed.\n\nChaos Rider Capitalizes on games like F-Zero and Tube Slider made back in those days and re-introduces it to today's market.\n\nAnd damn, does it do it well.\n\nPros:\n+ Breakneck speeds\n+ F-Zero Nostalgia\n+ Only about going fast, nothing else\n+ No cheap-ass blue shells and ruined friendships\n+ Grab 3 friends and 3 more controllers for a blast\n+ BEAUTIFUL tracks\n+ Good soundtrack\n+ Difficult, just like the games it's based off of\n\nCons:\n- Mediocre SFX quality\n- A few audio bugs here and there\n- The bots can be absolute dicks\n- You crash, the adrenaline stops\n- Not much for customization, just bike color and stats\n- No online multiplayer...yet\n\nDespite the game not saying it's in early access, it's a little unpolished here and there. Overall, a very nice experience and a reminder to what racing games used to be.\n\nI need to break out my Gamecube, now.","timestamp_created":1422574173,"timestamp_updated":1422887158,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":30,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.66212928295135498","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj+CrpcsCf7alNg=="}
