The illustrations are a bit basic, the moans and voice acting can be a little cheesy, but the gameplay is so much fun. Yeah its hard on a few levels, but the trial and error is part of the fun for me. It's also just so unique? Voxel games are everywhere, but I love this goofy abstract 3D health shooter living simulation. Definitely worth 5 bucks.","timestamp_created":1576510951,"timestamp_updated":1576510951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45YHYh+8CfYDf5AE="}
