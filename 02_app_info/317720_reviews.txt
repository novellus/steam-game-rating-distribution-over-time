No matter what level you were on, this puts you back on to level 1 and you have to redo the tutorial!\n- When doing the tutorial, make sure you follow the instructions precisely, you can get stuck if you put the lightning node on the wrong spot and you don't have enough money to put another one. It does lock you from selling though ...\n- Mobs sometimes get stuck, at first I thought it was normal, giving you breather, but alas it looks like its a bug. \n\nSuggestions:\n- Get rid of restart button that resets progress\n- Fix pathing of enemies getting stuck. (game breaker imo)\n\nIf this game gets patched then theres a lot of potential for this to really good.","timestamp_created":1464554576,"timestamp_updated":1464554576,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548677980899810791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiKuQ/9QCeJ/nWA=="}
