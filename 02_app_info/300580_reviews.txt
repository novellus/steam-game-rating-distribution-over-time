It's a real shame that there wasn't more hype for this game when it launched like ages ago. Fun space combat with a neat AI system controlling enemies. Great dialogue and a nice plot.  Highly recommended if any of the above interests you.","timestamp_created":1606454018,"timestamp_updated":1606454377,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oo+JhPYCdeCaswI="}
