      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nSneaky Funk is a melee-based, rogue-lite action dungeon crawler\
      \ game with a focus on letting the player choose their own play style rather\
      \ than force you to dodge and shoot like many other top-down rogue-lite games.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe floor and room layouts are procedurally generated\
      \ and contain enemies, props, physical objects and more to create variety in\
      \ gameplay and visuals. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe gameplay loop is mostly split\
      \ into 2 parts; the real-time combat and the initiation attack.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\n- Initiation Attack: Every time you enter a new room (that contains\
      \ enemies) you get to allocate some action points to create a path between different\
      \ anchor points in the room. Once this is done, the player character enters\
      \ the room and jumps between these points, damaging enemies in their path. The\
      \ player can choose to spec into this stage of gameplay by choosing weapons\
      \ or items that offer more action points or add functionality and complexity\
      \ to this stage. This is something that plays with a heart for strategy and\
      \ tactics will love!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf action-oriented gameplay is more\
      \ your style, we have that too. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Real-time combat: After\
      \ the initiation attack has occurred, any remaining enemies need to be cleared\
      \ out. At this stage, you swing your weapon at the enemies and use abilities\
      \ to dodge their attacks. Most games in this genre are either turn-based or\
      \ rely heavily on ranged attacks; our game uses melee to great effect and features\
      \ a unique control scheme and purpose-built abilities to allow the player to\
      \ quickly and efficiently out-maneuver enemies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach floor\
      \ features a boss and defeating it allows the player to carry on to new floors\
      \ and meet new challenges (currently, only a single boss and floor is implemented\
      \ for the prototype version of the game)."
