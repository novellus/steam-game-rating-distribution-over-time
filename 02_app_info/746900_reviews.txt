I liked the artwork.  The open worlod part itself is nice to roam around and collect things.\n\nBut beyond that it has insane flaws.  Every now and then it puts you in these big cube rooms that are bland and makes you collect items.  Water rises.  Touch the water you have to restart.  Open world or cube world you have an auto slide so your toon won't even stay still.  So you have to repearivly jump in spot as water rises and falls or die and start over.  This is for anywhere in the game.  And making me sit in rooms to collect things over and over vs enjoying the open world, where you still slide and die but at least it pretty to look at, makes the game not desrable to play.\n\nGot to go repeated rooms so much in failure have a headache and I was still on the first island.  Looks pretty runs like trash.","timestamp_created":1571409520,"timestamp_updated":1571409520,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.473107635974884033","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2MzT7+0Ceran1AE="}
