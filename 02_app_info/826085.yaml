    review: 'Get it on sale if you want to 100% the game, but DLC 1 and 2 won''t be
      anything exciting. The landscapes are great but the enemy hordes are the exact
      same. The bosses in this DLC are: [spoiler] A reskinned version of the common
      Bull miniboss, and the Anubis encased in stone from level 2 [/spoiler]'
