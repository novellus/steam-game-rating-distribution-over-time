      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>New heroes and new units:</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\
      <ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Heinrich von Bassenheim:</strong> The Teutonic\
      \ order may be small, but they recruit extremely skilled warriors. The leader\
      \ of the Teutonic Knights in the Holy Land is known as the Grand Master. He\
      \ is a veteran of many battles, both on the field and in political skirmishes\
      \ as well.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Otokar von Marland:</strong> He is the\
      \ Master of Arcane, a knight who possesses great knowledge in the mysterious\
      \ arts that the commoners call magic. Otokar has lived a secluded life, and\
      \ over his many years in the Holy Land he has hunted down rare arcane tomes,\
      \ and visited many sages and wise men. Now, it is finally time for him to use\
      \ this knowledge to protect his brothers in arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Brothers\
      \ of the Sword:</strong> These sacred warriors of the Order serve as bodyguards\
      \ and elite warriors, having travelled to the Holy Land under the orders of\
      \ the Grand Master. They receive unique training and are provided with the finest\
      \ equipment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Teutonic Archers:</strong> Although\
      \ these vassals will never enter the higher ranks of the Order, they nevertheless\
      \ fight for their brethren with great spirit and dedication.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\
      <li><strong>Teutonic Infantry:</strong> These crusaders are the volunteer forces\
      \ of the Teutonic Knights. They are neither vassals nor sworn knights. They\
      \ may have lacked proper training when they joined the Order, but constant skirmishes\
      \ on the Holy Lands quickly turn any soldier into an efficient warrior.\n\t\t\
      \t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Teutonic Lay Knights:</strong> These nobles hold land\
      \ granted to them by the Order. Most of them hold lands in the Holy Roman Empire,\
      \ which engenders in them a sense of brotherhood, borne out on the battlefield.\n\
      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Teutonic Mercenaries:</strong> The Order welcomes\
      \ with open arms any mercenaries who enter the Holy Land and strengthen their\
      \ forces. True, these mercenaries do not belong to the inner ranks of the Order,\
      \ but they are provided with the finest equipment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>The\
      \ Brethren:</strong> They swore to protect the pilgrims of the Holy Land, and\
      \ have founded hospitals for the sick. By their actions, they have made the\
      \ Order of Teutonic Knights a respected presence in the Holy Land. Originally\
      \ they only defended the ports of Acre, but as the conflict escalated, they\
      \ have found themselves engaged in the larger conflict.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\
      \t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Numerous new abilities, spells, artifacts:</strong>\
      \ Presence of the Grand Master, Holy Protection, Incineration, Inspire Zeal,\
      \ Incantations of St. Alberic, Rosary of St. Gregorius, Sacred Goblet of St.\
      \ Anthony, Shroud of St. Afan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Four unique events\
      \ of the Crusader Campaign add to the gameplay on Holy Land.</strong>\n\t\t\t\
