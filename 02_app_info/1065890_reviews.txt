The UX could be worse, but still, it's very clumsy, without playing the tutorial there's no way you could understand how to play it intuitively. I guess the fun starts a little later in the game but I couldn't stand one more minute playing it.\n\nFor the record, I had been waiting for the price to drop for a looong time, bought it under 5â‚¬, and I'm going to ask for a refund, I'm very disappointed.\n\nBut hey, most reviews are positive, so maybe I'm just too picky and that's just a matter of taste.","timestamp_created":1596561202,"timestamp_updated":1596561202,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtdOd3fMCevmvmQI="}
