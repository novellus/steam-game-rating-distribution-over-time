Just one annoyance after the other; they forgot what made donâ€™t Starve fun a long time ago and only cater to cheaters and trolls like they are giving real feedback.\n\nThese Developers fell from grace long ago. They are online bullies and deserve no support. They don't take kindly to criticism and will retaliate using any tactics at their disposal; thank god they have no power here on Steam. Early access game are supposed to be criticized but I guess that is why their crummy games never improve.","timestamp_created":1541776009,"timestamp_updated":1609962904,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.266541779041290283","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnIvR7PYCcsm1rgE="}
