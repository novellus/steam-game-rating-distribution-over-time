    review: 'Don''t buy, don''t bother.


      While the artists did a good job, the writers did a particalarly poor one.


      There aren''t many glaring plot holes but lot''s of plot convenience and the
      plot points in general are rather forseeable and on a level of fanfiction.


      While anime always relies on archetypes the characters here are best described
      as stereotypes and they don''t connect on an emotional level.


      That would be ok if we were talking about a fanservicy anime but since that''s
      not the case I can''t recommend this series not even on a discount.'
