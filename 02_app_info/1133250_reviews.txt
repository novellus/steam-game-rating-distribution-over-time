You play as a virgin that tries to escape a bunch of crazy cultists who plan to sacrifice her. Tension that builds up as your enemies grow in numbers spices the good old rogue-like dungeon crawler mechanics pretty well. Pixel art visuals are neat and have that special retro-vibe to them. Creepy music and low-fi SFX match the overall atmosphere.\nIn conclusion you can have some fun with this little game. And it's worth the (really cheap tbh) price.","timestamp_created":1566057103,"timestamp_updated":1566057103,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566929101943969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46d+R0OwCe7nE0AE="}
