Upload the Oculus Touch update on Steam, it will be fine.\nFlipped the review score in an obnoxious attempt to force the issue. The following is my original positive review of the older game.[/strike]\n\n[u]edit 2: (Jan 28, 2018)[/u]\n[b] ok they added the touch controls to the steam version. It's great! I beat the whole game again and did the extra robot story arc thing, and made the people disapear and then shot Amity with the gun. [/b]this game is VR bliss, but they removed it from steam! I can still play it, but I can't correct this review! Or can I? Im going to flip the review to positive now, even though the game is removed from steam, I'm not sure what will happen. Please remake Technolust again, then do it again, again, and again, and again.\n\n[u]original review (Dec 9, 2016)[/u]:\n19.99? A gamble, though as I expected, it worked fine with Revive. Take advantage of a sale. Have a Xbox360 controller handy for standing play.\n\nFor the majority of it (and the length is sufficient) it was very much what I hoped for, a techno-robo-cyberpunk panopticon oozing detail. It does have plenty of detail, but not that much interactivity (npc's don't talk), which was fine with me. A large drawback is that the better part of the game (city) is far too dark for a VR game, though this may be done for reasons related to them being outside areas. The interior sets (dim too) are very habitable. It starts off real strong, but the charm fades near the end when you go out on the wasteland (bright) and then go to mars (short, out of place). I did not complete any of the collection quests (and it took for forever to find his shop in the dark), so you might stumble upon the ending of the game, and have a few nuggets of replayablity left over that I unfortunately cannot spoil for you.\n\nOverall there's oodles of incredibly well crafted cyberpunk art in first 2/3 of this VR game to make your eyes bleed all over your fresnels. It was really was a very impressive force-de-tour of cyberpunk stuff (of which I'm not an aficionado). Really hip. I loved the \"Bit's and Bytes\" TV show that played.
