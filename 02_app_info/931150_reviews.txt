A center reset wouldn't be difficult, and would solve the issue.\n\nNot an all in VR port, everything is done with clicks. That'll disapoint the purists, but keeps it simple for those that can't get to grips with the complexity of Table Top Sim's controls.\n\nThe game is nicely scaled, big bright board. A good selection of custome options, and has full multiplayer cross platform play with mobile devices leaving you with no shortage of games.\n\nWhile i normally wax lyrical over VR multiplayer experiences because of the social atmosphere they create, be aware Rento isn't that online.","timestamp_created":1542465534,"timestamp_updated":1542465534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586226880550384521","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwg4eHkecCddn5rgE="}
