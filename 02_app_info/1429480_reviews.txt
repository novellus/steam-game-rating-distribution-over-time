Makes for a game that I can play without having to so engrossed that I can't simply get up and come back later to play more.  There is a little room for further enhancement especially apparently running on the Unity engine...I would like to see the ability to rotate the puzzle to different angles and make the cards to where they must fit in perfect numerical sequence just to make some of the higher levels more difficult.  I would recommend this game as a great casual puzzle type that I would go back and play all over again.","timestamp_created":1605908505,"timestamp_updated":1605908505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4muTm8/UCdLXGrwI="}
