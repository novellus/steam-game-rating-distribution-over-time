I'd dare to even call it a really good  rpg maker game. Always look at the chasm first, then touch the egg for bad end or leave it alone for good. Given some of it's faults, it's only really worth the buy when it's on sale. I don't think I'd be nearly as kind to this game if I had paid the full 10 bucks for it.\n\nPros:\n\n-Fun game\n\n-Good enough storyline\n\n-Usually straightforward progression. \n\n-Never gets too hard, lot of fights only take 1-3 turns the entire game save for the boss fights.\n\n-Bosses are challenging enough compared to the other monsters\n\n-Items EVERYWHERE. You find them or get them from fights, you will never run out. Ever.\n\n-Likable characters. Granted they aren't super fleshed out but they aren't totally cardboard either. 2.5D\n\n-Salesman, I like the character they're cool. \n\n-Beautiful pixel graphics.\n\n-Mapping glitches. There are a lot of them in almost all of the maps of this game. I list them as a pro because you can kite monsters into them if you don't want to fight.\n\nCons:\n\n-It never gets too hard. I listed it as a pro, but that's because I greatly prefer button mashing my way through fights to get back to exploring and the story.  If you like rpg fights, these might bore you to tears.\n\n-Bad eventing. Most of them are minor things that effect the graphics but the rest are bad. The main ones that come to mind are all at the end.\n   + The egg, that if you get it before looking into the chasm it will cause the game to crash because it can't handle the event switches being flipped out of order.\n   +Two boss fights at the end, where once you beat those characters the devs forgot to make their character events passable, so the player character will bump into the invisible events rather than go through them.\n   +On of the party members in one of the last scene just stands there after all the characters converge on the main character. I'm guessing they had all the characters set up as events and forgot to event her moving in with the rest of them, or set her movement to skip if she couldn't move.\n   +Not related to the ending. Sometimes events just won't recognize when they're being interacted with, or is misplaced from where it seems it should be. With enough persistence you can get the events to work, but it's just weird that they just won't even with the related switches activated.\n\n-Missing tools and under used ones, A.K.A. \"where is the damn broom?\" and \"Why do we keep the shovel again?\". \n\nThere are many mentions made too the broom throughout the game,  in the blurbs for the other tools and even a character at the end of the game makes mention that \"You made your way through this place with nothing but your wits and a worn broomstick\". Except I never got the broom! I've played through this game twice now and I dunno where it is. All the chess pieces are easy to find. The sledgehammer and the pickaxe are found easily as you're led to them through story events. The broom isn't given that same treatment. I don't know where it is. \n\nThe shovel has the opposite problem where we get it, use it once, then we NEVER use it again. What was the point in keeping it? It says it can be used to dig up secrets or find extra passages, but they're no where to be seen. Most of the secrets are very easily telegraphed, and it just bugs me that the tool is just extra weight from an idea that never came to be.\n\n-Disjointed character development. While the characters are a little deeper than your standard puddle, some of their dialogue is off. It's like you're missing conversations between them and some of what they say can come off as cold or outright mean. They get along more towards the end, but it's still really weird seeing them be mean to eachother to being more like friends. It feels like there's missing conversations that would have smoothed that out.\n\nI also suspect that the missing broom leads into this, since we may have been able to get into the oil room/treasury much earlier in the game as it's blocked off by what I can assume is a sweepable pile of debris. I say this because there is a place for the merchant and it's a big open area with no monsters, and those are normally the locations where the MCs rest and talk. The devs at least had enough forethought to make it so that the pile is gone by the time you end up looped back to that area, since you have to do a fair bit of back tracking at that point in the game and would have been stuck otherwise.\n\n-Inconsistent item hints. This is mostly in regards to early-mid portions of the game, where it seems like the devs couldn't decide if they wanted the player to work out and find what they need on their own, or use the sparkling graphic to telegraph it as both are used in the game. It makes it a bit confusing, and then including some events just not registering interactions? It can make a player miss an item they need, like the torch for the oil room because it didn't let them take it after interacting with it a couple times, wander the monastery, only to come back and NOW it lets them take it.\n\nNitpicks:\n\n-One switch to decide your ending. There are two endings to this game and in a game that was this big, I'm not really a fan of there being just one switch to decide which one you get. I think it would have been better for there to be a variable system to decide your ending, which considering a character that plays a part in both endings it could easily have been made into three or four endings.\n\n-All the cultists just sitting there at the end. They just sit there when they could swarm the MCs, be destroyed, or have clouds of smoke come off them as they finally die for good. Leaving them standing there after everything just seems lazy. \n\n-No flavor text. You can't interact with everything and get a bit of dialogue for it. Granted it lets the game be more streamlined so the player knows they don't have to waste their time selecting everything, but I'm one of those that likes having that bit of extra dialogue to help discover more of the lore. \n\n-The Controls are wrong. The Z key is entirely nonfunctional for this game even though the beginning control explanation says you can use it. It's the default interact key as well so it's a bit weird having to always hit enter.  It left me going between the Z and enter keys just because I kept forgetting that Z doesn't work. I'm also a bit sad they disabled shift to run, which would have been great to have for some of the longer back tracking segments.\n\n-That the achievements are hidden until after you complete them and sometimes not even then. This is mostly for the chess one, since even after placing down the chess pieces I don't have the achievement for it.","timestamp_created":1606604700,"timestamp_updated":1606604700,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlsfGiPYCff/otAI="}
