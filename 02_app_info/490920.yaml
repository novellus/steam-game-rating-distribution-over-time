    about_the_game: 'Wolfpack is a realistic, first person, co-op U-boat game where
      one or multiple crews of players man the stations of a highly detailed German
      type VII U-boat during the Second World War. The crew will encounter large randomized
      convoys of merchants escorted by destroyers, sloops, and corvettes. Their objective
      is to intercept and sink enemy ships and escape undetected. <br><br><br>Each
      player mans a station in the U-boat, and the crew will need to cooperate in
      order to succeed in their mission. Unlike other submarine simulators, Wolfpack
      is designed for players to procedurally manage the submarine through direct,
      manual interaction with valves, levers, and instruments.<br><br>Each U-boat
      has up to five players: The captain, the helmsman, the dive officer, the radio
      man, and the navigator.<br><br>The radio man operates the hydrophone, radio,
      radio direction finder, and Enigma machine. The helmsman controls the U-boats
      heading and speed, and operates the torpedo data computer. The dive officer
      controls the depth using the dive planes, ballast and negative tanks and serves
      as a lookout and gunner for the deck gun and anti aircraft gun. The navigator
      calculates the position of the u-boat, and determines the best route to intercept
      enemy convoys. The captain is the commander of the U-boat, and leads the crew.<br><br>Wolfpack
      also features a single player mode where one captain can easily manage his U-boat
      solo. Plus, it is easy to start a mission solo and allow other players to join
      the battle in their own subs as part of a wolfpack. The captains can use the
      U-boat radio to communicate with each other just like the real U-boats did.<br><br>All

    reviews: "\u201C&quot;Immersion\u201D means different things to different players.\
      \ Turn-based and RTS players identify so much with their units that they feel\
      \ they are members of the force. Simulation and FPS players have even more visceral\
      \ connections: they are virtually on the spot, spewing bullets and doing Split-Ss.\
      \ Submarine simulations tend to combine both styles. The main position is the\
      \ captain\u2019s positions in the command center where he can pick targets by\
      \ the periscope. He can also click on dials to control speed, course and depth.\
      \ Some simulations can send players to specific compartments like engineering,\
      \ fire control, sonar/radar, radio, even crew quarters via clicks on icons.\
      \ Still, the player is in control with no real change in perspective. Skvader\

      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Wargamer</a><br><br>\u201CIf you've ever\

      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >PC Gamer</a><br><br>\u201C&quot;It\
      \ was our second mission, so our three-man crew was a little nervous. Even though\
      \ my two gaming buddies and I cracked jokes about our rather limited adventures\
      \ at sea we knew that we were playing a game that was deadly serious. We were\
      \ tasked with seeking out and destroying any British supply convoys that we\
      \ came across in the frigid waters of the North Sea.  Wolfpack is not an easy\
      \ game. It sure managed to flummox my two gaming buddies and I when we initially\
      \ tried it out. This is not a submarine simulator where many of the complex\
      \ calculations and controls are streamlined for you. No, this is a full-on simulator\
      \ which forces you to come to grips with your chosen U-boats many machinations\
      \ all by yourselves. And when everything comes together and your crew finally\
      \ comes to grips with Wolfpack\u2019s carefully articulated mechanics, the game\
      \ becomes a thing of beauty that I personally haven\u2019t experienced in most\
