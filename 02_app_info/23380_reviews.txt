It's basically a clone of Bejeweled Twist with a monsters, battles and a story. I was looking forward to playing the game again, but I can't really recommend it on PC. For some reason, the game keeps crashing and I have absolutely no idea why. Seems like it is poorly optimized for PC, or maybe just my system. Worth buying when it's ultra cheap if you don't mind constant crashes.","timestamp_created":1609140259,"timestamp_updated":1609140259,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i/mO1PYCdf2CvgI="}
