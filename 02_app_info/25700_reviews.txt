Whether you are playing the competitive multiplayer mode or the Single-player/cooperative campaign mode, half the time you will be switching guns you find along the way. The variety of weapons found in this game are also divided into 2 separate energy types, which are regular bullet-type weapons & laser type weapons, and the other being heat & cold powered weapons. Your character is a living sphere that rolls around as you move, and each one has his/her own special abilities at their disposal. Experiment with the variety of characters and weapons in this game and find out what suits you best.\n\nIt's a great game to play with friends, or by yourself if that is your thing. Either way, this game is quite good and can keep you entertained for a while.
