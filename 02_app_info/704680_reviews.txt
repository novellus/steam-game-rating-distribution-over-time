I'm probably just biased but I absolutely love everything about it. I only played through it once so far but I got the true end and it was a crazy roller coaster of emotions for me haha I can't wait to play through it again and get more of the endings! Hopefully a walkthrough is made as well.","timestamp_created":1504669213,"timestamp_updated":1604521444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.484312325716018677","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqsi7yvUCe4TRhAE="}
