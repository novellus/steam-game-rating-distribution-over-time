    review: '[i]Pier Solar and the Great Architects[/i] has a brilliant soundtrack
      with a total of 78 tracks. There are plenty of upbeat songs, battle themes worthy
      of the 16-bit era and many wonderful tunes that lend a lot of personality and
      charm to the game.


      The soundtrack is split across four discs, the first two contain the soundtrack
      to the game in its higher quality PCM form with more realistic instrumentation
      and a more full sound than the 16-bit FM version. It''s the ''enhanced soundtrack''
      that would play for the Mega Drive version of the game if a Mega CD was hooked
      up and the Enhanced Soundtrack Disc was being run simultaneously with the cartridge
      of the game. The third disc contains arrangements of music from the game by
      a number of composers, as well as some prototype and unused versions of tracks.
      The arrangements on the third disc come in a mix of styles so while it may not
      flow as well as the main soundtrack there are some interesting and fun takes
      on some of the game''s tracks. The fourth disc comes as an ISO file and is the
      ''Enhanced Soundtrack Disc'' that can be burned to a disc, put in a Sega Mega
      CD and used with a Sega Mega Drive cartridge of the game to play the original
      16-bit version of [i]Pier Solar[/i] with CD-quality PCM audio.


      What''s truly interesting about this soundtrack release is not only that the
      Enhanced Soundtrack Disc is included, but that it happens to be a treasure trove
      of interesting files. Mount the Enhanced Soundtrack Disc''s ISO and set Hidden
      Files to visible in Windows Explorer or simply unarchive the ISO, inside there''s
      an executable that leads to a flash page that may not work for some, even if
      it doesn''t it''s possible to look around the various directories on the disc
      and find concept artwork and photos from the development of the game, the 16-bit
      FM soundtrack in vgz form, some very rough Mega CD ROMs of Tavern RPG (the Eidolon''s
      Inn forum project that became [i]Pier Solar[/i]), a Mega Drive ROM of the beta
      version of [i]Pier Solar[/i], complete with readme and manual, and a Mega Drive
      ROM of [i]Pier Solar Music Player[/i].


      The included ROMs can be run through an emulator, or on original or clone hardware
      using a flashcart, or by burning discs for the Mega CD ROMs. The included ''ALPHA04''
      and ''ALPHA25'' versions for the Mega CD are very early in the development process,
      in fact the former is a garbled and messy looking proof of concept, simply allowing
      some walking around, talking to NPCs and opening a chest, while the latter looks
      closer to the final game, albeit with different art for a lot of stuff and much
      more rough dialogue, but only several areas can be explored and the battle system
      can be seen in the very early stages of being put together. The Mega Drive beta
      is from further along in development, dated as April 2008 when looking at it
      in a hex editor, and it''s much more polished. The beta served as a demo and
      the credits roll shortly after the first dungeon. Some of the artwork is quite
      different because one of the graphic designers on the project left the project
      in late 2008 without authorising the use of his art, so it was replaced for
      the final version. The UI, character portraits, cutscene art, credits art and
      enemy designs are all different from the released game, but the bulk of the
      field graphics are the same and the battle system is fully functional. The Music
      Player is what it sounds like, it allows for listening of the game''s 16-bit
      soundtrack via emulator or original hardware through a simple menu.


      The ROMs could be found freely online years ago, though these days with Eidolon''s
      Inn shut down it may take a little searching, so it''s great to have them snuck
      onto this disc and included with the soundtrack, along with some amazing artwork
      and interesting relics from the game''s long development. These are such cool
      inclusions, it seems odd they aren''t advertised as part of the soundtrack''s
      contents.


      (Note: After unarchiving the ISO if there''s an unnamed file that can''t be
      deleted by conventional means, right click on the folder the file is in, select
      [i]''Add to archive...''[/i] and choose to zip it, under the archive options
      choose [i]''Delete files after archiving''.[/i] After it''s archived delete
      the zip.)


      There are only two minor drawbacks with the digital release of the [i]Definitive
      Original Soundtrack,[/i] one is that the soundtrack is provided in mp3 form,
      rather than a lossless format like FLAC, and the other is that only the PCM
      soundtrack is provided, though the FM soundtrack can be found in vgz form in
      the included Enhanced Soundtrack Disc''s contents, as mentioned earlier, and
      then it can be converted into whatever format is desired. A physical release
      of the soundtrack exists for those looking to make lossless rips.


      With so much amazing music from the game, the unused tracks, the new arrangements
      and the extra contents that can be found in the included Enhanced Soundtrack
      Disc, this is an amazing release.'
