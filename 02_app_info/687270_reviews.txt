Making big, pointless labyrinths that don't feel like a real location is bad level design. I would often fall asleep as I moved with my character.\n\nBecause of the isometric perspective and the intro scenes (which take place on a train station and in the protagonist's apartment) you may be misled to think that it's an action-adventure.\nIt's not.\nThere are some conversations and even an NPC companion, but the screenshots are misleading. The area with civilians and NPCs is 15 minutes long. The rest of my 8 hour long playtime has been spent in a big, boring labyrinth (underground high-tech complex). I managed to \"complete\" it only to arrive at another big, boring labyrinth.\n\nThe story is badly written. It tries to be unpredictable and succeeds only at being ridiculous. It's difficult to follow (especially given the unnecessary sci-fi jargon). The dialogue shows that it's not written by a good writer - the characters are not convincing. \n\nI saw the game has very little sales and because of that the hipster in me hoped that this is a hidden gem that was somehow missed by the masses - a little pearl cast in front of the swine. :D But... it's not. Still, this is one of the few bad games I don't regret buying simply because I like the genre. Despite being so dull I could have even finished it because of this love for the genre. But... it's time to learn to value my time.\n\nMy God. So dull.","timestamp_created":1587500644,"timestamp_updated":1587500644,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6q6az/ECfMDGggI="}
