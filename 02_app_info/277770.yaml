    about_the_game: "High-speed Chinese rail services were first introduced in 2007\
      \ and operated with existing CRH (China Railways) rolling stock running on existing\
      \ lines which had been upgraded for speeds of up to 250 km/h (160 mph) and on\
      \ newer dedicated high-speed track rated up to 350 km/h (220 mph).<br><br>The\
      \ CRH380D is the newest generation of Chinese high speed train, capable of running\
      \ at 380km/h and one of the fastest production trains in the world. In service\
      \ with China Railways these trains have been designated as CRH380D (8-car set)\
      \ &amp; CRH380DL (16-car set) using the new numbering system.<br><br>In September\
      \ 2009, Bombardier announced an order for eighty Zefiro 380 high-speed trains\
      \ by the Chinese Ministry of Railways (MOR) to be produced at Bombardier's joint\
      \ venture Sifang (Qingdao) Transportation Ltd. <br><br>The CRH380D uses state-of-the-art\
      \ flat-screen glass panels to display train information as well as the route\
      \ speed and signal data from suitably equipped routes. It can be driven manually\
      \ or by using the on-board computers which mean you need to do little more than\
      \ adjust the cruise control to comply with the speed limits between your departure\
      \ and destination stations.<br><br>The CRH380D has been developed for and interacts\

    review: "Alles im Cockpit h\xE4ngt sich nach absehbarer Zeit auf.\nImmer alles\
      \ auf einmal, die Geschwindigkeitsanzeige, die Cruise Control samt Regler, alle\
      \ Bildschirme...\nUnd wenn man in dem Moment zuf\xE4llig noch zu schnell unterwegs\
      \ war, geht der Alarm auch nicht mehr aus, selbst wenn man stehen bleibt.\n\
      Ich hatte bis jetzt keine fahrt in der sich die Elektronik nicht aufgegangen\
      \ hat.\n\nNeu installieren hat es auch nicht besser gemacht.\n\nBitte \xFCberarbeitet\
      \ den Zug, so an sich ist er wirklich gut."
