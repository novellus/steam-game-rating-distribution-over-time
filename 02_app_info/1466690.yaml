    about_the_game: 'Ogasawara Hiroki was once an ordinary man, but his life has now
      taken a distinctly unordinary turn. Quite unwittingly, he stumbled upon a well-kept
      secret which flipped his humdrum existence upside-down: namely, that several
      of Japan''s most famous female celebrities are succubi.<br><br>These succubi
      fall for Hiroki in droves, and soon he obtains quite the harem. His gaggle of
      adoring succubi include the two-faced idol, Ikue Ayu; the ditzy social media
      star, Cosmos; the sadistic businesswoman, Marina; the elegant actress, Hifumi;
      the cheerful tennis player, Hazel; and the aloof succubus princess, Yue.<br><br>After
      narrowly escaping a lifetime of imprisonment in the succubus realm, Hiroki is
      ready to kick back and relax. Ayu invites him on a vacation to her private beach
      house in Okinawa, and Hiroki is happy to refuse. The other succubi come along
      for the ride, and a week of summertime fun begins.<br><br>Join Hiroki as he
      breaks up vicious pillow fights, teaches Cosmos how to swim, and (begrudgingly)
      goes jogging with Hazel, all the while deepening his bonds with his adoring
      harem.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1466690/extras/ayubanner.png?t=1608043120"
      /><br>Ayu is a famous idol beloved by men and women alike across Japan. Her
      songs are peppy and adorable; her stage outfits pink and frilly; her attitude
      sweet and innocent.<br><br>That''s the image she wants to project... but, in
      actuality, the real Ayu is quite different. She''s cold and calculating, and
      some of her more disdainful expressions could curdle milk.<br><br>She is very
      fond of Hiroki despite herself, however, and she''s slowly becoming more honest
      with her feelings towards him.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1466690/extras/marinabanner.png?t=1608043120"
      /><br>Marina is a wealthy businesswoman who owns her own company. She is one
      of the oldest of Hiroki''s harem, and tries to act like a mature big sister
      should. She is generally calm and level-headed, but she''s highly sensitive
      about her age - a fact which Ayu mocks mercilessly.<br><br>Marina might act
      commandeering, but she has a soft side she only shows to those she loves. Away
      from the office and on the beach, Marina is more willing than she otherwise
      would be to let her hair down, and show Hiroki how cute she can really be.<br><br><img

      /><br>Cosmos is a social media star with a highly successful RapidPound account,
      which boasts over three million followers. Cosmos makes a living taking spicy
      photos of herself for her ever-growing audience, in a variety of costumes and
      poses.<br><br>Cosmos loves her fans dearly, but she loves Hiroki even more.
      She''s eager to please, and willing to do anything to make Hiroki happy...<br><br>But,
      since she''s an airhead, she sometimes takes things a bit too far.<br><br><img

      /><br>Hifumi is a well-regarded actress who has been working in the movie industry
      for over a decade. She''s so popular, even Hiroki''s father is a big fan of
      hers.<br><br>Hifumi is an elegant, demure woman, who typically wears luxurious
      kimonos. On the beach, however, she prefers to dress more casually, in a baggy
      shirt and shorts. This is a side of Hifumi that her fans have never seen before,
      and it''s all for Hiroki''s sake.<br><br>She might have changed up her look,
      but Hifumi is just as doting as ever, and she dreams of one day being Hiroki''s
      wife.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1466690/extras/hazelbanner.png?t=1608043120"
      /><br>Hazel is a tennis star with a Japanese mother and an American father.
      She''s unfailingly cheerful and upbeat, and is rarely seen without a big smile.
      She loves exercising, and is determined to get Hiroki to join her on her early
      morning jogs, even if it kills him.<br><br>Hazel has a penchant for both pretty
      women and handsome men. She''s very fond of Lady Yue, but she''s just as fond
      of Hiroki. Unable to choose between them, Hazel has, instead, opted to love
      them both equally.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1466690/extras/yuebanner.png?t=1608043120"
      /><br>Yue is the princess of the succubus realm. She may appear cool and aloof,
      but she has thawed out somewhat following the events of Sakura Succubus #3.<br><br>Yue
      has spent most of the life in the succubus realm, governing he people. As such,
      she has few opportunities to enjoy the human world. She''s determined to have
      some fun during the summer - and of course, she wants Hiroki to compliment her
      on her swimsuit.'
