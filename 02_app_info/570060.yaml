    review: It's hard to complain about a game that only cost a buck, but it doesn't
      even have enough value to justify that cost. There's nothing here. You can get
      a good score by simply standing in one spot and allowing the tacos the smack
      you in the face in time trial mode. In survival mode it's bit harder, but that's
      mainly to do with crappy Minecraft like graphics. Another review noted this
      is a good party game. It's not. If you use this game to show others a VR experience,
      they more than likely will never try VR again. Not recommended.
