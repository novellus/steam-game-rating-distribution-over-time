But just that. Not bad for a very limited dev team and fair for a sale price. But there's not a lot going on here and both my son and i found some of the puzzles tedious. I'd try something. Nope. Then literally every other thing possible. Then go look at a walk through video and - oh it was that first thing, but more of it. But beyond that, I like low poly games by small teams. It shows that a game is possible to make using more artistic flair than capital. I feel good supporting efforts like this.","timestamp_created":1609636902,"timestamp_updated":1609636902,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwx7714vYCd8D1vwI="}
