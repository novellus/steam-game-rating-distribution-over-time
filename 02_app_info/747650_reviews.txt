I liked the art style, and there were a few decent puzzles rooted in amongst the bonkers ones.\nOnto the negatives.  For one, the combat is horrendous.  It is near impossible to aim as you have to maintain the mouse over the enemies to focus aim but as soon as your mouse moves off them for a split second you lose all accrued aim focus entirely.  And it's impossible to keep the aim on them when the enemy is shambling at an oddangle, in a tiny room, half obscured by the scenery, randomly speeding up to a full pelt run midway through their amble towards you.  It was just so frustrating and caused multiple deaths because the enemy would reach you, stun you, block you from running away, and whittle your health away quickly.  If you could avoid them and get a couple of shots off at a distance they went down easy, but the controls really hold you back here.\nAlso the tone is all over the place.  Yes they were going for a tongue in cheek approach, but the script is so stilted, and the delivery of the actors is just off.  Top that off with a nonsensical, yet serious story, and I just didn't know what to make of it.\nBut what really kills the game is the threat of permadeath once you've died too many times.  Especially once you've got by the second of the horrible box-whack-a-mole puzzles (you'll know when you see them) - at that moment I knew if you were to try to convince me to go through those puzzles AGAIN I absolutely would have given up.  But because the threat is there, and death comes unfairly at the hands of enemies so easily, and because a lot of puzzles when done wrong will kill you, it gets to the stage where you very quickly give up on a puzzle far too quickly to look it up in a walkthrough to minimise the chance of another death, and the potential wiping of progress (it really doesn't communicate well how close you are to the death limit before permadeath kicks in).  Some puzzles I may have tried to batter through but I had to give up quickly to ensure I didn't lose progress - which is just a plain bad design decision.\nNot recommended.","timestamp_created":1606172452,"timestamp_updated":1606172452,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47826087474822998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwytTV+/UCdtmSsAI="}
