    review: 'This DLC reveals some background facts about the main game, especially
      in the extras. So I put a spoiler warning here if you haven''t played the main
      game. It is a pure graphic novel with some extras, so it does not influence
      the main story in any way.

      From what I gathered, it happens after Gijin is revealed, but before he attacks
      the capital. It likely happens around chapter 8 of 12.

      A special insight are the Mini-Events, especially the one of the Harem Dream
      of the priest implies that the good ending - the alternate one - seems to be
      in fact the canon ending, as seen by one of the women from the good ending being
      part of said harem.

      The other is the fact that the merchant was in a certain city before, know for
      its open mentality towards the world prior to the warring states era. He also
      met his assistant beforehand as she is present there. It is therefore likely,
      that Saki came from the area of Sakai. I still guess the merchant is either
      from the Hansa or the Netherlands, since the hair colour is more prominent with
      the German states and not Great Britain... and surely not Portuguese. The Netherlands
      were quite involved in Asia at that time. So greetings to the Netherlands!


      The rest of the story you have to find out for yourselves. Sadly the story is
      neither diverse nor consequential as your only free choice is the first one.
      All the other are do or die... so don''t expect a deep narration.


      Overall I only regret having bought it one day before it was halved by 50%.
      Then again I got the main game in a free bundle during a donation, so I gladly
      paid the 50% more. For all that enjoy a little novel, feel free to grab it.
      For those that expect a game with deeper choice mechanics... don''t. I liked
      it.'
