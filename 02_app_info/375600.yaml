    about_the_game: 'Air Brawl provides interesting and creative ways for the player
      to destroy their enemies.  Instead of just damage, weapons have many different
      attributes they can afflict on their targets. Some weapons slow the enemy, some
      disable their steering and some damage them over time. And these are just a
      few.<h2 class="bb_tag">Class based</h2>The game features 6 planes with varying
      roles and loadouts.   <br>  <br>The planes are:  <br>  <br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>The
      Fatbird which excels at close  quarters combat and setting up traps.   <br>  <br></li><li>The
      Sharp Shooter which utilizes high accuracy weapons and high mobility to get
      the upper hand  <br><br></li><li>The Witch Doctor which specialises in dealing
      damage over time area denial.    <br>  <br></li><li>The Viking which overpowers
      its foes with its high health and strong belief that hammers make great anti
      aircraft weapons. <br>  <br></li><li>The Cyber Priest which has great supportive
      abilities. Either healing its team mates or disabling enemies, setting them
      up as easy targets.  <br>  <br></li><li>The Elder which is the newest addition
      to Air Brawl. It has high burst damage as well as lots of crowd controls like
      entangling roots or magnetic fields.</li></ul>'

    review: "I hate writing a negative review about a game, but in this case I see\
      \ strong potential in a yet unfinished and ignored game. Landfall Games has\
      \ released two other games after this one and the last update for this game\
      \ came out more than a year ago, so we can safely assume that Landfall Games\
      \ has given it up, in favor of new projects.\nI've bought Air Brawl just a few\
      \ weeks after it came out and payed about 6\u20AC, now it's free. Air Brawl\
      \ by itself is a very fun dogfight game which provides different planes with\
      \ all different loadouts. In addition, there are several maps and modes, which\
      \ make the game versatile and not boring at all. The graphics are simple and\
      \ yet nice to look at, the music is fine too and doesn't annoy you when you\
      \ fly. The tutorial is ok, but I wish there would be a way to practice shooting\
      \ at planes instead of slowly hovering candies.\nI'm a Mac-user, so I and others\
      \ can confirm that achievements don't work at all. Also I'm not able to switch\
      \ between the continents and each time have to restart the game to get it on\
      \ \"Europe\". Creating an own match seems difficult too and there are almost\
      \ no people hosting one.\nI hope Landfall Games will return to Air Brawl and\
      \ fix it..."
