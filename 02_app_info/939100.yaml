    review: The game is a lot of fun especially with friends. I can see why people
      are upset with the lack of content but for what it is its pretty good. Controls
      are fairly straight forward more so if you play MOBAS. The character design
      and play styles are really unique and fun, just wish we had some more lore to
      them. A couple more maps and maybe an endless mode would be a lot of fun but
      I dont mind the devs taking their time making the game better.
