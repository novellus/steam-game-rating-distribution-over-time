This kind of control is always confusing for me. You can opt to use mouse, like I did, to click the control in the right-hand corner.\n\nYour task is to grab all the gems, then head for the revealed exit. As some paths are usually locked after visiting once or twice, you need to plan the route beforehand.\n\n[h1]Trial-and-error in puzzles[/h1]\n\nThe exit is not always where you think it will be, and as it only reveals itself after gathering all the gems. This exposes a trial-and-error element.\n\nAlso, there's no zoom. Some levels are big enough that you have to try twice or thrice before getting it right because not knowing where the exit appears or where a previously hidden path appears.\n\n[h1]Repetitive puzzles[/h1]\n\nSome puzzles seem like retakes of some previous ones. That said, there are a couple of really nice puzzles that took a minute or in one case ten to complete.\n\nThe whole game lasted about 45 minutes for me. An alright puzzler in my opinion.\n\n[h1]Free vs. paid? [/h1]\n\nSteam version has 10 puzzles more than the free version. I got it on sale, so I felt it was appropriate, particularly as an additional support for the dev. That said, it's prudent to wait for a sale nevertheless.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9997062/]~Twistorian Curator~[/url]","timestamp_created":1594919863,"timestamp_updated":1594920290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.632669746875762939","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7YiqrPMCe8TZlQI="}
