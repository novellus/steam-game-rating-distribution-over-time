Game runs really bad, I felt like I was getting around 20fps on a 1080ti\n2. Lazy modeling, most of the models seem to be copy pasted and the scaling not adjusted so some models are way too big, some models just float in mid-air, have seen some just glitching out and spinning randomly, multiple identical NPC models used in different parts of the map\n3. There is no gameplay, the main point of the game seems to be 'defeat the zombies and rescue the hostages' but nothing actually happens, you don't get any points or rewards, you don't event need to rescue anything, theres no point to anything\n4. No story either, lack of story and gameplay means there's really no motivation to play at all\n5. Game has code which sends your computer's mac address to a chinese server. I'm not sure if the code is used or not but it's not a good look\n6. Dev has promised updates on the community forum but hasn't delivered anything since release 1 year ago\n\nNote: I played on the rift, didn't have any issues despite the game being advertised as vive only\nNote 2: I'm not refunding because it's only a couple of bucks and no matter who it is it's good to support VR devs","timestamp_created":1544169919,"timestamp_updated":1544169919,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oeLsw+cCf5vOtAE="}
