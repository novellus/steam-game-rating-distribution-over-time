    review: "The Mojo series is a R18 series of games based on 2048, a sliding block\
      \ puzzle game. This review will cover Mojo: Hanako and it's Deluxe edition.\
      \ Mojo: Hanako is technically a free demo or sneak peak of what the Mojo series\
      \ has to offer and as such there is not much to say about it. The game has two\
      \ major features. A series of progressively difficulty 2048 puzzle boards and\
      \ artwork of an anime style woman who progressively undresses as you advanced\
      \ through the game and that's about it. There are a few twists and new rules\
      \ to help make the game a bit more complex, but nothing much.\n\nThe music is\
      \ nice for it's minimalist style and the controls are easy to understand. After\
      \ playing a few other 2048 games I can tell you that this type of game can range\
      \ from casual to just outright impossible depending on the board and the developers\
      \ programming. 2048 is such an heavy RNG puzzle style that sometimes it feels\
      \ more like failing than solving a puzzle. Thankfully Mojo: Hanako is very much\
      \ a intro to intermediate game where a new player of 2048 can learn the game\
      \ and still find success. \n\nHanako will offer you about 30 minutes to an hour\
      \ of simple game-play with, in my opinion, nice adult artwork for free. I've\
      \ said it before but I do like the artist and their work so this is purely just\
      \ my opinion. This is also a free game and honestly giving this game a bad review,\
      \ when it's taken nothing from you but a few minutes of your time, just... I\
      \ don't know. It's not like its those religious scam artists you meet on colleges\
      \ who offer you 'free' books but than demand a $20 donation. \n\nThe only way\
      \ this game will take your money is if you buy the Collectors/Deluxe versions\
      \ and those versions make it very clear they they are for supporting the developer\
      \ and nothing else. They add no extra game-play elements, but do offer you some\
      \ different in game artwork. Seems like a waste of few bucks, but again, I like\
      \ the artwork so getting more of it is nice. \n\nActual downsides, Hanako doesn't\
      \ offer a level select after you finish it like the other games do, a proper\
      \ gallery mode would be nice in these games, and thing that I've noticed that\
      \ bothers me. Mojo Hanako, XXX, and Mia have dev support deluxe modes that if\
      \ bought offer new artwork, but the new art replaces the old art meaning you\
      \ can no longer view the original game art unless you uninstall your Deluxe\
      \ DLC which is a huge hassle. Again, the need for a proper gallery mode would\
      \ be nice, but the game is old so that's unlikely. If you like 2048 or if you\
      \ like Gal style it's a fine game."
