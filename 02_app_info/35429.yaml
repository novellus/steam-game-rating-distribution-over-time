    review: 'The Steampunk Character Pack 2 is yet another in the line of character
      skin DLC packs for [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/1250]Killing
      Floor[/url], in which only two of the skins even vaguely appeal to me personally.
      Now that Killing Floor 2 is out, there really isn''t an excuse for most of these
      packs to be 8 dollars each. This is strictly for hardcore freaks of the first
      game with money to spend.


      Strangely, this one doesn''t seem to be fully registered on the Steam storefront
      as DLC for KF1; most notably the purple DLC box on the store pages of all other
      downloadable content isn''t present.'
