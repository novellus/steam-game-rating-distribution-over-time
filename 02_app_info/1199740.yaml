    review: 'I just bought Pinata Attack for $0.51 to get my $5 off of $30 in the
      summer sale. In the first 10 seconds of playing it, I knew that it was worth
      the 50 cents, if not $4!

      This is a simple but engaging game that lets you have fun with someone else,
      with crazy Pinata physics and upbeat music.

      I have multiple monitors, and just want to warn anyone else: your mouse can
      accidentally slide off the screen and the Pinata gets stuck. This is fixed by
      centering your mouse again.

      [h1]Overall, a great little game, and something I recommend you try out![/h1]'
