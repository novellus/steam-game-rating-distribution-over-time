There are free scripts such as NIAutoclicker that do much the same thing.\nThe extra consumables are not worth paying for since you get them frequently in-game.\nYou can get 2 of 3 in-game taskmasters fairly easily by saving Rubies in the game and just playing over time.\n\nThe taskmasters will mostly appeal to idle players.\nAqua The Dragon is currently priced at $10 and for \"Limited Time\" until November 21st, the net proceeds to go to the Extra Life charity drive to support Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.\n\n\nIf your goal is to:\n- Support the Devs and the CMNH charity, then I vote YES. \n- If your goal is to get Phat Loot or make significant progress, then I vote NO.","timestamp_created":1542294307,"timestamp_updated":1542295025,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.720321178436279297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41s78i+cCcJrorgE="}
