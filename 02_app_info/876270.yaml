    review: 'I''d be lying if I said I hadn''t had this game wishlisted for a long
      time. I honestly thought it would cost a bit more too. The original trailer
      was vague, but now that I''ve played, the trailer explained everything in serious
      depth and detail. Fun game, can''t wait to see what else comes out of it. Workshop
      would be cool to see too.


      Controls feel a bit wonky at first, but they end up making sense. I hell of
      a lot of fun, especially for the price. I think there is a ton of potential
      here and excited to see it.


      ''SHOUT'' is a bit of an ear rape, sooo now I know not to play this at work
      with speakers up. Otherwise I love the game.'
