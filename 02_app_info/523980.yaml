      \ attacking force, providing pure psychopathic fury and claws that can render\
      \ armour utterly useless.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main dilemma for a Necromantic\
      \ Coach is how to replace his more specialized players when they get pounded\
      \ into the ground, never to rise again. Zombies are easy to find, shambling\
      \ around any old graveyard in the dead of night, but the more useful players,\
      \ such as the Flesh Golems and Werewolves, can cost a hefty sum to replace."
