      \ /><br><br>Sense - \u4E0D\u7965\u7684\u9884\u611F: A Cyberpunk Ghost Story\
      \ is a 2.5D game inspired by Clock Tower and Fatal Frame. With careful attention\
      \ to pacing, atmosphere and storytelling, Sense hopes to return the horror genre\
      \ to its roots; celebrating the slow, fearful creep of dread instead of relying\
      \ on over the top action and jump scares. The ghosts - as glitches on our reality\
      \ - act as spiritual and paranormal threats, not monsters to be killed. The\
      \ horror of our story comes from atmosphere and storytelling, not loud sound\
      \ and artificial effects.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1120560/extras/story.png?t=1599152709\"\
      \ /><br><br>In 2083 Neo Hong Kong, a young woman named Mei-Lin Mak is dragged\
      \ into a maelstrom of supernatural horror. As she peers deeper into a century\
      \ old mystery, Mei will be forced to question her perception of reality and\
      \ whether she trusts her cybernetic eyes. Under the neon lights of a cyberpunk\
      \ dystopia, the ruins of the 'Chong Sing Apartments' hides a bloody mystery\
      \ illuminated by both the traditions of Chinese folklore, and the innovations\
      \ of the industrial future. If there is any hope of escaping this nightmare,\
      \ Mei-Lin must explore this complex, piecing together the stories of 14 lost\
      \ souls, and discover the truth of her own family curse.<br><br><img src=\"\

      \ of the world around them in order to progress. Some items may not be visible\
      \ until specific chains are completed, and some items may be hidden from Mei's\
      \ cybernetic eyes at all times, as if spirited away by the ghosts stalking her.\

      notes: 'Sense does not contain adult or explicit content (there is no full nudity),
        but features skimpy/semi-revealing outfits, and mature themes. There are references
        to alcohol, tobacco/drugs, and topics which some may find distressing, such
        as murder, suicide, and abuse. References to more mature "themes" such as
        stripping exist in game. Contains visceral horror elements which includes
        disturbing imagery, blood/gore, and violent character deaths. '

    short_description: A 2.5D horror game inspired by Clock Tower and Fatal Frame,
      mixing cyberpunk with traditional Cantonese folklore. With careful attention
      to pacing, atmosphere and storytelling, Sense hopes to return the horror genre
      to its roots by celebrating visceral horror and the slow, fearful creep of dread.
