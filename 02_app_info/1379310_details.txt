So with 2 upgrades bought it would be 2^2 = x4. This multiplier is added before exponential floor scaling is applied. Keep in mind that the soft-prestige multiplier is applied to points gained, not (directly) to stats gained, as they increase in price.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn short, the upgrade increases in effect during your playthrough.
