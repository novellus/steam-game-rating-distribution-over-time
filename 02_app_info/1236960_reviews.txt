Do they move on or become a threat we have to deal with when we least expect it? Much as I want to say it's not likely to come true... its certainly a scary thought and I thank the creators of the game to give us a taste without a heavy price. My rambling aside; the art style is very beautiful which makes it fun to experience while playing.","timestamp_created":1606369227,"timestamp_updated":1606369227,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j6bEgfYCdPLYsQI="}
