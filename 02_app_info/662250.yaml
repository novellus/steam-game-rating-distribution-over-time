    review: "[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33401179/]Follow my\
      \ curator page for more recommendations![/url][/quote]\n[b]This Full Game Upgrade\
      \ DLC is not needed to play bot matches.[/b] \n\nYou get two additional modes,\
      \ a bot mode where you can pick the mode and level to play on, as well as bot\
      \ difficulty (really this only changes how much damage the bots do), as well\
      \ as a wave-based mode, however it is not an infinite wave mode so once you\
      \ complete 15 waves (first level, second is 20 waves, +5 waves each level) it\
      \ just ends and you're sent to the next of five levels total. There is very\
      \ barely a plot going on in the background where people on the radio tell you\
      \ stuff and you just sit there listening while shooting zombies and running\
      \ around the map chasing down bubbles that protect you. It's dumb, not fun,\
      \ and the voice acting is pretty awful.\n\n[b]Now why is this DLC sort of a\
      \ scam?[/b] Because the main draw is going to be the bot mode, since there is\
      \ very clearly no one playing this game. However, [b]you can do a bot match\
      \ without owning the upgrade DLC[/b] by searching for a match for 2 minutes\
      \ (when matchmaking finally gives up). It will then throw you into a bot match\
      \ (you can tell they're all bots because on the scoreboard they have no ping\
      \ and extremely dumb). \n\nSure, you can't choose the mode or level, but it\
      \ saves you from paying for a hilariously overpriced $20 DLC that only really\
      \ offers the ability to choose the map/mode, as well as a painfully boring and\
      \ short wave-based mode."
