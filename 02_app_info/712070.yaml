    review: "Pretty unique, interesting and well waved game. \nYou won't find any\
      \ such game (well, there are games from same dev following similar path or alternate\
      \ story lines / alternate universes)\nGame is story driven and pretty much entertaining\
      \ and enriching.\nRPG system is straightforward. You gain Ability point, that\
      \ you distribute among your basic stats, plus you can choose skills, based on\
      \ your main character (Warrior, Wizard, Rogue) \nYou can save anytime (and you\
      \ should save as often as possible)"
