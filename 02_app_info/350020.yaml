      \ since I reviewed Rage of Bahamut and none of them hooked me the way it did;\
      \ yet The Gate is on the verge of doing just that. It actually lacks some of\
      \ Bahamut\u2019s central features, including factions and clan support, but\
      \ whatever arcane m\xE9lange of art, audio, accessibility, difficulty, and pacing\
      \ it is that lets a game bury its hooks deep into a player, The Gate has it.\
      \ If you\u2019re a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to try this game\
      \ \u2013 and if you\u2019re not, it\u2019s a pretty good place to start.\u201D\

      \ an experience that\u2019s fun and extremely addictive. The look of The Gate\

    review: It's gone.  It's been over for years.  There is no server.  There is no
      support website.  There are also no news posts about it being closed, but all
      there is left to this game now is watching "Verifying Credentials" indefinitely
      because there is no server to verify anything with.  Other portals have removed
      this game from their library, but not Steam.  Steam just refuses to tell you
      it's a dead end.
