      \ class=\"bb_tag\">Background</h2>Some may call this propaganda. Others may\
      \ say it's gloating. While those assumptions admittedly may have a shred of\
      \ truth to them, my hope is that most see this game as I do ... as a fun, light-hearted\
      \ but sincere salute to Donald J. Trump's amazing and successful run for the\
      \ U.S. presidency. However people see it, this was just something I had to create\
      \ ... so I did!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Game</h2>This &quot;mini&quot; game consists\
      \ of 6 \u201Cbattles\u201D between Donald J. Trump and a handful of the enemies\
      \ he faced during his campaign, namely:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Fake\
      \ News<br></li><li> Southern Border<br></li><li> Protesters <br></li><li> Hollywood<br></li><li>\
      \ The Swamp<br></li><li> &quot;Crooked&quot; Hillary</li></ul><br>The gameplay\
      \ is meant to be more of an entertaining experience than a hard-core gamer challenge\
      \ but I've tried to make it a decent mix of both. <br><br>With each battle win\
      \ players can choose to upgrade their health (HP) for future battles or get\
      \ more \u201CWinning Coins\u201D to unlock additional hats and outfits.<br><br>The\
      \ first battle is free and if you enjoy it you can purchase the other 5 via\
      \ the DLC:<br><a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/676080/Super_POTUS_Trump_The_Full_Game/\"\
