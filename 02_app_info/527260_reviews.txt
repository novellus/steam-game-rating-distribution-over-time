I almost forgot about this review that I was originally gonna do months ago when I released, but eh, whatever. I was going to make a review video for the game, but chose not to. With this said, here's my review based on things I can recall knowing that the game hasn't been really updated since it's release.\n\n-I wasn't expecting too much considering Swamp Sim was a thing, but it actually wasn't all that bad. The story itself was pretty good, but not really the main focus of the game. It's mostly just a bunch of talk about the beasts that live in close proximity of each other and apparently never ran into each other.\n\n-The gameplay was okay for the most part, but I was unable to complete the game. From what I remember, there was a mission where I had to go visit a lake or something, and my compass guided me to a giant rock wall where a lever slot was supposed to be. Didn't see the slot at all, and I scaled that whole damn wall for an hour while also getting killed off by the stamp-faced lookin' ass. Pretty annoying when the game grew kinda stale on me with backtracking and certain repeating enemy encounters that were almost impossible to avoid. Also, the compass had spasms for extremely long periods of time, which was frustrating for trying to travel.\n\n-The audio was actually pretty well made, so I don't really have much to say other than that. Plus pretty good voice acting to boot.\n\n-The enemies at least had some variety, and I especially loved the cemetary demon. As much as I hate to admit it, the cheap little loud-as-balls jumpscare got me, and it didn't feel random because I just wasn't paying attention to my surroundings. When it wasn't in the cemetary and it chased me out of the blue, that actually scared the shit outta me to see it creeping right behind me. As for the rest: the wolf got me a few times, but got old soon enough; the stamp-face got me once, then it wore off on me; those monsters in the large rocks were somewhat scary, but it became annoying when they could chase me pretty far beyond the rocks and still actively look for me in the far off forest by the lake; and yeah, that's all I gotta say about them. The environment was alright, but could've been a bit more insightful on directions when the compass would start to spasm.\n\nLurk is a game that isn't bad, but isn't exactly good. There's obvious issues that need to be resolved that haven't yet, like the compass directions being unclear, buggy, etc. If you think you can get farther than me, and I was only missing that one mission because of that bug, then shoot, you can give the game a shot. I'm only giving this a Not Recommended because this game's barely been touched upon after it's release on Steam to fix these issues that annoyed me pretty well. With this said, I hope ya'll have a lovely day.","timestamp_created":1524801981,"timestamp_updated":1524801981,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458776026964187622","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1525029210,"developer_response":"I'm sorry to hear that you weren't satisfied with Lurk - nothing is more important to me than making sure you're having fun with it. I put out several updates since Lurk's launch to address many of the bugs that were originally in the game, but it looks like more have appeared that need to be resolved. With that being said an update is on the way that will adjust gameplay, fix bugs, and make the experience better overall. Thanks for the review!"}],"cursor":"AoJ4pPnRguMCdZ6OnwE="}
