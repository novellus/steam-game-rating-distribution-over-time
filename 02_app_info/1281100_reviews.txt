Murk is a side-scroller where you have to find power ups to regain health and ammo. It also has an automatic save point system. However, when you are low on health at the moment a save point is activated, and you die a few seconds later in the level from a single hit, you respawn at the last save point but still with your low health, causing you to die over and over again at the same point in the level, basically blocking you from progressing in the game. I played at normal (i.e. the lowest) difficulty.","timestamp_created":1601760251,"timestamp_updated":1601760251,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1601923213,"developer_response":"This bug has been fixed!
