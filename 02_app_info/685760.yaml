    review: "Although quite cheaply produced, this is an engaging and therapeutic\
      \ puzzle game that works pretty well and just needs to be given a bit of a chance.\
      \ It is not a match 3 in the traditional sense, where you swap adjacent tiles,\
      \ but where you drag tiles from the sides to fill the inner grid. The colours,\
      \ that get ushered in gradually, are bright and very well-chosen. \n\nThe game-play\
      \ is a step-up from the automatic and (sometimes) brainless moves required in\
      \ a normal Match 3 and actually requires a bit of thought. It's quite a nice\
      \ companion piece to the also neglected T-Kara Puzzles which offers another\
      \ innovative twist to this (sub) genre."
