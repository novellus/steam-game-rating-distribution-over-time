    review: "Didn't deserve all the hate it got at launch. There are a few characters\
      \ to play,  with different intros and styles. There are also upgrades to purchase.\
      \ \n\nThe gist of the game revolves around trying to kill 100 enemies on each\
      \ lvl in the shortest amount of time. At first you are just trying to stay alive\
      \ but once you master one of the mechanics of properly killing them it really\
      \ becomes a frantic score run.  Kinda reminds me of The Club. Not the driving\
      \ game but the murder score one. \n\nThat being said once you figure things\
      \ out you will quickly blast through all the content.\n\nUnfortunately like\
      \ many vr games it's going to rot in EA purgatory for all time, so buyer beware.\
      \ \n\n"
