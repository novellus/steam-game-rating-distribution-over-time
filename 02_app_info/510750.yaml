    review: "This visual novel is greatly underrated. It seems to me that many reviewers\
      \ compare it to AAA-tier visual novels, which in this case is unfair, or nitpick\
      \ it. For a first visual novel, the amateur team has done a good job. After\
      \ a relatively weak start, the story picks up and the characters' personalities\
      \ (although a little bit clich\xE9) are interesting enough to catch your attention.\
      \ However the male characters are pretty bland and one-dimensional with one\
      \ or two exceptions. This VN stops after Act I, which leaves you to want more.\
      \ It's unfortunate that the ending is very abrupt, I would have preferred a\
      \ partial closure. Instead all the plot points are left hanging, and I'm sure\
      \ they are continued in the upcoming sequel.\n\n\nThe art is top notch, the\
      \ BGM is forgettable but doesn't sound like it's out of place. The script is\
      \ decent enough for me to recommend it. Nonetheless the comparisons to Katawa\
      \ Shoujo are justified, I can definitely see the similarities. Even though Driftwood\
      \ pales in comparison, I suggest you should give it a go. I don't really get\
      \ all this hate towards the game. Ok, i still haven't seen everything, but what\
      \ i saw honestly isn't that bad. Most important part of VN is writing and this\
      \ one is decent at least, with some good moments. Worst part is the begining.\
      \ It's highly unbelievable and it feels cheap, but it gets better.\nArt isn't\
      \ perfect, I've seen better, but I also have seen much, much worse many times.\
      \ Artist who drew characters can get very good soon, if she/he still practice.\n\
      Yes, I have to agree with some people that it kinda feels like Katawa Shoujo\
      \ rip off, but is it that bad if you get your ideas from the best?\nI really\
      \ wanted to see how it ends so i hope one day i'll get another chapter"
