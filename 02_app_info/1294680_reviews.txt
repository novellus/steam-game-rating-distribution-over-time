I have not completed the game YET, but I feel that I have encountered everything that I need to make a decent review.\nFor starters: Most of the bugs complained about are patched out at this point. I didn't encounter any major bugs or issues. Occasionally the fades to black when the scene changed would cause a half-second lag, but I've encountered this in other games as well and it hardly detracts from gameplay. Ok, on to my thoughts about the game.\nThe art is pretty. REALLY PRETTY. I would put it up there as one of the most visually appealing VNs not coming from a major company like Otomate. The cgs were lovely and the sprites were very pleasant to look at as well.\n\nThe story was... meh. I can't say it was particularly amazing or particularly bad. There were some points that definitely caught my interest, but sadly not many of them were followed up on. I'd say it falls into the same hole as many other games with about the same length: Too little time to get the story across. With a little work I think this game could be great, but sadly it didn't really get that time. One big gripe I see with most of the reviews for this game is the politics which were... honestly not a big deal to me. If you are an American liberal, I can totally understand why the game could offend you (since it does take a fair few jabs) but otherwise... it's honestly more funny than anything. It'll be all serious and then go \"Oh those damn Liberals\" And I can't help but laugh at how random it is. So really I can't say it detracted from my experience that much, especially since it really didn't tie into the narrative at all, in the sense that they could just as easily be right wing, or any other political party tbh. It was just there, easy to ignore, or laugh at.\n\nThe characters were... decent. I loved their designs, but some of their personalities were a bit lacking, and a tad inconsistent. Even so, they were likable enough that I was interested in how things would turn out for them.\nOther than that, the music was fine, the sound effects were fine, if not a bit silly at times, and that's about it.\n\nIn conclusion, if you want this game, get it one sale. It's good in some ways, meh in others.\n[spoiler]On a side note Ron is 100% based off of Katsuya Honda from Fruits Basket. Which pleases me more than it should.[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1609725834,"timestamp_updated":1609732724,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575835466384887695","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0oLj5fYCf9KhwAI="}
