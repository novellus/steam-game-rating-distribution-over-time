Some scenarios can be completed in 15 minutes.  Other are more challenging.. There are some drawbacks though:\na) missile troops have an unlimited supply of missiles making them rather too powerful,  Historically, unless you were in fortified positions you were largely limited to what you could carry.\nb) sometimes you attack an enemy unit in the flank but don't get the flank attack bonus,\nc) Roman legionaries threw their pilum (a type of spear) before combat and then used their gladius (short sword).  This doesn't seem to be reflected in game combat; the first time legionaries are in combat they get no bonus for the pilum,\nI'm not sure how accurate it is historically.  Mind you for the price I'm not complaining.","timestamp_created":1602089926,"timestamp_updated":1602089926,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw14eAgvUCe665pgI="}
