(in the [u].../Program Files(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Sanctum2/mp3[/u] and [u].../common/Sanctum2/wav[/u] folders respectively).\n\nFor anyone confused about with mismatched track numbers: \"[b]27.

With excellent audio quality. I definitely recommend giving it a listen on youtube or something even if you aren't planning on buying it.","timestamp_created":1549899055,"timestamp_updated":1581468670,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg5u4m/ACfPbSugE="}
