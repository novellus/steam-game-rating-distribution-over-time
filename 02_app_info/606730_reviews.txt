To conclude, it's worth getting for a play-through at a low sale  price in my opinion.","timestamp_created":1609720168,"timestamp_updated":1609721135,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+ee25fYCe5qfwAI="}
