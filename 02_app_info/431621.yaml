    review: "Bought this to provide Cocoa a carrot.\n\nThe artbook itself is pretty\
      \ neat. Going over all the full 116 pages was kinda cool as you get insight\
      \ on the characters and the development of the game. Also that Daki kinda hott......................................\
      \ Uhh you can also change the music while viewing.\n\nPortrait viewer was kinda\
      \ fun to mess around with but there's nothing really to do once you go through\
      \ it all.\n\nYou get cut content and more stuff to do overall. New boss rush\
      \ type beat modes and unused levels with the addition of a boss. \n\nSolid artbook\
      \ and exceeded my expectations. Recommend to those that want to support this\
      \ game, it's devs, and just like the art and visuals."
