    review: I love the idea of Soko Loco Deluxe but the controls make it a hard thing
      to recommend. The challenges needed for achievements are also extremely difficult,
      and I have not completed enough of the game to say if they are reasonably feasible.
      As this game uses seeds to setup your map, it is feasible to figure out something
      that will work consistently, though I have not looked into this enough.
