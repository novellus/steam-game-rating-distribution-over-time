      absolute destruction of the whole dang universe.<br><br>Through a myriad of
      settings familiar and strange, you will collect as much <strong>junk</strong>
      as you can find, while beating off hordes of boring zombies, mutated mouth-breathers,
      and worse stinky horrors yet.<br><br>Armed with a genuine homerun baseball bat,
      you'll have to pull out all the stops to survive and collect all the precious
      resources in a level. <br>Our teleporters take time to charge up - get creative
      until we're able to get you out!<br><br>-Set traps and make barricades using
      your environment. Every object can be moved, repaired, or destroyed.<br>-Use
      smaller objects as improvised weapons and projectiles. Send a chair flying into
      a crowd, instant chaos.<br>-Exchange <strong>junk</strong> for better weapons
      and customize your appearance with unlockable outfits.<br>-Multiple ways to
      win! Collect all <strong>junk</strong> for a faster ride home, barricade yourself
      like a turtle, or run like a madman.<br>-Level layouts remain static, but everything
      inside of them changes between playthroughs. Each run will play differently.<br><br>README:<br><br><strong>Keyboard
