It's entirely optional and easy to ignore.\n\nThe AKSU doesn't have enough identity on its own to make it a really interesting option compared to guns that come with the base game like the Bastard or even the AK74 rifle.\n\nRanger mode as a difficulty is basically broken too. It seems more like an afterthought, as mutants are a little bit too fragile against bullets in this difficulty mode, especially considering they only seem to be doing Hard mode levels of damage to you. Perhaps the biggest problem with Ranger mode is that it takes out the survival-horror inventory aspect out of the game entirely. In Metro 2033 you could check your ammunition inventory totals by examining your objectives clipboard (which took time), but in this iteration of Ranger Mode that's all gone. So basically, the main character forgets how to count in this game mode. Damn shame. So yeah, forget about this DLC.","timestamp_created":1368739063,"timestamp_updated":1398914015,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":39,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.610849320888519287","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48bvx2sUCeIHJAg=="}
