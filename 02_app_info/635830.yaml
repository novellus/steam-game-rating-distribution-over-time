      \ we have (finally!) the option to enlarge the text and change the background\
      \ color (white) to a black background with white text. \n\nFRAN\xC7AIS:\nUne\
      \ bonne histoire, mais elle m\u2019a d\xE9\xE7ue par son manque d\u2019interactivit\xE9\
      . La plupart des choix vous font progresser de la m\xEAme fa\xE7on. Au moins,\
      \ nous avons (enfin!) l\u2019option d\u2019agrandir le texte et celui de changer\
      \ la couleur du fond (blanc) pour un fond noir avec texte blanc."
