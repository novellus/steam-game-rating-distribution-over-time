It adds one new character - Chandra, who the game describes as \"very advanced\" but is basically just a melee character who can actually do damage unlike the core game's Seraphine - and a new dungeon level that you can access near the end of the game, right before going to the final level of the dungeon.\n\nIf you're going to be playing Strangers of the Power, I recommend this, even though I still don't really recommend picking up the base game.","timestamp_created":1586879998,"timestamp_updated":1586880184,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.590066194534301758","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7L/bvPECdNnfgAI="}
