I really enjoy the difficulty level and unique challenges/mechanics that I encountered while playing. I really appreiciate the devs constant updating of them game. For example, When the game launched it was pretty short with not a lot of features and content. Now there is a pause menu, main menu, saving and loading, and three new chapters. Overall, very fun and worth it.","timestamp_created":1608661775,"timestamp_updated":1608661775,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qdbtxfYCcdSdvAI="}
