    review: i played the free game maybe like 200 hours 5 years ago, hence i feel
      the need to recommend it, but while i love the world, ships, etc the game seems
      like it hasnt been updated alot. i expected some accesibility or basic options
      for that matter, mod support, fps stayed at 30 for some reason, but its so good
      to get to play this game again after forgetting it existed. the weapons and
      randomness is kinda great and i always forget how time passes
