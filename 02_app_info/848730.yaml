    review: I have mixed feelings about this one. Mostly the puzzles were not too
      challenging and that is fine if you just want a casual game to waste some time.
      It's a very short game which you can play in one sitting, probably 1-2 hours
      at most. I quite liked the art style which reminded me a bit of the Rusty Lake
      games which I loved. Now for the annoying part! The game ended really abruptly,
      I couldn't get back in to finish it, there were things I had not yet done and
      screens shown on the Store page that I never saw, so why did the game just end
      like that? I suppose I could start over but what would be the point? It would
      probably just end abruptly again. I'm a little bit miffed at this.
