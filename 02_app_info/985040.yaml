    about_the_game: 'Play as familiar characters as you take on a dystopian world
      occupied by NPCs masquerading as real living humans in a 3D First Person Shooter.  You
      have been dropped into NPC Square, a walled off quarantine zone.  You can also
      fight the horde in the new NPC HQ map. This is a humorous, satirical game where
      you fight endless hordes of &quot;NPCs&quot; hell bent on destroying the eccentric
      and unique playable characters.  You observe the programming of unaware NPCs
      by the NPC New Organization and attempt to destroy as many bots as you can to
      help free the world.  Said saviors of the world include: The Bad Orange Man,
      Wojak/Feel Guy, Chad, Virgin, The Doomer, a 30 yr old Boomer, a Brainlet, and
      a Zoomer.'
