Because it simply makes LIRR more diverse. You can operate the Budd in same timetable as M7, in all three car setups. (For those who don't know how to change the car setups, you can do it via \"Q\" - livery switch.) The cab looks nice, controls seem to work properly and only one thing you need to be aware of is the door opening system being blocked via brake settings. \nAnyway, if you like LIRR, buy this one! \n\n7/10","timestamp_created":1603394568,"timestamp_updated":1603394568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9O/wqPUCdNa9qQI="}
