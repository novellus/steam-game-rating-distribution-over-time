The whole game takes about 15 minutes to play through. There is no story, there are no puzzles. The game blatantly copied the basic gimmick of the Stanley Parable but with absolutely no effort put in from anyone involved or any of the things that made that game interesting. There is nothing good about this game. I am very dissapointed in Valve for allowing the creators of this game to charge for it and will be refunding the game.\n\nIn response to developer feedback:\n@Mwester I understand you aren't some AAA game studio. I think this game has some promise, you should definitely continue working on games, but as you said. This is a hobby. Its great that you are following something you enjoy, but I personally would advise you not to charge for your games at this point. Having your content available to all would allow you to get more of an audience, and also, to be frank, this game is not worth money. I am sorry for my harsh review, but as long as you are charging money for your games I think people should know what they are buying, because I feel it is not apparant from your store page exactly what this game is.","timestamp_created":1527109461,"timestamp_updated":1559427163,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550108730792999268","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1527176327,"developer_response":"Hi Staves, I'm sorry if you didn't enjoy the game. I make games as a hobby, balancing time between that, a job, and having a life is hard. If you really did not like the experience, go ahead and refund it. While you are at it, how about you take the time to learn to make your own video game that meets all of your personal standards and expectations..."}],"cursor":"AoJ4t8TGiusCe9H9oAE="}
