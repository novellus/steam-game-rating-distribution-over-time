    review: 'Game was fun, but compared to Hidden Folks, it just didn''t have the
      same charm. The big plus to this game was color but I feel that detracted from
      the entire experience of clicking an object and having that object move something
      or trigger something to occur that helps you find a character you''re looking
      for. Mostly enjoyable experience other than the fact that most of the objects
      were just blended in to the background or only a very specific part of them
      was showing.


      Would still recommend this game, but only if you play Hidden Folks first'
