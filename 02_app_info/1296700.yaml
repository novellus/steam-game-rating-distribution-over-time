    short_description: Christmas. Christmas never changes. Soon those overzealous
      little freaks will swarm the city led by that bearded maniac. But this time,
      we fight back. Inspired by Zombies Ate My Neighbors and Beavis&amp;Butthead's
      heavy metal comedy, this is twin-stick mayhem like you've never experienced
      before.

    review: '**Also wanna add, the music is killer. Fits the game so well!**


      This game is so good. From the cool graphics to the mechanics! Slaying elves
      this time of the year is something I always wanted to do and now I can within
      this game!


      The overdrive weapons are amazing, Each of them are really unique and cool!
      The weapons you get, upgrade and find better ones makes the game go at a good
      pace!


      And I love the distraction items. The TV to the blowup dolls!


      but lets not leave out the best part (To me)... The headbutting! Or as I like
      to call it, Headbanging!


      This game is well worth the price and you will get lots of fun out of it :)'
