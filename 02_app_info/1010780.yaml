    review: Wings of Glass is a pretty short game (I finished it in only 2 hours),
      but it's actually a pretty great game. Most of the levels are about puzzle solving
      and platforming with very little combat. The platforming requires surprisingly
      tight execution, and the final battle requires an uncommon strategy :) I got
      this game on sale, and would absolutely recommend picking it up if you've got
      a few hours to spare.
