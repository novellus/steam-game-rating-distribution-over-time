The influences are clear but they come together to make an RPG greater than the sum of its parts.\nYou have a battle system that's a mix of megaman battle network and Super Mario RPG,\nAn overworld reminiscent of earthbound, with plenty of things to find and puzzles to solve, (think Golden Sun without the powers)\nA group of refreshing, likeable characters,\nExcellent music. Lots of fun, bouncy chiptunes backed by sampled instruments.\n\nThings I liked:\n- It was always worth solving that one extra puzzle for a chest. Found items never felt throwaway.\n- The sheer amount of \"juice\" in the battle system, and how smooth the UI is. \n- Enemy designs, in particular the bosses, were always fun.\n- About 13-14 hours in, and probably nearing the final 5th of the game. A nice length that doesn't overstay its welcome.\n\nThings I didn't like as much:\n- MSI Afterburner overlay crashes the game on launch.\n- It felt like the timing was very slightly later than it should be on attacks. Could this be down to the timings being set up to compensate for a 60hz input polling rate? I'm playing on a 144hz monitor with a framerate likely as high.\n- The fire, lightning, and alchemy mages carved useful niches in the party, but not so much the others. The others didn't really have the utility to justify the lower offense (not so much the paint mage maybe)\n\nI'll be keeping an eye on if there's a sequel to this, I feel like the dev has only just touched on what can be done with the systems they've made.
