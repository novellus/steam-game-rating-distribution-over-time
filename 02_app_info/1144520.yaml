    review: 'Looks terrific.


      Would be nice if the plane could actually fly more than 2 metres before dropping
      like a piano filled with anvils.

      Would be nice if there were checkpoints.

      Would be nice if there were explanations regarding how to control such a demanding
      and unresponsive little thing.

      Would be nice if pulling the stick meant going up instead of down, as no amount
      of options and remapping could fix that heresy.


      I''ve tried 69 times from the courtyard. Half the time, I have no idea why the
      plane falls (or fails without falling.) I''ve passed over the wall 3 times,
      barely got any further before the plane dropped for no apparent reason, and
      each time I had to restart from scratch.


      And some joker put "casual" and "relaxing" in the sales tags.

      Worst flying I''ve ever experienced, at least in a video game.'
