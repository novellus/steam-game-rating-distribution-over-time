    developer_response: "hi, thank you for your review.\n\n\"Fighting is pretty much\
      \ clicking an enemy over and over, and maybe occasionally hitting 1-6 to do\
      \ a special move. There is not a whole lot of strategy to it. It would be nice\
      \ if you could click an enemy and it would keep attacking.\"\n\n-You can just\
      \ click once on an enemy so your character will keep attacking him(you still\
      \ need to command him to use skills)\n\n-\"There is not a whole lot of strategy\
      \ to it \"because the Prologue is too long(up to chapter 17) and we want to\
      \ speed things up for player. After certain chapter/character lv, enemies will\
      \ become much more deadly.\n\n-You need to reach chapter 17 to unlock the third\
      \ \"controllable\" teammate. You can unlock the second  \"controllable\" teammate\
      \ at early chapter.\n\n-Once you have at least 3  \"controllable\" teammates\
      \ than you can use formation. \n\nHope you enjoy the journey"

    review: "Edit: I've gone back to this game a couple of times now since I wrote\
      \ this review, and both times I got bogged down in very tedious 20-30 minute\
      \ dialog sequences where I could do nothing but hit Enter over and over to progress\
      \ through it. I am not even pretending to read it any more. The sequences are\
      \ usually interrupted by a fight scene or two, but they take 2-3 minutes maybe.\
      \ The rest of the time I'm mindlessly hitting Enter to get thru it so I can\
      \ save and quit.\n\nI'm going to leave it a positive review because when you\
      \ can actually play the game, it's a lot of fun, fairly deep and you can tell\
      \ a lot of work went in to it. I just don't really have the patience to watch\
      \ people talk to each other for that long, so I'm most likely done with the\
      \ game. \n\nEnd Edit\n--------\n\nEdit 2:\n\nWell, I got really bored and powered\
      \ through all of the dialog to get to chapter 18. I now apparently [spoiler]\
      \ own a house, a farm, and a... Hooters? There's a Playboy Bunny running around\
      \ and bandits in my pumpkin patch[/spoiler] and... maybe I should have read\
      \ more of the dialog?\n\nEnd Edit\n--------\n\nI've played this about 5 hours\
      \ now, and it's a mixed bag. I still find it fun, but I'm not quite sure why.\
      \ \n\nThe basic idea seems to be:\n\n1. Watch an extended cut-scene, where you\
      \ make no decisions that I've seen yet. There may be a fight in there somewhere.\n\
      2. You are suddenly back in town and able to roam around, do a side quest or\
      \ two, shop or craft. The side quests will have you go to an area outside of\
      \ town and kill/collect X.\n3. When you are done with that, talk to your mentor\
      \ that is standing around waiting on you, and goto 1.\n\nThe combat is real-time\
      \ with pause. I only have one companion so far and I can't seem to control her.\
      \ Maybe I'm missing something because the store page says you can switch between\
      \ party members. I'm playing on normal and have not even come close to dying\
      \ yet. I have drank a potion when I got to half health a couple of times.\n\n\
      Fighting is pretty much clicking an enemy over and over, and maybe occasionally\
      \ hitting 1-6 to do a special move. There is not a whole lot of strategy to\
      \ it. It would be nice if you could click an enemy and it would keep attacking.\
      \ The constant clicking prevents me from playing more than an hour or so at\
      \ a time. Even holding down left mouse to keep attacking would be better. (Edit:\
      \ It does have auto-attack, but you can attack much faster by manually clicking.\
      \ This makes the auto-attack not very useful.)\n\nThe crafting seems fairly\
      \ extensive but I've not gotten too deep in to it yet. I did make a few items\
      \ and they took 4 materials, with each material affecting the stats of the item.\
      \ At level 5 I have several dozen different materials to choose from in my inventory.\n\
      \nThe story is...well, I kind of quit paying attention to the story after the\
      \ first hour. I do read all the text but it barely registers. The dialog is\
      \ painfully awkward and/or badly translated. The characters have annoying habits\
      \ (e.g. saying \"Hohoho\" at the start of every sentence), everyone seems to\
      \ be constantly telling others to \"shut up!\" and I just recently met a bad\
      \ guy referred to as the \"double-headed stupid guy\". He may or may not have\
      \ a proper name. I wasn't paying attention.\n\nOverall, it is still somewhat\
      \ entertaining. I think $25 is probably too much, but it appears to have many\
      \ hours of grindy-crafty goodness, if that is your thing."
