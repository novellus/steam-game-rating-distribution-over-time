      \ is full of great, fast paced action strategy and horrible, stomach quivering\
      \ smells. You might pee green for a while. You\u2019ll start playing to see\
      \ what can happen but you\u2019ll keep coming back to hear me talk about it\
      \ all.<br><br>The tale I have for you is of a heroic, although pungent lad who\
      \ crash lands on a foreign planet while on a cargo mission through deep space.\
      \ He needs your help to survive until his rescue ship arrives.<br><br>Finding\
      \ food will be the simple part, because the stress of surviving alone manifests\
      \ as hallucinations of deadly demons. You\u2019ll need to help the lad deal\
      \ with his past to overcome his demons and get home.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/905070/extras/combat.gif?t=1599617024\"\
