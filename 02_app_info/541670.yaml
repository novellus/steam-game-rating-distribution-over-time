    review: There are a few weird glitches here and there, but not enough to be considered
      buggy. Runs way too smooth. I was getting 350+ frames on average. Every character
      is unlocked from the start, except for the newer characters that were added
      to the console versions before this game got taken down and re-uploaded.  This
      can be solved with modding. You also get most of the playsets too. I picked
      this game up during the steam winter sale for $8, and it was practically a steal.
      Sadly, all online features have been removed from the game since it got canceled
      a few years back, but that's not that big of a deal if you are just wanting
      to play the sets.  I would recommend this for new players, and even older players
      that want to get back into this game. I would try and get it during a sale.
      I dont think that this should be $30, but when on sale its worth it.
