Read the other helpful reviews for more details (including the negative ones), and feel free to downvote this so there's more page space for the more helpful ones.\n\nLike everyone else, I like the Portal universe and it was incorporated into the table well, with original voice snippets and characters/features making their appearance, so I'm not disappointed in that aspect atleast.","timestamp_created":1499845759,"timestamp_updated":1526624012,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474433302879333496","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7rj4uOMCetzYfw=="}
