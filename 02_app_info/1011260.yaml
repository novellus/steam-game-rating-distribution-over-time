    developer_response: "Hi there, \n\nA smooth turning option should be very easy\
      \ to add, also I agree that controls info needs to also get added to the pause\
      \ menu. \n\nThe reason for having grip using the trigger was so that you could\
      \ quickly pickup an item and throw it with a squeeze and release (throwing pickup-able\
      \ items will damage the humanoid robots). Feel free to propose alternative preferred\
      \ controls in the feedback section. \n\nThe story behind the robots initially\
      \ ignoring you is that they are supposed to be friendly robots serving the settlement,\
      \ but something causes them to turn against you. This early quiet stage of the\
      \ game is a good time to pickup as many grenades as possible, a 4x battery upgrade,\
      \ and also to find one of the full laser crystal modules lying around the settlement\
      \ that are required for firing balls of plasma. \n\nYou can fully take down\
      \ the blue walking robots with a single fully charged ball of plasma fro your\
      \ raygun, but if you are only using the basic laser they will have 3 lives.\
      \ The white \u2018Octeyebot\u2019 variants are tougher and have 5 lives if fired\
      \ at with only the laser. \n\n\u2018Groundhog Day\u2019 is a very good analogy\
      \ as to how the game plays at the moment. The plan is to eventually add a save\
      \ game option so you can save your progress. \n\n Hope this has been helpful.\
      \ Any more questions feel free to post in the feedback section."

    review: 'Initial Impression (Played on Oculus Rift, 3 Sensors)


      What I think I''m experiencing is a huge sandbox-type game, where you are a
      futuristic ''Omega Man'' (Charleston Heston old Sci-Fi movie) trying to figure
      out what is going on, and trying to survive at the same time.


      Pros

      - What an enormous-sized sandbox to play in.  It gives a good feeling of what
      it might be like to be alone in a city.  It makes me feel like I was walking
      through the abandoned set of an old sci-fi film, ''Logan''s Run''.

      - The game description indicates your ''hand will not be held'' as the story
      starts to unfold, so it makes it seems like I''ll have to use some detective
      skills.  Be careful though, too much aimless wandering around can quickly drain
      the fun out of the game.

      - I absolutely love that the goth C3PO robots remind me of what it might be
      like to fight against an angry Bender from Futurama.


      Cons

      - Lack of Smooth Turning is jarring, and constantly breaks the immersion for
      me (feels like a ''screen reset'' every time the snap turn occurs).  The ''Interpolated
      Turn'' (?) feature is horrible; it is like the foresaken offspring of snap and
      smooth turning.

      It is only because of my 3-sensor set-up that the game wasn''t promptly refunded.

      - While the ''Controls'' screen lays out the Touch Controller mapping, why is
      this not available when you pause the game?

      - Although the game has an epic scope, there doesn''t seem much you can do initially
      (other than walk around and push buttons on elevators).  So after a while, it
      starts to feel like I''m walking through a giant-corridor level.

      - After dying, I start back from the beginning.  If this is part of the overall
      storyline, I''ll stick around some to see how it plays out (e.g., ''Groundhog
      Day'').  If this is part of game design, it depresses me to think I''ve got
      to do everything all over again each time I play.

      - Would be great if the Ray Gun could be in the left hand as well.

      - Why is a grip function regulated to a trigger on the touch controller? I can
      work through it, but it sure is counter-intuitive.

      - It is confusing as to why initially the R2-D2 units (almost called them mini-floor
      sweepers) and the goth C3PO robots initially ignore you, but some undefined
      time later,they are coming after you like a Debt Collector.  At least the R2
      units  make a sound when they attack you.  You don''t hear a thing from the
      C3PO units, even when you turn around and discover 3 of them are of top of you
      in a very smothering, uncomfortable way (it feels like a very cheap attack).

      Before the psycho version of the Laurel and Hardy Robots start attacking me,
      I would watch them move around the city (or in one of the underground levels).  They
      seems to move around with no real rhyme or reason I can initially detect (It''s
      not like they come out of/go into those blue doors, which would make me think
      there''s an undiscovered story element here).

      - Please explain how many shots it takes to put the walking robots down.  Sometimes
      they seem to get up again.

      - Walking around on the main street level shows me a lot of lovely looking buildings,
      but no way to seemingly enter them (which goes back to my complaint of feeling
      like a huge outdoor corridor game).


      Despite the overwhelming Cons versus Pros at this time, I''ll provide a provisional
      Thumbs Up because condemning a game after 50 minutes of play, without giving
      the Developer a chance to respond to concerns, seems a little harsh right now.  To
      be fair, getting this game during a Steam Sale, has dampened the negativity
      I might otherwise be feeling.'
