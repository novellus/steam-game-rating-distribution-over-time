    review: "Before committing to buy, ask yourself this - do I want to own a set\
      \ of tutorial videos which are horribly blurred and illegible? If the answer\
      \ is yes, go right ahead. Mug.\n\nOr maybe I'm the mug. I shelled out just under\
      \ \xA330 for something that is abysmally low quality.  Steam, of course, are\
      \ perfectly happy as they have my money but don't have to give a refund (policy\
      \ alert!). In my view the software is entirely unfit for purpose, but hey, what\
      \ do I know?\n\nThanks for nothing, Steam. I won't be buying any more stuff\
      \ from you."
