    short_description: The final chapter in the Grisaia series. He thought life at
      the academy would never change. Everyone marched forward in the same direction,
      matching step for step; before he knew it, he began to surrender to that illusion.
      He believed that he would only arrive at the same place if he continued down
      the same path as everyone else.

    review: "[h1]\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606[/h1]\nFinal chapter in the Grisaia\
      \ series, this game is a fine conclusion and slightly better than part two.\n\
      \n[b][+][/b]\u2800While it doesn\u2019t have the epic proportions of the first\
      \ game, The Eden of Grisaia is much more focused than the second one. The story\
      \ presented is quite long, consistent, well-paced, and no character is left\
      \ aside. In this game, Yuuji is not in the limelight until the last third, which\
      \ leaves room for the girls to show they have talents of their own. The backgrounds,\
      \ dialogues and music are of the same great quality as the other two games.\
      \ In my opinion, the ending was fine as it really brings closure to the whole\
      \ arc while still leaving things open-ended.\n\n[b][-][/b]\u2800There are only\
      \ two things that bothered me a bit: the two incongruous CGI movies that felt\
      \ out of place and the fact that some of the girls pull off ridiculous supermoves\
      \ out of nowhere, just to give the story an action-oriented edge."
