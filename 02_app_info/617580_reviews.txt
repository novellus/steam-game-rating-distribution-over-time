There are all sorts of helpful features, which may be used to visually change or enhance pictures and photos. \n\nPhotoPad's user interface is organised in a favourable way. The interface shows effort to display the functions that are most often used. Functionalities are easy to locate, and use self-explanatory terminology.\nThe interface's colour-scheme is easy on the eyes, because the colours are not too bright.\nPhotoPad can load more than one image, and earlier adjustments to images can be reverted or changed. For example, by saving an entire list of made changes to an image, and steps that were taken to change the image, can later be undone or altered.\n\nI can recommend this, because PhotoPad is fun to play with, and making something different from drawings and pictures taken.","timestamp_created":1588055981,"timestamp_updated":1603616016,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6NC9r/UCcOSBhAI="}
