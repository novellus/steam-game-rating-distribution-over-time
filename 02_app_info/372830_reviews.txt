Which start as an easy platformer but goes much harder closer to the end. Especially frustrating is the fact if you choose fox with a gun levels are significantly harder and longer. Also you can use only one checkpoint per level at world 3 keep that in mind. If you love ao old fashioned platformer genre this game is for you.","timestamp_created":1591039730,"timestamp_updated":1591039730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlfTWuPICcvrRiwI="}
