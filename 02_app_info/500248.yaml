    about_the_game: "The Aerotrain, a futuristic and utterly unique lightweight diesel\
      \ streamliner that became one of the most iconic American passenger trains of\
      \ the 1950s, is now available for Train Simulator!<br><br>The Aerotrain was\
      \ created by General Motors as a lightweight, low-cost alternative to traditional\
      \ passenger equipment, and the diminutive streamliner was at once futuristic\
      \ in its bold styling and design-based upon standard industrial components.\
      \ Motive power for the Aerotrain came in the form of a sleek Electro-Motive\
      \ locomotive designated the LWT12, which was equipped with a standard EMD 567-series\
      \ 1,200-horsepower diesel power plant. The Aerotrain\u2019s low-slung passenger\
      \ coaches were based upon GM\u2019s standard 40-passenger intercity bus carbody,\
      \ which for rail service was widened by 18 inches and mounted on a pair of axles\
      \ per coach.<br><br>General Motors assembled a pair of 10-car Aerotrain demonstrators\
      \ in 1955. The distinctive streamliner made its debut in January 1956 when one\
      \ of the demonstrators ran from Washington, D.C., to Newark, New Jersey on the\
      \ Pennsylvania Railroad while the second dashed from Chicago to Detroit on the\
      \ New York Central. The Pennsylvania Railroad then leased one Aerotrain and\
      \ utilized it as a nine-car train in New York-Philadelphia-Pittsburgh service,\
      \ while the second Aerotrain undertook a barnstorming tour that included working\
      \ on U.S. railroads such as the Santa Fe and Union Pacific. A third Aerotrain\
      \ locomotive was constructed for the Rock Island and the RI eventually purchased\
      \ the two demonstrators as well. <br><br>Created for Train Simulator by DTM,\
      \ the complete Aerotrain (LWT12 locomotive, coach, and coach-observation) is\
      \ authentically re-created wearing the Pennsylvania Railroad\u2019s famed \u201C\

      s classic Horseshoe Curve route (available separately). And the Aerotrain pack\

    review: "The Aerotrain is a unique add on which is great for 1950s era US railroading\n\
      \nPros: \nInterior on the Coaches\nGauge Lights, Number Board Lights, Working\
      \ Mars Light, And Class Lights\nGreat sound effects on the engine and coaches\n\
      \nCons: \nThe engine is very loud and listening at a high volume is not recomended\n\
      Observation car only has a PRR variant"
