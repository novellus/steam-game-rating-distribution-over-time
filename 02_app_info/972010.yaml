    review: "You are a raider and you only have one goal and that is to pillage and\
      \ rule the entire wasteland. \nThe combat is ok especially with the auto-resolve\
      \ being added, but otherwise you get to customize your raiders. I also like\
      \ the idea of how you can conquer the other settlements and be able to force\
      \ them to pay tribute to you.  \nThe story is simple and easy to follow with\
      \ a few side quests which you guessed it, they are not morally good. \nNow the\
      \ gameplay has this feel of Mount and Bland with rpg elements. The last part\
      \ I want to say is that this game would become more fun if modding was to get\
      \ introduced, because imagine playing this with Fallout mods."
