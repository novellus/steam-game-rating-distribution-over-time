The game looks fine, and the sound design is okay.  The game play is pretty much an automatic platformer where only one button is required to play, a really short and easy game of 24 short levels and a leaderboard.  If you want a small time waster to 100% this game might be for you, however I feel as if this would have been better off as a free game as it does not offer much else.","timestamp_created":1599785749,"timestamp_updated":1600132585,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44rLVx/QCc8eGoQI="}
