    about_the_game: In this game, you play the role of a member of a once noble family,
      and try to build your own town using all you have. You can design every detail
      of the town from every road to every brick of the floor. You have to build every
      single store yourself, and be responsible for everything, including determine
      how much you want to import for each ingredient and what the price of each product
      is. Your control over the whole town ends at this step, as the market itself
      will determine how your businesses go. Of course it is known to all that with
      higher price goes lower sale quantity, but the challenge is how to make most
      profit out of it.<h2 class="bb_tag">What Will Be Included In the Full Release</h2><br><ul

    review: The game is OK but needs lots of improvement. Starting with lack of content
      and there is no map editor. The User interface  could use a major face lift.
      I'm sorry but since these issues haven't yet been addressed I won't be playing
      this game any time soon. In fact I have already uninstalled the game and will
      not reinstall It unless the gameplay improves.
