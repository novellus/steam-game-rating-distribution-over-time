The platformer part was quite challenging, and you can immediately bounce back from failure, which reminds me of Hotline Miami in the sense of game feel. \nThe point-and-click part had stunning scenes that gives the feeling of a dystopian universe. The game delivers that unique atmosphere with a very tasty aesthetic.\nAlthough the game has a vast untapped potential, I blame the recommendation algorithms and the way that market works against indies, which portrays this masterpiece of art as a humble underdog. Ten years before, a game like this easily would have a cult following. \nI strongly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the games mentioned above.","timestamp_created":1578763649,"timestamp_updated":1578763649,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/q/pyu8Cea2s6wE="}
