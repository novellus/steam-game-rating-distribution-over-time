    review: '[b] A cerebral and beautiful experience unlike any other [/b]


      In Other Waters is a remarkable little gem, although It is a pretty niche title
      for sure and a lot of people might not quite gel with it (I can totally understand
      that), but personally I found everything about it just perfect, the story is
      truly captivating and will leave you thinking long after the end credits have
      rolled. The gorgeous UI, sound and topography design is also so satisfying to
      navigate.


      The soundtrack is up there in my top 10 game OST''s as well, pure ambient bliss
      that captures the feeling of the vast unknown depths with a splash of the melancholy
      and wonder thrown in for good measure.


      Well worth checking out if you dig story driven indie games that do things a
      little differently.'
