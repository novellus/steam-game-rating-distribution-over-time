    review: "I love the beauty and logic of the puzzles. It can make me feel both\
      \ smart and dumb, but it's a calming search for me.\nThe *only* problem I have\
      \ with it is that I use a desktop at home and a laptop for work. If I want to\
      \ take a sudoku break, I have to manually enter a code to update the other location's\
      \ app with my progress. \n4.5/5 stars"
