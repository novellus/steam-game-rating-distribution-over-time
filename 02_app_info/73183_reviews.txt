Definitely optional, but a nice to have.  They are always a bit too expensive to start out with, but I always regret it when my metro stations get backed up and wished I had more platforms.  It isn't easy to delete an existing metro and insert one of these with existing lines to recreate.  So I end up using these later in a city when I am just optimizing my routes and have plenty of money.  Still, if you like optimizing your metro lines, these are a good choice to have.","timestamp_created":1504566190,"timestamp_updated":1504566190,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+8PIp94Cf9XFhAE="}
