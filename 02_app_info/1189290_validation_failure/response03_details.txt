As a result, Rothar finds himself caught in a mortal feud between powerful wielders of magic, bound by a curse he desperately needs to break away from. As events unfold, Rothar also comes to discover how his lands have fallen into disrepair while his eyes have been shut. Order must be restored if Rothar is to know peace.
