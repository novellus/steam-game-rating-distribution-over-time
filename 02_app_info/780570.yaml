    about_the_game: In the near future humans manage to create machines smart enough
      to carry out almost any task they are given. However, the humans become victims
      of their own success when they create machines that are so smart they no longer
      need humans to survive and decide to destroy their makers. Humankind is on the
      brink of destruction at the mercy of these super smart machines who possess
      advanced AI. But one machine is faulty. An error in its programming causes it
      to have an <strong>AI Anomaly</strong>. Instead of seeking to destroy its makers,
      this heroic little blue robot knows it must save mankind from the mindless onslaught
      of its fellow machines.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Run, jump, climb, use hand-over-hand

    review: 'This game is like a pull workout for the adrenal gland. The levels are
      incredibly well designed and increase in difficulty as you progress through
      the game. You need the reflexes of a cat, perfect judgement and nerves of steel
      to avoid the hazards and get through.


      The levels are varied and colourful. The game mechanics work beautifully too.
      I am something of a platform game enthusiast and I can say with some authority
      this is a real little gem.


      God bless the brave little robot. Please help him to save humanity!'
