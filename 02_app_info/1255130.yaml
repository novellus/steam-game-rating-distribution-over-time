    review: 'Where the first Unlock the King was an interesting puzzle game, and the
      second largely failing to deliver on the promise of a third dimension, this
      third iteration - with it''s Rubik''s Cube inspired adjustment of the available
      board - fails in every way imaginable. Yes, the moving parts come in at a reasonable
      time in the series of puzzles, but that is about the only redeeming feature.
      Most of the puzzles are not even slightly puzzling, requiring only a few pieces
      to be moved, and often not all of the rotatable elements. There are also many
      pieces on each board that serve no purpose, either to confuse or to block.


      And, as others have mentioned, the Y-axis rotation is inverted, making the viewing
      confusing and off-putting.


      And to think the idea had so much potential. For rotations to be repeatable,
      or to undo when a piece was moved off. To be combined with the board rearrangement
      of the second version. To fully use all dimensions.


      Instead, we get 50 throw-away puzzles undeserving of the name.'
