    about_the_game: 'Ichor is a shoot-em-up without any bullets -- instead, your movements
      push around a viscous fluid which, should they touch it, liberates your comrades
      into nirvana.   Meanwhile you have to navigate and avoid their fluid (until
      the cycle of suffering that is life is too much for you).  A very simple concept
      with surprisingly deep game dynamics, which all come from the physics of fluid
      dynamics.  Learn to play in the flow: follow where it leads and subtly manipulate
      it toward success; resist it and you are doomed.'

    review: "14 years ago I found this game for free on the now desolate \"Fun-Motion\"\
      \ physics games site. I loved it and played it all the time. I had it on my\
      \ downloaded on my PC until it bit the dust like 6 years ago and thought I would\
      \ never see this game again. \nWell my friends, the Holy Grail has been found!\
      \ Ichor lives!"
