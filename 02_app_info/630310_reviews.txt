Large and complex environments full of secrets, a gradual but satisfying firepower curve to compliment the difficulty level, and wonderful aesthetics. The keyboard controls take some getting used to (gamepad highly recommended), and at just over 7 hours it's not especially long, so perhaps not a great choice at full price but definitely worth checking out.","timestamp_created":1609460348,"timestamp_updated":1609460348,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxv7T3fYCfZKgvwI="}
