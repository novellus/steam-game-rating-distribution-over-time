    about_the_game: "Escape the clutches of friendship and social expectations in\
      \ this top-down puzzler about living with social anxiety. Go to social gatherings\
      \ and try to complete your obligations before you get too stressed. If your\
      \ anxiety gets too high it's game over. <br><br>The purpose of Personal Space\
      \ is to create the experience of social anxiety for any player that interacts\
      \ with the game. We wanted to make this game because it opens up a really important\
      \ conversation about social anxiety, how it affects us, and why we need to talk\
      \ about it. We think it's important that, even if you're not someone prone to\
      \ social anxiety yourself, you can empathize with the experience and with other\
      \ people who may feel social anxiety in their daily lives. We want this to be\
      \ a game that fosters a sense of community. It\u2019s about understanding that\
      \ even if you experience social anxiety you\u2019re not alone. A lot of us are\
      \ anxious, and in that we can find community.<br><br><strong>Who is Pastel Peaks\
      \ Production?</strong><br>We are a team of students from the University of Utah's\
      \ Entertainment Arts and Engineering Program. This game was created as part\
      \ of a Senior Capstone Project over the course of the 2019-2020 academic year."
