My main concerns are that a good chunk of the levels have ice physics which make jumping from one gap or small platform to another really difficult and levels end up taking a lot longer than they need to in my opinion. Some of the sprites used for the platforms and walls can also be confusing in you're not paying attention. Also, what's the point of the minigame? I beat the game on Normal only picking up the in-stage powerups so this last point's more of a nitpick. \n\nI'll recommend the game with the caution of \"AT LEAST 15 OF THE 50 LEVELS HAVE ICE PHYSICS AND THERE'S NONSENSICAL ACHIEVEMENTS\"","timestamp_created":1596939730,"timestamp_updated":1596939730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.436781615018844604","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxc/B6PMCd6CnmgI="}
