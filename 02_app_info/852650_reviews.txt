The game crashes every time I try to save, rendering it unplayable.  Sadly the game itself is pretty good, but not worth buying.\n\n---\n\n\nA solid operational hex-and-counter wargame, if a bit clunky and fiddly.  It's a lite version of something like GG: War in the East or Decisive Campaigns: Barbarossa, covering the entire Eastern Front from 1941-1945 with 1-month turns.  Once you get a hang of the UI, the game is a straightforward chit-shuffler.  Barbarroja is much quicker to play than GG or DC, and benefits from an option for custom unit placement, which adds a lot to replayability.  Speaking of replayability, there's a decent number of scenarios covering smaller snippets of the war, plus a fairly flexible scenario editor.  The AI is sneaky and competent, although the Soviets are unusually aggressive in the initial turns of the 41-45 campaign.\n\nRecommended for fans of hex-and-counter wargames and Eastern Front fanatics in general.\n\nFair warning:  I'm currently having issues with frequent CTDs caused by saving the game and even clicking \"No\" on the end-turn save prompt.  I've opened a thread about this and will remove this from my review as soon as it gets fixed.","timestamp_created":1572127992,"timestamp_updated":1595541358,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.564541220664978027","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw26DrvvMCe+n21AE="}
