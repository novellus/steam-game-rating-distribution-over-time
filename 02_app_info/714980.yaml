    review: Not sure if I'm missing something, but there's seems to be very very little
      content here. I was pretty disappointed after purchasing it - wish I had requested
      a refund. The art is adorable and the story quirky enough, but there just wasn't
      very much to it - I guess I finished it in less than 2 hours? You know how there's
      a snapshot of a bunch of comic book panels in the storefront slideshow - I think
      that's the entire experience.
