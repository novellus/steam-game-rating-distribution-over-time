    review: "This is quite possibly the worst dlc this game has had... right next\
      \ to the duck dlc. Here I am just trying to call in some geese and rail a few\
      \ flocks with the boys, but after sitting in a blind for an hour IRL both my\
      \ ass cheeks in game and in real life started to hurt. I told myself maybe if\
      \ I just waited 10 more minutes I would see just one goose. 30 minutes and 3\
      \ different spots later here I am, \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 in hand bored out\
      \ of my mind. DO NOT BUY THIS DLC, it is a waste of time, money, and sore ass\
      \ cheeks. Just go to Layton Lake and shoot the 483,221 moose that you can find\
      \ almost instantly... have a nice day and don't buy this pos dlc\n"
