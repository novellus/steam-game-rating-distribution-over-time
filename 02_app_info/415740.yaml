    about_the_game: "OmniBus is next-to-last gen physics game about the most powerful\
      \ bus in the universe that can\u2019t stop or even slow down for reasons incomprehensible\
      \ to the simple human mind. OmniBus must complete missions at the behest of\
      \ citizens as its speed increases to unsafe speeds and without landing on its\
      \ head or sides. OmniBus drivers will choose from the bizarre mission mode,\
      \ thrilling trick mode and versus multiplayer mode for up to four players to\
      \ achieve goals, set high scores, and receive total enlightenment.<br><br><strong>Deep\
      \ Emotional Narrative:</strong> Throughout history man has looked to the noble\
      \ bus in times of chaos and turmoil to bring peace, prosperity, and a lift to\
      \ those that it serves during hours of operation. Slay demon buses, harvest\
      \ space corn, and transport astronauts to a wedding as the legend foretold to\
      \ become the one true OmniBus. There\u2019s also a pretty cool level with a\
      \ football field on the top of a skyscraper. <br><br><strong>Multiplayer Derby\
      \ Mode:</strong> Jump into the chaotic free-for-all multiplayer versus mode\
      \ where drivers are pitted against each other in a high score trick mode or\
      \ the visceral deathmatch mode sure to raise tensions down at the bus depot.<br><br><strong>Free\
      \ Play Trick Mode: </strong>Choose your favorite bus and pull off unbelievable\
      \ jumps, flips and twists to hit incredible high scores and impress friends,\
      \ family, and other OmniBus drivers on the leaderboards. <br><br><strong>Cutting\
      \ Edge Everything:</strong> OmniBus has the best of everything from graphics\
      \ and sound effects to physics and an options menu. This is the future. This\
