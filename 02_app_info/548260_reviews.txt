The soundtrack inparticular is quite good. The enemies are varied and their death animations are violent including being blown to smithereens by grenades you launch or their chest being torn open after you blast them with a mech you've jumped into. The gameplay is nothing revolutionary and more an homage to old-school/retro shooters, but if you're a fan of that era of game then you will probably enjoy this as well. I especially like the character and enemy designs as they have a realistic portrayal and anatomy that is often missing from these kinds of shooters, which instead often opt for more cartoony or chibi-like features. \n\nThere are a few technical issues with the game including a game-breaking problem I encountered in one area with how the levels progress at times, let's say you were supposed to take a corridor on the right, and instead walked \"too far ahead\" (or up) to obstruct your view of the corridor your were supposed to go right on... now you have no way of going back \"down\" the level toward the corridor again, and the game instead locked me ahead as the view was no longer available. I have only run into this problem in this one area but I could see the player possibly wandering off of the beaten path and because of the way the game renders possibly not being able to backtrack and go down a proper path.\n\nAlso this is a minor complaint but your character when hit by an enemy bullet or attack pauses, blinks, and just stands there incapacitated for a few seconds. This is kind of akin to retro effects, in that you're disabled for a few seconds and unable to move but it has lead to a few annoying deaths for me where the timing of the enemies' bullets to my character recovering and being able to move again has lead to some \"cheap deaths\" where because I couldn't move out of the way and when the next wave of bullets was already coming in lead to one hit equaling three or more / death.   \n\nThat aside for the game's very cheap asking price you get a full, arcade-y, retro experience with some cool art and a good soundtrack.","timestamp_created":1502128234,"timestamp_updated":1502128380,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.601063847541809082","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhoP13t0Ce+CDggE="}
