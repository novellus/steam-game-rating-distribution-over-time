With nothing but a few images to go by, this is what I created. 41 instrumental tracks (1 hour 50 minutes) of ugly\/beautiful\/surreal soundscapes and melodies. Perhaps something to take with you on a long ride through a quiet place. For fans of film scores and strange haunting ambience. I would love to know what you think of it.
