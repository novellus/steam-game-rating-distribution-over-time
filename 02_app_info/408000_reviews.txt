If you’re interested in spicy games that’d rise err… the room temperature feel free to check out [u][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38444643/]our curator[/url][/u] (we will love it if you follow it too ^^).[/code]\n\nThis game disappointed me quite a lot. I bought it expecting a puzzle game with some substance, but instead, I got one where the story is limited to the initial cutscene and all you do is solve puzzles one after another. To make things worse there’s next to no cohesion between the puzzles and some of them are way too similar (Stage 4 is the biggest offender). They also feel a bit empty in the R12 version because it lacks the extra traps the 18+ version has, but applying said patch is not an option because [b]it’s broken![/b].\n\nI could almost forgive the lack of plot if I got a sense of accomplishment when I finished it, but both endings are disappointing and barely different from each other.\n\nAll in all, I can't recommend it. It pains me because I dig the darker take on Cinderella's tale but the game is just not worth your time.","timestamp_created":1599483094,"timestamp_updated":1609431963,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.55929487943649292","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ419rn3PYCfJmvoAI="}
