      <br>Just Adventure<br><br>\u201CThe gameplay is exactly right: intriguing, engaging\

    review: I'm not sure who invited satan's fetus, but beyond that nightmare of a
      child, the game and scenery was really well done! It reminded me a bit of The
      Haunting (I'm not sure why; maybe it's just the house?).
