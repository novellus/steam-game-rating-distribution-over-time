The game was fun for the first couple of hours after that it got very boring to watch your people do nothing.  just open portals and come back in an hour or two to see if you won the match or not.  Paid fro a premium but still have never seen a soundtrack anywhere -  so don't waste your money.","timestamp_created":1442363454,"timestamp_updated":1442363454,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.438502341508865356","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo/bj6c8Cd+/tRA=="}
