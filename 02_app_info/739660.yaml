    review: "I don't know where to begin with this review. I can state with confidence,\
      \ that this game has the potential to grow into one of the greatest games of\
      \ all time, and time to come.\n\nFrom the depths of the Steam store lies this\
      \ beast, undisrupted and undisturbed. My first impressions weren't very high,\
      \ however, I didn't think I was about to launch such a life-changing product.\
      \ Oh was I so wrong. From the get-go, I was immediately immersed within the\
      \ world of [i]Nymphalalalalia[/i]. My adrenaline levels shot up as I was greeted\
      \ by an explosive and action packed environment. Colours and particle effects\
      \ galore. My hands snapped to the keyboard, trying to save my creature from\
      \ a horrendous and cruel, yet beautiful death. Alas, I couldn't save him from\
      \ its demise. From an adrenaline rush to a heartbreak, I had no idea about the\
      \ emotional rollercoaster I was lining up for when buying this game, and it\
      \ wasn't going to stop there. I respawned back into the action refreshingly\
      \ fast. No need to wait around in this game. The combinations of the stunning\
      \ visuals and the deep, satisfying sound work brought the life right back into\
      \ me, along with the adrenaline. \n\nThis time, I was ready.\n\nUsing one of\
      \ the primary selling points of this game, I was able to transform into a fast\
      \ critter, zooming across the map at ludicrous speeds. I was about to flank\
      \ the enemy team. I converted to a strong titan, and using it's shotgun like\
      \ projectiles, took out enemies with rapid succession. There are no words to\
      \ describe the satisfaction and triumph I felt during those few seconds of my\
      \ game time.\n\nI could go on and on about the moments I had, exploring the\
      \ two highly detailed maps. The first being open and vast. The second incorporating\
      \ more close-quarters combat with a maze of towering spires. It makes you feel\
      \ insignificant in its world, but you soon discover the difference you can make\
      \ for your team.\n\nIn terms of menus and navigation, the game throws you right\
      \ in, with no return. It's straight to the point. Simple, yet detailed. Casual,\
      \ yet refined. The story is incorporated into the main menu, conveying its importance\
      \ and allowing users to get right into the deep and fascinating narrative. The\
      \ thought put into each and every corner of this game in mind-boggling. Extremely\
      \ impressive. \n\nTime to cut to the chase and get down the the basics;\nThe\
      \ gameplay fast and action packed. Lots of options when it comes to play style,\
      \ increasing the height of the skill ceiling. The gunplay is also vast in options,\
      \ with each creature comes a new type of projectile, and a new playstyle. By\
      \ quickly changing between creatures you can create your own powerful and unique\
      \ playstyles. \nThe visuals are remarkable, and already prepped for future gaming\
      \ and rigs. With the option to go up to 8K resolution you can be sure that graphics\
      \ haven't been looked over when the devs made this game. With excessive amounts\
      \ of colourful particles, you can find yourself caught up in beautiful chaos.\n\
      The audio is responsive and helps with the gameplay. Each character has its\
      \ own sounds that can be used to identify them, even without any visual aid.\n\
      The story is deep, hidden, and meaningful. The names of the creatures and maps\
      \ are intriguing. They really immerse you in the narrative and gameplay. \n\n\
      To sum it all up, a single, not even two reviews could successfully describe\
      \ the euphoria and joy that this game brings you. Play it for yourself to experience\
      \ this beautiful, lawless, masterpiece. \n\n9/10\n"
