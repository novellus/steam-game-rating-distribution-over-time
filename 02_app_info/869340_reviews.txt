[/i]\n\nFirst thing that struck me was the [b] horrifying UI [/b] - it's not good. Different colour text, cheesy sound effects.. \nYou start up the game, press play, and you have this chunk of text with basically what each key does like some GTA Cheat Codes, along with a bit of 'History' to set up the mood for the game.\n\nI see what they're trying to get at, I won't say there's a story but there's a concept which can be evolved. \nThe actual graphics, I guess aren't.. half bad? I'm assuming they are ready-made assets on CRYENGINE but character models, all look the same, no emotion, very static.\nThere's motion blur. That's pretty cool.\n\n[b] Gameplay wise [/b]. Oh boy. I also love the way you could unload two magazines on a guy and he's still alive.\nIt's true, I didn't explore every crevasse of the game - I don't need to. \n\n\n*WHAT I FEEL CAN HELP FOR THE TIME BEING*\n- Give it some more thought, take it back from the market maybe and really decide what you want to do with the game.\n-  I do feel like it has potential, but there's no story really. Writing some text to give it context.. that's not a plot. That's 8 year old me explaining why my superhero idea is fit for a movie.\n- Do you want a Singleplayer Campaign? Is the narrative important for the playstyle? \n\nWill I come back to the game? I don't know. \nI guess if I see development, If I see some kind of growth, I might give it another shot.\n\nGoodluck team!","timestamp_created":1591366228,"timestamp_updated":1591366228,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwgrO0wvICeISnjAI="}
