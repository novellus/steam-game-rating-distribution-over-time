The variety of mini games I found a nice break from the regular. At the end of the game wait and watch the credits, it is worth it to see the dancing monster knights busting their moves. I thoroughly recommend this game. Well done to the developers for such a wonderful game and also for making the bonus chapter pick up from the original story.","timestamp_created":1608419407,"timestamp_updated":1608419407,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.493421077728271484","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yY7RvvYCcebGuwI="}
