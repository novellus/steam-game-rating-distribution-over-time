It's not a fighter simulator but still very realistic. It's easy to learn how to control the planes and nothing is excessively complicated. Both the atmosphere of battlefield and the background music are splendid.\n\nThe only drawback is on the design of the role of the friendly planes which wait for the player to take control. They suffer attacks only and never attack the enemies actively.\n\nMoreover all the planes, carriers and missions are historically real. It's far better to know the properties of these WWII planes by playing this game rather than trying to understand the data.","timestamp_created":1609908954,"timestamp_updated":1609908954,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuaSD6/YCfr70wAI="}
