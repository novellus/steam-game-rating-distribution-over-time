    review: 'Enjoyable HOPA game with lots to do and lovely art. Other than the lack
      of Steam cards/achievements, this one has most of what I look for in one of
      these games.  The story is very basic - save the land from the powerful Dragon
      King - but the mythology is nice.


      Pros:

      - wide variety of puzzles, some challenging

      - HO scenes that include word lists, outlines, and even riddles

      - lovely art

      - beautiful setting

      - accents in voice acting generally very consistent

      - extras menu lets you replay scenes and HO puzzles to locate collectables and
      get missed (in-game) achievements

      - the right amount of "looking around" (backtracking), supported by a fully
      interactive map


      Cons:

      - linear story (complete tasks as directed to defeat Dragon King)

      - very 2D protagonist and characters (but the dragons are so well drawn I didn''t
      mind XD


      Overall: a very nice addition to this series of HOPA games; keeps up the high
      standards of previous entries; I''d wait for a sale, but if you enjoy the HOPA
      genre, this one is good'
