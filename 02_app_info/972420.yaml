    review: A good quality little game with lots of area to cover and lots of easy
      puzzles. A few of the hidden object games require you to find an object that
      matches a shown clue... like a flame is the shown clue so you must find a fire
      extinguisher. Some of the associations are really weird and annoying. All in
      all though, well worth the money when on sale.
