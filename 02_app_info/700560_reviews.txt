Just a click bait, fun the first hour and then you search for more things... =( Not worth the price tag! \nIt handles worse than anything without VR set. But don't support it straight away x'D \n\nI wanted a refund but it was too late, I had to google and research about this game on how to decode all sigil's and marks but nothing I had to spend more time writing things down since the game was \"SOO helpful\" with having a in game notebook.....Best druid ever without his own notebook..\n\nBut there are NO instructions inside the game, No tutorial. No guide in the steam community..\nSo you start of with a briefing and rest you figure out, including how things work. How to slay the ghost for example. When he took 40 hits in his face\n(Which can bug and become immortal so you need to start entire save file over from start in order to get rid of the ghost sometimes.. ) \n\nYou are just being told things very short and bad, without more info on what things mean, and what they do.. and again (Or how the mark or sigil look like but you have to guess and have a notebook next to you irl, So you write down things more than actually playing the game....)\n\nImpossible to sort things because when you came back for a 3 or 5'th time all your mushrooms got mixed with other stuff, and mushrooms mix with others.\nWhat is the point to not add a track code of Item ID ?\n\nSo you need a VR set to play a game made by 1 person since moving things around is more mouse scrolling than enjoying the world outside that door with boring tasks written on it.\n\nI bought this game since I am polish my self, I am a Shaman Druid and a coder also.\nBut to see this that gives motion sickness, and Claustrophobia due to a super small world to play in. But now I regret it and steam don't want to refund. \n\nThis game is fun first 20 minutes.. but as soon as you try to use the sword and it bugs soon and fly's away from your hand. \n\nThis game ain't worth what they creator ask for, This teaches you VERY little or nothing about the druidic path. (I would hope it would go through basics which is ALOT of Animism and Shamanic knowledge before brewing potions..)\n\nThe 11 hours I spent on this game was not worth it as for 11 hours of meditation taught me much more while having contact with a spirit guide. this game didn't even offer teaching you on how you gain connection with other worlds, how to meditate wasn't even taught... \nThis game is a joke on it's name and what it could have been. \n\n(Like it was hard to create a spirit guide that manifest's from like 8 or 12 different animals (power animals!) and this guide will show the druid how to find things, what certain things mean and can happen, Even working as a companion for company.)","timestamp_created":1518171241,"timestamp_updated":1518177536,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.687161266803741455","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgNmbveECeOCymAE="}
