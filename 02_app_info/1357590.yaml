      to the surface, and fight back enough machines to make rent this month.<h2 class="bb_tag">A
      Dungeon Crawler Dressed as a Card Game</h2>Take on the role of misfit mercenaries
      and explore decks packed with 'bots, gear, and a ton of scrap. Your unlocked
      cards are the tools you'll use to make your way to the boss. Unlock and upgrade
      power ability cards, blueprint cards to craft in a pinch, and augment cards
      to boost your stats.<h2 class="bb_tag">A World Worth Salvaging</h2>Humanity
      has fled to cityships just above the planet's surface, but we still need fuel,
      food, and valueless family heirlooms. That's where you come in. One good shove
      off the side of the ship and you've already started your mission. Don't worry,
      I'm sure another ship will come by to pick you up. Eventually.<h2 class="bb_tag">A
      Fully Cooperative Experience</h2>Team up in groups of 1-4 in fully online co-op,
      and choose your loadout smartly to ensure maximum combo potential. Matchmaking
      and custom games are both available!<h2 class="bb_tag">Alpha Features</h2><ul
