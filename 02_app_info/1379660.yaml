    review: 'This game is interesting and enjoyable. The game has amazing, fairly
      simple gameplay. The graphics are simple but decent and the sounds is alright.
      Overall, it''s an 8/10, would recommend.


      Detailed:


      Graphics: 8/10


      The graphics on this game are not mindbreaking and very simple. However, they
      are nice and with enough detail to be interesting and good enough.


      Sound: 5.5/10


      The sound effects are alright. A bit misplaced but good. The volume of the sound
      is low and that is annoying but this is alright.


      Gameplay: 9/10


      The gameplay is amazing! If you like things like Software Inc, Game Dev Tycoon
      and City Game Studio you will love this. The game is great to play, very user-friendly
      and has many modes. The easy mode is maybe a bit too easy but the rest of this
      stuff is great.'
