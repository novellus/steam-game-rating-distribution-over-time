They both have a \"pick up & play\" quality that lets  you understand most of what's going on just by playing before having to study the guide in depth. That said, something just doesn't \"click\" for me on them and I haven't found myself spending much time playing them. I'd give it a \"neutral\" if Steam allowed it, but I won't penalize the game for that with a negative review, but you should probably play the times demos of these a bit before you make your decision. If they're on sale though it's probably a good purchase","timestamp_created":1566499279,"timestamp_updated":1566499279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4icKo3ewCcubu0AE="}
