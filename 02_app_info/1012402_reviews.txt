I actually think this is one of the best purchases you can make seeing how I only bought one DLC.\n\n1. AGI = Agility is the biggest part of this DLC\n\nI played this on hard despite this being my first JRPG bc I don't want to breeze through the game for the story(which is also pretty good) & I also want some struggle/challenge to my fights which I know will personally encourage me to want to learn how to best/effectively use my characters.\n\nIn the beginning you're basically untouchable, you react & move faster, which means your character will for the most part dodge virtually everything. I came to realize just how important my AGI was when I realized hit my 30th hour and started fighting more & higher level enemies.\n\nI forgot to equip Warrior Set to Clea & Lucil and when they had their first battles that got deSTRoYED!!\n\nClea got Gangr*ped on sight & once she got revived, they went for a part two & I was powerless to stop them.\n\nLucil did not get the same treatment as Clea, but she would also die in a hit or two which left me with Shina, who eventually got met the same fate as Clea due to her low health. Even with her high Agility(AGI) she dodged all attacks from like what felt like 5-9 Martyrs.. But just when I thought she might go next they went another round on her and she dropped like a rock and I lost everything except my money.\n\n(keep in mind Clea/Lucil where my highest ranked members, and Shina was my lowest yet survived the longest)\n\nI have been smooth sailing through this game, not absolutely no difficulty/pay-to-win style, but it's def helping & now i'm fighting Martyrs that are actually making me strategize more than prior & the stupid high Agility helps so much from having to waste SP on reviving characters who die only to watch them die again.\n\nSo the weapons may be \"Weaker\" than those in the Travelers Set, it's good to note that they're not the weakest weapons in the game far from it & the AGI boost alone is worth it & is really, really helping me in higher level dungeons where the difference in not losing everyone in party is making it to the next turn, not necessarily dishing damage.\n(everyone has like 699+ Agility)\n\n2. Rings\n\n2.1: Toxic Ring - Resists Poison / / boosts HP by 1400+ at the cost of physical attack\n\n2.2: Anti-seal Ring - A ring that ensures the wearer cannot have their skills sealed / / boosts Magic Defense by 140+\n\n2.3: Nimble Ring - Resistance to \"Slow\" effect given by enemy Martyrs / / More Agility boost 140+\n\n2.4: Zen Ring - Resistance to \"Stop\" effect given by Martyrs / / Boosts everything by 47(+/-)\n\n2.5: Mind of Steel - Decreases EX Gain after Battle\n\nNot exactly sure what Anit-Stun does but the name are very literal & unsure of the benefit to Mind of Steel but the more I play the more I learn.\n\n3. Weapons look pretty cool & matches their whole Bagu/Glitch color scheme, both sets have weapons that match the characters better & still haven't found a weapon stronger than what I have from Rook -in-game so I've been using these as my go-to weapons from the start.\n\nIn my opinion the Travelers Set & the Warriors Set have their own objectives, and will appeal to different types of players. EXP boosts and initially ATK in the start may be your thing, but I can say one thing I'm far from regretting my purchase especially now that i'm nearing the end, where dungeons are getting alot harder & I wonder how many people would swap Rook Sets if they knew exactly what they were really getting into with either sets.\n\nI would whole recommend thisto someone who has anyone regardless if you have money to waste on DLCs or not, just be sure to read more reviews into other DLCs if you're strapped for cash, but I can't see how you can go wrong here.","timestamp_created":1594170081,"timestamp_updated":1594178015,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48cGalvMCeYDWkwI="}
