    review: "[i] Listen, I hate to leave a bad review on a game that's in the early\
      \ stage of development but I do believe it is not currently in a stage to be\
      \ released to the public for playtest. [/i]\n\nFirst thing that struck me was\
      \ the [b] horrifying UI [/b] - it's not good. Different colour text, cheesy\
      \ sound effects.. \nYou start up the game, press play, and you have this chunk\
      \ of text with basically what each key does like some GTA Cheat Codes, along\
      \ with a bit of 'History' to set up the mood for the game.\n\nI see what they're\
      \ trying to get at, I won't say there's a story but there's a concept which\
      \ can be evolved. \nThe actual graphics, I guess aren't.. half bad? I'm assuming\
      \ they are ready-made assets on CRYENGINE but character models, all look the\
      \ same, no emotion, very static.\nThere's motion blur. That's pretty cool.\n\
      \n[b] Gameplay wise [/b]. Oh boy. I also love the way you could unload two magazines\
      \ on a guy and he's still alive.\nIt's true, I didn't explore every crevasse\
      \ of the game - I don't need to. \n\n\n*WHAT I FEEL CAN HELP FOR THE TIME BEING*\n\
      - Give it some more thought, take it back from the market maybe and really decide\
      \ what you want to do with the game.\n-  I do feel like it has potential, but\
      \ there's no story really. Writing some text to give it context.. that's not\
      \ a plot. That's 8 year old me explaining why my superhero idea is fit for a\
      \ movie.\n- Do you want a Singleplayer Campaign? Is the narrative important\
      \ for the playstyle? \n\nWill I come back to the game? I don't know. \nI guess\
      \ if I see development, If I see some kind of growth, I might give it another\
      \ shot.\n\nGoodluck team!"
