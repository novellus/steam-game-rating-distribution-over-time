    review: "Video game music has evolved dramatically from its plinking, 8-bit origins.\
      \ The arcade machines and home consoles of the 1980s were limited by those systems\u2019\
      \ rudimentary sound chips, but as tech improved and game developers started\
      \ to build more enveloping worlds, the music grew more elaborate, too. Composers\
      \ began creating entire scores spanning classical, techno, jazz, and more. Sports\
      \ titles like FIFA and open-world games like Grand Theft Auto started licensing\
      \ hit songs, further blurring the lines between the game world and our real\
      \ one. Today, video game soundtracks can be as evocative and detailed as those\
      \ in films, offering powerful listening experiences on their own.\n\nThis one\
      \ is very post-apocalyptic. \n\nVery atmospheric. \n\nA great way to show your\
      \ support to a great developer."
