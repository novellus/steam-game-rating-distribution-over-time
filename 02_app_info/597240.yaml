    about_the_game: This is johns.game, a Wasteland Survival Game. <br>You are here
      on Naben, a cold desert wasteland full of criminal activity, death, and loneliness.
      After fighting off the people who killed your only family you find yourself
      having nothing left but the two hands in front of you.<br> <br>The world is
      quickly taking a darker turn. People will die, blood will lay ways to the surface
      of the orange, gray earth. The world will burn under your feet as the people
      around you fear you. You are John, a man with a cliche name and a hidden story
      of ethics. You don't care, you control someone with no morals and he will do
      anything. John... he will burn the world down, break every bone, slaughter every
      child, and find his truth. Do you want to know what happens in the end? John
      dies. Everyone dies in the end, it's just the hard truth. I am speaking to you,
      I just wish you would listen.<h2 class="bb_tag">Included Features:</h2>Some

      and I am quick to fix them. Sorry for the disatisfaction.
