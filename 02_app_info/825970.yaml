      /><br>The Mystery of Devil''s House is a 2D Horror Action Platformer based on
      the story of the Haunted house called William''s House located in Massachusetts
      which was built during the 1950s. The former owner was mysteriously murdered
      inside the house 5 years ago by an unknown dark entity. Since then, the new
      owner of the Haunted house is pretty scared to even set foot in the house because
      of the dark history associated with it. The owner believes that there is a portal
      which leads to the Devil''s world inside the house which is yet to be proved.
      It is also believed that various rituals have been performed during the 1980s
      in the house which is the primary reason behind the increased poltergeist activities.<br><br><img

      /><br><br>The Ghostbusters Crew: International, which consists of four members,
      has been hired by the owner of the house to investigate and eliminate evil spirits
      by performing exorcisms and by various other means. Each member has special
      skills required to fight against dark and evil spirits. Annie, from Brazil,
      has a high sensitivity towards ghosts and has a unique power to sense an entity''s
      presence. Ankush, from India, is a competent Ghost-buster, exorcist and has
      great weapons. Steve, from the USA, is a Paranormal scientific researcher and
      investigator having the various scientific equipment to capture ghost''s presence
      like Night vision camera, Spectrum camera, SLS camera, etc. Tomoko, a female
      exorcist from Japan, is very competent in dealing with any kind of spirits.
      The team of four members together forms an organization called, The Ghostbusters
      Crew: International.<br><br>Will the team be able to prove the presence of ghosts
      and the Devil in the house? Will they be able to put an end to the tragedy and
      free the house from the dark entities for good?<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/825970/extras/the_mystery_of_devils_house_gif_11.gif?t=1570681959"

    review: "Yikes. This is going to sound harsh, but I hope the Devs find a way to\
      \ use my negative review constructively to improve on future games. What a pile\
      \ of unfinished and unplayable hot garbage this is. \n\nThis seems like it could\
      \ be a fun game. If it would only work...\n\nI was puzzled by the lack of reviews\
      \ for this title. I'm a sucker for cheap, indie games so I picked it up anyway\
      \ and I've had nothing but problems with it. \n\nFirst, the opening text that\
      \ sets up the story is a gigantic wall of text that made my eyes bleed. Paragraphs\
      \ are your friend! Learn them, love them, use them! It was a huge pain to strain\
      \ my eyes to read the text wall. But I did. Ugh. \n\nThis is supposed to based\
      \ off true story which was intriguing. But the actual gameplay and mechanics\
      \ were crap. \n\nThe controls were simple enough to understand. WASD or arrow\
      \ keys for movement, click to shoot, space to jump, and a few other keys to\
      \ swap weapons. I never got to swap any weapons so I'm not sure what they are.\
      \ \n\nJust getting the game past the into screen should give you an achievement.\
      \ I had to restart the game SIX times to get the intro screen to stop locking\
      \ up the game. Oof. \n\nOnce you can actually get to the part where you play\
      \ the game, everything is on high speed and it's impossible to navigate. \n\n\
      Something is clearly badly wrong with this game if it is working this poorly.\
      \ It is in desperate need of performance patches and optimization tweaks. As\
      \ it is: THIS IS NOT A FINISHED GAME. It's just some janky dumpster fire that\
      \ someone put up for sale before completing the actual development stage. \n\
      \nJust don't hold your breath for any patches or improvements. The last time\
      \ it received any attention from the developer was one month after release,\
      \ so it was basically dumped on Steam and abandoned."
