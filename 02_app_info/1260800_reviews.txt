Though you may add a virtual stationary position for when the guitars are held. it would make it easier for controllers like the vive wands to slide down the notes on high difficulties.\n\nAlso, adding a double toggle on the grip to release instruments and to set up their virtual positions, would greatly help with accidental grip inputs. those accidental inputs make you release the guitar and throws off your notes. \n\nLast, you should be getting more musical content for joining the Valve Family. In its current state, i'd say its worth $30 with more DlC in the format of music worth their natural store price from .99c to 1.99c per song.

They will be aware of your visit. you should update your catalog to match our library.","timestamp_created":1609206315,"timestamp_updated":1609206315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4//aK1vYCd5CmvgI="}
