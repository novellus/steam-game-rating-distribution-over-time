    review: 'This game is six years old at the time of writing, and it still only
      has episode 1. Be aware of that before you buy it, as it likely will never be
      finished at this rate. The game itself is okay - very short (~20 minutes to
      complete episode 1), consisting mainly of you walking around the room(s) that
      you''re in and interacting with several objects until you trigger the end of
      that scene. During these interactions, you''re subjected to some pretty cringy
      commentary by your character that tries to be funny but fails at it.


      Despite it''s flaws though, I actually wouldn''t mind finishing it if the dev
      would continue work on the game. But six years, to me, says that it''s been
      abandoned. And for that, I have to give it a negative review.'
