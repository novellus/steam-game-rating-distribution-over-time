Maybe fourier, legendre transforms, etc. That would probably make it EXTREMELY useful for College of Science applications in Universities. \n\nKeep up the fantastic work and I'll be keeping a close eye on this :D","timestamp_created":1547049634,"timestamp_updated":1547049634,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528997123241424561","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjYHWmegCdJnztwE="}
