      in a pinch. Also don't collide with the flying enemies.<br><br>In 2-player mode
      you gain 50% less energy, so that the game isn't too easy. Second player gets
      less damage, but is also slower. When you get bonus X, the first player gets
      50 energy units, while the second one doesn't, but the bonus explosion is more
      powerful than usual.
