    review: "Badly overpriced at \xA324.99.\n\nThey left out the Al Kharid theme,\
      \ and possibly one of the most loved video game themes ever composed (Sea Shanty\
      \ 2) so they certainly could have offered more value to this collection.\n\n\
      I couldn't find the album in my Steam library [i]or[/i] the Steam music player\
      \ after downloading it, so I had to find them in C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\\
      steamapps\\music and then tried them in Winamp, then noticed that the tracks\
      \ miss details like year, genre, album name, and even track listing. \n\nI'd\
      \ love to say that atleast the bitrate was good, but it's actually about 4x\
      \ too high (at 1 GB) which isn't great for downloading and storing music that\
      \ you're not going to play often. You'd be saving yourself some money and hard\
      \ drive space if you just made a YouTube playlist - and you could even throw\
      \ Sea Shanty 2 in there..."
