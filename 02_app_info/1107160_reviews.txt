When you're running around collecting coins, you can't fire. The flamethrower tower can fire just by being held down, which is fine, but it's very short range, so it's not usable as a front line of defense. May be more fun with multiplayer, since one of you could be collecting coins while the other shoots, and you can double up on shooting when you're close to losing. The button mashing killed the game for me.","timestamp_created":1588443629,"timestamp_updated":1588443629,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43Min6/ECe/iMhQI="}
