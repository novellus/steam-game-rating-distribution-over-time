    developer_response: "Hi MaverickZealot!\n\nThank you so so much for your thorough\
      \ review. We really appreciate every single bit of feedback you had for us.\n\
      \nStory: This is definitely very valuable for us. Your analysis and look at\
      \ the story gave us a lot to think about and we might rework a few lines and\
      \ expand on how we portray it. It's hard to achieve a good mix of story and\
      \ gameplay content with the way our campaign mode works, that's why we have\
      \ been focusing on the Adventure Mode more lately!\n\nGameplay: The movement\
      \ feeling stiff is definitely an issue we have been working on for hours and\
      \ hours to improve on. It is so so hard to achieve the right feeling, and we\
      \ have some plans on making it feel more tight! Thank you for your observations.\
      \ We'll also be working on adjusting battle speed in bigger battles. This area\
      \ is where fan feedback is appreciated enormously! After all, balancing the\
      \ game is extremely hard as a dev that has played the game for thousands of\
      \ hours.\nWe'll also be adding more QoL to Adventure Mode with further patches,\
      \ such as better boss balancing, being able to skip dialogues and skippable\
      \ boss intros. \nAdditionally, we hope that when we reach more active players\
      \ the online PvP will also light up a bit more!\n\nTo cap our response off,\
      \ we want to wish you happy holidays! Thank you again for your review and we\
      \ hope you'll follow the game's further development! :)\n- Gal & Daniel (12B3\

    review: "EndCycle VS is a grid-based-combat game inspired by the MegaMan Battle\
      \ Network series and is currently in Early Access. Overall, my feelings are\
      \ mixed but this comes with the caveat that the game is not finished and things\
      \ will likely change in future updates. As such, please take my criticisms with\
      \ a grain of salt.   \n\n\n\n[h1]STORY[/h1]\nThe story is told in a rather disjointed\
      \ manner. You fight through 5-6 stages as a particular character in order to\
      \ complete their respective campaign, unlock the next one, and learn a bit about\
      \ the world in the process. Here is what I gleamed from all of them:\n[list]\n\
      [*]There are two rival factions- the Crimson Force and Azure Shield. Both seem\
      \ to have fairly nebulous goals as you only get a few text boxes\u2019 worth\
      \ of info at the beginning and end of every stage. \n[*]The world is full of\
      \ Noises- dangerous creatures made from data that attack the people of this\
      \ world.\n[*]The Azure Shield are suspected of creating Noises and have successfully\
      \ tamed some Noises for use in battle. However, they also seem to be able to\
      \ \"provide infinite food and water to everyone,\" or at least they claim to.\
      \ \n[*]The Crimson Force seem to be the ones actively protecting normal people\
      \ from both the Shields and Noises.[/list]\n\nOverall, this is all interesting.\
      \ Nonetheless, the lack of coherent storytelling definitely hurts the  impact\
      \ of the story. To date, there are only 4 campaigns available with another in\
      \ the works. You do get some sense of what each character is about while playing\
      \ as them and there is some humorous banter present. However, no one really\
      \ stood out to me as being super interesting. Likewise, there are some weird\
      \ phrasings in some text boxes that made me have to reread things. As a dedicated\
      \ \"story\" mode, I would've like things to be a bit more concrete. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2334179611\n\
      \n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\nThis game focuses on combat which is all grid-based. Your\
      \ character can move freely in their colored area (blue by default) and walk\
      \ across neutral tiles (grey). You get access to three sets of 4 VOCS which\
      \ are your spells/ attacks (for a total of 12 available VOCS). Casting a VOC\
      \ makes it go on cooldown and each VOC has an individual timer. You can freely\
      \ cycle between each set of VOCS in battle. There are 4 types of VOCS and each\
      \ serves a different purpose in battle.\n[list]\n[*]Strike- for damage and Crushing\n\
      [*]Protect- heals and shield/ protection\n[*]Effect- status effects/ changes\n\
      [*]Control- affects the field and panels[/list]\nSuccessfully connecting with\
      \ an offensive VOC causes the enemies\u2019 Crush gauge to fill. Upon filling,\
      \ the character is stunned and the opponents\u2019 VOCS\u2019 cooldowns are\
      \ immediately reset. Thus, keeping pressure is highly incentivized to disadvantage\
      \ your opponent. Nonetheless, you are also able to get Crushed by your enemies.\
      \ Your Crush gauge slowly depletes over time, so learning how to skillfully\
      \ dodge attacks is tantamount to surviving after a bad move. There are more\
      \ nuances to the Crush gauge, but this is the gist of things.  \n\nAdditionally,\
      \ there are 5 elemental types; each has its own strengths and weakness to the\
      \ others. There are also various status effects that can be utilized to get\
      \ the upper hand. That being said, only a handful are explicitly explained by\
      \ the in-game tutorial. The rest are fairly nebulous in their effects (e.g.\
      \ what does \u201Cmeek\u201D do?). Likewise, upgrade prefixes aren't explained\
      \ anywhere; what do \"cyber\" and \"tough\" do? Each VOC has a level; you can\
      \ only equip a VOC of a certain level in a certain slot. These upgrades usually\
      \ add 0 or 1 to the VOCS' level so you may have 2 VOCS competing for the same\
      \ slot.\n\nMoving onto how actual gameplay feels, movement is rather stiff.\
      \ This is likely intentional to avoid dodge spamming, but enemy projectiles\
      \ and movements are rather quick and some VOCS anchor you in place as you cast\
      \ and/or have a charge up animation. Although enemies have rather obvious patterns,\
      \ getting into position and then actually hitting them is rather annoying. This\
      \ is compounded by the fact that there is no way to check your VOCS\u2019 effects\
      \ in the field which made me very frustrated on several occasions due to not\
      \ remembering what a VOC did. Likewise, once you fight 2 or even 3 enemies at\
      \ once, things get very spammy.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2334171863\
      \ \n\nThe second solo mode is Adventure mode which is a rogue-like survival\
      \ mode where you keep exploring and fighting until you die. I enjoyed this mode\
      \ a lot but there are some issues. First, you cannot skip boss intro cutscenes.\
      \ It gets to be a bit annoying having to wait 5 seconds every time before a\
      \ fight. Additionally, bosses feel a bit overtuned in terms of difficulty. Since\
      \ your drops and the map are all randomized, I often went into a boss fight\
      \ undergeared and lost since I didn't find anything I wanted from the rewards\
      \ list or, more importantly, I didn't find anything to counter the boss' gimmick\
      \ (e.g. Annoyed Bombarabara's lava field). \n\nThat being said, there are definitely\
      \ things I really like in the game. For example, there is a pretty wide cast\
      \ of playable characters. Each has their own stats, Adventure mode deck and\
      \ unique look. I also really like the VOCS currently available. Although some\
      \ are pretty basic, there are some really fun ones such as \"Jumperjet\" which\
      \ spawns a controllable aircraft to charge into your enemies with.  There's\
      \ even mod support now! All in all, I honestly think it\u2019s mostly the roughness\
      \ of the game that is rubbing me the wrong way as I still feel compelled to\
      \ keep playing.\n\nThere is a multiplayer Battle mode for both online and offline.\
      \ However, I had no one to play with offline. Likewise, online was dead whenever\
      \ I checked. It would appear that all matchmaking is handled on the dedicated\
      \ Discord channel due to the small player base. Thus, even causal online matches\
      \ need to be scheduled properly. \n\n\n\n[h1]VISUALS[/h1]\nThe game has pixel\
      \ graphics and I feel that everything is well-done. The character sprites have\
      \ a lot of character to them and reflect their full-art forms well. They all\
      \ also have a nice amount of movement of them to compliment their character.\
      \ Backgrounds are a bit basic, but there is an appreciable amount of detail\
      \ included upon closer inspection. VOC art is nice and readable at a glance.\
      \ Their in-battle effects are even better. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2334187488\n\
      \n\n[h1]AUDIO[/h1]\nOverall, I liked the soundtrack for the game. The synthetic\
      \ notes work well for this type of game. Sound effects were great as well and\
      \ combat felt more gratifying because of it. Granted, I spent most of my time\
      \ focusing on the gameplay. \n\n\n\n[h1]PERFORMANCE[/h1]\nThe game worked perfectly\
      \ well for me. There are some graphical options, but the game is far from graphically\
      \ intensive to necessitate more. However, there are some welcome accessibility\
      \ options available such as disabling screen shake and flickering and colorblind\
      \ mode for those who need it. \n\n\n\n[h1]OVERALL[/h1]\nAs it stands, EndCycle\
      \ VS is a game I feel has great potential. However, I definitely felt a bit\
      \ frustrated during my playtime despite wanting to continue. While I have my\
      \ issues with it, make no mistake: this is a fun game. As an Early Access title,\
      \ I definitely feel that this is good enough to warrant a purchase depending\
      \ on your tastes. \n\nIf you enjoy tactical and highly customizable grid-based\
      \ combat, give it a whirl. The devs also seem active in updating the game and\
      \ listening to the community with is a very big plus as well. Consider supporting\
      \ their endeavor with this game. I definitely eagerly await future updates as\
      \ I continue to play this on my own time. \n\n\n\n[h1][b]7.5/10\nWORTH A LOOK[/b][/h1]\n\
