    review: "If your reading this. Go ahead and put this into your cart. It's simple,\
      \ but polished. Wave shooting, it's a you probably never heard of but you need\
      \ to get this while its on sale. I would say its as good or even better than\
      \ titles similar ranging from 5-20$ on the VR steam store. It's similar to Tron\
      \ but also Riddick. \n\nI suggest having haptic feedback in a pad and or vest,\
      \ turn the music off, and this title will bring you into its simulation. \n\n\
      I like it better than space pirate trainer, call me crazy, but I think when\
      \ I tried space pirate trainer I was using an older setup occulus dev 2 now\
      \ im using modified htc vives on super samplings game feels good."
