I get that this isn't the same franchise, but it shares a lot of the same flaws that only barely started rearing their heads at the cusp of megaman zero. \n\nCrafting has and will always be the absolute weakest garbage in any game.  From classic games, finding Light Capsules ensures you only get meaningful upgrades and only have to revisit a level at most once to get the new thing, offering you a new route to access it. As it is now though you have to revisit levels a ton to grind random drops from level completion. It's unwieldy gristle.\n\nOutside of falling in a pit or one (nearly) scripted death, you are invincible in this game and will not die. It takes sixty seconds of running into the same spike to die, and you can regenerate your hp any time, there are no stakes. Many boss attacks are undodgable the first time through, and one of the playable characters is enormously challenging to control. Good thing you'll never die, you can soak up all the damage with impunity. \n\nIf you want to squeeze all the content out of this game you -will- be FORCED to replay each level four or more times each. What a waste. Once is ideal, two is tolerable but any more is going too far. I have a life and a library full of other games to play . The riddler trophies from Arkham Knight can kiss my ass, and so can the \"challenges\" in this game.  What a tedious grind, and you lock the secret ending and achievements behind doing almost all of it? You rude little mongrel.  \n\nAlso I really hate that they localized the word \"Diva\" into \"Muse.\" Every time they use that word (often) I feel another piece of myself cringe to death. \n\nSpoiler: I beat this game with every achievement. I'm not a paid games journo who hates games and sucks at them, I just don't like the solid inches of fat I have to chew in this steak before getting to the meat.","timestamp_created":1610161263,"timestamp_updated":1610161263,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.303250372409820557","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4meLF8vYCeNbZwQI="}
