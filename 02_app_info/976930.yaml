    review: 'I''m generally horrific at these types of games as I have the coordination
      of a shopping cart with 3 busted wheels however a few things caught my eye.


      + Wide variety of music, not just EDM blasting in your ears. Considering it''s
      EA it will be interesting to see the final line up... Or create your own in
      the song editor.


      + There has obviously been a lot of care in the staging while you are playing
      the game during the songs. The backgrounds and stage is anything but boring
      or static and it''s a nice touch and gets you amped during the song at it dynamically
      changes.


      + The devs listen and tune based on feedback. Open and willing to listen to
      feedback. This is not common these days of garbage AAA games being crapped out
      for $90 that last 4 hours.


      + Does not need a lot of polish to feel like a finished game, also rare in EA
      these days. It entered EA with more polish than many EA titles that have been
      there for years.


      Looking forward to what''s next'
