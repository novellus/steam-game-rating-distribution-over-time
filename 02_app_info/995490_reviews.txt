Of course, quality work needs time. \nThe mouse controlled \"ergonomics\" need some polishing, obviously, but that's all.\nThe atmosphere is spot on. The Lovecraftian World War II setting is really cool, some games utilize it already, it is a really exciting take.\n \nThe visuals are nice. For those PC Master Race graphics-snobs, one more time: the graphics are FINE. Really, if a game is good, better graphics (than this) won't add much. There are way too many \"puzzle\" games out there, which are really just Unreal engine walking simulators, with bare-bones linear content. We don't need those, thank you very much. This game is cool.\n\nMore episodes, more expansions! We don't need top notch graphics, especially if that's a major reason for delays.\n\nPuzzles 10/10\nSound/Atmosphere 9/10\nGraphics 8/10\nControls 7/10\n\nVerdict: simply delightful. Recommended to Lovecraft and Mystery/Puzzle game lovers. Great first episode.\nThank you and keep up the good work!","timestamp_created":1607987176,"timestamp_updated":1607987176,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwpKTgsfYCe6igugI="}
