However Close Combat: The Longest Day was like a breath of fresh air.  Not only is the game play and feel very like the original, the makers have sort of combined the Gold Juno Sword  mod into the new incarnation of the game and it is awesome!  I cannot recommend this game highly enough and the if the other recent remakes were this good I would have been extremely happy with them.","timestamp_created":1610115165,"timestamp_updated":1610115165,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tPWV8fYCcI3GwQI="}
