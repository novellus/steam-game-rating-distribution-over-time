I find myself checking every hour I'm at the computer for dungeons and to see who is online. \n\nThe one thing this game needs is more players.\n\nDefinitely recommend the game, but I would try it out on the website first, for free. Then if you like it, support the developer by picking up the steam version.\n\n","timestamp_created":1598940686,"timestamp_updated":1598940686,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528301894664764404","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw69SSpPQCfZ6LnwI="}
