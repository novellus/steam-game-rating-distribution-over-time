    about_the_game: '<h2 class="bb_tag">Nerzugal''s Game Master Toolkit</h2>This is
      the second Toolkit I have created to help out Game Masters new and old for 5E.
      Similar to the first, you will find fully detailed dungeons and one-shot adventures,
      most of which can be dropped in any traditional fantasy world with minimal effort.
      This Toolkit also comes with 100 new monsters as part of Nerzugal''s Extended
      Bestiary with numerous unique creatures as well as expansions upon existing
      types such as centaur, kobold, ogre, orc, and even bullywug and includes beautiful
      artwork for 26 of these unique monsters! In all, the Toolkit contains 5 full
      dungeons, 5 one-shot adventures, 10 puzzles, 100 trinkets, and 100 monsters
      to help develop your world!<br><br>The Toolkit was created with both novice
      and veteran game masters in mind, giving detailed guides and walkthroughs that
      are easy to follow and can be dropped into most settings. So if you are just
      looking for some new monsters to throw at your party or if you are someone who
      has always wanted to try GMing but were afraid to go at it alone, there is something
      for you within the Toolkit!<br><br><i>Converted by: </i><strong>Rob Twohy</strong><br><br>Released
      on September 11, 2018. Designed for Fantasy Grounds version 3.3.6 and higher.<br><br><strong>Requires:
      </strong>An active subscription or a one time purchase of a Fantasy Grounds
      Full or Ultimate license and the included 5E Compatible ruleset.'
