    reviews: "\u201CForever Space is a wonderful interactive story.  It's not very\
      \ long, but what there is has been told beautifully.  It's controlled by the\
      \ mouse, so it's easy to interact with everything.  But Pinhead Games has broken\
      \ out of the usual 'adventure mold', and given us a slightly different  way\
      \ of interacting with Greg and his world. If you're in the mood for a gripping\
      \ story, look no further than Forever Space!\u201D<br>4.1 \u2013 <a href=\"\

    short_description: This experimental short story is more of an interactive experience
      than a &quot;game&quot;. It is based on an original story by Catalina Leon and
      presented through key moments over several days. Play as Greg who must decide
      whether lapses in his memory are just paranoia, or something more sinister.
