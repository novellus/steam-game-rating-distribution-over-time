I've spent over 4 hours, trying to import resources to my capital in order to build the large transports to sell back to the empire, but on the logistics screen, regardless of what resource your trying to transport, Iron is the only thing that will show at the top of the page for transport. Plus, while in the market, you can't scroll down to other items to buy or sell unless you are on a desk top or have a mouse connected to your laptop, in which case I don't! I know what the developers want to do with this game, which is why I added it to my wish list a month or 2 ago, but its not ready! this game does show promise though, and I'm hoping that the creators hurry and finish this! Once they finish this, it will be awesome if you're a fan micro management like I am! Also, when the day finish, if some of your planets have a production issue or emergency, you'll be notified, which is awesome, but when you click go to it to fix it, you can't actually fix it if you have more than one planet with an issue! Trying to click on it to fix it will just show you another planet that has an emergency that needs attention! So, after all of that, then you have to go back out to the galaxy map to look for each system and planets that have the emergency and fix them, after you've been to them but was unable to correct the issues! Please fix this soon! It can be great if you all don't rush to release an unfinished buggy version.","timestamp_created":1588907346,"timestamp_updated":1588907346,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1589320523,"developer_response":"Hi Sirvictorfuqua,\n\nThank you for the feedback, I'm very sorry you have run into a few undesired issues. I take all feedback onboard and I will make sure your feedback is acted on.\n\nI can confirm to you that in the next patch there will be fixes for laptop users that do not have access to a mouse, this will include scroll bars that can be selected to scroll through each menu that needs it. These should resolve the issues you faced with the Empire Market and Logistics screens. I was not able to reproduce the issues you faced with the Iron transports but I will continue investigating.\n\nWith regards to the Planet Notifications, these too will be reworked in the next patch due by the end of May so that they are not so 'in your face' getting in the way of other notifications.\n\nThanks\nCSDev"}],"cursor":"AoJwhcGQ+fECfZiqhgI="}
