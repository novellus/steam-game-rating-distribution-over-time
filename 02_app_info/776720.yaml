    review: 'First of all, I really like this game. I''m not sure if my sanity will
      continue if I keep playing this. It''s hard, but is fun. I can scream, cry,
      and break things but still, I keep playing the game. For the price is a "Yes!"
      I couldn''t say the same for maybe $10 or $15 but this price is perfect, I still
      have to trythe multiplayer mode, but I don''t have friends, lol.


      I still don''t see glitches or bugs but if I see something bad I will update
      my review.


      If you like the challenges buy it, you will not regret for doing this ^^ Congrats
      developers!'
