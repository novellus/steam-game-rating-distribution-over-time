    review: 'I wish Steam has a third option for reviews as I wouldn''t either recommend
      this or recommend against it.


      It is an okay starter pack, but really overpriced as you get the three cheapest
      heroes in the game (which you can unlock in one day by playing a few matches
      and doing your daily challenges), and a measly amount of Platinum (hard currency
      used for buying skins).


      Note that skins cost 150, 300, 420 and 600 platinum, and you also get 360 free
      from verifying your e-mail, so you could get any skin you''d like, but if you
      want the Platinum it''s cheaper to buy it in-game.


      It''s alright when on a sale (about -75%), but buying an unused CD key has much
      more value.'
