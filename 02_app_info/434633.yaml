    about_the_game: "Brings the German transportation system embedded in typical German\
      \ towns and industries according to the respective topographic region (coasts,\
      \ the Alps, etc.). Trains and lorries are taller than they are in standard pak128.\
      \ Every building and factory has four views and each type of factory has different\
      \ aspects.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Miscellaneous</h2><br>PAK128.german is a graphics\
      \ set for the Simutrans transport simulation. It offers the player the opportunity\
      \ to set up a transport system. The representation is based on typical German\
      \ cities and industries. The timeline, also known as chronology, can be played\
      \ from 1800 and is based on the real history of Germany, for the vehicles, buildings,\
      \ routes, landscape elements and industrial chains. The historical background\
      \ can be experienced without claiming to be completely realistic. The two world\
      \ wars and other wars during this period are not displayed, even if they had\
      \ a massive impact on the economy and transport. The war economy, troop transports\
      \ and the destruction, as well as the division of Germany by the iron curtain,\
      \ simply cannot be represented. Vehicles of the FRG and the GDR exist here peacefully\
      \ side by side and can be used in a colorful mix. That was possible in real\
      \ life only after 1989 onward. However, the wars makes interrupts in vehicle\
      \ development and in the peacetime between them, there seem to be fast spurts\
      \ of progress.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Information about the graphics</h2><br>The\
      \ Trains and vehicles are thereby a bit bigger than they from the Standard-Pak\
      \ 128.Most buildings, regardless of city or industry have consistently four\
      \ views.Every Building- and Factory type has furthermore based on the region\
      \ in which it is, a different Graphics, and in the latter different operation\
      \ numbers of production.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Entry aid for beginners</h2><br>In\
      \ order to avoid the problems and pitfalls of map generation, I recommend: Do\
      \ not start a &quot;New Game&quot;, but start with &quot;Load Scenario&quot;\
      \ and load the map of &quot;Deutschland_1800&quot;. The card is big, but has\
      \ the great advantage that the money printing machine is already running.<br><br>&quot;Getting\
      \ the money printing machine up and running&quot; is what we call the typical,\
      \ not easy to master Simutrans initial hurdle. None of us Pak designers have\
      \ come up with a solution to the problem. At the beginning of a new card, Simutrans\
      \ is very difficult for beginners. It is hard to avoid going bankrupt the first\
      \ time. But as soon as the first lines are established and run profitably, Simutrans\
      \ will be very easy. On a well-running and well-rehearsed card, the player drowns\
      \ in the money. From then on it is no longer possible for the player to spend\
      \ his money. Somewhat experienced players then often complain in the forum that\
      \ the game is way too easy. But we Pak designers can't make the game more difficult,\
      \ because otherwise beginners won't have a chance and, after a little frustration,\
      \ turn to other games.<br>So the first hurdle is to get the money printing machine\
      \ running. This hurdle has already been overcome in the &quot;Map of Germany\
      \ 1800&quot; mission, the money printing machine is already running. Not perfect\
      \ yet, but money shouldn't be a problem anymore. The first thing a beginner\
      \ should do is run the map and explore the lines. For example, the supply of\
      \ coal to the slaughterhouse in Munich is still insufficient. Also inconspicuous,\
      \ but not to be underestimated, is the transport of people and mail by ship\
      \ from Passau via the Danube, Ludwig Canal and Main to Wiesbaden and Mainz.\
      \ Here one could build further connections to Koblenz, Cologne, D\xFCsseldorf\
      \ and Duisburg. As well as organizing transport to the port within the cities.\
      \ The way things are already going in Mainz and Passau. Ingolstadt and Munich\
      \ would also like to be connected to the transport network.<br>Starting around\
      \ 1800 is both an advantage and a disadvantage. It's still very leisurely. The\
      \ transport options are manageable. The first revolution in transport was imminent\
      \ in 1835 with the invention and introduction of the railroad. Making money\
      \ later won't be the problem anymore. The industrial revolution, the growth\
      \ of cities, the increasing division of labor and the resulting increase in\
      \ transport volumes are placing ever greater demands on transport companies\
      \ and their networks. The inhabitants of the cities are becoming more and more\
      \ eager to travel. More modern and more powerful vehicles are coming and they\
      \ are urgently needed to cope with the increasing demands. There will be traffic\
      \ jams. New roads and routes are necessary. Better transport hubs and control\
      \ of vehicle flows required. The problems will pile up, including in the stations\
      \ and streets. After a while, the transport network on your own map will be\
      \ just as confused, strange, illogical and grown. Just like the transport network\
      \ in Germany in reality. In any case, the Simutrans game has given me great\
      \ respect for the planners of the German transport network. In reality, a diversion\
      \ or relief route is not built as quickly as it is here in Simutrans.<h2 class=\"\
