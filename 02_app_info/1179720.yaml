    review: 'This is an amazing game. I know a couple of my reviews start like that,
      but I don''t always go out of my way to make one, but this game is truly a game
      changer.

      Its like someone took all the fun and music from Minecraft and decided they
      could do better. Coming from the company who makes DayZ, its nice to see a get
      better and better. If you like casual survival and exploration games, then you
      have to try this game.'
