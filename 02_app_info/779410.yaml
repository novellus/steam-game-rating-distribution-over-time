    review: "I played this before before become a pay game and I remember being one\
      \ of the players that played more hours. I played with a friend in duo mode.\
      \ This game has everything to be revelant and developers keep saying that the\
      \ solution is making a big youtuber to play it. Nope.\n\nThe problem is the\
      \ studio not being relevant. That problem was being solved slowly because the\
      \ player base was growing, but then they made the worst decision ever: making\
      \ a pay game. The slowly growing playerbase disappeared.\n\nThe best solution\
      \ for the studio is making it a free to play while keeping the crystal store,\
      \ of course the game won\xB4t make much money, but the game can be used as publicity\
      \ of the studio and people will look for the other games. Also the studio could\
      \ make ocasional updates because when it does, everyone who played the game\
      \ will receibe a notification of the update, so they don\xB4t forget the game\
      \ (this is why battle royale games have seasons, for making them feel not abandoned).\
      \ There are indie battle royale games being played a lot today, so the loss\
      \ of trend isn\xB4t something to worrie about."
