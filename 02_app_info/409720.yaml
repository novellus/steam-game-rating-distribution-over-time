    about_the_game: 'BioShock 2 provides players with the perfect blend of explosive
      first-person shooter combat and compelling award-winning storytelling. The halls
      of Rapture once again echo with sins of the past. Along the Atlantic coastline,
      a monster has been snatching little girls and bringing them back to the undersea
      city of Rapture. Players step into the boots of the most iconic denizen of Rapture,
      the Big Daddy, as they travel through the decrepit and beautiful fallen city,
      chasing an unseen foe in search of answers and their own survival.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul
