The game works as advertised and it is fairly fun, but it works better with fewer players when using the default settings, as 6 players have too easy a time defending their goal and the game can go on forever under the default score settings (first to 10 points). You ca change quite a lot in the options though\n\nMy main gripe with the game is the menu navigation. Basically, you can't use the analog stick in the menus even though it's what you use to move the paddle. On top of that I didn't see an easy way to customize your paddle and its powers using the controller (you need a mouse for that), it's a bit of a nitpick but if you are couch gaming you may want to have a wireless mouse.\n\nThere are tons of settings you can change to make the game whatever you want it to be. I haven't tried everything, but it seems comprehensive enough.\n\nAll in all I had fun with the game and so I'll recommend it, though this is definitely a little bare-bones and you may feel inclined to get it during a sale.","timestamp_created":1575503881,"timestamp_updated":1575503881,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sqzW6e4CfIqC4gE="}
