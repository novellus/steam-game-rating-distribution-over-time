    about_the_game: "Bunzou High School is welcoming its new first-year students.\
      \ One of them, Koshiyama Shiki, is chosen to participate against his will in\
      \ an impromptu fast-buzzing quiz meet by the president of the Quiz Bowl Circle.\
      \ As a quiet boy who loves reading and doesn't want to stand out, Shiki is overwhelmed,\
      \ but his classmate, Fukami Mari, is able to hit the buzzer and answer questions\
      \ before the full question is given. &quot;If you buzz after you know the answer,\
      \ you'll be too late. Fast buzzing can determine the winner by a margin of 0.01\
      \ seconds.&quot; As he watches her, Shiki realizes that there's a point in each\
      \ question where the answer becomes certain. With fellow Quiz Bowl Circle members,\
      \ Shiki meets the powerful rival Mikuriya Chisato, and experiences the joy of\
      \ giving the correct answer as well as the frustration of being unable to buzz\
      \ in. Koshiyama Shiki now devotes his youth to the world of competitive quiz\
      \ bowl as he strives with his teammates to perfect not only his knowledge, but\
      \ his technique.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Don't you want to become a quiz king?!&quot;"
