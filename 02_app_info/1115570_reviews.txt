On the pro side, I enjoy the music that was played and the sounds used in the game are great. There are many con's I found for this game. There was no main menu and the controls were sloppy. Very often the environment would be floating and the gameplay was hard to control when walking or fighting dragons.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNBrqfzGBkg","timestamp_created":1563557630,"timestamp_updated":1563557630,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.735970139503479004","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg4LThewCe5zYzgE="}
