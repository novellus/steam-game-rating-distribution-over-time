    short_description: Meet Matt, Freddie, &amp; the rest of the RocketJump crew as
      they film a western horserace in the style of the Fast &amp; the Furious. That
      is, if they can deal with unpredictable horses, experimental cameras, and the
      most dangerous stunts they've ever attempted.
