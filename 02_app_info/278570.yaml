      t take up too much of your day, and it\u2019s nice to see developers try something\
      \ different. This is definitely one to try for anyone who enjoys a good maze,\

    review: I enjoyed the puzzles. Some take a bit of trial and error, but not to
      the point where it gets too frustrating. Wouldn't mind playing more games with
      these kinds of puzzles.
