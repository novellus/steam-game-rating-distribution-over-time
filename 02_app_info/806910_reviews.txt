I have to say this game is damn depressing.  To the point that after a few games you just want to never play this game, the endless bad weather, the RNG that is constantly messing you up.  Trying to flee mobs that you should not be fighting early on.  I think if they stuck to the board game rather than try to create something a bit different they may have been better off.  In its current state don't was your money.","timestamp_created":1596323237,"timestamp_updated":1596323264,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw4P6R1vMCccrvmAI="}
