Although I mostly got this game for the physics and gameplay of hockey, the lacrosse that this game has to offer isn't bad. I mostly use the New Jersey Knights and crush keepers, I win 10-1. I so; strongly recommend to use a controller. This game isn't really worth $50 (maybe $30), you'll have to be lucky enough to snag it on a rare sale. I have only seen one glitch so far which I hope Big Ant Studios reads this post to fix this glitch, sometimes the player walks right through the net on a celebration, but that's about it. I hope they lower the price or put this game on sale, I don't think it has been on sale just yet. The skill level of the AI is not what you're looking for, it's the skill level of the team. That increases the difficulty. I found that there is no option to increase or decrease the players' skill level. Also, graphics are very sweet and very realistic.\n\nIn all, 9/10.","timestamp_created":1472482587,"timestamp_updated":1592950228,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwvDO8fICcKefYA=="}
