      since there are almost no player choices and there is only one ending, but it
      is a far cry from a manga and can only be experienced on a computer. The name
      for this is a &quot;Kinetic Novel&quot; -- a subgenre of Visual Novels. You
      still click through at your own pace, of course, like any other VN, as well
      as save, load, and view a backlog of what you''ve recently read.</strong><br><br>This
      is a linear story about a teenage boy named Keitaro Soseki from Kagoshima, Japan.
      It is a Slice-of-Life romance novel with lots of comedy as well. For those familiar
      with VN genres, most of the story is considered &quot;Iyashikei&quot;, but there
      is a tragic element as well. There are 20 characters with voice acting and expressions.<br><br>Character
      list:<br>Keitaro - Main character. Smart, innocent, a little shy.<br>Yuri -
      Keitaro''s younger sister. Bubbly and bright.<br>Haruko - Keitaro''s older brother.
      Sporty and mature...for the most part.<br>Noriyuki - One of Keitaro''s best
      friends. He is obsessed with girls and plays competitive video games for the
      high school eSports team.<br>Shino - A mature and reserved study-bug with a
      thing for Yuri.<br>Ayuna - Yuri''s best friend. Has an interest in Noriyuki.<br>Kadan,
      Joji, and Orino - Haruko''s friends who play for the school''s American football
      team. Kadan is a giant goofball, literally and figuratively. Joji is his loyal
      sidekick who constantly fails to prevent him from making a fool of himself.
      Orino is the wisest of the bunch, often scolding Kadan for his clunky behavior
      and trying to prevent himself from looking like an idiot in their presence.<br>Mai
      and Tomomi - Keitaro''s parents. They''re a warm, simple couple.<br><br>The
      characters all swap out for a new set in the second part of the story, except
      for Keitaro who stays present throughout.<br><br>Rinji - Another goofball, extremely
      animated (without any literal animation, of course). He frequently tries to
      impress Kasumi.<br>Takeo - Just as obsessed with girls as Noriyuki, but is a
      little smoother about it.<br>Hana - Keitaro''s cousin. She has a passion for
      spirituality and her head can be in the clouds at times.<br>Aiko - Keitaro''s
      cousin. He is a video game developer and sometimes reminds Keitaro of Noriyuki.
      He is also a passionate futurist who has complete opposite beliefs from his
      sister. They bicker easily.<br>Kasumi - Bubbly and kind. She is always smiling
      or laughing. Despite her excessive cuteness, she is smarter than she looks.<br>Keiko
      - Keitaro''s love interest. Wholesome and sweet. She has significant similarities
      to Keitaro but also complementary differences that make for a natural progression
      from friend to lover. She is as confident as he is shy.<br>Tamiko and Michio
      - Keitaro''s aunt and uncle. Tamiko is responsible and protective and Michio
      is a fun and hearty goof.<br><br>There are a series of adventures in the first
      part of the novel with Keitaro and his friends/siblings. The second part of
      the novel progresses into a more developed and committed storyline with much
      more depth to it.'

    review: 'A novel where the end is worth it more than most of the journey leading
      towards it. The game definitely dragged during the first half, but got better
      during the event linking the halves and the second half. The characters look
      rather nice and the music is acceptable.


      My biggest negatives are the complete lack of any CGs and... technical performance.
      Never thought I''d have to mention performance in terms of a VN, but the game
      appears unresponsive for seconds at a time whenever a large amount of characters
      appear and additionally when changing scenes with them. It also takes a considerable
      amount of time to even start up and save/load menu functionality breaks if you
      make the window fullscreen. I''m more bagging on TyranoBuilder at this point
      than the game, but it is easily the worst VN engine around. Supposedly it''s
      the easiest to just start using, but it lacks so many QoL features that are
      default elsewhere.


      That said, the ending is rather sweet, even if it''s already stated on the store
      page. Voice acting is also a plus that wouldn''t have expected to find here
      either.'
