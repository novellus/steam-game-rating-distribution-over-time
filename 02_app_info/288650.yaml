    review: 'I have maybe come into this in the wrong order having become a fan of
      ''Carrera Go'' in real life first which is a 1/43 Scale slot car racing system.
      But I found this very 3D and colourfully interesting and quite challenging to
      play given the variety of courses this game offers up. Many perceive slot car
      simulation to be just ''Press the ALT key and DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH!''
      but I feel this offers up more because of it''s colourful and inventive representation
      of this subject. You can set your experience level from easy to expert and the
      toughness will increase accordingly. Cars can and will ''spin'' off the track
      but replace themselves within seconds at the point of excursion. I have also
      experienced ''HTR+ Slot Car Racing'' and feel that this is more dynamic and
      colourful: Potentially more interesting but nothing is absolutely like the real
      thing [''Carrera Go''] when played on PC. A great effort though ... I liked
      this a lot :o)'
