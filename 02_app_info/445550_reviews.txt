[i][b]Watson's Watch[/b][/i] is one of those nice little games you sometimes stumble on and feel quite lucky you did.. Because these kinds of games tend to amazingly surprise, entertain and catch you in their storyline. [i][b]Watson's Watch[/b][/i] has all of these features : \n- it's an astonishing game,\n- it has a fairly enjoyable gameplay and pace, \n- it has an entirely immersive intrigue.\nIt may be still in early access, it's quite well developped as it is. No annoying bugs. Achievements are unlocking adequately. \n\n[i][b]Watson's Watch[/b][/i] is a decent little adventure game, in the detective field, putting the RPGMaker softwares to a good use.\nThe storyline is intriguing. The way the main character learns things leaves room for suspense till the end of the game. \n\nThe gameplay is good.. During the inquiry you'll fastly travel by cab through the city where the events take place, preventing you from the feeling of eternal back and forth. \nThe game pace is fine, going along with the development of the plot. \n\nThis is supposed to be the 1st episode , if I understand. \nAs a matter of fact the game feels a bit short. The end comes rather abruptly.. leaving the gamer waiting for more, impatiently waiting for a kind of sequel.\n\nThe basic idea of [i][b]Watson's Watch[/b][/i] is excellent, the plot/storyline is tricky and the game developpement very promising... \nLet's hope [b]Retro Warp Gaming[/b] the developping/editing team will be able to get back on the tracks of this encouraging game and give it its due sequel..
