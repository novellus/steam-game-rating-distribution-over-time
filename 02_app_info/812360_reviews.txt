As I'm not much of a writer, I'm adding some pros and cons based on my personal game experience.\n\n+++ Good story!\n+ Likeable characters\n+ Original monster design\n+ Good balancing (I played normal mode)\n+ Optional content for explorers\n+ I personally like the art style (monsters > maps)\n+ Music\n+ Cutscenes (kind of manga-like sequences)\n+ Good reading exercise for Japanese learners :)\n\n- Some long ways to go (ancient archive, going back to the market, ...)\n- Pacing is rather slow, thus the gameplay experience sometimes becoming a bit repetitive\n- Short dialogs, sometimes cut a bit abrupt\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed the game and can definitely recommend it if you like classic (J)RPG gameplay and storytelling.","timestamp_created":1592675051,"timestamp_updated":1592676353,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vpC66fICfO2WjwI="}
