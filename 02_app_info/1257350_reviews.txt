Yoko is a fun character to play as since she has a cool design (that modern school jacket mixed with the classic witch look is super cool) and a fun story about trying to prove she can become a true witch. I can't help but admire such determination.\n\nAnyway, The character has a nice forward shot that has decent coverage. Her friend Michael sticks closely to her and fires a single, powerful bomb blast at a time. This might not be ideal for people who are used to more rapid fire attacks, but the tradeoff means more power (I need to double-check how powerful the shots are)\n\nAnyway, if you like Trouble Witches and have been itching for more content, go ahead and by this DLC along with Yoko and the Walpurgis difficulty mode!","timestamp_created":1585293851,"timestamp_updated":1585293851,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540069699287414551","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l4+4jfECesy4+wE="}
