    review: "I was going to down vote this game just because of the RL concept, its\
      \ just not my thing.\nHowever I do like the base building and RPG aspects and\
      \ thought about giving it a try and I'm rather impressed. \nIts hard in a way\
      \ that you want to play it over again, much like how RL genres are, but this\
      \ one is different. I'd say the replay value can be there, but its not their\
      \ by default and that's where mods in.\n\nWhat I don't like about this game\
      \ currently is the ZLevel (what the developer calls it) system and can see others\
      \ commenting on this problem as well. You place a set of stairs going down in\
      \ one area and you expect it to go down in that area to the level below, but\
      \ instead the stairs going up from the next level down is placed somewhere else\
      \ at random. And you can only have one set of stairs going down/up per level\
      \ to ground floor. If you place stairs going somewhere else on the same level\
      \ it will remove the stairs you currently had placed and places it where you\
      \ want it, but going down you will see the stairs going up is still in the same\
      \ spot as last time.\n\nI really want to see more items and units added to the\
      \ game for recruitment, after a while the selection gets bland."
