I was the one of those who developed this game for GMTK Jam. And I was proud what the game was spotlighted there. But I left the development team and now I was excited to check how the game goes. I like the pros/cons type of comment so I'll do the same.\n\nPros: \n[list]\n[*] Hard puzzles. Or I'm not too smart for it. \n[*] Visual style. Especially the background. \n[*] The ball gun behavior. It's fun to play with it. \n[*] Early access. So the game will be improved.\n[/list]\n\nCons:\n[list] \n[*] It looks like there might be more sounds. I really miss some step or jump noises.\n[*] Gamepad support. Maybe, there is a way to make it work but I didn't find it. \n[/list]\n","timestamp_created":1568963968,"timestamp_updated":1568963968,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwwMfipu0Ce7nG0gE="}
