Full audible menu scheme and an impressive tutorial.\nThe simple graphics are easy on the eye and sound is acceptable.\nThe core racing game is fun with the challenge to win each race the options for a single race or championship mode.\nThe controls are simple using keyboard only.\nIt is a shame there is no real integration with Steam in relation to acheivements, Cards or Leaderboards all of which would add to the fun.\nHappy to see more games coming to Steam with the Visually Impaired in mind","timestamp_created":1594589003,"timestamp_updated":1594589003,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.564315319061279297","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4z6e6ovMCcb/ylAI="}
