The big diesel was one of GE’s final and most powerful variants of its famed line of “U-Boats” and was powered by GE’s reliable four-cycle FDL16 power plant. The six-axle diesel weighed nearly 400,000 pounds and exerted 92,500 pounds of tractive force.<br><br>Before being succeeded in the General Electric catalog by the GE Dash 7-36C, the U36C garnered orders for 125 units from four U. S. railroads – the Santa Fe, Milwaukee Road, Erie-Lackawanna, and Clinchfield – as well as two railroads in Mexico.<br> <br>Clinchfield acquired seven of the locomotives (CRR road numbers 3600-3606) in late 1971, and together with the EMD SD45-2, they were the most powerful locomotive types on the CRR. Purchased primary for coal-train service, the husky “U-Boats” could often be founding working Clinchfield’s priority manifest freights as well. As the only GE diesels on the Clinchfield, the U36Cs were somewhat out of place and in 1977 CRR swapped all its U36Cs to parent Seaboard Coast Line for a group of eight SCL SD45s. The ex-CRR U36Cs went on to serve the Seaboard Coast Line and successors Seaboard System and CSX. <br><br>The General Electric U36C for Train Simulator feature realistic details, controls, and sounds. It is dressed in Clinchfield’s final distinctive black-and-yellow livery. Accompanying the U36C in this DLC are a Clinchfield 100-ton, four-bay coal hopper as well as CRR’s noted “Santa Fe” style steel cupola caboose. And the DLC includes three career scenarios that will take you over the length of Train Simulator’s popular Clinchfield Railroad: Elkhorn City - St. Paul Route (route available separately).<br><br>The Clinchfield GE U36C: Big, powerful – and now available for Train Simulator!<br><br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios<\/h2><br>Three career scenarios featuring the Clinchfield GE U36C on the Train Simulator Clinchfield Railroad: Elkhorn City - St. Paul Route are included.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Boody Coal Haul, Part 1<br><\/li><li>Boody Coal Haul, Part 2<br><\/li><li>Elkhorn City Coal Haul<\/li><\/ul><br><strong>Please Note: <a href=\"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/1230271\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Clinchfield Railroad: Elkhorn City - St. Paul Route Add-On<\/a> is required, as a separate purchase, in order to play the scenarios featured in this add-on.<\/strong><br><br>More scenarios are available on the Steam Workshop online and in-game.
