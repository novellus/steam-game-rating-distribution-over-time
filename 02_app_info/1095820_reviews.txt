It adds a new parameter to the typical platformer by including resource management, aka your battery. Not only is the battery depleted by being hit, but also by moving, making every decision in the game a strategic one. Anyone can enjoy is game, but I find that the game truly shines on hard mode.","timestamp_created":1599580001,"timestamp_updated":1599580001,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rrqZt/QCdP/LoAI="}
