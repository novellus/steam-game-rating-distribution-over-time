    about_the_game: 'These coaches were built between 1903 and 1909 to the design
      of John McIntosh, the Locomotive Superintendent of the Caledonian Railway, for
      the Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen service known as &quot;The Grampian Express&quot;.
      They were 65ft long and built to the extremes of the loading gauge. They ran
      on 6-wheel bogies due to their weight. They were elaborately sprung, and the
      body was mounted on rubber pads to eliminate noise and vibration. They were
      also insulated with felt to further reduce noise. Fitted out to luxurious standards
      they became very popular, and also found service on the Clyde coast expresses.
      <br><br>They travelled far along the West Coast Mainline and were frequent visitors
      to Euston. One of their duties was down to the south west on the Anglo Scottish
      Westcountry expresses. The Brake Composites used on this service became to be
      known as the Taunton Brakes. Being heavily built and luxuriously fitted out,
      they had a long life lasting into the mid 1950''s. An interesting note regarding
      the roofs: the early versions were built with a roof that had a flat profile
      on top, similar to clerestory roofs, suggesting that McIntosh had intended them
      to be clerestories, but had a change of mind before building commenced and kept
      the clerestory profile. Later builds had elliptical roofs.<br><br> <h2 class="bb_tag">Included
