    review: 'I REALLY love this game as art... but not to play that much. It is a
      beautiful, from only getting slight glimpses on the planetary background of
      which this game takes place. I love the kill everything theme. It''s almost
      like Acrid from Risk of Rain 1 before landed on the planet in that game. I also
      love the smooth transition from upright to crawling. I LOVE the 3D pixel art
      and the subtle special effects.


      It is a MASSIVELY ganky though. This is enough to turn off most players. The
      starting menu is kinda blurry the options menu took me like 6 seconds to understand
      what I was looking at. I couldn''t figure out how to turn around. The crawling
      needs work. I got stuck on the second level because I died twice to guns. The
      menu inside terminals it a little weird.


      All in all, this is a good prototype. A good test run of a concept. There is
      potential, but it needs to be focused, honed, and most importantly of all, released!
      Please make this into a full game!


      P.S. the store page is a little weird. It says Zombie something as a game with
      a weird release date.'
