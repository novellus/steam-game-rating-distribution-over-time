I can see that it is an interesting concept, but there are major problems. Problem one is that your drumsticks don't rebounce from the surface as they would do in real playing. That leads to you hitting through the drum, and when you move up to beat again, you go through the drum, cause a sound, and then back down through the drum with the next strike. Sounds and feels awful. Then there is the trouble with the missing bass drum, which is emulated through a fingerklick on the trigger. Not working for me, as it completely disturbs my drumming rythm. Unless there will be some kind of pedal controller one solution would be to have the bass drum as a pattern you can set up and which loops in the background. One big problem will always be the latency of course, from controller movement to -sensing and then from collission detection to sound output. \nBut well, it IS a Beta, so let's see how the final product will work out. I'll take a break until after the next update/s. \n","timestamp_created":1533911017,"timestamp_updated":1533911017,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ44pSOkuUCep+CqAE="}
