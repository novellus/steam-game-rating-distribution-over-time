The only downside, is that it has no \"turbo\" feature to speed up the sluggish battles, and tends to bog down with farming and grinding.  Cheat engine speedhack won't even work; not that I've found anyways.  Still, interesting game.","timestamp_created":1557400912,"timestamp_updated":1557400912,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518828451633453369","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiICVzuoCeZ/twAE="}
