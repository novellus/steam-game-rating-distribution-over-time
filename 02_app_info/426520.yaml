    review: '**My reviews aren''t much to go on. In fact they''re pretty bad, but
      I try my best**

      **It''s 2AM and I''m really sorry if my review, if you can call it that, makes
      no sense**


      Yo, this movie is straight up bonkers!


      I''ve never read the book/series and the movies are my first actual exposure
      to this.

      And I''m really enjoying it.

      Dank memes aside, these movies are pretty cool.

      I mean it''s still a love story, but good Lord.


      I''m not sure what could be considered a spoiler, but

      Spoilers

      [spoiler]So yeah it''s pretty much official. Edward and Bella get married.

      But before that.

      Victoria''s "One True Mate" was killed, torn apart, and body parts burned by
      the Cullen family when Bella was attacked by her "Husband". Victoria has been
      on some kind of warpath after her husbands death by the Cullen''s.

      Then it gets crazy.

      The Volturi, an ancient Coven of Vampires meets Bella after Jacob tries to imply
      to Edward that she died.

      Edward heads to Italy to basically commit suicide, because he thinks that the
      love of his life has died, by exposing himself to humans. The Volturi would
      have found out that Edward broke a rule and he''d be sentenced to death by decapitation,
      limbs being ripped off and sent to be burned. At least from what I believe.

      But Bella comes in just in time to save Edward.

      Bella has a run in with the Volturi and is basically given a second chance at
      life on the condition that she become a Vampire. And those dudes are serious.
      There''s even a vampire that can look at you and basically leave you inoperable
      but in massive pain. It''s bananas.

      Edward is telling her not to become one. It''s not the life he wants for her,
      but Bella wants to become one to be with Edward forever. Most of the Cullen
      family agree that she turn, but one other in the family that opposes the transformation
      and tells her why.


      Jacob is part of a tribe of "Spirit Warriors". Basically they turn into big
      wolves and wreck house. Not everyone in the tribe is one, but few are.

      He''s telling Bella to not become a Vampire telling her that it would be the
      same if she was dead. Implying they already are. Walking husks that can think
      and talk.

      So he''s trying his hardest to change her mind. He announces his love for her
      and Bella enters some kind of love triangle. And Edward knows this and is willing
      to let her go if she chooses to leave.

      She also punched Jacob in the face, but broke her wrist. And Edward is absolutely
      livid thinking that Jacob hurt her.


      Then more crazy stuff goes down.

      Bella basically unites the Wolves and Cullen Family to fight this horde of new
      born Vampires bred by Victoria. Victoria doesn''t expect this and is shocked
      when she see''s what is happening. They fight and Edward kills Victoria by ripping
      her head off of her body. But Jacob is severely injured. His ENTIRE right side
      of his body is just broken bones. Jacobs regenerative ablities kick in, but
      it''ll basically kill him. The doctor, who happens to be the Alpha in the Cullen
      clan helps Jacob by rebreaking his bones to let them heal properly.


      The Volturi have some kind of hand in this and probably used Victoria to breed
      an army of vampires. Or maybe there''s innerworkings happening in the Coven
      itself. [/spoiler]


      Can''t wait to watch the next one.


      TL;DR

      Vampires and Wolves duke it out.

      Some kind of conspiracy is going on within a group.

      Love triangle with Bella, Edward and Jacob.'
