Nice looking, lots of \"advanced\" features to click and switch, some truly nice sounds, but ultimately ruined because in 64-bit mode (which I thought just about everyone had switched to) you can't move the power handle at all; not by keyboard, not by mouse.  It does work fine in 32-bit mode, but then you're back to all the hassle that comes with running in what is, effectively, restricted mode.\n\nIt also seems that Virtual Rail Creations have disappeared along the way, which is sad because they have the basis for a very good product here and I was hoping to get my hands on a BN liveried example to run over the backdated Marias Pass route, but no, denied...\n\nWill recommend for now as I'm optimistic it'll get fixed, but this is pending a response from DTG whose record for revisiting and fixing stuff is... questionable.\n\nEdit: I saw Kooth Odok's remarks on how to fix the 64-bit mode and can confirm this does work, however, it's a bit much that DTG havent't fixed it themselves.  Oh, and the dynamic brakes don't work (yes, I moved the selector ðŸ™„).","timestamp_created":1609770366,"timestamp_updated":1609780823,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vcCa5/YCcM6zwAI="}
