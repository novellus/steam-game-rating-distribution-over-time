    short_description: "Gurgamoth is a flying fighting game where the level is your\
      \ weapon. Each match is lightning quick and focuses on intense flying combat\
      \ and getting in your opponent's head. The controls are simple, but the mechanics\
      \ and interesting levels bring out the game\u2019s depth."
