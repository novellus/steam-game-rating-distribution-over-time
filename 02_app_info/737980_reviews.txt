I got this thinking it was just another detective point and click.  You know, a nice way to spend an afternoon and support indie developers.  I got that, but a lot more too.  This game was really fun.  \n\nThe game description really underplays the importance of choices.  You decide if you want to chase random items for people, what you want to investigate in a very major way and how you do it.  Once you choose, those other options are closed off and you have decided your fate.  At least until the next choice comes along.  How you handle conversations with characters can help you or hurt you in all sorts of different ways.  \n\nBecause of the wide variations in how the story plays based on what you decide to investigate, this game has a very high replayability factor.  And the \"Grimsworth Reports\" you collect are saved for your next playthrough.  Very nice!\n\nThe one drawback that wore on me a little was the fact we are playing in a very large game world and there is no map.  So if you forget how to get to where you need to be, there can be times of wandering ... and wandering.  The controls are a bit old school with you having to cycle the cursor through walk, look, interact, and run.  And you have to keep clicking the run across the sceen to move through the levels of town.  But if you can deal with that, you get a very fun game in return.\n\nSuper mild spoiler - [spoiler] find that cardboard box.  It's a life saver.  Literally.
