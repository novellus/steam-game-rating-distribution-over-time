        Notes:</strong> Requires Circuit Tools v2.9.30 or later (included). Built
        in PC based video capture increases load on the PC whilst recording. For most
        modern, machines that can comfortably run the chosen SIM racing game this
        should not be noticeable. However, if the PC is already near the limit for
        the game that is running, it may be necessary to reduce resolution/quality
        settings for VBOX Sim video capture to avoid video lagging behind telemetry.
        Alternatively, consider purchasing an external video capture device to reduce
        the load on the PC. For ultra wide monitors we recommend reducing the capture
        resolution if performance problems ensue.  Support is included for external
        video capture devices such as the Avermedia LGP Lite as an alternative to
        the built in PC Based video capture. VBO files should be opening with Circuit
        Tools v2.9.30 or later (available on the Help tab in VBOX Sim).</li></ul>

    developer_response: "Hello there, many thanks for the review - great to hear that\
      \ you've already started to make gains. Circuit Tools v2.9.30 or later is recommended\
      \ - this is accessible from the 'Help' tab within VBOX Sim, so you shouldn't\
      \ need to go to the website for it (the public release of Circuit Tools on our\
      \ website is actually an earlier version - 2.8). \n\nRegarding game support\
      \ - there is a 'getting started' section on the 'Help' tab, which offers instructions\
      \ and also provides the rfactor2 plugins when you click on 'Files can be found\
      \ here'. The only other thing required is a restart of rfactor2. For Project\
      \ Cars 2 the only requirement is to turn on 'Enable Shared Memory' in game options.\
      \ If the above doesn't help, or if you have further issues if you could drop\
      \ us a brief email at simsupport@racelogic.co.uk then we will get you up and\
      \ running reliably."

    review: 'Early adoption is always iffy.  I have gotten it to work in AC (issues
      with downloaded tracks that are not Kunos''  not registering start finish)  and
      ACC.  When it works it is brilliant and massively helpful but it has issues
      not the least is the price.  I cannot get it to work in rfactor 2 or PC2 even
      after doing the things on the website.  It really should have a pdf with instructions
      in the download  because it is not intuitive especially about needing a separate
      download of circuit tools (analysis software) from another website.  Haven''t
      tried in iRacing yet given the known bug.  I would love to see it in R3E and
      AMS2.


      The analysis tools with video is pretty awesome and helped me define a braking
      issue I was doing.  As always be careful with early access software and bugs.'
