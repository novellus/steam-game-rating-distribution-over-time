To be fair, I was put off by the dialogues between the characters, they are so basic, there is no story, character development, just a series of mind puzzles, which have average to high difficulty. So, if you want a brain teaser, this game might hit the spot. Not for adventure gamers who also care about the story.","timestamp_created":1606916162,"timestamp_updated":1606916162,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwndjqkfYCctXgtgI="}
