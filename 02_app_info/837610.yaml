    reviews: "\u201CThere are many ways this game could\u2019ve come off as just another\

    review: "TLDR - A good story but holds Lazy/Unpolished game play that becomes\
      \ tedious\n\nAs a dungeon crawler this is about as bland and uninnovating as\
      \ it gets. Honestly would only recommend this game if you are looking for story\
      \ instead of game play and even that's a long stretch considering that this\
      \ is a dungeon crawler.\n\nThe story is solid itself but the game play is where\
      \ it falls apart. At its core as a dungeon crawler it is just SO BASIC. Nothing\
      \ implemented in the game makes it distinct or unique from other dungeon crawlers\
      \ or even expanding on the basic formula. Abilities are so watered down that\
      \ they devolve into your bare bones single target/aoe/buff/heal. The mechanics\
      \ they implemented are interesting but just don't go anywhere or are not fleshed\
      \ out enough. Being able to retain your abilities while switching classes is\
      \ interesting on its own but due to the watered down abilities it falls apart.\
      \ Each character has their own unique ability that they can use when exploring\
      \ the dungeon but the game does not utilize them enough at all on top of laughable\
      \ puzzles. \n\nMaps are pretty basic as they devolve into a maze with endless\
      \ dead ends. Every single area plays out the same with 0 variety, a maze with\
      \ dead ends. It becomes so tedious, every single floor & area I went through\
      \ played out exactly as mentioned above\n\nOne thing to note are also the enemies.\
      \ The enemies in this game have ZERO DEPTH. It all devolves into spamming your\
      \ aoe's as the devs thought it would be amazing for every encounter to throw\
      \ at you 3+ enemies. Enemies and bosses will for the most part do either a single\
      \ target attack or an aoe attack. Clearly no effort put into designing actual\
      \ enemies"
