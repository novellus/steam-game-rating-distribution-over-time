    review: "I don\u2019t use databases much but was asked to manage one for a job.\
      \ Having this training included in the set was helpful. The lessons and examples\
      \ are presented well \u2013 simple but detailed. As a beginner I appreciated\
      \ a run through of the basics \u2013 just what I needed. Excellent for users,\
      \ like me, new to Access, to get familiar with objects and tables and forms\
      \ and queries, etc.  Check it out if you need some help!"
