As someone who bought the game in May 2014, I wasn't expecting such an early version.\n\nFirst Release takes you back to when the game first launched. When tools, weapons and even mining were disabled. The good old times where you could only build ships and then ram them.\n\nYou get a bit of nostalgia all while supporting the devs, which I like!","timestamp_created":1488124524,"timestamp_updated":1488124524,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.515508711338043213","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3sbIvdoCed+Zcw=="}
