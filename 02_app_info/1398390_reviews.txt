There is also some interraction with another character to progress the story. The story is simple, but nice and a little sad.\n\nOverall I recommend trying this game to relax for a day or two. It is kinda enjoyable to wait for Black Hole's cooldown and see how quickly enemy ships disappear in it.","timestamp_created":1602752652,"timestamp_updated":1602752652,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrpTglfUCeYL9pwI="}
