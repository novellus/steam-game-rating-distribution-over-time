      \ blizzards and heavy rains will put you through the various challenges.<h2\

      \ are many dangers in the wilderness - wolf packs, bears and, of course, people\
      \ who won\u2019t be as humble as you and will kill anyone for gaining some golden\
      \ nuggets. Equip yourself with some knives or a gun, survive the night and be\
      \ victorious!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Dig, mine and sell!</h2><br>Search for caves\
      \ and caverns, dig through the hard rocks and get your gold. Don\u2019t forget\
      \ to equip yourself with good quality picks, dynamite and building supplies,\
      \ or your mines won\u2019t be easy - no one wants to die because of collapsing\
      \ ceilings.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Take care of your dogs</h2><br>You will have\
      \ a dog sled at your disposal while traversing the open world of Alaska. Those\
      \ good boys need food, warmth and love from their owner. Don\u2019t forget about\
      \ customizing their equipment!"
