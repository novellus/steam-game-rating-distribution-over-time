It's fun, hours of game time, quite a large variation with styles and it's a very money-saving way to enjoy everything.\n\n10/10.","timestamp_created":1587422794,"timestamp_updated":1587422794,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530201315879821777","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkbLxzPECeverggI="}
