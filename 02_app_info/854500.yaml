    review: 'Follow my curator page for more reviews like this at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32939373]Phenix
      Emporium[/url]


      Provided the developers work to improve the movement mechanics a bit (in ways
      I''ll mention below) as well as add in a settings menu with at the very least
      audio options, then I can recommend this game.


      At its core Dawn of the Celestialpod is physics-based platformer, you play as
      a space squid that evolved from a starfish and has escaped its alien captors
      only to turn back around and invade those same alien spaceships in an attempt
      to free your space starfish brethren.  When you evolved you acquired two long
      tentacles, you launch these tentacles out to move by grappling onto the environment
      as well as using them to interact with it which in theory is a pretty interesting
      mechanic and in practice almost works, unfortunately given two specific issues
      you don''t feel in control of your squid many times especially when you are
      in a time crunch and being rushed as each time you rescue a starfish the alien
      spaceship starts a self-destruct timer and you must escape.


      The two issues with the movement system are fairly big ones, one is the physics,
      now I understand that you are in space and all that, but your squid is just
      too floaty and keeps too much momentum as well as having far too much bounce
      off of obstacles, it makes trying to maneuver in the small spaces of the alien
      ships very difficult, the level design often calls for precision but the physics
      and controls lack that.  Speaking of the controls, when you fire out a tentacle
      it seems to fire from where it currently is, so basically if you were trying
      to get through a small gap in a wall, you initially fire your tentacle in order
      to pull yourself towards the wall, then you try firing again to get through
      the small space and that tentacle just hits the wall again, and since they are
      constantly trailing behind you and take a bit to return even relatively close
      to your body, it is a bit of a mess.  Now with that said, you could certainly
      work around these constraints and learn to play with them just fine if the levels
      didn''t take place in small spaces and physics wasn''t so floaty and bouncy.  Both
      these issues combined make for an unnecessarily difficult time trying to just
      maneuver around the place.


      The other issue that very much needs to be worked on is adding a settings menu
      at the very least with audio support as well as toning down the initial opening
      audio volume, it is very loud (rip headphone users).  Also while the game does
      indeed support keyboard/mouse and gamepads it does not allow you to hotswap
      them, so if you start up the game with a controller plugged in, you cannot use
      the keyboard unless you close the game, unplug the controller, and then start
      the game back up, and vice-versa, so that would certainly be a very helpful,
      at the very least just having a switch in the settings menu (provided one gets
      added) that let you manually decide which you wanted to use.


      If this game receives the support and updates that it very much needs, then
      this could be a really fun and unique physics-platformer, I very much hope it
      does as I would certainly enjoy seeing what the rest of the game has to offer.'
