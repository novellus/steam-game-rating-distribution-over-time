    review: 'I played the original Runbow campaign only on Wii U back then, so when
      I bought the PC version, I decided to try first the Satura DLC. Turns out it''s
      good! A bit harder than the main campaign, which is in itself already quite
      hard.


      It offer a nice challenge for new and veteran players, with uniques mechanics
      to it''s zone, and a few notable levels. It''s sadly only the size of a quarter
      of the main campaign, but that''s fine, it gives just more of the same old Runbow
      experience.'
