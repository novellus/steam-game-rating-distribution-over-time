Cabin was excellent, but all the others are too dark, the physics are dog shit, it runs bad, and is obscured through think Unreal Engine TSAA fog. The setting (hanging in a cage in the top of a forest) is pretty novel, but you can't get immersed when everything is so slow and 'soupy'. You can see they have alot of ambition, but really need to learn how to use the engine. [spoiler]It's probably worth a few dollars, but maybe not 5, although that is a fair price as well, so if you like escape room games, you might eventually still get this, but don't get your hopes up.[/spoiler] https://youtu.be/O9r4YS8Wc3E","timestamp_created":1596642962,"timestamp_updated":1596642962,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.113356351852416992","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpcXV3/MCf4PNmQI="}
