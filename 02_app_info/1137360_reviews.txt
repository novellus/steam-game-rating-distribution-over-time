Every gameplay element dev has designed is developed to offer the player the hardest challenges possible. Jumping, grabbing a coin, changing gravity - they all demand you to act in a very short reaction time and ridiculously precisely manner. It has 50 levels, and I only made it to level 32 and that was my limit there. If you enjoy games like Jump King I'm sure you will like this game too. It is a short game but it has a fair price. Reward you get for beating each level is one achievement and one famous quote.","timestamp_created":1601753950,"timestamp_updated":1601756257,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rpuH+PQCdeLWpQI="}
