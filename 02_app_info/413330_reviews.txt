The soundtrack, however, only has a few. Several key themes are absent, including some from prologues and cutscenes, the overworld theme, and [i]even the song from the title screen[/i].\n\nI will [b][i]gladly[/i][/b] change the review to positive if they ever add in all of the missing tracks, some of which I'm sure many people wanted to acquire when they had purchased the OST. I simply cannot recommend it in this incomplete state, especially given that it used to cost $15.","timestamp_created":1525755616,"timestamp_updated":1525755616,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521160364151000977","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsOOHn+MCcMDynwE="}
