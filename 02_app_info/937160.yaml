    review: 'So I got this thinking it was going to be a vr angry birds type game.  It
      is.  You have three different kinds of weapons to knock down or destroy what
      seems like a lot of building levels.  I haven''t seen it all since later levels
      need to be unlocked by completing the levels before them.  It''s a great pick
      up and play for a few minutes game.  Not much else to say about it.  I''d say
      it''s worth 20$ and a nice game to get especially for friends when they stop
      by.  I''m going to be going back to this game instead of the lab whenever I
      feel like knocking down stuff.


      My only issue would be the controls for the htc vive.  I couldn''t find a way
      to change them in game.  Not that annoying, but the mine detonation is the same
      pad circle thing that turns you a few degrees in game.  Otherwise the game looks
      decently polished.'
