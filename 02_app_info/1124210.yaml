      story and characters, while incorporating an enjoyable and user-friendly gameplay

      the scenes in a struggle for power and influence. A young paladin is trying
      to survive in a dark world filled with compelling actions, drama and political
      incorrectness, while opposing factions are trying their best to outwit each
      other.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1124210/extras/B5380A.png?t=1606854718"

    review: 'This game is great, nice graphics, great story and very exciting. I look
      forward to continuing Heroes of Shaola or other games from Smiling Dragon RPG
      Studios. World of Shaola is great.

      I highly recommend to all players who love this genre of games and other players
      who play other games.

      Best regards Tael'
