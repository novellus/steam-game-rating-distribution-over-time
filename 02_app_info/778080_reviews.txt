It's a shame because the game looks interesting and I saw an update that recently happen in NOVEMBER 2019, after reading all the comments people posted and the reviews I had some hope but when I launched the game I repeat literally nothing happened. Sure the game loaded up, but that was it... the keyboard/controller for this game doesn't work at all, I was spamming all the buttons on my keyboard and all I found to work with the game is NumPad plus+ (which just speeds up the game from 30-60 fps to over 100+ frames per second) and the F1, to F12 worked... I tried disconnecting, restarting steam, the common solutions and still nothing just stuck at the main menu which for some reason now does a weird BASS BOOST. Please fix this the state of this game before releasing it on steam, it's not even funny bad, same goes with the port being terrible, having to save state which I thought people was making up, but no you actually have to save state and besides that again controls not even working... disappointed and requesting a refund. \n\nAnother thing I want to mention is the god damn price of the game, who thought £10.29 is a great deal/price for this game, it's an old game from the 90's for starters a lot of them are usually around 3.99 or slightly more secondly the sale which is half price should be at least 3.99 or a bit cheaper, if you want to make money make the game cheaper, fix the problems people are having, do better sales there are so many things you can do to make the game better.\n\nI'm keeping the old post here, because I was quite negative with the game... But I purchased it again on sale (for Christmas 2020) the current price drop they've put it on which is £3.60 Is a bargain. The game works, at last it's improved, no longer looking like an emulation, just an classic game. As you can see many people haven't updated their post, but I'm going to update mine. Couple of things I didn't like is the fact, that you can't adjust the settings slightly, there's a bit of slow down but no frame drop, which could just be cause it's old game and also it's emulated so what do you expect? The ps1 memory card issue has finally been fixed, controls are finally working, you can customise your controls in game or the menu, which the menu is quite useful to customise. Overall this game has been improved, and I do recommend it for the hard work they've finally done and didn't leave it to rot like companies do. Another thing is it gives you various options on the main menu, which you can change the to stretch the screen, have it windowed, even old TV effects which is nice. I don't like the two borders on both side of the game though, was hoping I could just have full stretched screen to make it like a proper ps1 game and not obvious it's emulated/kinda arcadey.","timestamp_created":1577583127,"timestamp_updated":1609080758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535459280014038086","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7/ur0vYCef315wE="}
