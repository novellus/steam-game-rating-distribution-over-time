    review: Game of my childhood :D Im really disapointed that we dont have first
      one on steam, but that doesent metter cause we have Chicken Invaders 2, 3, 4,
      5 + DLC for every game, we have easter DLC, christmas DLC... When all games
      are boring at the moment, this can be interesting like it was interesting for
      me cause im writing this at 15.9.2020 in fucking 5:17 AM xD...
