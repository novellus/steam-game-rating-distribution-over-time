    about_the_game: <strong>Power Supplied</strong> is a multiplayer puzzle game,
      a one-to-four player game where four characters are simultaneously controlled,
      with each having individual and unique abilities to help them along. The end
      goal is to get to get everyone to the end of each level, working together with
      your friends to solve the challenge presented before you. You'll need your wits
      about you, as the constantly changing path of doors and routes will mean passing
      over the same ground many times in a level to try and reach that one last lever
      needed for your freedom.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>
      40 levels of increasing difficulty to keep you challenged and playing for hours.<br></li><li>
      One to four players, dynamically adjusting controls as controllers are added
      or removed.<br></li><li> Each character has unique methods of traversing the
      map, from water pipes to using fans to reach far-off ledges.<br></li><li> Death
      results in only a minor setback to the nearest safe location, to minimise punishment
      for bad moves on long levels.</li></ul>
