But two problems that kill this for me. \n\n1. its a old ass game yet it has an interface bug that is very annoying. sometimes after a battle the entire interface just disappears and i have to exit the game and come back into it to fix it. \n\n2. the campaigns have no option to do short or long. they are all just long AF. People should have the OPTION because there are going to be factions that bore you. so by the time you get to the DLC ether A you decided not to try every faction or B you are bored and the game has gotten tedious. It does not matter how good you are its a very long grind if your achievement hunting. which is not something i am into. \n\nthere are some other things to mention. but they are small things that are going to just come with total war things. like certain units being very OP and some being way to weak for what they historically are. some menu and information preferences. \n\nBut if it was not for those two numbered things i listed above. this would have gotten a thumbs up. i still am a loyal total war fan.","timestamp_created":1609963066,"timestamp_updated":1609963066,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqdrR7PYCcZOMwQI="}
