[/h1]\n\n[b]What It Is:[/b]\nYou put mines...on golf balls!\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nIt's actually more complex than it lets on, with you being able to place about a dozen mines and activate them at different times. I found quite a lot of alternate routes and shortcuts on holes.\n\n[b]Controls:[/b]\nA bit odd, you rotate the camera and place mines. You then use hotkeys to activate those mines, flinging you golf ball across the field.\n\n[b]Difficulty:[/b]\nThe beginning it pretty easy, with later levels really challenging you on getting that hole in one with proper mine placement and timing.\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b]\nAbout as good as any other golf game, though the saturation is a bit jarring at times.\n\n[b]Audio:[/b]\nIt's neither here nor there. Decent explosion sounds, average golf noises.\n\n[b]Replay Value:[/b]\nMild replay value, although the charm wears quickly when going for hole in one plays.\n\n[b]What I Like:[/b]\nUnique idea, easy on the PC.\n\n[b]What I Don't[/b]\nSome levels start the ball in a poor location for mine use. Primarily an issue with loop-de-loops, which don't work properly with the directional force you can give.\n\n[b]Judgement[/b]\nI would opt for Golf with Friends, but this is a better solo experience if you aren't looking for a minigolf game with tons of content and a creation kit. So worth the buy if that interests you.","timestamp_created":1528146074,"timestamp_updated":1608110571,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43/+2tfYCcdWOogE="}
