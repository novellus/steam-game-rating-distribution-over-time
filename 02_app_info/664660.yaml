    review: This game annoys me. It covers only four real transporters, and the rest
      are "nanobots" (so they can transport chemicals in both directions). And these
      two-way transporters work ONLY from higher to lower concentrations, rather than
      evening the concentrations in an only statistical sense, like in real cells.
      In that sense, I'd consider it "educational" only in the barest sense, and it's
      not super-fun as a game either -- but it could be. The only reason I'm voting
      "yes" is that with so few reviews a negative one would be devastating, and I'd
      like to see this improved upon. Surely a more complicated (and more realistic)
      cell-management game could be a lot of fun AND very educational.
