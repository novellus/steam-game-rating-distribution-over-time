    review: "This is a great game and I consider myself to be quite picky when it\
      \ comes to 4X type games. I love the building up of an empire but dislike games\
      \ where the combat is too simple. \n\nThis game is visually beautiful and when\
      \ the Eclipse comes the entire landscape darkens adding to the atmosphere of\
      \ your empire beings stalked by Pandora's natives. The factions are limited\
      \ in number (I'd like a few more). The technological progression is interesting.\
      \ \n\nThe combat is unusually better than the standard one-on-one combat seen\
      \ in Civ type games for a number of reasons: \n1. The unit variety is actually\
      \ quite large. There are biological units, human ones and mechanical ones. They\
      \ come in large and small, terrestrial, aerial and water-based. \n2. Customisation\
      \ multiplies this variety by allowing you to create ranged artillery, offensive,\
      \ defensive and special-type units. \n3. The designers have added a the ability\
      \ to have combined arms with ranged combat, and to have other friendly units\
      \ adjacent to the enemy assist in attack or defense. This is usally overlooked\
      \ by designers of Civ type games (preumably because it takes alot of effort\
      \ to develop) but in my view is a 'must-have\". \n4. Units can stack, yet there\
      \ are mechanics which can counter and deter stacking. \n5. Then there is the\
      \ effect of terrain which has an enormous impact on combat. And these effects\
      \ vary with the type of unit.\n\nIt seems to me the developers of this game\
      \ have gone out of their way to create something that appeals to the tactical\
      \ and strategic wargamer, not just the civilisation builder.\n\nThis is a fully\
      \ developed game and I think it is worth the price, the DLC being essential.\
      \ I would love to see further development of this game. It is very unusual and\
      \ very good."
