The graphical engine needs tweaking because the game continuously lags and stutters despite my system having a RX 590. The puzzles and errands are too easy to figure out and the game can be beaten in a matter of 30 minutes. All in all, this game is not worth it. Save your time and money until they drop the price to 99 cents.","timestamp_created":1591094029,"timestamp_updated":1591094029,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.600302040576934814","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rIWmuvICf9feiwI="}
