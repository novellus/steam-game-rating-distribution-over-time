    review: 'Doesn''t even support regex, I didn''t even thought what app called "Renamer"
      could possible not support it.


      I had bunch of files named this way:

      [list]

      [*] "1-GJUDHG.png"

      [*] "2-KDEJKG.png"

      [*] "3-CNWUR.png"

      [/list]

      And I wanted to turn them into this:

      [list]

      [*] "1.png"

      [*] "2.png"

      [*] "3.png"

      [/list]

      It can be easily done with regex using this: "/([0-9]+).+/ " with "$1" substitution.


      There also no settings to change interface which is simply too small unless
      you have it open in full screen.


      On top of that it does not seem like developers even bother to answer question
      in Discussions.


      Search for "regex file renamer" in github, there tons of apps/scripts which
      does same thing but also support basic features, open source and free.'
