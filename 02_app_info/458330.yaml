      generates each creature''s pixel-art body.</h2>The shape, or morphology, of
      each animatroid or fungol is determined by its genes. Genes control the bending
      of internal <i>bones</i> or <i>branches</i>. Pixels cover the bones to create
      the shape of the body. The shape of the body and the number of different pixels
      determine the <i>physiology</i> of the life form.<h2 class="bb_tag">Pixels and
      body shape determine biological function: <i>hydration, nutrient use, movement,
      perception...</i></h2>Each life form has a metabolism that processes <i>hydration</i>
      and <i>nutrients</i> at a rate determined by the <i>metabo</i> gene. The larger
      the life form (the more pixels in its body), the more hydration and nutrients
      it will need each metabolic cycle. <i>Surface area</i> determines how much hydration
      each life form evaporates. The more wrinkled the body is, the more surface area
      there is.<h2 class="bb_tag">Simple graph-shaped brains create emergent behavior:
      <i>fear, aggression, attraction...</i></h2>A simple set of rules, derived from
      genes, controls the behavior of each animatroid. Animatroids have external sensors
      (<i>motion/scent/water</i>) and internal sensors (<i>hunger/stress/thirst</i>).
      Animatroids'' brains have attraction/repulsion relationships between these sensors.
      It is these relationships that determine each animatroid''s behavior.<h2 class="bb_tag">Natural
      selection and breeding are the only way to evolve your life forms - <i>unless
      you &quot;cheat&quot; with genetic engineering!</i></h2>Your animatroids and
      fungols will evolve over many generations into new species. The genetic code
      of each life form is passed down to its offspring during reproduction, with
      a chance of mutation. Evolution is a slow process. To speed things up, try crafting
      and drinking a lot of sugary beverages. Toxic waste can also be useful (and
      dangerous!) It can cause drastic mutations in offspring.<h2 class="bb_tag">Export

    review: I love trying to figure out how to succeed.  I love hearing the soundtrack
      while I am working, on my real life work...  I think I have become a fantastic
      fungol farmer, and I am happy... in a sweetly muted, pixelated kind of way.  If
      you like games that are chill, come back later and see what grew, and also if
      you love genetics of any kind, you will be happy you have this game.
