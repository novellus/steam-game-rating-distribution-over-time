Other than that the game bugged out causing my mouse sensitivity to be extremely high also making the game basically unplayable. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.","timestamp_created":1586188169,"timestamp_updated":1586188169,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1587821442,"developer_response":"Hi!\n\nI am sad to hear that you did not like the game! Been working on it for 2 years, but controls are something I know have to be remade from scratch.\n\nIt is however weird that you could not get pass the egyptian level? I have had over 200 people try the game so far and all of them has been able to finish the game?\n\nWould appreciate if you could elaborate further on the \"car issue\".\n\nI run 4 companies in my daily life so I have not had as much time to update the game, but I will recreate many things before the summer starts."}],"cursor":"AoJ48tWLqPECf/HU/gE="}
