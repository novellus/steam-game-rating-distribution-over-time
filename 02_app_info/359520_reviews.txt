It was a mistake because it turned out that the weapons were easy to research. As you progress with your level, you will get stronger guns for free. Sure you get a 25% credit bonus by using the gun but whats the point if you are not competetive on the high levels? \n------------------------------------------------------------------\noriginal 2015 review:\n\nDont expect this DLC (just like the other 2 DLC) to enrich your game experience! All weapons in this package are effectively available for free in the game. They can be purchased with silver, a currency generated by your play activity. The only  difference featured with this package that is worth to mention is the reload speed, which is marginal. (10% faster)\nI will not review the weapons that are in the package - at least not as the game is still in the beta phase and weapon characteristics may still be changed.\n\nWhy do I still recommend this package?  Vostok Games, the developer of Survarium, in  my opinion established a premium weapon  sales model that is not pay2win.  What you basically do here by purchasing of one of these DLCs is crowdfunding.  Survarium is the spiritual successor of the Stalker series and a good number of  its former developers now work on Survarium. Because Stalker was a fantastic game, It means a lot to me to support these peopleÂ´s future.\n\nWe can not expect Vostok Games (an indie developer) to create a triple-A title quality-like  MMO survival shooter with the little resources they have.  Thats why it gives me a good feeling to support them now.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease leave me a comment in case that you didnt like something about the review so i can improve it.","timestamp_created":1429033673,"timestamp_updated":1555268407,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":46,"votes_funny":16,"weighted_vote_score":"0.640131950378417969","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47ZHOjuoCfsLMOg=="}
