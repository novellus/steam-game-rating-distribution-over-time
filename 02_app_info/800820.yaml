    review: "OK, it\u2019s time to address an elephant in the room. This VN is overflown\
      \ with sexual violence in all forms, mostly played for laughs, or at least taken\
      \ as if it\u2019s not a big deal. And all the \u201Cdeep philosophical meaning\u201D\
      \ it supposed to have (which is of course an incomprehensible mess of early\
      \ 20-th centaury \u201Demotions are corporeal!!\u201D occult parapsychology\
      \ and poorly red  \n[strike] Wittgenstein [/strike] wiki article about Wittgenstein,\
      \ covered under 999+ layers of sci fi-ish technobabble) couldn\u2019t \u2013\
      \ and, honestly, shouldn\u2019t \u2013 change that. \nAnd that is honestly even\
      \ not the worst thing about this VN.\nWhat actually scares the hell out of me,\
      \ is that literally non of the other reviewers cared to mention this in their\
      \ reviews. Including the guy from \u201CChrist Centered Gamer\u201D."
