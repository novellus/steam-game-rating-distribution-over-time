I was looking for a dungeon crawler type game with persistent progression.  This game scratched that itch, except I didn't expect the difficulty to be so intense.  Some things that made me quit playing is getting stuck on walls that don't appear to have protrusions, sometimes when getting hit by one rolling guys it would register the hit multiple times and getting one hit killed, and sometimes the controller didn't register when I tried to dash out of the way of an attack.","timestamp_created":1609655823,"timestamp_updated":1609655823,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qdW94/YCcOb9vwI="}
