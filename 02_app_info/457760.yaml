    review: 'I know that this game has mixed reviews, I would encourage anyone who
      reads this to read both the positive and negative reviews, both apply. As for
      myself, I loved the game!


      The background is set in a dystopian future where FTL travel, and more importantly,
      instantaneous communication across unlimited distances have changed everything.
      Human built AI have surpassed and eclipsed humanity, and Tolva is occupied by
      competing AI factions to determine the source and purpose of a mysterious signal.
      The included manual provides a very well thought-out prelude to the environment,
      and if you are old school like myself and like manuals, this game has you well
      covered.


      TSFT will not hold your hand, it is obtuse. Figuring out how it works is half
      the fun, but essentially, you have to blast your way across Tolva, scanning
      for resources and data as a hacked AI host and taking over bases. Gunplay is
      where this game shines, it looks cool, it sounds cool, and blowing robots to
      hell never gets old (for me anyway).


      I''ll break this into pros and cons, and will say that this game, while definitely
      up my alley, may not be to your tastes.


      Pros:

      Gunplay is fun. Battles between factions, when they occur, are beautiful to
      watch.

      Atmospheric and immersive.

      Mysterious.

      EXCELLENT artwork all around (sound, graphics, animations, all very well done!)

      Decent music.

      World is well built, has a very creative back-story.

      Once you understand how it works, it does not take long to get back into it
      and have fun. It is simple, in a good way.


      Cons (in order of severity, worst first):

      Game is not well optimized, I''m seeing marginal framerates on high-end PC''s,
      and terrible framerates on low-end systems.

      World is too open for the amount of AI that inhabit it. You will spend a lot
      of time running. If the title were to be optimized and the AI population doubled,
      my guess is that the "Mixed" review status would change to "Mostly Positive".

      Could use more variety, more enemy types, more weapons, more special equipment.

      Game has a "capture-the-flag" feel (a core mechanic is that different AI factions
      can assault and take over bases), but there is really no way to fortify the
      bases you take. Bases you assault generally never have more than 4 bots defending,
      could definitely use more (perhaps a result of the sub-par optimization).

      Game is short, can be completed in 7-10 hours for someone with mediocre FPS
      skills like myself, though I like the occasional short game in my library that
      I can play through over and over, so for me this is not a big issue.

      The storyline that you are feed from the signals you retrieve is too obtuse.
      I played through the game, read most of the manual, and still don''t quite understand
      it.


      I''m going to give away my age here, but this game reminds me of a game I loved
      as a child, Lucasart''s "Koronis Rift". I don''t know why this game reminds
      me of that title so much, but it is a good thing!


      In conclusion, watch a few videos before you purchase this. "Worth a buy" on
      YouTube has a pretty good review, though I disagree with his thumb-down, it
      is a fair review that I believe is a fairly accurate description of the pros
      and cons of this game, and is pretty close to my own review here. Big Robot
      also has another great title, "Sir You are Being Hunted", that is worth a look
      (I am not paid or employed by them, just a fan of their work so far). I grabbed
      this on the Steam winter sale for about $5, at that price it was an absolute
      steal.
