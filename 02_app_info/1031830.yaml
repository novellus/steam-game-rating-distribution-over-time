    review: "The concept of Contructionary is brilliant, but some issues make it feel\
      \ like an unpolished/unfinished game:\n\u2022 Unable to add an own wordlist\
      \ so you can\u2019t add words for other languages or have a play session with\
      \ words from a certain category like \u201Cname the TV series\u201D, etc.\n\u2022\
      \ You can teleport all over the place even out of the virtual room where the\
      \ game is played and it's too easy to teleport by mistake making it frustrating\
      \ for users new to VR. If they accidentally push down on the trackpad or touch\
      \ the thumbstick they can be miles away from the play field and not know how\
      \ get back while the timer is ticking. A simple recenter button would be much\
      \ better.\n\u2022 Would like to have a setting to enable resizing of objects.\
      \ Maybe as a separate game mode.\n\nI\u2019ll give this a thumbs up since it\
      \ can be fun to play with friends and the price is reasonable, but I really\
      \ hope custom wordlists will be added and teleporting issues will be addressed."
