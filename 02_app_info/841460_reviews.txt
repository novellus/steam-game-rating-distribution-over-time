Most of the characters' animations are motion-captured performances, though there are plenty of character movements that are stilted and robotic, which were obviously manually-animated.  The characters are cartoony, but expressive.  And don't let the character designs fool you... this story is not for young children.\n\nThe game controls your perspective, allowing you to look around and even move your head through the world.  The ability to change the position of the camera is the key difference between a 360ยบ 3D VR recorded video and an experience like The Great C that runs with a game engine in real-time.\n\nThe game constantly changes the stereoscopic base of the in-game camera, causing the game world and characters to have bigger or smaller scale.  I'm not sure this is a great idea and I consider this an experimental thing to do.  I'd have liked an option to view the game from a perspective that maintains stereoscopic settings that create a realistic scale, but it doesn't.  The two options for camera pertain to whether the camera makes \"cinematic\" movement through the scenes.\n\nThe story is the typical \"humans suck\" post-apocalyptic dreck that has been done to death.  The plot and setting didn't appeal to me, but I enjoyed the characters and I wish there had been more conversations and interactions between Tim and Clare.  The great facial animations drew me into them.\n\nOriginally, I thought the art for The Great C had two dudes on it, but the person on the right is Clare and she's married to Tim.  It's unusual to see a young couple that is already married in a piece of modern entertainment, which prefers to depict the excitement of courtship rather than the stability of matrimony.  Their relationship status probably comes from the original short-story, but it was interesting to see nonetheless.  I also liked that Clare was not a hard-charging 'bad-ss' bending everything to her will.  No, she was feminine and vulnerable in this world, which goes a long ways towards making you actually care about a female protagonist if she's not going to just easily annihilate all obstacles she may encounter.\n\nLastly, please ignore the negative reviews from terrible people using the Steam review system to make their excremental opinions public.  That one review from a grug-brained troglodyte claiming this \"doesn't do anything to take advantage of the VR medium\" is an absolute lie.  The experience is viewed in an immersive way with a VR headset.  That is inherently taking advantage of VR!  And just like how he gives no specifics on how the story is \"boring,\" he also gives no examples of how this cinematic experience could have \"taken advantage of the VR medium\" to his satisfaction.  That low-IQ review is disgusting.","timestamp_created":1609748906,"timestamp_updated":1609748906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgeCg5vYCeYyqwAI="}
