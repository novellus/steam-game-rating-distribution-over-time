    review: 'Point and click adventure games been my favorite genre since the nineties,
      and i loved this game.

      Some might be put off by it''s graphics, and will say it will look like a turd,
      but if you give it a chance there is a nice diamond hidden beneath.

      There is one point in the game where you have to make a decision that leads
      to 3 possible endings, the rest of the game isn''t that difficult although it
      has some pixel hunting, but you can also use the ? button to show the hotspots.

      The game is a bit small (if you made the ending for the first time you can get
      the other endings in like 15 minutes) but when it''s your first time, you will
      enjoy it for a bunch of hours.


      I made a maximum score walkthrough with the help of the dev, who has been very
      friendly (and unfortunately has no plans for a sequel), so check the community
      guides if you get stuck.'
