It has a fantastic story about an explorer robot (who looks a lot like Wall-E, indeed) that gets stranded on a foreign planet and tries not just to escape it, but also understand its life and life in general. The atmosphere is great and the game is a neat combination of resource gathering & crafting, layered on top of an arcade platformer. All wrapped in a nice philosophical layer. The side-characters, like the two talking motherships and your sidekick, Ani, have dialogue that varies from cute to deep and while they're sometimes annoying, they move the story forward in a natural way. Furthermore, its graphics have aged well.\n\nHowever, there's a reason why I've claimed ''the first part of the game'' got me hooked. And that reason is that Phoning Home is an indie game and you will notice it quite soon. It's bug-ridden to the teeth, and often clunky and unclear about objectives and mechanics. Ani gets stuck a lot, must be protected all the time and makes the game unecessary long. And so do the absolutely boring quests in the second part of the game (most of them with ''gathering'' mechanics) and the horrendous level design with invisible objectives and poor hit boxes. After the lush forest from the first part and the confusing, but surprising desert in the second, the last two parts leave you with poorly designed mines and a ''winter area'' that simply suck the fun out of the gameplay. And that's not even mentioning that ''island hopping'' mission. All while the game doesn't offer you a map, only a primitive scanner (which can get jammed in some levels).\n\nWith proper testing and a bit more ''baking'', Phoning Home could have been a classic. Sadly, the fact that it isn't is all its fault.","timestamp_created":1609676618,"timestamp_updated":1609678598,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw98WU5PYCet2GwAI="}
