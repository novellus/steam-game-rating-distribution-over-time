    about_the_game: 'DeMagnete VR is a puzzle adventure inspired by magnetism, built
      from the ground up for virtual reality. Use your magnetic-powered gloves to
      solve puzzles and make your way to the top of a mysterious underground cavern.
      DeMagnete VR presents a variety of original magnetism mechanics that evolve
      with every chamber, as you find out more about what happened around you.<br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Unique Magnetism Mechanics</h2>In DeMagnete, each hand
      controls one magnetic pole, Positive and Negative. You use your hands to interact
      with objects in the environment, following basic rules of physics and magnetism:
      opposites attract, but likes repel. There are a variety of magnetic objects,
      like boxes, barriers, propulsors, etc. Each puzzle is built combining these
      objects and real physics rules to create new mechanics.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/995270/extras/DeMagnete_GIF_03.gif?t=1609770738"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Progression-focused virtual reality gameplay</h2>Our goal
      with DeMagnete is to create an experience that not only immerses the player
      and makes use of the best that motion controls in VR have to offer, but also
      gives the player the sense of mechanical progression that gamers expect. DeMagnete
      VR is an experimentation of magnetism and physics-based mechanics that evolve
      and deepen over 40+ puzzles.<h2 class="bb_tag">Secrets</h2>Those who likes to
      do some exploring may end up uncovering secrets that reveal more of the game''s

      unfolds as you interact with the environment and your companion, Q. Voiced by
      the award-winning actress Ashly Burch, Q is the mysterious keymaster AI which
      controls the whole place and guides you through its chambers. Uncover the secrets
      hidden in the rock walls while Q leads you somewhere deep into the cavern.<h2
      class="bb_tag">A mysterious cave, a lost dweller and a lonely companion</h2>The
      story of DeMagnete centers around your character, D, and you have to find out

      cavern, you discover the truth about what happened there, and the role Q and
      yourself play in it all.'
