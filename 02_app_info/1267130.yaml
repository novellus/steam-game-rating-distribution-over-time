    review: Axe Girl is a steam videogame featuring a rush of relief drowned with
      a classic twist of monologue that drives the player insane...a simple tone of
      sincerity finish feeding great level design that digs another can of hesitated
      tentative wrinkles of oozy bubble worlds that stood the trip well...contentedly
      devouring boss battles surprising gentleness wiped with greatly entertainment
      trek into fashion i give this game a 10/10 a garnish bold of treatment into
      a bitter glass axe bottle of arrangement and skills really recommended love
      the burrito master!!!
