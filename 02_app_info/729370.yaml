      \ /><br><br>Klaus is a 2D puzzle platformer with a self-aware narrative. Its\
      \ design takes inspiration from classics games combined with a tense and emotionally\
      \ engaging story.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">\u201CI DON\u2019T KNOW WHO I AM\u201D\
      </h2>Klaus discovers his identity while trying to escape from a mysterious basement.\
      \ Through his journey he\u2019ll discover who he is, what &quot;Klaus&quot;\
      \ means, and how he ended up there. While jumping spikes, hacking computers\
      \ and avoiding danger, Klaus seamlessly interjects with key elements of his\
      \ story, which develops naturally while you play.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/729370/extras/01.png?t=1587515231\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">4TH WALL BREAKING MOMENTS</h2>In KLAUS, you\u2019re\
      \ not  playing as the title character; rather, you\u2019re his companion. Klaus\
      \ acknowledges your presence and wonders aloud about his escape and how he found\
      \ himself trapped in the first place. His personality can be volatile in vulnerable\
      \ moments because Klaus has his own agenda. Oh, and Klaus might not always want\
      \ to do what you want. After all, who wants to die due to someone else's mistakes?<h2\
      \ class=\"bb_tag\">K1, THE FRIENDLY BRUTE</h2>During your journey, a &quot;friendly&quot;\
      \ guy called K1 might join you on your journey. K1 is a brawler, at least in\
      \ part, and with his destructive prowess he\u2019s able to smash obstacles and\
      \ do Shoryukens without breaking a sweat. Klaus and K1 can be controlled separately\
      \ or cooperately to solve puzzles, although sometimes they\u2019ll be split\
      \ apart. Each character, of course, has his own motives.<br><br><br><img src=\"\

      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">REMEMBER THE PAST</h2>Throughout the game Klaus will\
      \ remember his past through interactive memories. Each memory is playable in\
      \ a unique way with different mechanics than other sections of the game. Just\
      \ like in real life, the dreamy worlds of the memories don\u2019t follow the\
      \ same rules of the rest of the game.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/729370/extras/04.png?t=1587515231\"\

    review: "Nice platformer game.\n\nLevel design is good, not too hard. You die\
      \ here and there.  \nStory is meh. If you expect a great story this one is not\
      \ for you.\n\nOverall I had fun, totally worth it on sale and if you want to\
      \ support the devs, you can buy it for full price of course.\n\nP.S.: I recommend\
      \ you to play with a controller because playing with keyboard can be a nightmare."
