      /><br>It''s the year 2112. A hundred years following the apocalypse, humans
      quickly rebuilt a new world while developing science and technology. Earth,
      at this time, became a perfect Eden. Despite this, humans continued to be possessed
      of madness and desire. Wars, crime, and killings still continued.<br><br>In
      2113, due to the demand for new weapons of war, a program surrounding cybernetic
      technology was initiated. A group of specially selected girls was sent to a
      secret research facility for body modifications.<br><br>In 2115, a mysterious
      meteorite from deep space was detected approaching the Solar System. Some scientists
      predicted it would hit the Earth in three years. Humans were so afraid that
      they tried everything they could to prevent this from happening.<br><br>In 2116,
      analysis of the incoming meteorite revealed something even more frightening:
      the presence of many unknown life forms and suspected viral substances on the
      meteorite. Even if humanity survived the meteorite hitting the Earth, the world
      would be destroyed due to these mysterious life forms and viruses.<br><br>Near
      the end of 2117, just before the meteorite is due to hit the Earth, three of
      the girls who had their bodies modified as weapons are sent, along with all
      the hopes of humanity, to destroy the meteorite and save mankind...'
