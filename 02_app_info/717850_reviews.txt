The writing is amazing and the characters are believable and i often find myself wishing i lived in this world. At first i had thought that it was just a little short but the more i delved into these routes and backgrounds the more i realised i insanely wrong and each character from the wacky and completley unbelieveable are written out so well with thier backgrounds and feelings. I did feel a little bad about some route endings, without spoiling i'll just say it made me personally wish i could of made a different choice.  The other story routes such as elf and man or dragons treasure i feel were just amazing in the aspect they went into even more depth. I was literally stuck at my computer just going and going for hours on end not wanting to stop reading or learning about the characater you have created. I wait impatiently for the next releases and you have made a life long customer and turned me into someone who is completley looking through thier steam shop for more stories like these.  i would highly recommend these for anyone who has never read a Visual novel before or just been curious. lifes not fair and i still to this day wish i could find a wish making creature and teleport me to this world or make it real lmao.","timestamp_created":1609758982,"timestamp_updated":1609758982,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw95fH5vYCef+twAI="}
