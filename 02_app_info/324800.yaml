    about_the_game: "Shadow Warrior 2 is the stunning evolution of Flying Wild Hog\u2019\
      s offbeat first-person shooter following the further misadventures of former\
      \ corporate shogun Lo Wang. Now surviving as a reclusive mercenary on the edge\
      \ of a corrupted world, the formidable warrior must again wield a devastating\
      \ combination of guns, blades, magic and wit to strike down the demonic legions\
      \ overwhelming the world. Battle alongside allies online in four-player co-op\
      \ or go it alone in spectacular procedurally-generated landscapes to complete\
      \ daring missions and collect powerful new weapons, armor, and arcane relics\
      \ of legend.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">STORY</h2>Five years have passed since Lo Wang\
      \ shattered the alliance between his deceitful former boss and the ancient gods\
      \ of the shadow realm. Despite noble intentions, Lo Wang\u2019s efforts to annihilate\
      \ the darkness corrupted the world, creating a strange and savage new order\
      \ where humans and demons live side by side. <br><br>The once feared warrior\
      \ now lives in the shifting wildlands outside the reach of his enemies and the\
      \ neon glow of Zilla\u2019s cybernetic metropolis, scratching out a meager existence\
      \ as a hired sword for the local Yakuza clans. When a simple mission goes wrong,\
      \ Lo Wang is drawn into a volatile conflict between a brilliant young scientist,\
      \ his nemesis Orochi Zilla, and the demonic forces that have become unsettled\
      \ in our world. The sharp-tongued hero must once again wield lethal blades,\
      \ staggering firepower, and archaic magic to purge the world of evil.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">FEATURES</h2><br><strong>Blades and Bullets:</strong> Lo Wang delivers\
      \ his own brand full throttle brutality with an expanded array of over 70 lethal\
      \ blades and explosive firearms to overcome the demonic opposition. Become a\
      \ whirlwind of steel and blood with razor sharp katana, short swords, crescent\
      \ blades, and hand claws or unleash a hellish symphony of ornate firearms to\
      \ decimate your enemies.<br><br><strong>Four Player Co-Op:</strong> Battle through\
      \ the expansive campaign alone or team up as a four-player typhoon of destruction\
      \ online in campaign co-op mode. Tackle challenging primary missions or thrilling\
      \ side quests while maintaining your own ninja style with customizable armor,\
      \ items, and valuable loot from your triumphs.<br><br><strong>Procedural Environments:</strong>\
      \ The breach between the human and demon realms created an interdimensional\
      \ hernia resulting in constant shifts to the world of Shadow Warrior 2. Procedurally\
      \ generated landscapes and paths bring new twists and turns to once familiar\
      \ terrain and routine missions. <br><br><strong>Brutal Damage System:</strong>\
      \ Choose your weapon based on the situation at hand and then dismantle everything\
      \ that stands in your path with an advanced gore system. Use precision blade\
      \ strikes to separate limbs and heads or switch to heavy ordinance and blow\
      \ a hole right through colossal beasts.<br><br><strong>Custom Upgrade System:</strong>\
      \ Upgrade weapons in your arsenal with up to three stones at once to improve\
      \ performance or augment them with devastating elemental effects. Collect karma,\
      \ amulets, and armor to enhance Lo Wang\u2019s power and shift his death-dealing\
      \ artistry into overdrive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Shadow Warrior Series</h2><br>The\
      \ Shadow Warrior series started back in the 90s with Shadow Warrior Classic\
      \ that was remastered and released on Steam by Devolver Digital and 3D Realms\
      \ as Shadow Warrior Classic Redux. Then in 2013, Flying Wild Hog and Devolver\
      \ Digital released the bold reimagining of the legend of Lo Wang with the modern\
