      Unique Driving System - Like in any kart racing game, the vehicles are much
      more maneuverable than their real-life counterparts. Additionally they allow
      for jumping, drifting (which influences the car's handling and fills up the
      turbo gauges), using the turbo, weapons or momentary ride on a wall or ceiling.
      The driving system, though easy to learn, gives the players huge opportunities
      to use creatively on the maps of all game modes.<br></li><li> Characters and
      Vehicles - The playable characters are the familiar monsters, known from legends
      and pop-culture. Each character has its own, unique vehicle with specific parameters
      and original look.<br></li><li> Original Weapons - A wide arsenal of funny and
      original weapons, which the monsters shoot at each other to get the upper hand.<br></li><li>
      Split Screen up to 4 Players - Local multiplayer gaming is coming back! You
      can sit back and enjoy the game together with your friends and family in front
      of one screen.<br></li><li> Online Multiplayer -  Each game allows the play
      for up to 8 players at once. You can create a session and let other players
      from around the world to play with you, invite your friends or just join others
      by yourself.</li></ul>
