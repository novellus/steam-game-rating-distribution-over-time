Its very creative, both in story and gameplay. Because of its innovative gameplay, I experienced some initial awkwardness with the sand manipulation and telekinesis but that is part of the game's charm. It was a new way of playing. I got used to it and thoroughly enjoyed it. I hope this developer continues their work.\n\nCON: The dragon boss and birdman boss are way too technically difficult. The feats of gaming athletics required remind me of some old school Sega and Nintendo bosses, which if you like that, great, but for me it just frustrated me and made my hands and fingers sore. It felt a little sadistic.","timestamp_created":1606517974,"timestamp_updated":1606517974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv9z7hfYCcPKAtAI="}
