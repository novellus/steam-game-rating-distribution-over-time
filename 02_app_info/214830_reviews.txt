It's... a puzzle game I guess? But also a JRPG, bullet hell, RTS, and ARPG. But, rarely any two of those at the same time.\n\nIt's a parody of JRPGs, less in writing, but more in gameplay and tone. Most parody games relentlessly beat you over the head with the \"satire,\" but fail to actually say/do anything about what they're mocking and rely entirely on the parody aspect to not be the definition of generic milquetoast paste. Half Minute Hero, on the other hand, conveys its parody mostly through smart gameplay design. It's a \"show\" versus \"tell\" kind of thing.","timestamp_created":1609582427,"timestamp_updated":1609582427,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t9el4fYCfpLXvwI="}
