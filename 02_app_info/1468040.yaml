      \ the Elmarion World again. The Dragons woke up and again helped to cope with\
      \ the Undead. However, this time, not all the Dragons fell asleep for some reason.\
      \ The Dragons were not enemies to the people, but they were not their friends\
      \ either. For a while, the people remembered their duty to the Dragons and tried\

      \ And even some people could get in trouble if they met a Dragon. As a result,\
