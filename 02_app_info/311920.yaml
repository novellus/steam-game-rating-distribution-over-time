    review: i purchased this thinking that it would be a great way to learn how to
      GM within FG, but the adventure is very poorly made; all of the map files are
      extremely basic and computer generated with no GM information for what room
      is what.  all of the monsters are letter tokens and not pictures.  There is
      not even a map for the second encounter.  all in all i would give this a 1/5
      as playable.  The story line isn't bad and if you take your own time to find
      pictures, tokens, maps, and create more chat frame text it can work.  but not
      work $5.99, maybe $1.99 but even with that there is almost no work put into
      this from the paper version.
