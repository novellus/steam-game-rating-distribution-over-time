Dragon Lapis is a straight-foward retro JRPG.  \n\nPros: The job system is well-implemented with growth plates giving you real control over how each character develops, making progression satisfying.  There are two sorts of in game currency, gold and lapis.  Lapis gives you the option to purchase items that significantly increase your power, if you so choose.\n\nCons: Other than the job system, there isn't a lot of depth here, which is unfortunate because the job system would support it.  For example, monsters mostly lack strengths, weaknesses, or immunity.  There are no found items outside treasure chests - which seemed like an obvious mechanic for thieves and merchants.  No crafting to speak of.  The game is also quite easy, even on hard mode.\n\nRecommendations:  Get it on sale.  Its plays well enough it can hook you, which says a lot more than many throw-back JRPGs, so it is worth buying.  Play it on hard mode and stay out of the lapis store if you want a meaningful challenge (doing this will force you to spend skill points carefully as they're otherwise slow to earn).\n\nEdit:  Changing to not recommend. \n\nThere is endgame content that makes lapis store purchases effectively necessary for completion.  Lapis is earned in game, not purchased so its not pay-to-win, at least not with real-world currency.  \n\nOverall, this game just isn't balanced very well.  The main game is way too easy relative to the progression system - the developers really need to start paying more attention to this as it doesn't do justice to otherwise solid work.  Unfortunately, this is EXE-Creates MO - they have some good ideas, but don't take the time to flesh any of them out.  Would be curious to see what the team could do if given the time to really complete one of their games.  This game has an inspired job system, for a throw-back JRPG, that is begging for a more complete game to be built around it.  But that's about it.","timestamp_created":1604340553,"timestamp_updated":1604519014,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551777422428131104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw56WyyvUCdsntqwI="}
