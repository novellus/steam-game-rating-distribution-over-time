    review: 'Tofu Topple is a competitive puzzle game that is highly enjoyable. And
      is an easy recommend to anyone who has fond memories of Arcade VS. Puzzle games.
      In this match three gem game, you have several characters to choose from, and
      from chaining matches or making several matches in a row they will send over
      character specific garbage blocks to the opponent. Instead of pushing the opponent
      off the top of the screen (though it is still a valid win condition) the main
      focus on the game is to be the first to reach a set score goal known as quota,
      and the unique trash blocks that each character sends will either give you score
      when the opponent clears them, or stalls to give you time to pull ahead.


      It is in this regard that the character that you select matters more to your
      opponent then you, as your opponent is the one that deals with the character
      specific blocks, this makes mastery of all the different block types crucial
      to becoming very skilled at the game, as quick thinking on how deal with trash
      while minimizing the time spent waiting or score given to the opponent can make
      all the difference. Also since you are not flooding your opponent with trash
      blocks and instead focusing on scoring to get your quota up, it often means
      that late in a battle one miss drop won''t completely take you out of the game
      like in Tetris or Puyo Puyo, and if your fast and skilled enough you can easily
      recover from a few mistakes.


      The story in the game is light, but hints at a much larger world and story which
      I personally enjoy, though since it is a puzzle game if its not your thing then
      it can be skipped with no loss to the game play or anything. The music is excellent,
      which is important if you grind at the time attack or endless modes as, at least
      to me, it doesn''t get old.


      There are only a few minor bugs that I have come across, but as of now the developer
      is active and trying to sort them out. The main complaints I have are, controller
      support seems to be limited to Xbox controllers, I have tried a few other controllers
      that I have and seems to have trouble keybinding some of the buttons, and that
      as of now, I the online lobby''s are almost always empty, but both can be solved,
      one with some bug fixing and hopefully this gem of a game will gain enough traction
      to solve the other as well.



      TLDR: This is a great game for anyone who loves arcade style competitive puzzle
      games, with few complaints and many positives and more then worth the price.'
