    review: "Honestly, i only bought this for the pony achievements. I have absolutely\
      \ no idea what i am supposed to be doing, i haven't even figured out what the\
      \ blue rings on the cursor are for yet, they don't seem to do anything. I almost\
      \ wish this was one of those garbage games where you can just stand there and\
      \ get the achievements because i don't really want to play it. I don't mind\
      \ pixel games, but this makes Mario look like 4K .... or at least 720p. \nIt\
      \ seems to be a good game, i just really don't want to play it anymore, mostly\
      \ out of frustration because i am too lazy to look it up. So i just wander around\
      \ cussing at it because something killed me, or i think something killed me,\
      \ i have no idea what i am looking at. \nBut i will just keep chugging along\
      \ because i want the fucking pony achievements."
