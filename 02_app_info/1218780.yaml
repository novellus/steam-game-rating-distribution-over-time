      /><br>Your little underground bunker-turned-shop is about to be stormed by an
      army of customers eager to get their hands on unusual merchandise.<br><br>With
      a single pull of a lever you can supply enough pieces of metal, rubber and explosives
      to satisfy their heart's desires and more. War might have gone out of style,
      but recycling is back in - and you have all kinds of gear lying around, ready
      to be reused as entertainment and garden decoration. Listen closely to every
      little masked guy and put out the goods they order.<br><br>While rapid shopkeeping
      is the key making any money, it's the business decisions that will have the
      most impact. Figure out how to best design the shop layout, stay on top of organizing
      the stockroom and acquire advanced equipment to really spice things up.<br><img

      /><br>Unlock all kinds of different things to sell. Some of them might be difficult
      to handle or just downright dangerous but hey, you absolutely CAN pawn off an
      explosive barrel as a coffee table if your sales pitch is convincing enough.<br><br><img

      /><br>Spend your hard earned money to buy new rooms, furniture and upgrades.
      You will need the extra space to keep things organized once all the wares come
      flooding in.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1218780/extras/Expand600x250ish.gif?t=1582715218"

      /><br>Create wonders of makeshift engineering by combining useless junk into
      amazing contraptions. Rockets with magnets duct-taped all over are worth pretty
