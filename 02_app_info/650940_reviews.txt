There isn't enough interesting locations or unique mechanics that really set it apart from some of the heavier hitters that are more fleshed out.  \n\nA very rough example of the game in at it's sloggiest is playing a Troll Fighter with sword and shield that won't die easily and has trouble hitting stuff, where as mages have a lot of utility spells that are great and many damage spells that generally boil down to direct damage or AoE versions of specific damage types.\n\nThe game does offer some persistent award, such as stat increases or certain abilities, through essences earned when characters die, which can be toggled on or off, but one of the more random mechanics people will love or hate is 3-4 (if the 4th slot is unlocked) random abilities every so many levels. Sometimes you'll get a follow up to an ability you need, other times it'll never show up again and you have a gimped version of it and might be stuck with other abilities that are more there for padding or very very specific utility. While this is pretty much the defining unique mechanic of the game, it can lead to frustration or rare/exciting cards can come too late or just at wrong timing.\n\nOverall I look forward to see if the DLCs add any more interesting life into it, but I always feel I should be playing some of the other heavy hitting in my library as I put time into this one.","timestamp_created":1609391943,"timestamp_updated":1609391943,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.510589003562927246","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41YXP2/YCff6AvwI="}
