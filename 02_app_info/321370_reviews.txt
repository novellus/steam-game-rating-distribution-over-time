Is this game terrible? No, but it does suffer from some weird design choices, odd animation placements and puzzle mechanics that work well towards the beginning, but begin making less and less sense as the game goes on. I look forward to what this team does going forward, but I wouldn't say my completion of the game left me with any sense of accomplishment.","timestamp_created":1599005166,"timestamp_updated":1599005166,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505028307437896729","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm9GIpvQCc8mfnwI="}
