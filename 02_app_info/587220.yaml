      /><br>Jet Island is massive open world and you have an arsenal of tools that
      will allow you to travel through this world at extreme speeds! When standing
      on your hoverboard, the ground below you becomes frictionless. Perfect for sliding
      up and down the mountainous terrain. To control the direction of your movement
      and gain even more speed, you have two wrist mounted jet thrusters. You also
      have grappling hooks to swing from tall structures and climb up the side of
      giant monsters. The combination of these tools provide a freedom of movement
      unlike any other. There are no limits to what you can do. It's the closest feeling
      to learning how to fly.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>

    review: Jesus, this game is probably the most actual fun I've had in a while.
      Playing this with my friends has been a blast, whether it be just messing around
      or actually fighting the bosses. The only true gripes I have is the menu, the
      graphics, and the lack of being able to walk with left stick. But honestly,
      those all kind of don't really matter all too much to me. If you're planning
      on getting this, try to get some friends to play with you too!
