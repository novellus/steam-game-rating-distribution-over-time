    review: "Hack, Slash, Shoot, Loot, Manage a few survivors, to escape the incoming\
      \ ' Horde '.\nDozen of short maps to explore.\n\nWalking simulator, \nas well\
      \ as all other actions in ' SLOW ' motion,\none of the SLOWest movement game\
      \ ever experienced since the 80s.\nScreen is so large, but the character simply\
      \ lingers in the lower potion.\nShift inventory is slow from backpack to storage.\n\
      Keyboard ' X ' is a death trap for losing item on accidental pressings.\nGame\
      \ will bug out when carrying excess of 31K coins.\n\nSimple to stack stats on\
      \ crafted equipment for the ultimate arsenal.\nRecommend to install 3rd Party\
      \ tool to overwrite keyboard binds, as the default keybinds are horrible.\n\n\
      Game could have some potential, bare and lacking in contents.\n\nCan't expect\
      \ much, from a ' Low Priced, Low Budget, Low Quality '.\n\nPlayable with Patience."
