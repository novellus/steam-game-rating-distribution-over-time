    about_the_game: 'SPAERA is a head-to-head puzzle fighting game, using an unique
      match-3 cascading mechanic as its core system.  The world of SPAERA is heavily
      inspired by characters, gameplay and themes from games that we loved to play
      as we were growing up.  We''ve created a roster of eight original characters
      that you can select, each with his or her own individual story.  Players can
      battle the computer in the game''s campaign mode, or against live opponents
      in local and online matchmaking.<h2 class="bb_tag">HOW TO PLAY</h2>Players choose
      a unique character as their avatar, each with four of their own unique spells
      that can vary from Attack types to Protection types.  Once the game begins,
      Players receive a continuous stream of puzzle pieces that are arranged in different
      color and shape configurations.  Players are then tasked to match 3 or more
      of the same color blocks in order to trigger a clearing response.  When clearing
      is initiated, any color on the active puzzle piece that is not the same colors
      as the cleared ones will cascade downwards on the board, enabling setups for
      complex combos and chains.  There is also a power meter that will increase as
      you clear blocks or obtain and clear special block types that enable the player
      to issue magic spells to either support their own board or attack their opponent.  The
      first person to force their opponent to have nowhere else to place their puzzle
      piece wins the match.<h2 class="bb_tag">SPAERA FEATURES</h2>Our lead artist
      and his team are amazing.  Seriously, check out the screenshots for yourselves.  All
      graphics and animations were hand drawn!  We like to think of SPAERA as something
      that everyone can enjoy; it''s pretty easy to pick up, but you can add a lot
      of depth to your strategy.  In many ways, SPAERA represents a mashup of a lot
      of the games that we love: games that you can just pick up and play by yourself
      or with friends without too much fuss.  It''s fun, quick, and easy, just like
      a favorite snack.  Head-To-Head multiplayer with server supported Matchmaking,
      Ranks, and Ladders enables endless fun and depth.  We are trying to build a
      community of people that can be positive and enthusiastic about playing with
      us and each other, and hopefully help us to continue develop more games that
      everyone can enjoy.<h2 class="bb_tag">WHO ARE WE?</h2>Blazing Orb is founded
      by a pair of coders that have always been gamers at heart with huge love for
      RPGs, platformers, side-scrollers, fighting games, and puzzle-strategy games.  SPAERA
      is our attempt to pay homage to all the influences and good times that we''ve
      had growing up playing these games, and hopefully be able to pay forward all
      the fun to others.'

    review: "Griefing as a Puzzle game. If you're into that, this is recommended.\n\
      \nI have fun playing this game locally, but without that personal touch, it's\
      \ just going to be frustrating, especially as the game demands your attention\
      \ being on everything, including your opponents piece, their next piece, combos\
      \ their setting up, their meter, and have an understanding of how it all connects\
      \ together. For something like this, there might be a bit too much going on\
      \ for a genre that generally is recommended for it's simplicity. \n\nNot bad,\
      \ but not recommended over Poyo Poyo Tetris."
