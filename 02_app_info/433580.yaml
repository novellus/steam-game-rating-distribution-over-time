    review: 'An extremely well done point and click adventure/puzzle game. The soundtrack
      and visuals were excellent for its time, and they make playing the game feel
      very relaxing... However, there were several points in the game that legitimately
      spooked me, made me breathe very heavily, and feel fear as if my life was in
      danger... This is a good thing though, and part of the appeal of the game! It''s
      not a horror game, but the emotions this game will make you feel is worth the
      experience!


      The puzzles in this game are definitely a challenge and can be difficult to
      figure out, but its extremely rewarding when you do solve them. The type of
      person who will enjoy this game is someone who likes thinking and who is also
      very patient. (Tip: If you get stuck, try reading the journal for clues) This
      game is a hidden gem that shouldn''t be overlooked!'
