    short_description: In the sugar-stuffed world of Cake Bash, only one sweet treat
      can be the tastiest. The only way to decide the best delicacy? By beating the
      others into submission! Join the Steams Games Fest crew as they battle pigeons,
      flying cutlery, and most importantly each other in this sickeningly sweet game.
