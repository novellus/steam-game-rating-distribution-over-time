    short_description: Asuma and his team finally confront Hidan, and a battle ensues.
      They fight with all their strength but are shocked at Hidan's power. Kakuzu,
      the other Akatsuki member, also appears, and the Hidden Leaf seemed destined
      to lose. Escape is impossible, and Asuma grimly goes over a battle strategy?
