    review: "Super Serie!\n\nMir gef\xE4llt es wie die anderen Teile dieser Serie\
      \ wirklich sehr gut.\nJeder der Time-Management-Spiele mag, sollte ohne zu z\xF6\
      gern zugreifen.\nWer solche Spiele noch nicht kennt, sollte sich mal eines im\
      \ Sale zulegen und ausprobieren.\nF\xFCr eine Runde nach Feierabend passend\
      \ zur Tasse Kaffee mit Abendbrot genau das Richtige.\nNur h\xF6rt man danach\
      \ nur nicht so schnell wieder auf. ^^\n\nViel Spa\xDF damit!\n\nFazit: kaufen,\
      \ kaufen, kaufen!"
