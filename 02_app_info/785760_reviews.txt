The graphics are not spectacular but it's 10 times better than the old 90'ties games, and the tracks are very interesting. The tracks changes a little bit with some added ramps and chicanes to make it more difficult (read: more crashes) every new championship!\nThe damage models are not so amazing but fair enough, but the cars are looking all almost the same.\nThe soundeffects are also good enough for me and the music is a retro house/acid ish, no metal or garage rock this time.\nIt's not a Flatout or Wreckfest game but for me personally during the sale price I can warm recomend it!\nI would like more differences between the cars with some Camaro's, Mustangs, Ford Pick-ups and more...\nAnd a replay would be awesome, I would play a lot more just to watch the crashes again from different angles.\n\nGraphics : 6,5/10 Sound&Music : 7,5/10 Gameplay: 8/10","timestamp_created":1603550066,"timestamp_updated":1603629798,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwp5ryr/UCd/TqqQI="}
