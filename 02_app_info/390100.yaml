    review: 'can''t even open a bloody account for this game, the sign up page creates
      an infinite loop and you cant contact support without an account either.


      After a massive struggle trying to contact the game support, they were able
      to help me create an account. All of this is now useless, because something
      happened to the game and everyone''s characters lost ALL their skills progress.
      If you logged in within a week after it happened, you were given some tomes
      to redo it all, but I missed that week and besides, playing as a healer is way
      too much of a chore to REDO EVERYTHING. I just logged in to check and I literally
      have a CS1 healer standing there with literally no skills in the kung fu menu.
      Everything has to be rebought, then relearned then retrained in the field. Uninstalling
      this rubbish right now!


      Avoid this game. If you even manage to open an account, there is absolutely
      no guarantee that your character is safe. You can literally lose all your progress
      out of the blue and have nothing to show for it. You''ve been warned!


      Edit: shouldve listen to my own advice and stay away. My high level character
      had their skills wiped along with everyone else''s during a skills rework. The
      new skills give +-0.03 xp at level 1, so no ways that a skill will ever max
      out, even with the highly limited in game trainer. The game mechanics have died
      horribly.'
