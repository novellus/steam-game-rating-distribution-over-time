    review: i give this game a postive review but i was still doubting about it because
      after playing this game once its just not fun anymore to play it a second time.
      Playing this game once is really fun but its just not interesting anymore for
      playing it a second time then it gets boring. But it still has a funny gameplay
      and storyline so for that reason only a positive review but i dont think i will
      play this game again anytime soon. Its also really short but that's why the
      price is so cheap but i still think this game should have been for free. For
      a free game this game would have been really fun and nice to play but for a
      game that you have to pay even though it is really cheap not so much.
