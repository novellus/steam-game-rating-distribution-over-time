    about_the_game: Have you ever been fighting minions in a dungeon and thought &quot;Ugh,
      lava pits <i>and</i> spike traps in the same room? Really, a medieval torture
      chamber, with <i>this</i> lighting? Who is <u>managing </u> this place?&quot;
      Well, you're in luck, because its your turn to do some serious dungeon renovations!
      Dungeon Consultant is a management game where you'll be tasked with taking under-performing
      dungeons and maximizing their potential by laying traps, training &amp; staffing
      high quality minions, and ensuring a particularly frightening aesthetic.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Lay Tricky Traps</h2>From spikes to disco balls, you'll need
      to carefully place traps to defeat those pesky &quot;heroes&quot; and steal
      their gold before they can steal yours!<h2 class="bb_tag">Build Backstage Rooms</h2>To
      help keep your dungeons running, and to help &quot;heroes&quot; depart with
      their gold, you'll need to construct backstage rooms. Whether it's a new Minion
      Resources office, a Breakroom, or a Trap Workshop these rooms will help you
      manage the behind-the-scenes upkeep of your dungeons.<h2 class="bb_tag">Hire
      (or fire!) Minions</h2>Goblins, and ghosts, and golems; oh my! You'll need to
      hire minions to staff your backstage rooms, and defend your dungeon. When defending,
      your minions can be armed with the latest and greatest gear ...or whatever is
      lying around; you need to turn a profit, after all.<h2 class="bb_tag">Profit!</h2>When
      you satisfy the requirements of the dreaded senior management, you'll be given
      new dungeons to make profitable. Every dungeon is unique, and will require a
      unique approach to make it the kind of dungeon nightmares are made of!

      notes: This game contains cartoon and fantasy violence (eg characters hit each
        other with spells, arrows, and swords) but it does not contain any blood,
        dismemberment, or gore of any kind. Additionally, characters are "defeated"
        rather than killed.
