Loved the garden themed graphics, colorful and crystal clear.\nThe storyline was quite complex for an HOG game. The story went on and on - but that's a good thing because I find many end abruptly! Tons of varied puzzles, some I've never seen before which the avid HOG gamer will surely find refreshing. Lots of bonus things to find & collect during the game.","timestamp_created":1599536921,"timestamp_updated":1599536921,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mo/1tfQCfrjAoAI="}
