    review: 'GAMES got STYLE.  If you look at this game and don''t see familiar features,
      then you must play it.


      IF simply being different on many levels isn''t enough, THEN know the game features
      grindy leveling, lengthy dungeon crawling, item management, more artistic pictures
      than good graphics, full party creation, multiclassing, RNG combat features,
      in depth weapon/armor enhancements, and combat is basic but uncommon.


      To save time, it essentially has style.  And different.  How often do we find
      something actually different?  What is cheap to me may not be cheap to you.  But
      to me at $10 it is must play.'
