    review: "First of all I just want to say that this game works perfectly fine on\
      \ the Valve Index (so probably Vive aswell) I don\u2019t like the controls,\
      \ there\u2019s no free locomotion & no snap (or smooth) turning at all. You\
      \ can teleport (but no way of turning other than physically turning yourself\
      \ around obvs) & the only other movement is by holding the grips whilst swinging\
      \ your arms. Definitely needs a better control scheme. Apart from that, the\
      \ graphics are good but the sound can be a bit glitchy at times. Gameplay-wise,\
      \ unless you know how to do all 33 Masonic rituals, you\u2019ve got absolutely\
      \ no hope of getting very far at all. There are definitely some interesting\
      \ set pieces & I\u2019m glad I got it (mainly out of curiosity)....... Now for\
      \ the jokey bit!: I hope someone will make a full walkthrough of this but I\
      \ can\u2019t see it happening somehow. I\u2019ve made SOME progress & done the\
      \ first FEW basic ones but after that I\u2019m totally stumped. THE ANSWERS\
      \ NEED TO BE MADE READILY AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE!!! (Yes I\u2019m being ironic).\
