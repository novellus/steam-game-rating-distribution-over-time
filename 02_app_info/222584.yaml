    about_the_game: "The record-breaking streamlined Class A4 Pacifics were the flagships\
      \ of prestigious high-speed steam travel in the UK, and the six surviving \u2018\
      Streaks\u2019 are now available for Train Simulator in one special Gathering.<br><br>During\
      \ a visit to Germany in 1933, Sir Nigel Gresley was taken by the high-speed\
      \ streamlined \u2018Flying Hamburger\u2019 diesel train, a concept the London\
      \ &amp; North Eastern Railway had considered for its East Coast Main Line route.\
      \ However, Gresley believed that steam power could do an equally impressive\
      \ job and tested the theory with Class A3 \u2018Papyrus\u2019. Gresley\u2019\
      s tests were such a success that LNER granted permission to design more streamlined\
      \ locomotives.<br><br>The Class A4s were designed for prestigious high-speed\
      \ passenger services, running from London Kings Cross to Edinburgh, Scotland\
      \ via York and Newcastle. Both internal and external streamlining improved coal\
      \ and water usage, and a Kylchap double chimney was proven to improve efficiency,\
      \ making the Class A4s a much admired model with their distinctive flowing aerodynamic\
      \ profile.<br><br>A total of 35 \u2018Streaks\u2019 were produced at LNER\u2019\
      s Doncaster Works between 1935 and 1938 and were capable of a 90mph (140km/h)\
      \ top speed in regular service. However, the Class A4s were record breakers\
      \ from the outset - Silver Fox attained 113mph (182km/h) in August 1936, making\
      \ it the highest recorded speed of a regular passenger train at the time.<br><br>The\
      \ most famous of days for the Class A4s was on 3rd July 1938. Pulling six coaches\
      \ and a dynamometer car, Mallard reached 126mph (202.8km/h) at Stoke Bank, breaking\
      \ the world speed record for steam locomotives of 124.5mph (200.4km/h) previously\
      \ held by a German DBG Class 05. The record still stands today, making 2013\
      \ the 75th anniversary of this record breaking occasion. <br><br>To mark the\
      \ occasion, the UK\u2019s National Railway Museum (NRM) is bringing all six\
      \ surviving Class A4s together in one location. With the \u2018Streaks\u2019\
      \ fully withdrawn from mainline service by 1966, six were preserved \u2013 Mallard,\
      \ Sir Nigel Gresley, Bittern, Union of South Africa, Dominion of Canada and\
      \ Dwight D Eisenhower. The latter two locomotives were moved to North America\
      \ shortly after being withdrawn from service with the other four locomotives\
      \ maintained on preserved railways or in museums.<br><br>The NRM\u2019s Great\
      \ Gathering assembled all six remaining Class A4s reunited and on display to\
      \ the general public for a limited time, and the Class A4 Pacifics for Train\
      \ Simulator recreates this unique gathering and the locomotives in the liveries\
