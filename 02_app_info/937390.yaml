    review: "I bought [i]Ah, Love![/i] out of pure curiosity, and a game that costs\
      \ less than 1\u20AC is a fairly good selling argument, right?\nI usually don't\
      \ buy games with such low prices because they often end up being not very inspired\
      \ and with too little work put in them. Sadly, good little indie puzzlers are\
      \ getting lost in Steam's endless catalog of cheap hentai minesweepers or similar\
      \ games that sell their [strike]stolen[/strike] visuals over an interesting\
      \ gameplay.\n\n[i]Ah, Love![/i] is exactly the opposite : it doesn't have stunning\
      \ graphics, but it offers a proof of concept, if not a gameplay that has never\
      \ been seen before. At first, it looks like another tile-sliding puzzle, and\
      \ it's exactly what it is. However, it adds a simple mechanic that turns it\
      \ into a whole different experience : the tiles are different pieces of a maze\
      \ with two hearts, a pink one and a blue one, symbolizing two lovers that must\
      \ be reunited. But the lovers are automatically attracted to each other : you\
      \ can only control them by moving the tiles themselves.\n\nIt's as simple as\
      \ that, but it works as an idea, and the execution is surprisingly good.\nIt\
      \ will make you think in a way you're probably not used to in the first half\
      \ of the game, before you start to understand how it works. All levels are handmade\
      \ and they appear to be pretty well designed : there's usually one unique good\
      \ path to take to beat a level, and you first need to assemble the tiles together\
      \ to see which ones fit.\n\nTo be fair, the game has a lot of potential and\
      \ could be improved on several levels, especially the textures or the animations\
      \ (the tiles swap instantly, which is a bit disorienting at first), but the\
      \ gameplay itself is very addicting, and for the price it costs, you can't really\
      \ ask for more. The whole \"Love\" theme appears to be very simple, but it works\
      \ well with a game like that.\n\nThere are a lot of different new mechanics\
      \ introduced at the beginning of the game, which is an excellent thing in a\
      \ puzzle game. From level 50 and on, I felt like there was a lot of variety\
      \ in the level designing. There's a couple new and surprising ideas that really\
      \ make the game more and more enjoyable.\n\nIn the end, I bought [i]Ah, Love![/i]\
      \ to support the developer, because it's a very promising puzzler, and I have\
      \ no doubt with some extra work he will come up with new original ideas in the\
      \ future and could make great and polished games. I hope this honest review\
      \ can help.\n\n[Edit 02/2019] : The developer has updated the game with enhanced\
      \ art and visuals as well as a better menu to keep track of the optional objectives.\
      \ I can't recommend it enough !"
