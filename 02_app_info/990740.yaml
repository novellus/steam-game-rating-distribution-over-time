    review: "For 3 bucks this is a quick time killing Rhythm game. If have better\
      \ games to play I would skip it. I had fun and got my 3 monies worth. The music\
      \ is inconsistent and sometimes doesn't match the beat perfectly.\n\nFor fappy\
      \ bois I would not recommend. Although nudity is available it's forgettable.\
      \ \n\nWorth the cash sure. Tiddies could be better."
