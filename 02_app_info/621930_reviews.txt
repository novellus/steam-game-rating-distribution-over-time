There are plenty of ways how you could improve this game but does this mean it's a bad game? No not at all! \nIf you consider that this was made by a little indie studio, which (as of now) has only created one more game called \"Monstrum\" https://store.steampowered.com/app/296710/Monstrum I think it's a pretty solide performance. (sidenote; Monstrum itself was also a very good little game!) \n2 games and 2 times thumbs up I can't wait to see what Team Junkfish is going to create in the future ;)\n[h1]PS: can confirme the game is funny, it's almost worth to buy just for the lol's[/h1]","timestamp_created":1610060064,"timestamp_updated":1610060150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz4bE7/YCc/2ywQI="}
