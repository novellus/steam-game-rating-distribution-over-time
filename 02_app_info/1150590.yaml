    review: My first play through was on Master Samurai difficulty, and the early
      levels of the game is very punishing especially if you have not acquired any
      items yet, but it is very rewarding if you managed to suceed. If you want to
      challenge yourself you need to play on Master Samurai difficulty with your first
      play through to experience the sufferings hahah. Currently grinding Act 2 boss
      now :D.
