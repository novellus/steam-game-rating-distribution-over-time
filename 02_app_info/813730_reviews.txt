However, it has the look and feel of a game I should have played 10 years ago. Interfaces are butt ugly and obscurely laid out and as for the ship designer; it's shockingly bad... All that said, combat is very intuitive, star map feels balanced and general mechanics seem sound.\n\nWith some input from a UX/UI developer and a graphic artist this could have been a truly great game.\n\nRecommended but wait till it's on sale.","timestamp_created":1557891087,"timestamp_updated":1557891087,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qe/i3OoCfuSbwQE="}
