However, I can't quite call it a logic puzzle. For the most part, it is a skill game.\n[list]\n[*][b]Gameplay:[/b] gameplay features a handful of different room types, but they generally don't diverge from those. This is my main gripe with the game, and the reason I cannot recommend it: at first glance, this looks like a fun puzzler. There were some really clever levels involving navigating with certain barrier-breaking items, or figuring out a set of movements. But then, in-between those you have levels where, unless you have really fast reflexes, will get you stuck for a really, [i]really[/i] long time. My strategy for the \"key-mashing\" type of levels was to basically look at my keyboard and press a series of keys in a loop. The problem with this approach is that it completely invalidated the \"random enemy spawning\" catch of the level, not to mention the more obvious issue of me not actually looking at the game at any point in that level; I'd just loop those keys and pray that it ended quickly. Thankfully, there are only three of those levels but, in my personal opinion, there should have been exactly zero. I'll cover this more in the Accessibility topic.\nI appreciate that this game is not a one-trick pony. I like that it has many ideas it wants to explore. But with a couple exceptions, those ideas are never explored in innovative ways. The only element of \"surprise\" in this game, the only source of the \"aha!\" moment is through its riddles. Most of the puzzle levels are less about the environment or mechanics and more about \"find the odd thing\" or \"figure out password\". The game mechanics were only used as a means to an end, not the source of challenge itself, which in my opinion is just a waste of potential. My favorite levels were those that made you stop to think about which barriers to break, or how to navigate the room such that you stepped on activator keys in the correct order, but those were few and over rather quickly. The fast reaction levels were, at the core of it, just the same type of challenge in different styles. Run from the \"X\" key to the \"Y\" key as fast as you can. Either because red circles, or because pulsing timer with death keys in-between, or because another character told you to do so.\n[*][b]Physics:[/b] you'd think that, in a game about navigating with keys, there wouldn't be space for physics, but here we are. The player character moves between tiles by sliding across in a straight line. No problem there, until you have to move between two tiles with one in-between. Since you [i]have[/i] to traverse the in-between tile, and since so many levels require fast action, your instinct will be to press the in-between key, then the destination key as soon as possible, but if you're not at the center of the tile by the time you press the next, and if the player character is in the region of the in-between tile, then it will start swaying in the direction of the new tile from wherever it is, potentially hitting a wall or missing a button.\nAt no point in the game does this \"in-betweening\" movement get implemented as either a mechanic/intended move or as a deliberate barrier. It's simply a consequence of the fact that the player character is a physics object which doesn't regard the keyboard as a grid, but just as a regular, 2D map.\n[*][b]Difficulty curve:[/b] the game starts off really easy. It lets you get used to the keyboard gameplay, and gradually ramps up in difficulty. So far so good. Then you get to the first \"key-smashing\" level. After that, it's all game. Maze-like level design, riddles with confusing clues, sweeping puzzles that effectively require brute force, trial-and-error to get solved, and so on. The impression I get is that this game either had no playtesting at all, or that playtesters only played up to a certain point. It genuinely feels like the game takes a turn to \"gameplay exploration\", where a lot of ideas are explored, but they aren't introduced in a well-paced manner, or aren't explored to their potential.\nInstead of building up on your acquired skills and understanding of mechanics to derive its difficulty, it only gets progressively faster and more instinctive/reactive. This is evident by the fact that the early levels had absolute no randomization, whereas late levels almost exclusively relied on random events. If the gameplay was consistently about navigating levels that involved random events, it wouldn't be much of an issue, but the inconsistency of having well thought out and designed puzzles versus what I can only described as battle arenas is remarkable.\n[*][b]Graphics:[/b] the game is minimalist in nature and feature elements comprised mostly of lines and solid colors. I commend the creators for that, since the simplicity and consistency makes the game easy to understand and navigate. However, I can't help but feel like the different mechanics could have used more distinctive designs. Some special tiles are simply too similar to other types of tiles, and most of them are either rectangles or lines. I believe exploring different shapes and forms, while still sticking to the general \"vector-like\" art direction, would have been a wiser choice. I'll cover this more in the Accessibility topic.\n[*][b]Music and SFX:[/b] this is one of the game's highlights, in my eyes (or, in this case, ears). The game has a small but very atmospheric soundtrack that appropriately matches the circumstances in which it is played. It is never so intense as to be distracting, nor so quiet as to be dismissed. The sound effects are also very well designed, with each mechanic having its own characteristic array of sounds. It also serves as great auditory cues in levels where that can be helpful.\n[*][b]Narrative:[/b] the story this game tells is as simple as it can get, which is not a complaint, only an observation. This game features a handful of meaningful character, which each have their own identity and personality and role to fulfill. While the player character itself doesn't have any dialogue lines, it still feels like an important part of the narrative, especially near the end. Writing was solid, jokes were okay, and general plot was serviceable. A very \"by-the-books\" story, but still entertaining, and really adds to the game.\n[*][b]Accessibility:[/b] and this right here is the reason why I cannot, in good faith, recommend this game. Even though I mentioned many perceived flaws and shortcomings with many aspects of keyg, I would have recommended it had it not been for the fact that, for a lot of people, this game is, and I mean this with no sarcasm, literally unplayable. As many mentioned, it lacks the one feature a game about a keyboard should contain: key mapping. While it does offer three keyboard layouts, it doesn't account for the fact that some people have international keyboards, or just a different layout (QWERTZ, for instance). It also offers a \"color blindness\" mode, but all it seems to do is switch green tiles for white - which is just confusing: why not use different shapes/fill modes for them? But mainly, this game is completely out of reach for anyone with even the mildest condition that might hinder hand/finger movement or reaction time. If you're not a fast typer, this game is not for you. If it takes you more than a fraction of a second to locate a key, this game is not for you.\n[/list]\nMy hope is that, some day, some dev will see this and add features and settings so that more people can play the game. Be it through redesigning levels, creating an Assist Mode, or just more settings. If that alone happens, I'll update this review. But until then, this game is just a very interesting and creative idea that didn't know its footing.","timestamp_created":1609921072,"timestamp_updated":1609921162,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1610008106,"developer_response":"Thank you very much for such a thorough review!\nI already learned my lesson about not combining fast-reflex levels with logic puzzles in one game, so never again :)\n\n[quote=author]The impression I get is that this game either had no playtesting at all [/quote]\nYou almost correct, I managed to find exactly 1 tester.\n\n[quote=author] it lacks the one feature a game about a keyboard should contain: key mapping[/quote]\nSome puzzle levels make it impossible to add this feature.
