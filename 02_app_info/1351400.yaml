    review: 'This is one of the most high-adrenaline, rewarding hockey epics in gaming
      history.  Even the most ferocious players will be challenged, as success in
      the lower leagues is rewarded by promotion - like the sixth grade student entering
      junior high, you will suddenly find yourself thrashed around by the vastly superior
      physical skills of your opponents.  Demotion, likewise, isn''t too bad because
      you get the chance to dominate back in the minors and earn valuable experience.  Only
      the supreme focus and discipline of a ninja will allow you to eventually overcome
      your rival players, who possess blazing speed and will violently check you literally
      across the arena.  Having won the Canvas Hockey League Elite championship, I
      can now die in peace knowing that I have accomplished something truly great.


      Canvas Hockey emphasizes entertaining gameplay over glitzy graphics - its hand-drawn
      style and tasteful, folksy music add an endearing atmosphere to the whole affair.  Loading
      speeds are extremely quick.


      I bought this game as a boy.  I completed it a man.  For the low price, you
      have nothing to lose and immortality to gain.'
