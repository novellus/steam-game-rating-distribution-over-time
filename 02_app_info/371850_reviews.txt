Setting tasks for the Defensive players is glitched, you have to change the slot below the player you want and or check to the side to see who it really is. They have teams set so that you wont have enough money to sign your first rookie, not due to cap space but because apparently NFL team owners are broke. If the new versions are anything like this stay far away from them. MAYBE if your favorite team is in a rich city with a high population and large stadium and you don't want to bother making defensive plays try them out. Not positive but i believe they only have a small amount of real players in the first college draft. Download for free on your phone Ultimate Football Manager, you can download the real team names but the players aren't real. Game play is much better than this.","timestamp_created":1608309047,"timestamp_updated":1608309047,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47Y+su/YCdc6cuwI="}
