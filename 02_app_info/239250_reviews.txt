It could have been excellent but those stupid, awful stealth missions which were not only not fun but painfully bad.\n\nSneaking around some horned dude who can one shot you if he finds you and practically teleport to anywhere you are so it makes the mission a complete dice roll... And then you fight him if you complete the stupid, boring, awful stealth mission.  \n\nAt which point he can no longer one shot you ??? WTF??\n\nSeveral missions throw brand new dynamics at you that are completely retarded and not remotely fun.\n\nSome of the game was really fun to play but getting through all those god-awful missions only to reach the woefully bad ending makes it seem like a giant middle finger.","timestamp_created":1610073001,"timestamp_updated":1610073001,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4won17/YCeeW3wQI="}
