    review: "Tough game to recommend.  On the one hand, the game delivers exactly\
      \ on what it promises.  The store description says 7 levels of increasing difficulty.\
      \  You see the video on the game store page and the game screen shots.  So you\
      \ know exactly what you're getting.  [b][u] Note: I played this on the Oculus\
      \ Rift with Touch controllers, I had to do a windows 7 compatability fix, but\
      \ then it worked fine after I started from Steam VR (didn't work if you start\
      \ app directly from Steam) [/u] [/b]\n\nSo it comes down to value really.  Is\
      \ this game worth $4.99?  Nope.  Is it worth $2.49?  That's where I'm struggling.\
      \  I don't want to give a negative review because the game worked exactly like\
      \ it said it would.  It's a stand still, racket game where you basically have\
      \ to knock down moving targets before you run out of time.  Priority is placed\
      \ on the zombies that are destroying the fence.  \n\nI found that  you can control\
      \ where the ball goes.  You really have to be good at both your forehand and\
      \ backhand swings though.  I found it helps if you're staring at your target\
      \ and time your swing correctly to achieve the right angle on the swing.  \n\
      \nI think in the end, sadly, this game is a $.99 cents game really.  I almost\
      \ finished this game in 30 minutes.  It was 1 environment, with only two enemy\
      \ types (zombie, zombie with helmet), with only one powerup target (a bomb).\
      \  The 7 levels really don't change anything up, other than there's more zombies.\
      \  \n\nSale Price Rating 4.5/10 ... close, just needs more content to justify\
      \ the current price or a further price drop to justify it's lack of content"
