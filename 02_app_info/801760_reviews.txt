I enjoyed my little playthough of this game.  My Goals were simple.  Destroy buildings , cars, and People I think in a quest to find the Golden Coins, to set free my other Giant Monster Friends to Wreak more Havok.  This game all though Realtively short is still fun and worth the buy.  But I do feel it could go further.  Maybe More Monsters?  If the Deloper is up to it.  I request I giant Werewolf, Giant Vampire, and well we need a Giant Woman in there too.  Just to round it out.  I highly Recomend this game for those itching for a bit of Nostalia and well City Mayham and Destruction.\n\nHere is the Vid as promiced:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpzYfJH-2Sc&t=100s","timestamp_created":1569679102,"timestamp_updated":1581960798,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.477030813694000244","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw88ONqvACd5uD0wE="}
