Basically this is nothing more than a lite fantasy tactical skirmish game.  \n\nWhat It is missing is a strategic layer.  I was hoping you would build some kind of civilization / faction by making or capturing cities, choosing what to produce, etc...\n\nInstead this is a super linear campaign, with no strategic layer at all.  In between missions you can only recruit a very limited type of troops with some gold you get.  To upgrade them, you need weapons and armor, which can not be bought, only found on the skirmish maps.\n\nAnyway, the pure skirmish game play was not interesting enough to hold my interest, especially since you can only play one faction, barbarians, in this fantasy game.\n\nIf pure, tactical game play appeals to you, then you might like this game.","timestamp_created":1610052446,"timestamp_updated":1610052446,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw89Sm7/YCfdKvwQI="}
