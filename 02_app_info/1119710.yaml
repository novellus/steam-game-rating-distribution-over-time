    about_the_game: looK INside is an episodic narrative game in 2.5D based on the
      interactions that the player performs in a book summarizing in pictures and
      texts the life of a French family at different times and periods in the life
      of its members.<br><br>You play Manon, the youngest of a French family of whom
      she knows little. When she discovers a book in the attic of her parents' house,
      she will then be immersed in life stories.<br><br>The goal for Manon is to get
      to know her family through all the periods in which she has not known them and
      to reconstruct a complete family tree located on the first page of the book.<br><br>We
      offer a fable on transmission and memory, mixing literary and graphic arts and
      giving an air of poetry to these people whom we know so well and so badly at
      the same time.<br><br>We do not want to make looK INside a detective game; no
      mystery, no massive family secret. We want to give the family an air of truth
      and simplicity. Our ambition is to provide the player with a tailor-made experience
      with several means of solving small playful puzzles based on the reaction that
      the objects of the game have to the actions of the player.<br><br>We hope to
      have made a little homecoming with KIN, a tribute to these men and women who
      made us who we are, with their qualities and their faults but above all with
      their humanity.<h2 class="bb_tag">In this first chapter </h2><br>Unlock the
      portraits of Manon's ancestors and their different versions according to the
      period of their life.<br>Explore the first 6 pages of the book and try to unlock
      the 15 achievements of the game.<br>We estimate the duration of this first experience
      to 2 hours.<br><br> Attention <br>Some puzzles are based on color perception
