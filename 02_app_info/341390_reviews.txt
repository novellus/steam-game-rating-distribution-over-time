There is no question in my mind. The amount of stuff you can do, the amount of careful planning it takes to get far, dying sometimes on your first step of the journey... this is roguelike perfection. This is just an adaptation of the classic NetHack, for the most part it is simply a graphical overhaul, or basically an isometric tileset. However, there are a couple game mechanics that are very slightly different. But for you purists, I really don't think it affects the gameplay. This is basically classic NetHack but with better graphics than have ever been seen before. Sadly, they are still not very good. I would love to see some really good graphics on NetHack someday, but I'm not sure there is enough interest for that these days. The devs of this game say they have graphical updates coming, and from what I've seen they look amazing, but the project seems to have stalled out, so who knows if we'll actually get them.\n\nEither way, if you have played NetHack before, this is the best version to play IMO. Don't come at me if you're an ASCII purist, I don't care. This is objectively a better game experience than ASCII characters, don't lie to yourself. If you have never played NetHack, this will be by far the easiest way to get into it, and I highly recommend you give it a try. Sure, you can get a free version of NetHack online. But you will struggle to figure out what to do. Just buy this, it's worth it. (Not that you won't struggle in this too, just remember to ask the oracle, and if you can't figure something out... well I guess there is no shame in looking it up. I'll give you one hint though, you can engrave \"Elbereth\" on the ground to protect yourself from many enemies for a short time.)\n\nI guess I should add something here on the off chance that anyone here is totally unfamiliar with Nethack. It is a D&D inspired dungeon crawler which is randomly generated with each new game. You start off not knowing what things are - for example, you may find a potion, and realize it is a potion, but not know what it does. It might be called a \"milky potion\", and even if you have identified a milky potion in a previous game, that will not help you because the item descriptions are also randomized. You'll have to do some experimentation to figure out what potion it is, and from then on, you'll recognize it as, say, a potion of healing (not all potions have positive effects, though). Until you die. You only get one life, so you better make it count. Progress in this game is made through dying over and over and getting a little further each time, until you have learned the mechanics of the game and how to use your character well enough to be able to beat it, which is no small task. Few people who play are dedicated, careful, and ingenious enough to actually do it. \n\nWhile the game may be limited in terms of graphics and an easy to use interface, it is anything but when it comes to player choice. In fact, it is the most robust game I have ever played in that regard. You'll have to use every object you find to maximum effect in order to make it out alive, and that often means getting creative and using items in ways which are not immediately obvious, and which no other game would allow you to do (barring some other hardcore roguelikes, which are all essentially inspired by this game and its predecessor, Rogue). Here is a video which explains what I mean pretty well. There are some spoilers in it (what players call hints on the game mechanics - not storyline spoilers, the storyline is for you to fill in the details), but I think they are good for proving the point. https://youtu.be/SjuTyJlgLJ8\n\nIf you've enjoyed \"roguelikes\" and \"roguelites\", which are terms very loosely thrown around these days, often being applied to games which only have a couple of these mechanics such as permadeath, and want to see what all the fuss is about, this is what you should try. It's frustrating, it's hard to learn the basics, and much, much harder to beat. But it can also give you experiences that you will never have in any other game (again, possibly barring some other games which were inspired by it). \n\nPersonally I'd recommend limiting your exposure to spoilers, because I think it's more fun to figure it out for yourself, even if it means you'll never beat the game. If you can reach the oracle a few levels down, he can give you some hints. The Elbereth trick mentioned above is technically a spoiler, but given that it is mentioned in the guide that comes with the game, and it would be difficult to reach the oracle who tells you this trick without knowing it, I don't think it counts. \n\nBasically, it's NetHack. The learning curve is pretty insane. But once you get into it, you won't want to stop. This is a masterpiece of gaming, and while I can't give too much credit to the creators of this game, given that they really just slapped a skin on it, I do believe that this is the definitive version, for now. The controls are still complicated but less so, and the graphics and music, while not great, are certainly better than nothing (which is what you'll get with the free version). Good luck and happy hacking.\n\n9.5/10","timestamp_created":1609446743,"timestamp_updated":1610152171,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ434qj8vYCfpGavwI="}
