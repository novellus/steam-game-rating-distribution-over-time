      \ brutal environment.<br><br>Zombie Watch is a top-down, open world survival\
      \ game that will take you to a post-apocalyptic world, where you are going to\

      \ resources and build a self-sustaining base with defences to fend off the incoming\
      \ zombie hordes. Craft or find weapons, armor, medicine and much more.<br><br><strong>STORY</strong><br><br>You\
      \ wake up in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by bloodthirsty zombies that are\

      \ once they spot you. While living in hiding or fighting for your life, you\
      \ also have to attend your basic human needs. It would be a shame if you perished\
