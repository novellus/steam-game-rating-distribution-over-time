    review: 'This sixth entry in the [I]Witches'' Legacy[/I] series is better than
      entries two to five, but still doesn''t get a thumbs up from me.


      The improvement is in gameplay: more intricate and challenging point-and-click
      puzzles. Unfortunately, it''s the same concept as previous games (except the
      first [I]Witches'' Legacy[/I]), which means that most of the puzzles are "magical"
      and make no real-world sense and deduction won''t help you. As an example, in
      one puzzle you light a censer with flower oil, which stimulates a magical pyramid,
      which releases ... a necklace. Makes sense, right? ;)


      Also unfortunately the story is as bad as any of the previous games, possibly
      worse. Remarkably there are practically no characters in this game, they are
      just one-dimensional props for the puzzles. Have the writers just given up entirely?'
