      \ /><br><br>Once every millennium, Sun holds a huge gathering of the planetary\
      \ spirits. While Sun has found herself down in the dumps recently \u2014 including\
      \ a relationship with Terra (Earth) that is on the rocks and what she now considers\
      \ a largely mundane, solitary existence \u2014 she hopes that the get together\
      \ will brighten things up. However, after Terra ruins her event with his reckless\
      \ behavior, Sun decides it\u2019s time to play the field and chooses a new planetary\
      \ partner. <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1141520/extras/chara.png?t=1587834543\"\
      \ /><br>Sun: The life force for the entire solar system, so she's very warm\
      \ and loving. She loves these parties because she gets to spend time with everyone\
      \ since the majority of the time she feels distant and lonely. She has no other\
      \ stars to relate to and most planets see her as royalty rather than a friend.\
      \ <br><br>Mercury: He has trouble relating and making friends because of his\
      \ moods that run hot and cold. He covers up majority of body to hide scars and\
      \ mostly prefers his solitude away from the increasing drama of the other planets.<br><br>Venus:\
      \ He loves to stand out and enjoys pranking and teasing the other planets. He\
      \ is the only other planet that dated Sun and his planet turned into a poisonous\
      \ wasteland after their breakup. However, he claims he prefers it this way because\
      \ of the lack of responsibility<br><br>Earth/Terra: Known by the other planets\
      \ as incredibly dense and largely unremarkable in talent, some see him as undeserving\
      \ of Sun and her blessing. However, he has pushed himself to the limit for Sun\
      \ and his planet, drinking to cope with his responsibilities. He's quickly reaching\
      \ his breaking point with the increased pollution and problems on Earth while\
      \ trying desperately to keep the one he loves happy. <br><br>Mars: Easy to anger\
      \ and tough, she doesn\u2019t really like anyone, nor does she try to make friends.\
      \ Mars probably wants Sun\u2019s blessing the most out of anyone though and\
      \ so would be happy to see Terra and Sun break up. She is nicer to Sun than\
      \ she is to anyone else.<br><br>Jupiter: The big brother of the planets, especially\
      \ to Terra. He was the one who originally encouraged nervous Terra to talk to\
      \ Sun after her breakup with Venus. As the largest and first of the planets\
      \ in the Solar System, he is fiercely loyal to Sun and would do almost anything\
      \ for her. While he's always been kind, over the last few millennia, he hasn't\
      \ been as thorough in his maintenance of the asteroid belt and the rest of the\
      \ system. <br><br>Saturn: Saturn is the most popular of the planets, in part\
      \ because she can easily charm anyone. But still, she maintains a certain distance\
      \ from everyone \u2014 she was hurt in the past when someone got too close and\
      \ doesn\u2019t want to risk the same happening again. Might it have something\
      \ to do with her rings?<br><br>Uranus/Ur: Self-conscious about the name, like\
      \ his planet he is a bit eccentric. Ur feels like there\u2019s nothing unique\
      \ about him and doesn\u2019t understand why Sun gives him attention. In reality,\
      \ he is the most intelligent of the planets. However, he is dangerously out\
      \ of touch with his emotions\u2026<br><br>Neptune:  A bully to some and idol\
      \ to others, Neptune is one of the most influential planets. Her cool, composed\
      \ outer nature gives way to surprising storminess when least expected, and it\u2019\
      s almost impossible to keep up with her speedy transitions or know what she\u2019\
      s truly thinking. Despite that, she does work hard for the outer planets, with\
      \ one notable exception\u2026<br><br>Pluto: The most distant from Sun. Sun is\
      \ nice enough to invite him to every millennia party but he tends to get bullied\
      \ by Neptune and the outer planets (the outties gang) who believe he should\
      \ not be included in the 9 official planets recognized by Sun. His actions can\
      \ be unpredictable, like his planet\u2019s tilted and inclined orbit. Passive\
      \ and small,  he never tries to fight back against anyone who ridicules him.<br><br><img\
