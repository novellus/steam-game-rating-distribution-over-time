    review: "DO NOT buy this; NEVER buy this ! I've apparently waste 12,99\u20AC for\
      \ having a DLC full of glitches and bugs. Really I'm serious.\n\nAt first, there\
      \ is a lot of very basic things you can't do :\n-Change a political party's\
      \ name (When you create a new party, the name is randomly generated by the game\
      \ and you can't change it).\n-Create or modify a character (You can't create\
      \ any character, like if you want to customize a president's face or something\
      \ like that).\n-Change a national anthem.\n-Create new buildings.\n-Make natural\
      \ disasters happen.\n\nAnd for the little things you can do, it is all horribly\
      \ buggy :\n-If you create a political party for any nation, when you get to\
      \ play your scenario, it will have the default name. Like if you decide remove\
      \ the \"Republican Alliance\" from the american political parties, if you create\
      \ another party with the same political ideology (Right centrism) it will be\
      \ called \"Republican Alliance\", even if the generated name is different when\
      \ you are modding your scenario. Everything you create or change will finally\
      \ have the default game name when you play.\n\nIf you have 12,99\u20AC (Or whatever\
      \ your money is) DO NOT do the error I've made by buying this completly glitched\
      \ DLC. I'm serious, you have to trust me. Buy another Geo-Political game that\
      \ have a free included modding program like SuperPower 2."
