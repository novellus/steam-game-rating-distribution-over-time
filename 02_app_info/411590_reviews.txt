The problem is that getting there is a total drag. The puzzles and their solutions are so obtuse that they almost seem custom made to be as frustrating as possible. There are hints, but they often make little to no sense.  Of course, since it's in the Adventure genre, this can all be solved by having a walkthrough handy, so it gets a recommendation from me.","timestamp_created":1608598236,"timestamp_updated":1608598236,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtqX7w/YCdbCIvAI="}
