    about_the_game: <strong>Main Breakdown</strong><br>The games main objective and
      goal is to reach the boss room at the end of the level and eliminate the target
      by avoiding collisions with anything that might stop your bullet. As you ascend
      the tower, each boss has a significantly larger floor plan, each floor is also
      randomly generated, making it that much more difficult to reach them.<br><br><img

      moment is the winning submission for the 48 hour GameJam (plus all the fixes

      the push towards random level generation.<br><br><strong>Updates will be posted

    short_description: A disorienting arcade style &quot;shooter&quot; where you need
      to make your shot count because you only get one as well as you control its
      trajectory in an attempt to reach your target. Avoid obstacles, smash bonus
      targets and reach the end of the level without crashing in this bullet bending
      title.
