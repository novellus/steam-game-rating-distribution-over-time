I'd spend many hours playing this game, and was sad when flash ended in 2021. Then I found it on steam and was relieved. This game is very fun and the background music and sounds are fun as well. This game is a very well priced and I'd recommend it for all ages. I bought it for myself and gifted it to a friend.","timestamp_created":1609904947,"timestamp_updated":1609904947,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48//z6vYCd47zwAI="}
