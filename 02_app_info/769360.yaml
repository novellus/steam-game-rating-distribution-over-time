    review: 'This game definitely had some potenital, but in the end it fell flat
      on several things.


      So you apparently play as some detective who investigate a house. There''s definitely
      a horror feeling to it, and there''s enough tension to actually jump when there''s
      jumpscares. However the "run" sequences are a bit... odd due to the weird soundtrack.
      However they''re quite easy (the labyrinth took a few time but got it eventually).


      So what''s bad? Everything else. The story is badly told, the translation is
      essentially non-existing as it was probably done through Google Translate and
      then mangled an extra time for the sake of it and the game isn''t really that
      good after all.


      I usually want to give games an extra chance, but damn I do not recommend this.
      There''s better games like this out there.'
