    about_the_game: '<i>Spriter</i> makes it easy for anyone, <i>regardless of experience</i>,
      to create 2D game animations using a technique called <i>Modular Animation</i>.<br><br>Unlike
      traditional animation which requires each frame to be hand-drawn, <i>Spriter</i>
      animations are made of <i>individual sprite pieces</i>; these pieces can be
      rotated, transformed, and tweened along an animation timeline. This allows you
      to quickly create great looking animations in a fraction of the time while requiring
      significantly less art.<br><br><i>Spriter</i> also takes advantage of <i>skeletal
      animation</i>. Create a skeleton using the bone tool, attach images to each
      bone, and finally animate the bones with <i>Spriter''s</i> vast array of user-friendly
      animation tools. The result: a fully animated sprite using your own graphics.<br><br>Spriter
      is great for animating characters, user interfaces, power-ups, combat animations
      and more! Even if you''ve never animated before, <i>Spriter</i> provides you
      with an easy to understand, yet powerful toolset allowing you to jump right
      in!<br><br>Spriter Pro includes the Essentials versions of all of our Animated
      Art Packs, free to use in any of your game projects. Once you install Spriter

    short_description: Spriter makes it easy for anyone, regardless of experience,
      to create 2D game animations using a technique called Modular Animation. Individual
      sprite pieces can be attached to bones and then easily animated with the powerful,
      yet easy to use toolset.

    review: I would wait for this to go on sale again to buy. I wouldn't pay full
      price for this use to the fact it crashed when exporting too often to the point
      where they even have a function to save the export in a file. This is great
      but it's too unfinished for BrassMonkey to be making a Spriter 2.
