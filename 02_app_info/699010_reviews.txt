It's got some jank but I found it charming. Seems they are still working on new chapters for the game as well. [spoiler] You aren't forced to kill any bears if you don't want to. [/spoiler]\n\nThere are two kinds of bears in it: A brown/grizzly bear mom and cub, and a black bear. \n\nThe game contributes to the small niche of bear-themed narrative games so for that it has my full support.\n\n＼ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ／ \n\n","timestamp_created":1581707592,"timestamp_updated":1581707592,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwlNDHovACc9Cf8gE="}
