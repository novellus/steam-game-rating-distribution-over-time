    about_the_game: 'Wizard Hunter 2348 is a stealthy cover shooter about battling
      armies of wizards who will summon tough demons when alerted. The game features
      a full set of stealth mechanics in much the style of certain AAA stealth games.
      Enemies individually keep track of where they think the player is and can communicate
      this by shouting to each other. You can get them to look the other way through
      judicious use of dead bodies and throwing rocks- er, rockets.<br><br>In the
      hidden corners of the world, on scattered planets throughout the nation of the
      United Galaxies, there lurks a criminal element: Wizards. These wretched villains
      immerse their minds in the Chaos Matrix, calling forth fell beings from beyond
      space itself into our mortal realm without first acquiring the correct licenses.
      As a member of an elite commando branch of the Immigration Services department,
      it is your privilege and duty to bring down any demon-summoning wizards who
      have not first acquired visas for the demons they summon.<br><br>In the words
      of your drill sergeant at the Bureaucratic Training Academy: &quot;If I say
      ''Jump'', you say ''How high?'' If I say ''Demons work tirelessly for the betterment
      of all without needing food or rest'', you say ''Where are their visas?''&quot;<br><br>Wizard
