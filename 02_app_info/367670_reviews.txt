This is a MUST GET if you use controller at all. I have a set up that basically makes it so I can sign in, use the desktop, start games, literally anything and be wireless which is amazing for those times I just wanna sit back and relax on some schleapy time game in bed. If you really want then there is a free program called Gopher360 on github but its very bootleg compared to controller companion, $2 couldn't be spent better.","timestamp_created":1609723542,"timestamp_updated":1609723542,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn/+/5fYCc9egwAI="}
