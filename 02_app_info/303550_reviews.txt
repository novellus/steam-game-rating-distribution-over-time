While it is moderately easy all the way through, you still feel good about yourself for solving the puzzles or doing some clean platforming. It just feels good to play this game, and its concept is incredibly unique.","timestamp_created":1609916127,"timestamp_updated":1609916127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48dKe6/YCeN32wAI="}
