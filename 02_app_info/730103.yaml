    short_description: Ino, Sakura and Choji trudge across a desert under the blazing
      sun without any provisions. Ino and Sakura are arguing when a giant scorpion
      attacks and injures Sakura. While Ino tends to Sakura?s wound with Medical Ninjutsu,
      she remembers back to when she ducked out of her Ino-Shika-Cho training.
