    review: I'd appreciate more care in the design of the game; some sequences weren't
      executed well due to the text box hiding the key items, and then there's the
      map...as seen in the screenshots...poorly done, and compromised the gameplay
      greatly. The story did alright with getting me interested, but I wouldn't call
      this game ready for a full release.
