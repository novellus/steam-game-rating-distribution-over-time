    about_the_game: "The distinctive Class 58, nicknamed the \u2018Bone\u2019 because\
      \ of its unusual shape with a wide cab at either end, is now available to lend\
      \ some serious hauling power in Train Simulator.<br><br>The Class 58 was built\
      \ between 1983 and 1987 by BREL in Doncaster Works as British Rail wanted a\
      \ new freight locomotive that would be lower in cost and maintenance whilst\
      \ being able to cope with the potential growth in rail freight in the 1980s.\
      \ It was in the 1970s when BR started looking for this new locomotive when they\
      \ turned to the American design of a modular structure, meaning the loco would\
      \ be made up of standardized sections that attach to the underframe, allowing\
      \ for easy maintenance and lower building costs.<br><br>Fifty Class 58s were\
      \ built in total and were initially used on coal trains, however that was short\
      \ lived as they were entering service around the same time of the miner\u2019\
      s strikes of 1984/5 and so were used on a variety of freight services. Contrary\
      \ to the claims made in the 1980s, the Class 58s proved less successful on various\
      \ types of freight services when compared to the Class 56s due to an increase\
      \ in the amount of wheelslip occurred, which was mainly caused by the design\
      \ of the bogies.<br><br>Despite being built for exclusively freight use, the\
      \ Class 58s did haul various passenger services for example when a loco failed\
      \ and a backup was required. They also played a key role in \u2018Spin and Win\u2019\
      \ charters, with 58017 being the only member of the class to have not hauled\
      \ a charter service. Having started life in the BR RailFreight livery, the 58s\
      \ have seen a variety of different liveries following sectorisation and privatisation\
      \ including Coal Sector Triple Grey, Mainline Freight and EWS.<br><br>The Class\
      \ 58s started to be withdrawn from service in in the late 1990s and by 2002,\
      \ the last few finished operating in the UK. This wasn\u2019t the end of the\
      \ Class 58 though, in 2000 the Spanish infrastructure operator GIF hired eight\
      \ Class 58s from EWS, where they have been constantly used up until today and\
      \ other Class 58s were sent for work in France and the Netherlands. This cascade\
      \ of Class 58s saw them in a unique set of liveries not usually found on British\
      \ locos including GIF and ACTS. In the UK, one loco has survived into preservation,\
      \ 58016 which was bought by the Class 58 Locomotive Group.<br><br>The BR Class\
      \ 58 for Train Simulator, developed by Skyhook Games, includes both BR Railfreight\
      \ and BR Coal Sector liveries, HAA hopper wagons and PGA wagons. The pack also\
      \ includes a short Academy tutorial to introduce you to the Class 58\u2019s\
      \ controls.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you\
      \ the freedom to drive the BR Class 58 on any Quick Drive enabled route for\
      \ Train Simulator, such as those available through Steam. Also included are\
