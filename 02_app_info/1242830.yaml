      \ ever imagine to explore the Underwater Cultural Heritage from the comfort\
      \ of your own home?<br><br>Thanks to the iMARECULTURE project, you can explore\
      \ the 3D reconstructions of two of the most beautiful underwater archaeological\
      \ sites of the Mediterranean Sea: the Underwater Archaeological Park of Baiae\
      \ (near Naples - Italy) and the Phoenician shipwreck of Xlendi (Gozo \u2013\
      \ Malta).<br>In Roman times, Baiae was a fashionable resort city with a thermal\
      \ spa located over natural volcanic vents, in the centre of the Gulf of Pozzuoli.\
      \ The Roman elite built luxurious villas there from late republic to roman imperial\
      \ period, but part of the town became submerged in the sea due to bradyseismic\
      \ activity. Nowadays, most of villas lie at the bottom of the shallow waters\
      \ of the bay. Here you can explore the ruins of Villa con ingresso a Protiro,\
      \ composed of a series of rooms with a central atrium to provide them with light.\
      \ Within these rooms there are some wonderful mosaics. During the virtual exploration\
      \ you will be able to listen some information about the structures, and activate\
      \ the hypothetical reconstruction and see how the villa appeared in Roman times.\
      \ Moreover, you will enjoy a set of 360-degrees videos that mix virtual environments\
      \ and real actors to tell a story settled in the ancient Baiae.<br>The Phoenician\
