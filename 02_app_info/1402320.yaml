    about_the_game: "Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond is an action-packed, immersive\
      \ VR experience set in World War II, where you step into the boots of an agent\
      \ of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in war-torn Europe. A deep single-player\
      \ campaign bursting with authentic detail takes you through historic events\
      \ on land, air, and sea, sabotaging Nazi bases, subverting enemy plans, aiding\
      \ the French Resistance, and partaking in the biggest moments of the war. <br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to the rich narrative campaign, you\u2019ll be\
      \ able to hone your skills in challenging combat exercises, go deeper into the\
      \ history with award-winning short films created just for the game, and test\
      \ yourself against your fellow soldiers in explosive, fast-paced multiplayer\
      \ matches. Multiplayer modes take place on numerous sites across Europe and\
      \ feature competitive modes where you fight alone, with a team, or even scramble\
      \ to plant and diffuse timed explosives.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou\u2019ll need\
      \ more than good aim to succeed in your mission. Use anything in the world as\

      \ burning airplanes. You\u2019ll have to stay on your toes if you want to make\
      \ it out alive. You\u2019re not watching history, you\u2019re experiencing it,\
      \ like never before."

    review: ' This game sent my memory to 90% and my cpu to almost 50% and it frequently
      crashes. I have only made a couple of reviews but I had to make one on this
      piece of garbage. It does nothing but crash. It almost deepfries your computer
      chip and ram. It has worse graphics than halflife alyx and boneworks but those
      run 144hz with no frame drops just fine for me but this game dosent even let
      you finish a cutscene without crashing. This game is a waste of time. I hate
      this game with a burning passion. It had so much potential but Respawn and EA
      just had to ruin it.'
