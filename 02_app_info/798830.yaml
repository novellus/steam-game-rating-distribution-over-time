    reviews: "\u201CTrue to its genre, The Commission is a game not so much about\
      \ displays of force or tactical genius, but about numbers and spreadsheets,\
      \ patience and a certain penchant for flaunting statistical improbability.\u201D\
      <br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://medium.com/@spncryn/collateral-loss-209004131c3d\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Spencer Yan - Medium</a><br><br>\u201C\
      The Commission is approaching the genre through a smaller lens, instead focusing\
      \ on a single city and placing you in control of mafia family operations in\
      \ the [1930s].\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://indiegames.com/2018/07/grand_strategy_gets_a_little_d.html\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Indie Games The Weblog</a><br><br>\u201C\
      The Commission: OC is an innovative take on the grand strategy genre that manages\
      \ to strike a great balance between immersion, challenge and intuitive mechanics.\
      \ 302 Interactive succeeds in creating a game that can only be described as\
      \ a new milestone for Mafia strategy games and will very likely have you spend\
      \ hours upon hours on it.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD_VXQS8egM\"\

      \ \"Scarface\" Al Capone, Frank \"The Enforcer\" Nitti, Bumpy Johnson, Dutch\
      \ Schultz, Lucky Luciano, Bugsy Siegel, Meyer Lansky, James Cagney & Humphrey\
      \ Bogart in \"The Roaring Twenties\", Edward G Robinson in \"Little Caesar\"\
      , Vito Corleone, Sonny Corleone, Michael Corleone, the guy who cut off the horses\
      \ head and somehow got it up the stairs and under the sheets without waking\
      \ anyone or leaving a blood trail and everyone else rolled into one!\n\nYou\
      \ get to run rackets, make money, bribe, kill and do all the things that make\
      \ life worthwhile!\n\nEvery week (turn) I have a meeting with guys like Mickey\
      \ \u201CThe Hedgehog\u201D, \u201CCigs\u201D Andelini, Lorenzo \u201CCharms\u201D\

      \ Never Rat on Your Friends, yes it's even better than Goodfellas and I love\
      \ that freaking movie. \n\nLike I Said, I Don't Care If This Game Never Ends,\
      \ Actually I Hope It Doesn't.\n\nBecause when Murder Incorporated bumped off\

      \nWhen they got Al Capone on tax evasion did the Chicago outfit leave town?\n\
      \nWhen Lucky Luciano was deported did that criminal Empire crumble?\n\nWhen\
