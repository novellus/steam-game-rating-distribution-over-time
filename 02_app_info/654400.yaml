      /> <br>Shank n' Bake is a mixture of cutesy platforming and overly violent runner
      cartoon goodness. Slay your foes, dress sharply, and use powerups and your special

      food. A lone adorable jelly filled muffin man, <strong>Miff Mufflon</strong>
      must travel the world brutally murdering healthy foods and their leaders, <strong>The
      Four</strong>, to the point of extinction so that his kind can, once again,
      be eaten and appreciated by humans.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/654400/extras/death.gif?t=1598375078"
      /> <br>Think not for a moment that you can deal out death and avoid it entirely.
      Dying horribly will no doubt be a common part of your beautiful journey, so
      lean back enjoy the auditory treat of around 1 hour of unique screaming deaths
      and the visual experience of dozens of unique deaths and murder animations!

      you up with the latest in baked good fashion. With an ungodly amount of combinations,
      your can express your truest self, be it a laser sword wielding copper or a
      very royal leather daddy.
