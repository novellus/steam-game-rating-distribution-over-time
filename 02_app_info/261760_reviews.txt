The AI is well created and the world looks good, at first. Don't take a second look, but more to it later.\n\nYou know, the game has lacks in the story and actually everything else then the combat system. \n\n-Generel-\nThe base of the game is the combat, so you kill enemies to gain new materials to craft new spells. But the crafting system is VERY uncomfortable if you're new to the game. To get a building guide online is one way to make it easier for you, or you just start learnin how to make good spells (which will take time, and even if you got it, it's uncomfortable)\n\n-Graphics-\nFor a game of 2014 you can see good graphics, but at some points you're back in 19xx. One day you will walk through the endless areas of the game and hugh? Is this Minecraft? And sometimes even the AI will appear with only half of the rendered pixels that are necessary to identify what is coming. \n\n-AI-\ni like the AI, so this is the one thing that makes fun - bash the AI which is made decent IMO.\n\n-areas-\nyes, i have to talk about the areas. You will walk A LOT through repetitive areas, which are LONG as hell. You got a desert, a swamp, icy mountains etc. but its all the same, really. \n\n-Story-\nThe Story (and i care a lot about the story of RPG) has good ideas, but the implementation isn't good. So DON'T buy this game if you want a good story.\n\nWhat can i say? It's just a shame that they haven't gave more time to process the game properly. The game gets boring after some time and you will stop playin or (like me) play it till the end because you paid money :(\n\nSo look for yourself, or switch back to skyrim where you love the bugs - not like here. \n\n","timestamp_created":1607643130,"timestamp_updated":1609981705,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.550172984600067139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sueY7fYCfPPzuAI="}
