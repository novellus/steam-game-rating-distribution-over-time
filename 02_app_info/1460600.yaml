    about_the_game: "\u200BIt has been 20 years since a plague ravaged the planet.\
      \ The dead rose to shamble across the dense urban expanses and vast plains around\
      \ the globe. Cities crumbled and humanity retreated into their last safe bastions\
      \ to fend off the relentless hordes. In the preceding decades, most of the hordes\
      \ have rotted away and the time has come for humanity to strike out again and\
      \ reclaim what was lost. You have been chosen to lead a small party into the\
      \ wasteland, clear away the rubble of what were once thriving metropolises,\
      \ and raise a new settlement in its place. Can you help humanity to recover\
      \ and rebuild from what's left behind?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat's Left Behind\
      \ is a post-apocalyptic city re-builder. Choose from a variety of maps based\
      \ around real-world cities and start your new settlement from the ground up.\
      \ Clear away old buildings, gather supplies and provide for your settlers, all\
      \ while keeping a vigilant eye out for the remnants of the shambling horde."
