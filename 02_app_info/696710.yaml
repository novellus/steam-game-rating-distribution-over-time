    review: 'I wish there was a neutral option when it comes to rating games.  That
      being said, it''s a different kind of HoG than I''m used to playing, which made
      it a bit refreshing.


      While this game had an interesting concept, it had a habit of being a little
      frustrating.  There were too many objects you are looking to find and many of
      them required a specific location to click on it to get it. Not only that, but
      the slider feature just stopped working once I got past the horse and rider
      fountain scene. Without the slider functioning like it should, I couldn''t get
      the last piece to progress to the next scene. I''m thoroughly disappointed by
      that, as I shouldn''t have to start a game entirely over to see if the issue
      is resolved or still there.


      I would highly recommend if you''re looking to play it, don''t pay full price
      for it.'
