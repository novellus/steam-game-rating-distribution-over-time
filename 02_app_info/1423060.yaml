    review: 'The game feel on the laser is really nice. Getting shots off that chain
      a bunch of explosions together is super satisfying. If I could suggest something
      it''d be to have an option in the Quarters to view the models up close. They
      look pretty cool and it''s a shame you can only look at them from far away.


      I also think this would make for a fun mobile game.'
