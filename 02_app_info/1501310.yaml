    about_the_game: The Ranchers is an open world country-life RPG in open sandbox
      mode!<br><br>After years of living in the metropolis' stressful and hectic life,
      you finally decide to leave everything behind to buy your first lot of land
      in the country and start a new life, in the quiet, close to nature. However,
      your skills as a farmer and manager will be put to the test to make your Ranch
      a prosperous business and earn the villagers' respect and esteem. And who knows,
      maybe find love and start a family.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>CREATE YOUR RANCH</strong></h2>

      more. You'll have plenty of space to create the Ranch of your dreams.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>DEVELOP
      YOUR RANCH</strong> </h2>Craft objects, machines, and transform your basic resources
      into elaborate products to attract villagers, fill daily orders, or sell them
      in different markets for maximum profit.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>MANAGE YOUR
      RANCH</strong></h2> Optimize your Ranch's resource consumption, sign water,
      electricity contracts, or build your water wells, wind turbines, and solar panels
      and sell your surplus to the village.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>ONLINE COOPERATION</strong>
      </h2>Invite 1 to 3 players to join you in your Ranch online! Your friends can

      WORLD</strong></h2> On foot, horseback, scooter, pickup, or yacht, explore a
      gigantic open world where mines, wild islands, shipwrecks, and dangerous monsters
      abound. Use your skills to recover ultra-rare minerals, gems, etc., to make
      and improve your tools, donate them to the village museum, or sell them at the
      auction market to other players.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>IMPROVE YOUR SKILLS</strong></h2>
      Enhance your character with various skills that will serve you in your adventures.
      Choose to develop your farming, ranching, crafting/building, combat, or hunter/fisher
      skills depending on your play style.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>BUILD THE HOUSE
      OF YOUR DREAMS</strong></h2> By the seaside, in the middle of the prairie, or
      on top of a hill, choose your decor and place your furniture to create a house
      that reflects your image and that your friends will love.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>JOIN
      THE COMMUNITY</strong> </h2>Meet many colorful characters and discover their
      atypical personalities, everyday life, and fascinating stories. They go to work,
      go to the park, go to the restaurant, play sports, and interact with each other
      in many different ways. Take the time to get to know them, make friendships,
      and who knows, maybe love will be there, and you can move in together, have
      children and start a family?<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>AND SO MUCH MORE</strong>
