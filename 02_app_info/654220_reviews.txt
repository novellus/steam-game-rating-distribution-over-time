No more forgetting to add POIs. No accidentally bumping damage cubes or hot spots.\n- Faster setup / tear down than the physical version\n\nMiddle Ground\n\n- Graphics work well for this sort of game. Not really sure what is up with the \"Incredibles\" soundtrack though.\n\nCons\n\n- Very bare bones. Expansions add A LOT of replayability to this game. \n- Action menu is atrocious \n- Lack of \"undo\" can absolutely ruin games, especially when coupled with the way actions are selected.\n- Gamepad controls are hit or miss. The \"snap to grid\" is either too sensitive or too sluggish.\n\nSeeing as how I own all but two expansions for the physical version, you could say I'm a fairly big fan of Flash Point. At full price, I cannot recommend this game.\n\nI would only recommend this game on sale, and even then, at a sideways thumb. If you were wanting to get the physical version, just get that. It's basically the same price as this game, and you'll have a lot more fun with it. Flash Point Digital might be for you if you already have the physical version, and would like to play it more than you can due to life circumstances, or if you think it could be fun despite the cons I listed above.","timestamp_created":1609672744,"timestamp_updated":1609672744,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxJv+4/YCcuiEwAI="}
