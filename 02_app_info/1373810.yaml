    about_the_game: 'Welcome to Orlando Theme Park VR! Are your palms sweaty already?
      Are you brave enough to face all toys and rides? Yes, this is a VR experience
      like you have never seen before! <br><br>This is a real-life simulation more
      than a game! Going to a virtual park in the comfort of your home is awesome,
      but that''s all the comfort you gonna get! The adrenaline will make you hold
      on to your chair and we really recommend you to play it with your family and
      friends! Watching them play Orlando Theme Park VR is also VERY VERY fun! Don''t
      forget to record it! <br><br><strong>Is this very realistic?</strong><br>Yep!
      We are using a fantastic game engine to be as realistic as it is possible! And
      best of all: you can go to the park for FREE!<br><br><strong>I am going to get
      sick?</strong><br>Well.. yes and no! The game can and will give some people
      motion sickness because that''s what a good amusement Park do! But I think you
      can handle it! <br><br><strong>How much does it cost?</strong><br>The game is
      free for download! And you can enjoy the Ferris Wheels, Halloween Maze, Princess
      Castle, Medieval Village and walk in the whole park for free. But some rides
      you need to purchase to use it. We strongly recommend you buy the Full Pack,
      which comes with a great discount and more: The Puke perk! Awesome to create
      youtube videos and scary your friends!<br><br>Welcome to the best real-life
      experience in VR there is!'

    review: "Alpha software - IT DOES NOT WORK!!! Knuckles are not supported - but\
      \ are shown as Wands. While I might be able to live with that, thumbstick locomotion\
      \ IS REVERSED!!! I have to go backward to go forward (again this is a fun park,\
      \ but there are limits, right?!). And left to go right!!! Devs must be out of\
      \ their minds to sell such garbage. Note, I bought all DLC for like $30, but\
      \ I'm refunding everything. \n\nPerformance isn't even good using Index res\
      \ 100 % - this game IS NOT OPTIMIZED AT ALL! This game has so few polys and\
      \ low-res textures that res 200% must work in solid 90 fps using Index and GTX\
      \ 1080, just like Boneworks. Surely this game is incredibly far from such quality.\
      \ \n\nNow, this game has great potential - but not at all in its current state.\
      \ Avoid like the plague - or Covid-19, lol. \n\nOr enter knowing that you have\
      \ been warned. \n\nFree isn't cheap enough - I need the devs to pay me for wasting\
      \ my time in this misarable game! And no, I'm not joking."
