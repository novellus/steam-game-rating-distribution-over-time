    review: 'What is Herding Dog ?


      I got into this game thinking I would be getting into a simple but cool dog
      game as someone who love dogs but what I got instead was just a stupid game
      with crappy controls and ai, fulls of bugs and other problems, the main one
      being the repetitive structure of the missions, hoarding those livestock is
      not fun, its boring, the whole game is entirely that so that pretty much speaks
      for itself.'
