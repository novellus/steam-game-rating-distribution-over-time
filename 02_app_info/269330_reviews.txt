You travel back and forth through time to solve puzzles. The story is simple and predictable but does its job. The platforming is not great, but functions.\nIm not bothered by the simplicity of the game, im bothered by the characters not having likeable personalities. It's this \"snail is an annoying young brad and old man is cynical old man\"-dynamic, but not in a way that makes either character fun. Honoustly I'd have preferred if they had just removed the dialogue completely, it doesn't make me care for the characters anyways. \nI got it on sale for 50 cents, I'd say that for that money you could enjoy your 2 hours of gameplay, but I refuse to believe that there aren't any games out there that do this same mechanic but better.","timestamp_created":1609771989,"timestamp_updated":1609772104,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlJ/55vYCcca0wAI="}
