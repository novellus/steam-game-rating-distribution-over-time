      spherical character appears for you to control. <br>Seems like a platformer,
      but you cannot jump. <br><br>You begin to roll around a garden in space.<br>You
      feel the ramps and the hills, you start bouncing against the walls to gain height.<br><br>A
      portal appears, and you start your first challenge. <br>The world is dancing,
      little trinkets push you around, and you decide to join the performance.<br>Beyond,
      a universe of creativity, astral magic and floating factories lies in wait.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Local Multiplayer (up to 8 people)<br></li><li>Create your
      own levels with an easy-to-use editor<br></li><li>With only two buttons (left
      and right), Amberial Dreams is &quot;easy to play but hard to master&quot;<br></li><li>100
      Adventure levels<br></li><li>Co-op modes and other extras</li></ul><br>This
      is the definitive entry in the Amberial series that started as a web game in
      2007, attracting millions of players from around the globe. <br><br>Amberial
      Dreams brings together all the concepts and contraptions from previous games,
