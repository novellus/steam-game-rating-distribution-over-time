It seems like the best bang for the buck, but it's not right now.\n\nArkhan is next to useless as the most expensive hero in-game.  Jamilah is outshined by Strix, which you probably won't be able to earn in game for a while until the Strix event runs again.  The other champions are alright as buff heroes.\n\nThe devs have hinted in Q&A's that a hero rebalance is coming, with specifically a \"Make Arkhan Great Again\" focus.  But that could take some time.  When that happens, I will probably recommend this pack.  But it seems like the 'meta' in the game right now is abuse seasonal champs and their overtuned power creep abilities, which means players who have started late are sub-par for now.","timestamp_created":1524892146,"timestamp_updated":1524892146,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.418603777885437012","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlfOpheMCc6iXnwE="}
