    review: 'This is the best new game i have played in about 2 years now. The game
      is still in early access, so i didn''t really expect anything that''s perfect.
      But after playing for a couple of hours, this game is pretty good. The developer
      fixes the bugs you report mostly within 24 hours after submitting, and gladly
      accepts new feature requests. The game still has some flaws, like for example,
      you don''t actually have to go to the jobs, you just click on a car and fastforward,
      but that will hopefully be better in the future, because as i said, it''s in
      early access. I''m mostly waiting for Multiplayer/co-op, since the developer
      said that that will probably be a feature in the future. I must say the driving
      physics are a bit wobbly, so there might be room for improvement on that side.



      Edit: Game has not been updated for almost 2 years, so consider it abandoned.
      Game is currently full of bugs and hardly functions. Developer has promised
      for over 2 years that the game will be updated which hasn''t happened, he says
      he is currently reworking the entire game, he promises a release date and when
      that date eventually comes we don''t hear anything from him.

      All in all, good game.
