    about_the_game: Wake up in a narrow corridor to quickly realize you're all alone
      and utterly lost. Escape the dungeons - overcome many traps, solve puzzles,
      search for useful items and try to avoid the monster following your every step
      as you try to escape the labyrinth. But what if there's something worse than
      the monster? What about hungry zombies? Will you fight back?

    detailed_description: <h1>About me</h1><p>I'm a starting game developer since
      2019. aMAZEd is my very first project on which I've learned basics of operating
      a game engine and graphics. Since my strengths are more on the programming side
      in the whole development process, you'll see some free assets used in this game
      (characters and several items) which I haven't been able to produce by myself
      - if you occur to notice some graphics with worse production values, it's probably
      made by me. Thanks in advance for your feedback.</p><br><h1>Localisation</h1><p>This
      game includes English, Czech and Slovak localisations. Localisation file is
      accessible to anyone - feel free to add another language to this game.</p><br><h1>About
      the Game</h1>Wake up in a narrow corridor to quickly realize you're all alone
