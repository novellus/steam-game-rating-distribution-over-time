    short_description: Gin-san figures that the reason Odd Jobs isn't get any requests
      at all lately is because of a lack of publicity. In order to make an advertising
      poster, he tries to come up with a catchy copy along with Kagura and Shinpachi,
      but the ideas they come up with all seem somewhat familiar.
