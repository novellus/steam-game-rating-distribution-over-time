Starting in 1862, the scenario clearly intends for the Confederacy to be on the defensive against the Union's larger army, as the objectives are to defend key cities and 1862 was past the time when the CSA had the offensive footing. If you like this history and want to see if you can lead the Union Army as well as Lincoln's generals or see if you can save the Confederacy with control over the well renowned generals and militia of the South, this is a worth while purchase.","timestamp_created":1594014079,"timestamp_updated":1594014079,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532163739204406738","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gZOpkfMCfbeZkwI="}
