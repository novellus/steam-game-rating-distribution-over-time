That's fair, I never really cared for the Team villain mode. However, I would like to point out two things.\n1st is that the environments are mostly pretty cool. Temple and Magmaria are my favorites here, and Court is not bad.\n2nd, and more important, is that a LOT of variants need this expansion to be unlocked. S&D Benchmark, Stuntman, 2 of the Xtreme Prime Wardens and one or two others I can't think of have to have this expansion to be unlocked (properly anyways. Only CHEATERS don't do the story challenge). So, I would put a maybe if I could, but overall, the environments keep it from being terrible.","timestamp_created":1606350408,"timestamp_updated":1606350408,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlMH8gPYCeIKssQI="}
