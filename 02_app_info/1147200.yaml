      \ to younger children (despite the fact that adults play this game with great\
      \ interest !!).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayers take turns to roll a die and move\
      \ to a certain number of cells. Some cells in the field are ordinary, cells\
      \ with stairs and snakes move the player\u2019s chip to another cell. The player\
      \ who first got to the finish line wins.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore the start\
      \ of the game, chips are placed in front of the playing field. The sequence\
      \ of the move is determined by lot. Then the players take turns to roll the\
      \ die and, according to the numbers that have been dropped, move their chips\
      \ to the appropriate number of cells on the field. The goal of the game is to\
      \ get to the finish line first - cells with number 100.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      If a chip has stopped on a cell with a ladder (green), the player moves the\
      \ chip up to the end of the ladder. If the chip stopped at the cell with the\
      \ head of the snake (red) - the chip goes down to the very tip of the tail."
