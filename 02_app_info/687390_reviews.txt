Not to judge a book by it's cover or anything, but it's what it looks like. So I'm not really surprised, but this is not great. All the game is is pushing different buttons to make sure bars are filled. There's nothing else to it. The music and sound effects are pretty bad too. \n\nI spent very, very little time doing this, but as soon as your egg hatches for the first time after balancing cold/hot to be within the meter. It feels like things fly off the rails and it just moves too quickly to be any semblance of fun. And I thought my Tamagotchi On was demanding of attention. While writing up this review I decided to give it a second whirl, and it was a little less overwhelming... but, it's still not well designed.\n\nYou lose happiness just to buy food, you lose discipline just to buy toys. And to be clear, there's no currency system it's just pushing buttons. And you need both to keep the happiness and hunger meter up so you don't have to start over. You can raise happiness with some other thing that looks like a compass... but it reduces discipline. \n\nIt's all just balancing different button presses than actually raising a virtual pet. The UI design is really strange. I don't understand why the \"achievement\" thing is there it just makes it so you can't minimize it as small as it could be and push those buttons while doing something else. It's at least advertised to be there, but it doesn't make it any less weird. A lot of the visuals are low quality. \n\nIf you really want a virtual pet, this ain't it. I know that this is $1 vs the $80 (CAD) of my Tamagotchi On, but... it doesn't feel like it's even 1% as good as that. Or even 1% as good as the cheaper Tamas or Digimon, or other virtual pets. I haven't found a proper one on Steam yet to recommend instead. \n\nWith a virtual pet you should feel like it's an actual pet, not just balancing different meters with different buttons. You may as well be trying to stop a pot from boiling or something. It doesn't feel like the thing gets hungry or happy for any real reason just that you hit the button that lowers it. \n\nIt's quite bad. I tried to give it a fair shake despite the negative reviews and the way it looks, but don't be like me.","timestamp_created":1564891983,"timestamp_updated":1564892810,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557083666324615479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsam4rewCfITazwE="}
