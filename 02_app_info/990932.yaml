    review: "All right, so the good things first. The setting and especially the score\
      \ is quite impressive. It's obvious they wanted to try something different and\
      \ seeing all the effort going into this, it is quite a shame that I had little\
      \ to no enjoyment out of this one.\n\nThis time around they try themselves at\
      \ a more traditional game-type of story-telling that, sadly, doesn't fit well\
      \ with the overall design of the game. There are a lot of scripted scenes that\
      \ feel jarring, there is little to no exploration, the fight system is quite\
      \ annoying, the story isn't particularly interesting and it is definitely an\
      \ action setting and not a horror one. \n\nSome people seemed to enjoy this\
      \ one a lot and it does bring a wave of fresh air, but I was glad when it ended,\
      \ so sadly this is going to be the only part of the game that I cannot recommend\
      \ to anyone."
