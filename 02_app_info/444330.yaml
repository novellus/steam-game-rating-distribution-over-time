    review: I like this game, it's too bad Steam doesn't allow for a middle of the
      road review. My main objection to the game is, there seems to be only one campaign
      and that's the tutorial. I asked the developer, but have received no answer.
      With this in mind I give it an unenthusiastic thumbs up. If it were a school
      project, a solid C-.
