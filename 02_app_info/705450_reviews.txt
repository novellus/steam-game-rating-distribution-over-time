The whole candle gimmick is beyond idiotic especially when there are flying mosquito things laying eggs and multiplying all over the place and some pink creature dropping leeches from the ceiling that further deplete the candle if they happen to hit your hand cursor. Not to mention the whole slap maneuver is hit and miss. I can only get it to work half the time. \n\nThe whole thing is way too irritating when it's on a timer as short as the one in game is. Words cannot express my dislike for this pseudo rage game. Hiding this game in my library so I never have to look at it again.","timestamp_created":1601957419,"timestamp_updated":1602004140,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.426764219999313354","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/ue4//QCeJ6TpgI="}
