This is a must have in your library if you like arcade games or want to play quick couch co-up games. Kids love it too.\n\nGreat setup. Easy visuals. Easy controls.  This is the one.\n\nIts a shame development has stopped on this one. There are still some minor bugs.  I'd like a Ballistic tanks V2. With more tanks. More levels. Some balanced weapons. More done with the airplanes idea. More couch-co-up human vs bots.","timestamp_created":1608071214,"timestamp_updated":1608071214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwu+6gtPYCd/bGugI="}
