Good for about an hour of solo gameplay and half an hour more of the other modes offered if you want to explore those.\n\nI always judge games based on their price and I would say that there are definitely other titles at the same price range that will give you more bang for your buck. Not a bad game, just a bit too pricey for what it offers.","timestamp_created":1595029923,"timestamp_updated":1595029923,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y6TMr/MCcbD7lQI="}
