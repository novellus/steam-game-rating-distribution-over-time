New game! This is a first for me... It is a bit like the first Zelda, which I loved, so I easily got into this game.\n\nPros: Great price for content!\nNostalgic feeling.\nIt's a bit difficult at first with minimal direction (I feel getting led on the entire game is destructive to the value)\nThere's not much to say about it that you can't see in the video. It has a great feel to it, controls feel smooth once you figure them out, the monsters aren't one shot kills, and you have a bit of exploring to figure out what you're doing. The quest menu is rather helpful as it saves the important parts of notes for locations.\n\nCons: A bit buggy (I find myself shooting and nothing coming out at times, using the hookshot flings you across the screen occasionally) Nothing too frustrating though.\nFiguring out menu controls... kinda annoying (To select an item, you have to highlight the item in the menu, hit x, then enter or else it will continue to use the previous item) being conditioned with easier ways of doing that in menus made me use bombs unintentionally multiple times.\nGetting hit automatically brings you back to your weakest setting. That'd be like Mario having a cat suit on, getting hit once and becomming baby mario... maybe regression?\nTHE MAP! I mean, why even have one if that's what we get? I would've been happier without.\n\nThe cons are very specific and small, it wouldn't even ruin a game that costs a lot more. This is definitely worth $3, and even moreso, is engrossing and enjoyable. The monsters (although repetative) don't feel overused, the areas are a bit simple, but finding them can be challenging. It's a good way to pass a few hours and it has achievements!","timestamp_created":1520243379,"timestamp_updated":1520243379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586532771587371826","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1520257270,"developer_response":"Thank you so much for the review. \nIts our Privilege"}],"cursor":"AoJ4s6Hk+uECdM/nmgE="}
