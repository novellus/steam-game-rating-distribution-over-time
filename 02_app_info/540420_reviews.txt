It's a fairly by the numbers action movie with the twist that our reluctant action hero is a big stoner.\n\nAmerican Ultra also borrows a bit from the slasher/zombie genre of films, our hero is not a gunslinger. Improvised weapons are used throughout the entire film, look forward to violence in a wide variety of forms, even though the settings are extraordinarily mundane.\n\nOverall, the movie can be a bit cheezy, but it still fulfills everything that one might expect from an action movie, and the humor is never so overbearing that it distracts from the action as a whole.\n\nDefinitely pick this up at sale prices, but otherwise a rental may be more appropriate instead of the full 10.99 price.","timestamp_created":1504481045,"timestamp_updated":1504481045,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oN2Dpd4CcPm6hAE="}
