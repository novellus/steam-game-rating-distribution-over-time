While the mechanics are not very complex, most attributes and every of the few items is well-thought and has its use, like a warp item which shortens backtracking or a radar item that allows you to sneak through passages which are heavily populated with enemies.\nThe bizarre lore is made with passion and contributes to the unique atmosphere of the game.\nThe only downside is  the combat system, which encourages you to go for a simplistic one-hit kill approach. But most combats can be avoided, even grinding is possible without actual fighting: One \"dungeon attribute\" offers a chance to win an engagement automatically, another one allows you too flee otherwise. This way you'll get money and stats passively and without even having investested lots of attributes in the \"combat\" category.\nThe single rooms are full of details and keep you motivated. At the same time the game does not overstay its welcome. With a playtime of ~8 hours it gives you all the time to dive into the gameplay and the atmosphere before it gets tedious or shallow.\nFor free game not much you can do wrong here!","timestamp_created":1487886977,"timestamp_updated":1487886977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/rC+ttoCfYP3cg=="}
