    about_the_game: 'Come one, come all, to my great funland!''''. It was quite a
      night in the streets of London, you met up with Mark and Wally that day. That
      day is where you, Jack finally were going to work on the great but grand funland.
      Ah, wasn''t it exciting. Though, there was a thing that Mark offered you. There
      is a workshop they''ve worked on before they got the grand attraction park ready.
      He offered you to take a nice but cozy stay at there. Why wouldn''t you want
      to stay at a gigantic workshop that is all yours! Quite fancy, ain''t it? But
      if you think deeply about it, you might realize the terrible things that may
      happen. the terror of not being alone in the workshop. But who can think of
      that crazy idea? I can''t really think of bunch of machines from a funland trying
      to get some sort of a revenge on you. What a weird idea, haha! But of course,
      <strong>there is a chance that you may not be alone.</strong><br><br>Wally Hardmaker''s
      Funland: Home Trials is a free roam horror game. You explore the workshop as
      Jack, finding secrets and many dark things that may wait to be unfolded. There
      are four levels, and four chapters in total in this indie game. Each level has
      a task and some deadly machines you need to hide from. Each chapter has an intense
      boss fight and exploration around the underground. <br>On the ''''Level''''s
      part of the game, the mechanic mostly is doing tasks and hiding from the robots.<br>On
      the ''''Chapter''''s part of the game, the mechanic is mostly cinematic, free
      roam and fighting enemies. You also get to talk with real NPC''s in the chapters
      aswell.<br><br><br><br><br><br><strong>Credits</strong><br><br>Wally Hardmaker:
