    short_description: Play as a baby bird which has been rejected from its nest and
      will do its best to get back home. More than a classic 2D platformer, it's a
      story full of emotion with a unique artistic direction that is awaiting you.

    review: 'First off, really enjoy the gameplay. The game is beautiful and original
      in it''s look.


      That being said, you are prompted after about 20 minutes of gameplay that the
      full game will be available on Steam. I think they uploaded the demo as the
      actual game so I have to thumbs down until that gets fixed. It sucks because
      it''s actually a lot of fun to play.
