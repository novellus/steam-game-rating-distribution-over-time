There is next to zero randomness built into the game engine meaning the questions change but every commentary, every question pause, every element of the 'show' all the way to question 15 is on queue and replicated over and over again. It makes no attempt to mimic the tension that occurs in the TV show also offering little in the way of camera variations or banter from the host. Chasing the achievements, after about 5 games in, I wish I could hit the secret X button to activate the hidden 'sniper audience member' to put the host down so I could just get through the bloody questions in peace! .. no matter off with the speakers then.\n\nBesides these pretty big issues, there is no choices of host for different regions (Lock it in Eddie!), no different modes (hot seat etc), no online mode & The TV set (background) is pretty basic too and lacks any real detail which it needs. Questions in the Special Edition packs tend to group same questions randomly together somehow so you would get say 3-4 questions about iPhone games (?) before something else would be asked, or get 2-3 movies questions all on the same movie (some old crap movie too!). It wasn't happening all the time so maybe just bad luck but still ruins the experience. All the trivia questions are old too and there are no updates. Really isn't much else that is good to be said about this one other than some of the computer game questions .. some of those were fun I guess.\n\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/TrueBlueReviews#curation]If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow [u]True Blue Reviews[/u] for more recommendations![/url]","timestamp_created":1385454376,"timestamp_updated":1599123138,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":32,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.692224681377410889","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3dTKqfQCcvLNHQ=="}
