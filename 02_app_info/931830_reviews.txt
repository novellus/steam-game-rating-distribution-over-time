You can click the sun to stop all the music (the sun gets lower in the sky for each pedestal you activate making it easier to find), but when it's time to move on, try figuring out the order you turned the pedestals on, deconstructing the tune until you're back to the first sound you chose.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/xSeKBHrylc0","timestamp_created":1548806299,"timestamp_updated":1579567409,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539835214614868164","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49rzj4u8CdaXEuQE="}
