    review: 'I thought this game would be terrible because of the art style, but it''s
      one of the most fun games I''ve ever played. It''s like super smash bros combined
      with the old slime soccer games. The powers are really unique and its fun seeing
      how they interact with each other. If you get 2-4 people together to play this,
      it''s a blast.


      The other review mentions players clipping as a negative, but that''s intended
      so slime''s can pass through each other. Overall, if you loved the old slime
      games and have people to play with you should check this one out.'
