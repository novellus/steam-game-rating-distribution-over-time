Also, it is very short : it took me about 10 minutes to complete all of the 25 levels. Still, it was fine, I enjoyed playing it for its very short duration. Do not hesitate to give it a try.","timestamp_created":1603186059,"timestamp_updated":1603186059,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ477zVovUCe8+CqQI="}
