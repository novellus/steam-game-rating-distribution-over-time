    about_the_game: In this simple game you have to show all his skill, beating flying
      in your direction the ball, which has already managed to recapture the enemy.
      If you miss a shot and the ball flies into the goal-you will be counted a goal,
      and the enemy will get the advantage! So be vigilant and try to win. You can
      play in different modes-for points, for a while, or combine the two modes together.
      Also in the game you can adjust the difficulty from simple to difficult.<br><br><img

      to the hot South beach to relax and play a couple of wonderful friendly games
      in good old pong! Someone familiar with this game since childhood, and someone
      will play it for the first time, but it is sure to seem interesting and exciting!
      So do not waste your time, play soon and find out how long you can hold out
      one on one against a virtual opponent. The game develops attentiveness and reaction
      speed, and also will help to distract simply from daily Affairs and to relax
      a little. In different difficulty modes, you will be available to different
      actions. So, for example, on a simple difficulty you can move your block only
      vertically, and on a complex - throughout the field. But do not forget that
      the same can be done and the enemy! So be vigilant and have fun with the game.<br><br><img
