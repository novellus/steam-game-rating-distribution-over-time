    review: 'There''s a lot to like in The Perplexing Orb 2! You certainly roll an
      orb around an assortment of levels that generally increase in difficulty over
      time. It has some rough edges, but I''m happy with the time I spent with it.
      If you''re a prospective buyer, I might suggest throwing it on your wishlist
      and waiting for it to go on sale, as $10 for a ~2 hour game to 100% is a bit
      of a tough ask. Best of luck to TreeFall in their future endeavors!
