    review: The price of game is very high as compared to its quality , it should
      have stayed a mobile game , although the game is enjoyable but combat is very
      poor as compared to many third person fighting games. There are no effects,
      sound development is also not good. I wouldnot have discussed these points if
      game would be less than 1$. If you are fan of Turkish TV series Like Dirilis
      Ertugrul and Kurulus Osman then definitely play it but if you are looking for
      random 3rd person games then skip this.
