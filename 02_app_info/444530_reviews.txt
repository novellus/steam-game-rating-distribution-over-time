Solutions are generally interesting and well-integrated, but the number of variables to keep track of gets overwhelming later on. The spatial freedom of mirrors coupled with distant targets can make aiming beams a tad inconvenient. Perhaps a rotating pedestal with adjustable height that could be manipulated by push and pull would've been more comfortable than twisting your wrist around to line things up. While the game is made for the Vive, it does function with Quest Link. The game requires a large playspace to be playable. If this is a concern, using playspace mover would make the game more accessible. If you've got the VR area to make it work, Light Repair Team #4 might be worth experimenting with. After all, organizing objects in VR to accomplish some goal is an inherently gratifying task.","timestamp_created":1606867050,"timestamp_updated":1606867050,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4auvkPYCetPQtgI="}
