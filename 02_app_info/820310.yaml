    review: At first I was going to recommend this as a casual, relaxing walking simulator,
      but then I got to the platforming parts, and those are stupidly difficult to
      get across. Also,there is one level that only contains 4 chests, not 5, which
      means players could stay in that area looking for the final chest indefinitely
      without ever finding it. And there's no indication of where the levels end,
      so you can and will accidentally exit levels while still searching for the remaining
      chests, and you'll either have the reload a previous save to return to that
      area or just proceed with that level being incomplete. So this has turned out
      to NOT be a relaxing walking simulator, but a sloppy, frustrating piece of garbage.
      The further you get, the more tedious it becomes, and there's really just nothing
      fun or enjoyable about it.
