      /> No intro. No title. No bullshit. From the very beginning of the game, explore
      the entire world in any direction you choose. Even the final boss can be challenged
      from the very beginning of the game. This is a truly open world experience.
      Rather than force you through long introductions, expository dialogue, and pointless
      cutscenes, Nother puts YOUR story first. Who knows where you''ll end up? The
      path you take in Nother hasn''t been written until you play it yourself.<br><br><img

      /> Over 100 secrets packed into the game''s world. The most unique and interesting
      loot will also be the rarest to find. In Nother, you forge your own story through
      the discoveries you make in the world. To become stronger, will you defeat a
      powerful foe or solve the mysteries of the dangerous ruins?<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/545720/extras/athersdf.png?t=1487992743"
      /> Brutally difficult but fair combat. Nother''s AI may have varying attack
      patterns, habits, flaws, and perfections, but there is one thing they all have
      in common: they will kill you many, many times. Prepare your behind.<br><br><img

      /> The combat in Nother is deceptively deep. With secrets hidden between other
      secrets, the attacks you''ll be able to perform will differ from other players
      not because of what abilities you gained or purchased, but simply because you
      discovered them yourself. Like the open world, you can use the most devastating
      combat techniques immediately from the beginning- if you know how, that is.<br><br><img

      /> The beautiful soundtrack featured in Nother is hand-written for the game.
      Between the open silence of a forest and the horrific bass of an approaching
      boss, this game''s music received top priority and will twist your emotions
      in every direction.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/545720/extras/athersdf.png?t=1487992743"
      /> Everything in Nother was developed entirely by one person. This is my second
      hard core RPG on Steam, and you can bet it''s going to be an adventure you''ll
      remember.'

    review: "Well played it for a little bit and so far so good. An old game but i\
      \ do believe it deserves a chance.\nI may update this as i play more but my\
      \ first impressions are as such:\n\nQuick version; A charming art style and\
      \ a decent attempt at converting souls like combat to 2D. \nCombat seems relatively\
      \ straight forward and while you may die quickly re-spawning and trying again\
      \ is very quick\nProgression is simple and while grinding is easily available\
      \ i have yet to find it necessary.\nRolling seems relatively useless against\
      \ regular enemies due to unclear wind-up animations.\nSome minor bugs with movement\
      \ making me get stuck on certain tiles (quite annoying in combat)\nOver all\
      \ a fun and interesting game for anyone with a souls itch, though with a few\
      \ small problems and minor bugs. \n\nA charming game which imitates the souls\
      \ styles quite nicely if not flawlessly. \nTo start with as advertised there\
      \ is little in way of tutorial and it allows you to get right into the game\
      \ so you can explore. Whether or not you think this is a positive or negative\
      \ is up to you but i found that with relatively little to learn, as the systems\
      \ are fairly basic, that this was not an issue.\nSpeaking of getting straight\
      \ into it, re spawning is actually rather quick. I was quite grateful for this\
      \ as i found myself dying quite frequently to begin with.\n\nThe game however\
      \ is not without fault. There are certain minor bugs, such as getting stuck\
      \ on some tiles or entrances not working that can be slightly annoying  but\
      \ nothing major so far. \nThe audio can be a bit buggy when switching between\
      \ areas and is quite a suddenly cut off, simply annoying but not much more to\
      \ it. \nThe game seems rather small, which is to be expected but with about\
      \ 5 bosses and an estimated ( my own estimation) completion time of about 6\
      \ hours you can decide if it is worth it.\n\nThe bosses are simple and fun and\
      \ as i said before decently telegraph their attacks. \n\nOverall 6.5/10 not\
      \ bad at all but far from perfect. For anyone with a souls itch this may scratch\
      \ it for a short time."
