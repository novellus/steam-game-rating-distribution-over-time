Do you wish they had more pop and really had that shine to them? If you answered yes to ether of those questions then this is the downloadable content for you. With this downloadable content you can convert your plain boring cards to fantastic looking cards that you wont be embarrassed to put down on the table. They will bring you confidence when playing and give you the courage to play those rare cards with style. This DLC converts all uncommon, rare, and mythic rare cards in the decks to premium foil cards which you can admire and look at and not get ashamed while looking at them. The great thing about this deck conversion taking place is that it converts the appearance of those dull cards and turns them into premium cards that shine like stars. The downfall to this DLC is that it gives no advantage at all to the gameplay but just the look of the cards that you are holding. Start shining for your enemies today!","timestamp_created":1333876490,"timestamp_updated":1333876490,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480769246816635132","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8f/OyLYCdsuxCg=="}
