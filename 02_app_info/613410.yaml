    review: "***This is the first and (possibly the only) negative review I posted\
      \ on steam, most of time I don't bother posting negative reviews, but this time\
      \ I felt like I have social responsibilities to let people know what they will\
      \ run into buying this game.***\n\n\n\n\nThis is a cheap mobile game diectly\
      \ ported to pc.\n\nThe UI of this game is clearly specifically designed for\
      \ mobiles (touch devices), and there is differences/experience/expectations\
      \ between mobile and desktop. Take, for example, the character\u2019s skills\
      \ are shown in round button (I literally want to touch my monitor to cast the\
      \ spell), but instead you figure out you should press 3, 4, 5, 6 on your keyboard.\
      \ Same thing goes to the menu and all the sub menu.\n\nThe graphics, judging\
      \ from a PC game point of view, looks weird to me in a way that even though\
      \ the surroundings, characters, and enemies are all in one screen, there isn\u2019\
      t many interactions between them, and it gives me the feeling of stiffing when\
      \ it comes to the combat system. It is further penalized by the poor/low frame\
      \ drawing; the animation is not smooth.\n\nI do want to say that I only played\
      \ this game for only 10 mins in scenario mode, however it should give me a rough\
      \ idea what I am getting into. I will probably consider playing on an ipad but\
      \ definitely not on a pc."
