Expert is a bit unjustified in my opinion, 1000 Notes on a 3 minute song in this pack is a bit too much. I'm not one to judge but have fun and enjoy the pack.","timestamp_created":1606362178,"timestamp_updated":1606362178,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517985641956329346","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnbSpgfYCcqbIsQI="}
