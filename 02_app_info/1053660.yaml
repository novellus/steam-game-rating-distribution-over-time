    review: 'Absolutely hilarious! Mostly due to being able to start a brawl at a
      funeral, absolute madness! For the price it''s definitely worth it for a laugh!


      I played this game on the latest episode of my ''Random Funny Games'' series
      on my YouTube Channel! Check it out to see how I found it!
