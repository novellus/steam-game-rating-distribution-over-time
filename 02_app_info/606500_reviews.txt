It an early access game, ready to be abandonware right after its release.\n\nYes it had a lot of potential, unlike its developers. Buy it on sale for maybe 5 euros maximum, and even then, I wouldn't recommend it, not because it does not deserve it in its current state, but you will be paying developers for a game that promised, and never delivered.","timestamp_created":1609896337,"timestamp_updated":1609896337,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504504501819610596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ45pPT6vYCfOrvwAI="}
