I enjoyed playing each and every mission because none of them gave me the feeling that i can't wait for it to be over so i can move on to the next. I really liked the idea behind the Story and the voice actors were amazing at helping telling it (almost gave me goosebumps). I found a few minor glitches here and there but none of them broke the immersion that his game manages to pull the player into. I recommend this game to anyone that is a simulation / Sci-Fi / strategy fan.","timestamp_created":1591279392,"timestamp_updated":1591279392,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0JLpv/ICeaiPjAI="}
