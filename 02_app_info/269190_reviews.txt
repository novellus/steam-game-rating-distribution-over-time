Had it on wishlist for a very long time. It starts interesting enough, but as soon as the starter area is done it becomes blatantly obvious how boring it really is. \n\nFights provide no challenge whatsoever while being pretty much the biggest part of the game. It feels like an MMORPG without player interactions. Do the usualy uninspired fetch quests, fight some random mobs and ride your cat mount wich finds burried stuff every 2 steps and it's mostly a worm you'll then have to fight and kill with 1 hit. \n\nAnimations are amateurish, camera in combat is horrible. So far the story wasn't interesting enough to get me to play more. and I'm surely not going back to do fetch quests I can do in any free to play MMORPG. \n\nGear is pretty much JRPG or free to play MMORPG aswell. Use crystals you randomly find for skills and stat boosts, dropped gear is randomized. You can somehow upgrade crystals but i couldn't figure out how that's supposed to work with a 0% chance of upgrading. \n\nMuch RNG, little game.\n\nSadly i went far above the refund threshold, but i wanted to give the game a fair shot. It's a no for me.","timestamp_created":1609873462,"timestamp_updated":1609873569,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4zqb86fYCevnkwAI="}
