    review: "Aie aie aie. Ce jeu aurait pu \xEAtre vraiment sympathique. Mais son\
      \ r\xE9sultat est \xE0 la limite du vendable.\nJe ne sais pas ce qui s'est pass\xE9\
      , manque de moyen, opportunit\xE9 de ce faire un billet sur une licence? Le\
      \ jeu est cheap \xE0 se demander si ce n'est pas un gars tout seul qui l'a d\xE9\
      velopp\xE9 pour le fun.\n1er point, la musique... c'est la musique d'ambiance\
      \ de BB qui tourne tout le temps.\n2eme point, l'ambiance... y a rien et pire\
      \ quand on marque un TD, c'est silence et camera qui tourne autour du joueur.\
      \ La 1ere fois \xE7a m'a cass\xE9 dans mon d\xE9lire, une sensation d'inutilit\xE9\
      \ dans cette victoire\n3eme point, les bugs... alors BB a des bugs, on le sait,\
      \ et ici c'est pareil mais sur un jeu aussi petit qui reprendre les bases de\

      4eme le online... si c'est pour jouer avec des amis c'est possible. Sinon j'ai\
      \ r\xE9ussi qu'\xE0 faire 1 match et encore le gars \xE0 d\xE9co. Et comme l'IA\
      \ n'est pas des plus efficaces, autant dire que vous ne pourrez pas vous y amuser.\n\
      \nC'est pour moi un \xE9chec pour faute de budget ou de motivation? BB legendary\
