There are a few characters to play,  with different intros and styles. There are also upgrades to purchase. \n\nThe gist of the game revolves around trying to kill 100 enemies on each lvl in the shortest amount of time. At first you are just trying to stay alive but once you master one of the mechanics of properly killing them it really becomes a frantic score run.  Kinda reminds me of The Club. Not the driving game but the murder score one. \n\nThat being said once you figure things out you will quickly blast through all the content.\n\nUnfortunately like many vr games it's going to rot in EA purgatory for all time, so buyer beware. \n\n","timestamp_created":1564229836,"timestamp_updated":1564229836,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541641712188720703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwzqPXmewCevObzwE="}
