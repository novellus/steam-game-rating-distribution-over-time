    review: Yes, it's interesting, but also exasperating in many ways.  Bunch of woo-woo
      puzzles based on mystic concepts like I-ching trigrams, but no logic to them
      whatsoever.  Somehow the mysticism of the puzzles relates to the deeds of the
      four fictional-real serial murderers whose lives and careers this game tries
      to connect in a fictional plot.  Premise possibly of interest, but what the
      actual puzzles and clunky execution of same have to do with the premise is hardly
      convincing.  Some puzzles were relatively straightforward, others like the I-ching
      trigrams were totally arbitrary as far as this player could tell.  I would recommend
      with reservations.
