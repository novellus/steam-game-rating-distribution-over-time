But becomes very rewarding once you've learnt how to aim your shots to the targets. A very convincing Woodpecker simulator! Hat Trick Header is both fun and frustrating of equal measure.","timestamp_created":1487121346,"timestamp_updated":1542269104,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+N2Zi+cCeaWXcg=="}
