(tested on Nacon PS4 Controller and Logitech G920)\nIt would be great if you could actually import your own cars (something like zipped archives with the obj file, the sound and an xml file with the car's characteristics) or maps.\nIf you aren't afraid of some minor bugs and like to just drive around, this game is for you.\n(I as a german would need support for more languages btw)\nSummary:\nGraphics\n7/10                    (well, it has been made by one person, so don't expect anything revolutionary, but it does the job)\nGameplay / Atmosphere\n10/10                  (sense of speed is amazing!)\nPhysics\n9/10                    (arcade but your car will spin if you turn too much, brakes are also realistic)\nMap\n10/10                  (it is huge and has a big variety of landscapes)\nCars\n9/10                    (very detailed, nice sounds and characteristics AND IT HAS A SMART)\nSound\n10/10                  (better than Forza Horizon 4, that's for sure)\nInterface / HUD\n10/10                  (each car has its own gauge for speed, rev etc, menus are not too overloaded and very clear)\nPrice\n10/10                  (for a price of 2:39 you have more features than Forza Horizon 4)\n\n-_-Conclusion-_-\n- 10/10 would support again :)","timestamp_created":1609790621,"timestamp_updated":1609790621,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ41PC/5/YCcY6/wAI="}
