    review: "O jogo est\xE1 incompleto. Fa\xE7o bacharel em educa\xE7\xE3o f\xEDsica,\
      \ e pretendo fazer meu mestrado em ci\xEAncias do movimento humano. Baixei a\
      \ vers\xE3o de testes, e notei que este software possu\xEDa as os movimentos\
      \ e a\xE7\xF5es do corpo humano (sendo poss\xEDvel visualizar apenas atrav\xE9\
      s do sistema esquel\xE9tico na demo). Assim que comprei e baixei a vers\xE3\
      o paga, me senti enganado. Como na vers\xE3o demo, apenas as a\xE7\xF5es vistas\
      \ a partir do sistema esquel\xE9tico est\xE3o dispon\xEDveis. Al\xE9m disso,\
      \ as estruturas s\xE3o extremamente simples, e algumas anatomicamente incorretas.\
      \ N\xE3o recomendo de forma alguma, existem softwares de visualiza\xE7\xE3o\
      \ anat\xF4mica gratuitos que s\xE3o melhores que este.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
      \nThe game is incomplete. I have a bachelor's degree in physical education,\
      \ and I intend to do my master's degree in human movement sciences. I downloaded\
      \ the trial version, and noticed that this software had the movements and actions\
      \ of the human body (being possible to view only through the skeletal system\
      \ in the demo). As soon as I bought and downloaded the paid version, I felt\
      \ cheated. As in the demo version, only the actions seen from the skeletal system\
      \ are available. In addition, the structures are extremely simple, and some\
      \ are anatomically incorrect. I do not recommend it in any way, there are free\
      \ anatomical visualization software that are better than this one."
