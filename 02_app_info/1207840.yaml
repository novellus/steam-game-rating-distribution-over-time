    review: "Questo gioco \xE8 fantastico, l'ho cominciato a giocare per verificarne\
      \ le effettive potenzialit\xE0 e devo fare i miei complimenti agli sviluppatori.\n\
      Sia la grafica che il gameplay sono velocissimi, il gioco non \xE8 semplice\
      \ e mette alla prova i riflessi, ma d\xE0 anche molte soddisfazioni.\nComunque\
      \ anche se la difficolt\xE0 \xE8 tarata sull'hard core comunque non diventa\
      \ mai frustrante, l'unico appunto che ho \xE8 solo per il movimento della navicella\
      \ che mi sembra troppo veloce , ma \xE8 un mio punto di vista e forse \xE8 stato\
      \ fatto per poter evitare meglio i nemici.\nLa grafica \xE8 un piccolo gioiello\
      \ tra pixelart e video renderizzati, molto gradevole all'occhio.\nConsiglio\
      \ questo gioco a tutti gli amanti degli arcade che vogliono mettersi alla prova.\n\
      Io continuer\xF2 a giocarci per migliorarmi, consigliatissimo!!!"
