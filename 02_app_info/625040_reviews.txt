There's a timed mode if you want to challenge yourself, but even that won't add but maybe another half hour to your playtime.  None of the Steam achievements work properly, so you won't even have those to show off for your time spent.  And the controls are just frustrating enough (for the price) to make you consider refunding.\n\nIt's a nice little game with a good aesthetic, but way overpriced.  Pick it up on a sale at %50 off or more if you're curious.","timestamp_created":1516573562,"timestamp_updated":1516573562,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546612322330474854","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyYK1jeECfI/ilgE="}
