    review: 'The story is just a couple short lines per island, but the visuals are
      very nice and the actual Nonagrams puzzles are well-designed.


      This game does instantly let you know if you make a mistake and corrects it.
      This honestly drives me nuts, especially because the game gives you a little
      star rating if you make no mistakes. This is weirdly common in so many digital
      puzzle games and I don''t like it.


      However, if you are wiling to play carefully the multi-color nonograms are designed
      well and you often have to switch colors to figure out some portion of the puzzle,
      then switch back. The puzzles are honestly well done. There is also a fairly
      forgiving hint system if you get stuck or find the puzzles too difficult. The
      game is honestly quite relaxing, and I enjoy it very much, even though I wish
      it didn''t punish misclicks so heavily.'
