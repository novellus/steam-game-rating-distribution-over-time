      \ Developer Her Interactive sets that bar high in its series of Nancy Drew games.\
      \ The latest, Nancy Drew: The Deadly Device, is the 27th installment in this\
      \ award-winning series of games playable on computers. And this time detective\
      \ Nancy Drew uses science to help her to solve a mysterious death\u2026 The\

      \ THE DEADLY DEVICE is a fantastic adventure game with interesting characters\
      \ and an intriguing mystery to solve. Kids can learn a great deal about electricity,\
      \ and in particular the life and work of Nikola Tesla. The storyline also raises\
      \ thought-provoking issues about scientific research, such as the potentially\
      \ disastrous consequences of certain discoveries falling into the \u201Cwrong\u201D\
      \ hands. With two difficulty levels to choose from, The Deadly Device will appeal\
      \ to amateur sleuths young and old \u2014 including parents. This is a great\
      \ game for daughters to play with a mom or grandmother.\u201D<br><a href=\"\

      \ switch between night and day in an innovative way, explore a cool looking\
      \ high tech laboratory, read up on Tesla and electronics, play with interesting\
      \ equipment, try out new mini-games in your cell phone, call the Hardy Boys\
      \ and Deirdre for advice, recover yourself with Second Chances, and solve challenging\
      \ puzzles.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://buzz.gameswarp.com/game-review/nancy-drew-the-deadly-device/\"\
