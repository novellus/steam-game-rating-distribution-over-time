The ball wizzes by in a comical fashion like it was programmed with one line of code.\n\nCatcher mode did work.  As soon as I pressed the trigger the mitt disappeared.\n\nUmpire mode feels like it was tacked on at the last minute.  There's a Cube with the default Unity font shows if you called it correctly.\nNo sfx.  One line of code type of stuff.  \n\n","timestamp_created":1568127760,"timestamp_updated":1568127760,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6Nbsje0CfdT/0QE="}
