    review: To people expecting a similar amount of enemies to the Monster Legacy
      DLC from VX Ace, this is going to be a huge disappointment. There are only 8
      bosses, and though there are way more details for them to use along with plugins,
      it's still lacking too much compared to Monster Legacy.
