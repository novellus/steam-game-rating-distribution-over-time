[b]Atomic Girls[/b] is a basic memory game; this title is no different than the other memory games produced by IR Studio. There are forty puzzles to solve, with difficulties ranging between sixteen and twenty-four cards. Each completed puzzle unlocks another CG (which can be viewed from the gallery).\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThere is no story (and I'm not making one up!)\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe titlescreen is stylish, but the menu seems somewhat out of place. From \"Setting\", you may adjust audio and display preferences. From \"Book\", unlocked CGs can be viewed (with the user-interface hidden). Like IR Studio previous memories, the in-game visuals are plain and the animations are annoying.  \n\n[b]- The Goods -[/b]\nThere are ten base images to see, with three variants for each depecting undress. The artwork is [b]beautiful,[/b] and the enjoyed the painterly, rough style of the coloring. It's a shame there is no sexual content (but there's lots of lingerie and bare boobs!)\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nI do recommend this game. The artwork is wonderful, and the gameplay is what you'd expect. [b]Atomic Girls[/b] is shovelware, but it's [i]competent[/i] shovelware. Whether you're on the market for casual, memory gameplay or buxom women, IR Studio continues to deliver with inexpensive titles. \n\n[table][tr][td][url=https://wombattrap.com/review/atomic-girls/]To read the full length review, click here![/url][/td][/tr][/table]\n\n[h1]Support the Wombat[/h1]\n[b]<3[/b] Follow the [b]Wombat Trap Curator[/b] page for more reviews!
