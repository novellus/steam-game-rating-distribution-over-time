    review: "[h1] Once you've watched the trailer and looked at the screenshots, you've\
      \ basically seen all there is to see in Lost Circus VR (so far). [/h1]\n\nThis\
      \ VR experience only lasts about 1-2 minutes long in total, and there is very\
      \ little to engage with. For the most part, you're just looking at your surroundings\
      \ and watching all the so-called \"hyper realistic\" animation while you're\
      \ standing still in a barrel as a clown pushes you through the circus tent on\
      \ a cart. \n\nThe only three notable gameplay features consist of shooting at\
      \ moving targets with cork revolvers, killing black widow spiders with strongman\
      \ mallets, and holding up a flaming hoop for a tiger to jump through. After\
      \ that, there's a fart joke where the clown breaks wind as a cannon fires confetti,\
      \ and then he fans the smell around like a total jackass. Then the experience\
      \ wraps up with a dreadful motion-sickness-inducing sequence that consists of\
      \ the clown growing into a giant, picking up the barrel while you're still in\
      \ it, swinging you around while laughing, and then finally [b] swallowing you\
      \ whole. [/b]\n\n(For the record, I'm not saying that this conclusion made me\
      \ feel motion sick in particular; I'm saying that this could honestly make anybody\
      \ feel motion sick, what with all the dangling movement from being swung around\
      \ in the air. Even iron-stomached VR veterans would find this sequence slightly\
      \ disorienting.)\n\nDon't buy Lost Circus VR unless you plan to refund it once\
      \ you finish, or are patient enough to wait for further development updates,\
      \ because there's barely any content or replay value to it at the moment. Sure,\
      \ it has a retail price of only $5, but you can get a lot more fun out of other\
      \ cheap games like Among Us or even Five Nights at Freddy's for just $5. Or\
      \ if that isn't a fair comparison to this VR title, there are plenty of games\
      \ like The Lab, Rec Room, and VRChat that are available to download for free\
      \ and have more content to enjoy.\n\nI certainly anticipate continual production\
      \ on this game beyond the prologue, because right now I can't recommend buying\
      \ this after [strike] playing [/strike] standing around in its current early\
      \ access stage."
