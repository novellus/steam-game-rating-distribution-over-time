'z' and 'c' are the designated keys, but even those don't do anything when it comes to toggling audio or full screen, only arrows work there. mouse does too, but who plays tetris with a mouse?\n\nso the game still has a long way to go, and it's just not an enjoyable experience to begin with. all you can do is go for a full set horizontally, all 13 cards of the same suit next to each other, and even that's limited, as described above. some [b]alternate, customizable game modes would be nice[/b], like matching 3 or 5 of the same suit, color or number. [b]I like tetris and love solitaire, but this paricular combination still isn't up to scratch.[/b]","timestamp_created":1607222904,"timestamp_updated":1607821894,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.615110099315643311","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1607268462,"developer_response":"Thanks for your review. As I said on the other game: besides it being a $1 game, I am always updating all of them, making it more rich (you can see by yourself browsing all of my games). \n\nI follow the MVP development philosophy in which you publish the minimum version of the product and then get back to it every week to improve it according to the feedback and the market, instead of working 2 years on a project that in the end does not make more sense (as I did on my first game). The way I found to tell this for the customers is by the $1 price (you cant' expect AAA with that value).\n\nI will of course address those issues (I would anyway, I have a Trello board for all of the games with the next updates). My goal is to update all of them until they reach a console game quality so I can publish there (but I do it all alone, after working 12 hours on my day job, still not getting any penny from the games, so it may take a while). And there's no point in doing it as Early Access for $1 games.\n\nAs a game developer I just want to make people have fun. This kind of review makes me sad as it does not take nothing of that on account. And as if I don't care for the customers (I am not a villain). Please understand the context, it is important (even more from you that saw my effort on the other game). You don't need to lie to make the developer happy, far from that, you have to be honest, but words like \"lazy\" are really unfair to my hard work. People will only see your review and nothing else, ignoring the context too (then I basically lost 1 month of night work and the Steam fee).\n\nPS: You can play using the keyboard just like Cut Smash Wrap. They have the same controls (I have used it as the code base). Tutorial and settings comes on the next update, just like the other games (probably next week). Then, more animations, some kind of in-game store and so on. Updates for life."}],"cursor":"AoJwl+TprPYCdN/TtwI="}
