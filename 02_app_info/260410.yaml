    about_the_game: "First contact didn't go as planned, when aliens woke Murray Mendelson\
      \ up from his afternoon nap. Pulling the trigger first has drawn Murray in to\
      \ full scale war with these alien visitors, and they\u2019ll stop at nothing\
      \ to destroy him. Armed with his musket and inconsolable rage, Murray must defend\
      \ his home against all odds. Why are the aliens only attacking this one house?\
      \ Who knows?! Shoot first and ask questions later in this endless fast paced\
      \ arcade shooter, and keep those pesky aliens off of Murray's perfectly manicured\
      \ lawn!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCollect valuable alien orbs to upgrade your weaponry.\
      \ Use \u2018Cane Time\u2019, \u2018Infuriate\u2019, and \u2018Soundwave\u2019\
      \ power-ups to gain the upper hand when all seems lost. The longer Murray holds\
      \ the lawn, the stronger those aliens get. But there is plenty of firepower\
      \ waiting for you to try out in The Shed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, lock and load\u2026\
      and Get Off My Lawn!"
