It was a Greenlight project by one guy. You start with a tutorial of the controls. If you are using a keyboard you won’t know what the buttons are unless you look at the load window beforehand. Luckily, I went in blind and guessed them all because I have no life. You have a basic combo and 4 strong combos that also fill a “overdrive” meter that increases your attack power. You can dash, parry that stuns, and have an energy combo for breaking shields. That’s it. The controls seem clunky at first, but soon you can pick it up and get your hands in the rhythm. \n\nThere are 6 levels, 2 of which are solely boss fights. Why he didn’t add in a third to make it balanced, I’m not sure but the game is hard enough without a extra boss. The environments are a little dull but nice to look at it. There are about 6 enemy types with their own way of disposing of them. You can try other ways but I assure you that you will die and your options are limited anyway. The story you get at the beginning is an evil robot invaded a space station and he wants to do some bad stuff to some colonies. You have no name, and as far as I can decipher, you’re a robot whose helmet never got painted and you have no visor or eyes to speak of so I’m not sure how you can see. But that’s ok! It all seems so simple right? \n\nConsider this game to be... a test of endurance and dexterity and it suddenly becomes more fun. It is challenging in the sense that it expects you to memorize enemy movements to the T. Because if you don’t, you will be punished. Enemies will give you little time to breath, and on the hard difficulty you will be kiting and using run and go tactics a lot. There are health and 1up drops and that’s all. A simple formula that almost antagonizes you mentally when you run out of lives and get a game over because of its simplicity. So, you get good. So good that the tougher fights have blood rushing to places you didn’t know exist in your body and your fingers become so tense you think you have frost bite. \n\nI 100% completed this game in four hours, but man it felt like a life time. When I finished it, I literally had a genuine sense of accomplishment because I overcame something legitimately difficult. For 6.99 you get about 4 hours if you to have no life, or a lot of time on your hands. Personally, I bought this discounted for a dollar and would recommend picking it up at that price.","timestamp_created":1595366146,"timestamp_updated":1595366146,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/e/OufMCduDjlgI="}
