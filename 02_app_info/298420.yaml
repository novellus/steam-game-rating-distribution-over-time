    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Experience the\_mesmerizing world of Dreii,\
      \ the award-winning collaborative physics conundrum.\_</h2><br>Dreii is a puzzling\
      \ game about skill, logic and friendship. It subtly connects players in real-time\
      \ across the world, to help one another in a battle against gravity.<br><br><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Build a Tower.</strong> The mission is simple.\
      \ But once again, things get in the way... Explosives, thunderstorms, completely\
      \ incompetent colleagues. Oh, and have you heard of this thing called gravity?<br><br></li><li><strong>Play\
      \ with your friends.</strong> Dreii automatically connects all screens across\
      \ all platforms. This means you can even play with your friends who have Dreii\
      \ on their mobiles.<br><br></li><li><strong>Speak in 19 Languages.</strong>\
      \ Dreii features an universal communication tool which allows players to speak\
      \ to others, wherever they are in the world.<br><br></li><li><strong>Let's Dance!</strong>\
      \ One of the best thing about Dreii is how it sounds. Each player has its very\
      \ own instrument. Avatars work together to form Dreii's unique universal orchestra,\
      \ creating a unique musical landscape, inspired by archaic instruments and ancient\
      \ melodies.<br><br></li><li><strong>Uber Swiss Design.</strong>\_Dreii is designed\
      \ to be as universal as possible. However, in a strange way it's also very Swiss,\
      \ where it was made. Clean typography, minimalism with attention to detail.\
      \ Maybe that is why it has won the European Design Award.</li></ul>"
