    about_the_game: "Disney's Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon is a 3D RTS game\
      \ focusing on space combat. In the main campaign's story-driven missions, you\
      \ begin play as Jim Hawkins, a cadet in the Royal Navy's fight against pirates\
      \ and the deadly Procyon Fleet, with an eye toward eventual promotion to fleet\
      \ commander. Skirmish and multiplayer modes allow the choice of playing as all\
      \ three factions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSuccessfully completed missions result\
      \ in ship and fleet enhancements, more experienced crews, and upgraded weapons.\
      \ Royal Navy Fleet weapons are only slightly inferior to the reworked weapons\
      \ of the Procyon Fleet but are sturdier and less vulnerable. Ships for the Royal\
      \ Navy range from torpedo boats and war sloops to escorts, frigates, and the\
      \ impressive StarHammer, while pirates man sloops, gunboats, schooners, assault\
      \ cutters, and more, including several unique designs like the carrack and barque.\
      \ The Procyon Fleet is built for speed and maneuverability, geared for fast\
      \ hit-and-run attacks, and as the game progresses, news of a mysterious Ironclad\
      \ Fleet surfaces as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShip designs in Battle at Procyon\
      \ are fashioned after the seafaring ships from the golden age of sail, with\
      \ solar winds filling the sails and rigging. Arsenals reflect futuristic models\
      \ of light, medium, and heavy weapons such as laserball and plasma cannons,\
      \ beam weapons, Gatling guns, harpoons, fire and net launchers, gravity waves,\
      \ torpedoes, mortars, and more. Other features include multiple waypoint settings,\
      \ star maps, panic fire, secondary ship control, docking, repairing, towing,\
      \ grappling, and boarding actions."
