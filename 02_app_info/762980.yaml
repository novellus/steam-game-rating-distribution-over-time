      \ /><br>Chaotic Void is a wacky local couch brawler game set in zero gravity\
      \ space with unique physics gameplay, a multitude of crazy weapons, coldly inhospitable\
      \ environments, and feisty space-themed characters. It\u2019s brutal. It\u2019\
      s fun. It\u2019s chaotic!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/762980/extras/Local_Player_Brawler_2018.png?t=1589831839\"\
      \ /><br>Chaotic Void was designed with one goal in mind: to be one of the best\
      \ 4-player local party games out there! Currently supports up to three different\
      \ mode types, Free for All, Teams, and Survival!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/762980/extras/Unique_Physics_Gameplay_2018.png?t=1589831839\"\
      \ /><br>The physics-driven gameplay of Chaotic Void is what sets it apart and\
      \ makes for an incredibly addictive local brawler experience! Dual-wielding\
      \ weapons, grabbing your friends, pulling switches, pressing buttons, and allowing\
      \ your characters to interact with the environment all help make Chaotic Void\
      \ a great physics-based sandbox game.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/762980/extras/Tons_of_Unique_Weapons_2018.png?t=1589831839\"\
      \ /><br>Chaotic Void has a ton of unique weapons, including pistols, shotguns,\
      \ rifles, rocket launchers, laser guns, mini guns, C4, pipe bombs, and much,\
      \ much more! Every weapon is also entirely physics-driven, from the recoil and\
      \ rate of fire, to the projectile types. Weapons also have many different combinations,\
      \ such as clips, barrel attachments, silencers, and more!<br><br><img src=\"\
      https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/762980/extras/Hazardous_Environments_2018.png?t=1589831839\"\
      \ /><br>The hazardous environments featured in Chaotic Void are what make each\
      \ round so intense! Want to get rid of an annoying opponent? Drag them into\
      \ a set of saw blades hidden in a wall, pull a switch that sucks them out into\
      \ the void of space, or simply watch the AI completely and utterly destroy your\
      \ opponent by any means necessary!"
