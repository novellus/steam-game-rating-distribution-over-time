Playtime was about 2 1/2 hours without a guide.  The story is a scifi fantasy mystery where you play as Professor Meme after landing at the base on Zerulia.  Your friend Professor Gustav is missing and it becomes your job to find him and discover the mysteries of the strange creatures, the Seazogs.  The game is not without it's faults, and some puzzles are not as intuitive as I'd have liked.  There were two sections where I became stuck for a while.  For the first one, thankfully the base is fairly small so I was ultimately able to exhaust options to stumble on the answer.  The second however was thankfully not a game breaking bug, but was a softlock where I was unable to ride an elevator back up in a room.  I was able to quit to menu and when I continued, I was back in the starting room with all my inventory, so I was able to progress and ultimately finish the game.  I am considering typing up a guide so more people can ultimately finish the game, I feel that because there are times it is not clear on what to do, some people may be discouraged and not want to continue the game.  I hit that point previously, when I had originally purchased the game and gave up for a while. Only today I came back to try again and was able to complete it in one sitting, but I was also determined to see the end.  Again, I feel it was a neat game and very affordable for the short experience it provides, but it has faults and can be hard to know where to go next.","timestamp_created":1609824627,"timestamp_updated":1609824627,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k83B6PYCd43OwAI="}
