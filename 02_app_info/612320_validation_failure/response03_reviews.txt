You either have to spend a 200,000 GS($500) to upgrade it or put hundreds of hours to grind it for it to be even remotley useful. I was expecting a maxed out ship, like all other premuims.\n\nEDIT: \nMy support request this time:\nIn the 3 or so years this game has been alive, not once has a craftable ship been called a DLC. None of the destroyers, secret project ships, or alien ships have been sold as dlc until now. \n\nWhen a player purchases DLC they have come to expect a certain quality to the ship they purchased. I feel scammed by this fake DLC. At the very least all modules should be unlocked and a set MK1 come with the ship like all other premiums when paying for the ship.\n\nI tried to make the best of a bad situation and by another $40 in gold to max out this ship. I have spent many hours trying to complete the missions as well and still only at rank 7. \n\nThis is my second request regarding this, because the other one was closed without a proper resolution. I feel a proper resolution would be to unlock all modules and credit me back the GS I spent out the $40 of gold I have spent. After all, the GS cost you no money since it just zeros and ones.\n\nI have spent nearly $3000 with your company, I feel it is only fair to ask for special considerations at this point. Its people like me who keep your company going.  \n\nI felt this was worth being pasted into my reveiw. Thanks Niripas for reminding me to try again, I am sure the result will be the same though. :(","timestamp_created":1491931241,"timestamp_updated":1493145751,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":39,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.705617904663085938","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43YGb09sCfOTIdg=="}
