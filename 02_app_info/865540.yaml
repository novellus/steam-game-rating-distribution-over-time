    review: I love it. The goal for 2021 for me is to do 365 days in a row  :) You'll
      feel so much better about your life if you do this everyday. I recommend at
      least 20 minute sessions. You'll just start to "get into it" at 10 minutes and
      settle down. At 20 minutes, you're a whole different person when you open your
      eyes.
