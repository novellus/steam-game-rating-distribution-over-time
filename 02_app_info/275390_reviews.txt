The combat was often a frantic spamfest.  Switching between realms was terrible because player 1 will flip the whole screen while other players will only change their character model, and if both types are happening it creates a lot of confusion.  \n\nDespite great art and characters, the gameplay just didn't end up being that fun.  It's hard to pin down exactly why, but I think the maps just didn't feel that interesting to platform.","timestamp_created":1609903186,"timestamp_updated":1609903186,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhaTt6vYCf8DywAI="}
