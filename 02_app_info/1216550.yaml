    review: "Es ist ein Manager, den man schnell spielen kann. Man findet sich schnell\
      \ zurecht, dank \xFCbersichtlicher Men\xFCs. Besonders gut gef\xE4llt mir aber\
      \ die N\xE4he des Entwicklers zu den Nutzern. So ist er jederzeit bereit, sich\
      \ Vorschl\xE4ge zur Verbesserung anzuh\xF6ren und setzt diese auch um. Habe\
      \ ich so noch nicht erlebt. Die Spieltiefe des Managers ist enorm und es kommt\
      \ sehr rasch das \"Nut-noch-eine-Saison-Gef\xFChl\" auf. Hoher Suchtfaktor.\
      \ Zudem ist der Preis mehr als erschwinglich, vor allem im Vergleich zu den\
      \ kommerziell-gro\xDFen Titeln der Manager-Reihe. Klare Empfehlung von mir f\xFC\
      r alle, die einen schnellen und leicht zug\xE4nglichen Manager m\xF6gen."
