There is a slight touch of humour without breaking the immersion.  Note though that [b]it is pretty much a point-and-click adventure[/b]: so you find items, try to combine them, etc.  But there are dialogue choices, some of which are important decisions.  The dialogue style and UI reminded me of Fallout 1-2.  Do not expect combat nor any skill progression. \n\nWhile most tasks or missions are linear or simple, the story does require you make some very radical decisions that have extreme consequences.  I would say those were the best parts of the game. \n\n[b]Like other point-and-click adventures, it can be frustrating when you feel stuck and you travel back and forth[/b] trying to find the right combination or NPC to talk to.  You need to be a bit stubborn and the solutions are really not impossible or too hard to figure out. \n\nTIPS (no spoilers) : \n- areas that have new dialogue (NPC) have a glowing green circle.  It is a tiny hint considering you need to travel across many maps. \n- some areas have new items if you re-visit them after important events. \n\nPUZZLES : I encountered three puzzles (one \"easy\" and two annoying but easy).\n\nTIME : on a poll of 10 players, the average was 10 hours.  \nIt took me 17 hours or so doing all I could.","timestamp_created":1609995853,"timestamp_updated":1610083918,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi9ye8PYCcduYwQI="}
