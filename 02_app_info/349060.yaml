    review: '[b][u]Game Information[/u][/b]


      "Fruit Inc." Deluxe Pack is a Strategy game. The game was developed by Manifesto
      Game Studio and published by Strategy First.


      This deluxe pack comes with two games: Fruit Inc. 1 and Fruit Inc. 2. They can
      be accessed through the game''s folder in the Steam''s Application folder. The
      game''s desktop shortcut will launch Fruit Inc. 2


      [b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]


      Game Visuals


      I want to mention that the visuals in the game are well done. The visuals can
      be adjusted in the game''s option menu.


      Game Audio


      I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio
      is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game''s
      option menu as well.


      Gameplay


      There are no difficulty game modes. Each of the levels has their own difficulty.


      This is a strategy game, where careful planning is required, due to the limited
      amount of resources that are available.


      There is a star rating system in the game: Three Stars (Gold;) Two Stars (Silver)
      and One Star (Bronze.) There is an opportunity to replay all the levels for
      better score and star rating.


      There are twenty-six different achievements that can be unlocked from playing
      the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need
      to be completed before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game
      only.


      Miscellaneous


      Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay
      value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game''s
      full price value.'
