    review: It's a simple memory game which can be enjoyable, but is not worth the
      price. I like the somewhat twists of replacing an item or leaving out an item,
      but the game itself is very boring. I multiplayer and single player both once,
      but honestly can't say that I would play it again. I found it irritating that
      you had to download an app just to play multiplayer. Multiplayer also does not
      work well. It uses your wifi connection for the game to detect the app on your
      phone so you need to be connected to the same wifi network, but both my friend
      and I were frequently disconnected even though we were both connected to the
      internet the whole time and sitting maybe a foot away from the computer. I honestly
      would not recommend getting this game and I honestly will probably not play
      it again.
