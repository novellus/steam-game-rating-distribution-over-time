    review: I love this game.  If you were a fan of Dark Messiah of Might and Magic
      multiplayer, you are sure to enjoy this.  The player base needs to grow fast
      for this game!  I usually log on around 6-10pm and find opponents, but we need
      more players!  Also, I paid $9.99 for this game, back when it cost money, and
      did not ask for a refund because I want to support the devs of this gem.  <3
