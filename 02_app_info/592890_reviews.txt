WHY?!\n\nI genuinely hope this game becomes better, i will try to play as much as i can but i cant say im having fun","timestamp_created":1519645463,"timestamp_updated":1519645673,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.45313069224357605","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ44pj86OECdOOUmgE="}
