    review: The only thing this game has right now is potential, and a few basic mechanics
      implemented. Unfortunately, it seems to be completely abandoned at this point,
      the last update having been over two years ago. Sad I wasted ten dollars only
      for the dev to just run away with it. I would love to see them come back and
      actually create something cool with this, but until then, save your money, and
      don't buy this.
