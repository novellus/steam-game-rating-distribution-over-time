GAME Guy, can modify to any rules he wants to.. It's really competitive since anyone wants to be this MR.GAME Guy, so after it was chosen, the game start and ohhhh boy... Prepare to have friends betraying each other, because in this game you can take 30 minutes to finish or have 2 hours it really depends how this ******* MR.
