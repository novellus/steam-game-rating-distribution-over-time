Which kind of defeats its purpose.\nThe physics of swinging on a rope do not work. It's hard to give any momentum with the gamepad, and whenever you manage to get some, the swinging stops abruptly without rhyme or reason.\n\nThe unresponsiveness might be due to the lack of graphical performance, as the game constantly appears to stutter in its low-res side-scrolling glory.\nThe long loading times of the very simple checkpoints system though... I've got better things to do than spending 10% of my time dying and 90% watching an almost empty loading screen.\n\nBy the way, said checkpoint isn't stored between sessions, Whatever your progress, you'll have to redo the latest level in its entirety.\n\nBelieve it or not, Unosquare dub themselves Engineering Excellence.\nDevs, I understand... It must have been hard, inventing the platformer genre all by yourselves, but I still recommend a career change, You could try clowning excellence.","timestamp_created":1596477205,"timestamp_updated":1596477205,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oJ3d2vMCf5eYmQI="}
