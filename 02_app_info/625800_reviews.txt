The traps are very similar, although the game levels are completely different.  The enemies are quite well done!  In Orcs Must Die I will run around getting into skirmishes but here I found I did not want to get close to the enemies!  I get startled when someone comes up a side pass and jumps me!  \n\nI wanted to put an english review here so people have at least an idea of the quality.  I played through the first level, got stuck at the end where I think you are trying to get into the tomb?  The pictograph instructions didn't help me until it was too late.  I finally figured out I had to put the blocks on the raised stones which I found out at that point were pressure plates.  Sadly only one block was left, I threw the others away and they glitched out when respawning.\n\nThe best part is when you are placing traps the left hand lets you choose the trap and your right hand has a little diorama of the trap in action.  I thought it was really cool and something VR can do well.  Most of the help is in english, there is a little text at the start that is not, hopefully it isn't important!  :)\n\nThe graphics are stunning, and I'm having fun.  Worth the price I think!","timestamp_created":1504984452,"timestamp_updated":1504984452,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.554275929927825928","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwuomEtN4CdPz1hAE="}
