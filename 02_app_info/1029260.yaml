    review: 'OK been waiting for this game for awhile and I wish there was a maybe
      recommendation rather then just yes or no.

      For the amount of time the game has been in development, not just the original
      development but with this new team, this is disappointing.


      For me allot of this could be rectified with a clear road map of what to expect
      in early access, "this is early access" and yet the actual description of what''s
      currently available in the game should take the foreground.


      * - "Customize your Unsung Heroes from 20 jobs and 150+ unique abilities."


      there''s like 6 jobs in current access, one is unusable as it cannot be levelled
      up - developers are aware - no notes on when this is going to be rectified.


      "Stylize their look from options such as race, face, hair, and job outfit colors."


      Currently you can only play as a human male, with very basic customisation options


      I think it''s important for these game companies to be transparent about what
      you''re getting with "Early access" games, as this has been in development for
      so long and on their site there''s allot more content I was under the impression
      that early access would more content, it doesn''t so be prepared for a very
      basic experience.
