    about_the_game: "Greetings my friend!<br />\r\n <br />\r\nDo you like mythology?\
      \ Do you like fantastic characters? Are you into card games? Well, you are in\
      \ the right place. Let us open the gates of our mysterious mythological world\
      \ to you. Welcome to S.O.M.E. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou might be wondering right\
      \ now what is SOME? Let me quickly explain it to you. First of all, S.O.M.E.\
      \ stands for Sovereignty of Mythological Earth. Also, it sounds great when you\
      \ say &quot;Let's play SOME&quot;. SOME is a digital card game, which consists\
      \ of both mythological and fictional characters. S.O.M.E has a unique fictional\
      \ world on its own and besides the game, there is lore being created for this\
      \ fictional universe. Also just wanted to mention that this is an indie card\
      \ game and there is currently 1 game developer and 1 graphic designer (responsible\
      \ for most of the art).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOur aim is not just to create a game,\
      \ it is to create a fictional universe where people can enjoy the stories, music,\
      \ cinematics, and of course the games. To reach this goal we started off with\
      \ the card game (PC version) and eventually as we progress all the pieces of\
      \ the puzzle will fall into place.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo brave warriors and\
      \ heroes are you ready to join the battle? To expand the borders of our universe\
      \ and get S.O.M.E to a better place we need support and I think you are the\
      \ perfect candidate to make it all happen."
