    review: "god, I wish there was a neutral option but oh well.\n\nis the game good?\n\
      I mean, yes? it helps spending time and can be pretty challenging, its very\
      \ cheap and some levels are pretty difficult but there are... uh... problems?\n\
      \nThe thing is, braking can make you win 70/80% of the game, even when your\
      \ probably not supposed to, just get into a tiny spot and there, done, at first\
      \ I questioned if it was really supposed to brake or just slow down then when\
      \ fighting the first boss made things clear.\n\nThe bosses are interesting I\
      \ guess, it takes time to beat them since the icons to damage them take a little\
      \ while spawn and dissapear quickly (needing like 10 or more hits) and if you\
      \ lose, welp, off to the begining you go.\n\nIts very short, you can finish\
      \ it in an hour or so and there are a few bugs (possible to die right at begining),\
      \ but they didnt bother me much.\n\nAll in all its just a 1\u20AC game, so you\
      \ shouldnt expect much from it.\n\nconclusion:\n-difficult game with lots of\
      \ levels\n-good calming music\n-Bosses can feel a bit boring\n-game is short\n\
      \n5/10"
