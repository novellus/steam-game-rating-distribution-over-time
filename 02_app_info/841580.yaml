    review: There's a lot of potential in this game, I owned it back when Desura was
      a thing and since then have been daydreaming that it would come back on some
      digital store, only to find it here on Steam in Early Access! There aren't any
      other games quite like this, and I am at a loss at how to describe the game,
      2.5 hack-and-slash / brawl? With an overworld to explore, a house/guild to upgrade
      and units to recruit, defend the city from raids and go explore POIs that spawn
      throughout the overworld/world map, you have wandering enemies and raid groups
      that you can find. I'm still very early in the game as I was when I played it
      on Desura, so I'll update this as I go along - but if you're after something
      new, this is definitely something to support. Also includes the ability to host
      servers or play singleplayer.
