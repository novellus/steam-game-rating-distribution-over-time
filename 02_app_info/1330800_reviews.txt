Its story and atmosphere are well worth a few hours of your time.\n\nThis is not a full size game. It was created by a small group of students on no budget, and it shows. However, for that size and scope, it is impressively complete. I greatly enjoyed the couple hours I spent playing.\n\nNarrative:\nThe writing is very strong. The mystery is intriguing, the characters are likable and complex, and the story is well constructed. There are several emotionally impactful story beats; at various points I felt shock, anger, suspense, horror, compassion, etc. I enjoyed the prevailing theme of identity, trust, and how our experiences shape who we are. Also, LGBT rep is a plus!\n\nDesign:\nThe use of information as a consumable resource is an interesting mechanic that reinforces the themes of the narrative. \nThere are multiple paths through the story depending on what you say to which characters. Not all the content can be seen in one playthrough. It is worthwhile to replay the game to try other solutions, get to know different characters, and investigate previously unanswered questions.\n\n","timestamp_created":1595201619,"timestamp_updated":1595201619,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.629629611968994141","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w6DbtPMCfPCvlgI="}
