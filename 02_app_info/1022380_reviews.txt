Falling off the map subtracts one point. \nAI players tend to walk right off the map without attempting attacking, so there's no point playing with them. \nYou don't get to choose how many (if any) AI players to include.\nIt seems that there's only 3 maps, with no option to select which map to play on, or to create your own","timestamp_created":1575507571,"timestamp_updated":1575507571,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1575709582,"developer_response":"Hello, thanks for reviewing the game. \n\nWe'll take a look at the AI and see what kind of tweaks and improvements can be made to it since it's very important for the enjoyment of the game.\n\nThere is also access to a shuriken toss which can be used with 'i' or 'y' (depending on if you're using a keyboard or controller).\n\nThe game currently has 8 levels which are selected at random (level selection could definitely be added though so thank you for you comment about it).\n\nThe game forces a minimum of 2 players (default is 4). The number of players is selected by highlighting player count and pressing left or right (which can be done in the main menu or match over menu).\n\nEven though you did not enjoy the game, we're thankful for your review as feedback is something that we always appreciate. Once again, thank you very much for taking the time to leave your thoughts."}],"cursor":"AoJ4k7bk6e4Cfq6D4gE="}
