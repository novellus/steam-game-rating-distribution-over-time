    about_the_game: "In some games you jump all over the place, shooting things, saving\
      \ presidents, fighting challengers, dropping blocks, crafting weapons.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nIn this game you find the letter H.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this relaxing\
      \ journey around a pond, you collect as many of the letter H you would like.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nA note from the developer:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI made this\
      \ game last year when I was going through some really hard times mentally. \
      \ I wanted to make something simple that would help me relax and take my mind\
      \ off things and hopefully put me in a better state of mind. A few nights ago\
      \ I was having trouble sleeping and I remembered this game. I played it a bit\
      \ and it helped me calm down. The next day I decided that I would finish the\
      \ game and share it with the public. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese are pretty stressful\
      \ and uncertain times, but I hope this game is as helpful for you as it is to\
      \ me and is a comforting experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI'd love to hear what\
      \ you think of the game. And if you want to say hi feel free to reach out on\
      \ Twitter @SodaDrinkerPro.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanks!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWill<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nNote: this game is not a substitute for seeing a doctor or\
      \ therapist. If you are having mental health issues contact a professional."
