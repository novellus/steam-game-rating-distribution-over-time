Once I applied a couple of fixes the game ran perfectly, easily one of the most fun experiences I've had in a while. Humor is great and I like the fps elements and controlling a mech is pretty fun. Enemy AI can be bullshit at times and it clearly wasnt play-tested properly but in my opinion the good outweighs the bad. I highly recommend this game for ani fps,mech,anime lover.","timestamp_created":1609626339,"timestamp_updated":1609626339,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ465jN4vYCe4jwvwI="}
