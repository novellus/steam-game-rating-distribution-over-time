    review: 'I have been playing this game for about a week and I have to say it is
      extremely entertaining.

      A freeze-tag style chaser with the cutest, yet sassiest, playable characters
      with some of the best voice-acting.  The stages are just large enough to feel
      you can hide safely from the darkness, yet small enough to keep the challenge.  The
      movement is smooth with extra fun using the wall jumps and dash to practically
      fly across the stage as you free your teammates from the ensuing darkness.  Finally,
      after all my hours logged in the game, I have yet to see the light prevail against
      the darkness even once.  The challenge in this game makes it a very easy grind
      to higher levels while enjoying some of the best gameplay and most creative
      characters.  Strongly recommend you pick this game up!
