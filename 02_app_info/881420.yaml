      to our own. But it exists in a magical universe where the laws of physics are
      subordinate to the whims of the gods and spirits. To understand Glorantha, leave
      our mundane world and enter the world of myth. The Sun is a living god, not

    review: "A game with a wonderful atmosphere that matches if not achieves heights\
      \ higher than King of Dragon Pass. The Riders are a truly foreign civilisation\
      \ that one has to learn about and understand the importance of things. You will\
      \ likely fail your first few attempts, missing clues or simply not having the\
      \ whole story. Your clan mates often don't have the entire picture and you often\
      \ lack the cultural knowledge to understand some things. Sometimes, The spirits\
      \ and the Gods are simply not with you.\n\nThis game is quite RNG based, however,\
      \ it is not unfair. If you play it smart and genuinely make efforts to understand\
      \ the games systems and take into account things potentially being able to fail,\
      \ then you'll manage quite handily. \n\nThe game is very text heavy and will\
      \ require a lot of Reading and Absorbing information and requires attention\
      \ and focus, even though the game doesn't move at a fast pace. \n\nMusic is\
      \ a 9/10, pleasant and fits the Mood of any given scene."
