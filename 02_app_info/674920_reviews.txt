The pictures are well done, and the information is interesting, but functionally it needs some work. Most of the subclasses seem to be complex for the sake of complexity; science dice, forge dice, defense dice, fortune points, entropy points, cap points, spider points, etc. It's just another thing you need to keep track of. The best mechanics are both straightforward and compelling. What's more, most of the subclasses require you to be one of the new races. \n\nMost of the races are acceptably balanced, but some of them have abilities that are inexplicably strong. Did melee damage to someone? Now as a bonus action you can do more melee damage and knock them prone. No weapon? Don't worry about it, you have a natural weapon that does 1d8 with reach and knocks them prone. If a player decides to play a gnome barbarian just for laughs they might not be quite as strong as someone who chooses a goliath, but it's still not game-changing. On the other hand, some (2 in particular) of the race options in this are just head and shoulders above the rest. The opportunity cost is too high to not pick them.","timestamp_created":1520804904,"timestamp_updated":1520804904,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxKfCi+ICdOK6mwE="}
