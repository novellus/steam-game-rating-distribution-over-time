Why is that the first sentence?  Because this game is super nice and great.  It makes you care and worry about the characters from the beginning... but mostly for the main ones.  If you want to know about others?  You might get a hint here and there, but let's face it: the main characters are on the cover, it will be 90% about them.\n\nCombat?  Fun.  I wasn't bored for a second.  I liked the flashy animations and yes, there is an option to turn them off too, if needed.  Music/SFX work well together!  After you get going and adjust, you will actually be split into two groups.  Then you follow one and then the either, but you wont be confused, as there isn't that much dialogue, but everything that's said is direct and actually amusing at some points.\n\nYou kinda will figure out who the bad guy is... but sometimes you feel good about figuring it out from the beginning.  I gotta say though the side quests?  ARE THE MOST HIDDEN!  There are hidden rooms and stuff... but OMG I found over 25+ of those and only *sigh* 5 side quests... One of them didn't work for me.  It is the one with the blue orb for the church.  Once you can carry it?  The lady in the church disappears.  I explored every single tile in that church and nothing.  Couldn't find a way to resolve it.\n\nThere is one quest where you pick two items and that \"mini axe\" is adorable!!!  I consider it to be a lucky charm!\n\nEventually you will have to pick what characters you travel with in the end + you do get a boat.  None of this is a spoiler, I mean common... you play enough RPGs you kinda need to get that point to get everything that you missed!  And off you go to a place that's really wide and yeah... Boss time!\n\nArtwork in this game is really nice.  The main characters are sweet and loving towards one another.  So I am very happy for them and what happened.  *clap clap clap*  So thank you for the game which took me 15+ hours to enjoy due to finding all of the secrets.... at least I thought I did... Well played.  Thank you for the sweet, kind and fun game!!! =) :) :>","timestamp_created":1609910074,"timestamp_updated":1609910074,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521428585052490234","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqceH6/YCe+z0wAI="}
