    review: 'So I''m going to be completely honest here. I bought this game in full
      expectation of it being "so bad its good" type thing where I could sink a few
      beers and have a few giggles. And it is good for that, but what I wasn''t prepared
      for was getting genuinely invested in the story and characters. Sure, the characters
      are kinda Mary Sue-ish as another review points out but they do grow on you.
      This game is obviously a labor of love and I am genuinely sad more furries haven''t
      played it or even left so much as a screenshot. The art really grows on you
      and my boyfriend and I had a genuinely good time playing through this. Warning,
      you will get hungry!

      My only real complaint would be the price. $20 USD seems a bit steep for a visual
      novel especially when all the more well known ones are half or a quarter that
      price. I think a sale price would encourage more people to try this wholesome
      game.'
