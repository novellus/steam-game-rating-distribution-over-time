I'm about five flights in and so far they don't take you directly to any place of interest.  For example, one stop is in Buffalo, about twenty miles from Niagara Falls, but no flight takes you over the falls so you'd have to know that it's nearby in order to deviate from the flight plan to see it.  Also, all the flights are IFR by default so you'll have to constantly make those little adjustments that the Microsoft air-traffic controllers take you on, so I soon learned to modify the existing flight plan to be VFR using the GPS, then I just go on autopilot via that (with deviations around controlled airspace or to particular things that I want to see), switching to an IFR flight plan only if the weather becomes truly IFR.    \n\nThe Beech 18 is a sweet classic and I love the sound of those twin radials, though the tail-wheel lock doesn't work, nor does the tail wheel retract with the main gear--it and its doors just hang out there at the back.  Also, there's limited documentation on the aircraft and none about the journey itself.  Still, all-in-all it's a good product and I'm enjoying cruising around the country.  Each leg so far is about 1.5 hours long which is long enough to feel that you accomplished something but not long enough to drag.  \n\nIf you buy this, I suggest you buy the book \"I'll Take the 18\" by Scott Gloodt which is an excellent memoir of his years flying Beech 18 freighters across the American midwest in the 70s and 80s.  He's a good writer covering plenty of quirky characters and the challenges and joys experienced over many years of flying freight.  But most of all his book is a pseudo love story between a man and a sometimes cantankerous and rough around the edges but rugged as hell piece of machinery that carried him safely through many challenging situations.  He goes into some technical details and nuances of the aircraft which should be interesting in computer pilots who enjoy emulating real-world flying.\n\nAlso go to http://ryardusa.com/beech_lesson_1.html to see a complete configuration table for this aircraft (recommended throttle and propeller settings for various phases of flight).","timestamp_created":1585979638,"timestamp_updated":1585979855,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iYLxofECd770/QE="}
