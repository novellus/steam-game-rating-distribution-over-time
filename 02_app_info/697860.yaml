    review: 'Absolutely worth it if you''re at all interested with video effects and/or
      the retro analog video look. Is it perfect? no. Is it fun? YES. The ui can be
      unfriendly at times (in particular the sprite/figure editor, left click on the
      top left in the sprite drawing area on the SMALL white letter just next to it
      to change brush. not the boxed letters.) but the manual does help even if it
      could be a little more clear. Regardless though, the program is just great fun
      to play with, and has more potential than I think the store page might first
      let on. Audio reactivity stuff is probably my biggest issue, it could do with
      improvement both performance and stability wise, and just the way the program
      reacts to sound is maddeningly inconsistent sometimes. Live camera pickup also
      doesn''t seem to work right, but besides that its just loads of fun. I''ve made
      tons of little animations and videos, including things I''ve ported into Blender
      as animations to put on a display, brilliant to add to the aesthetic of a render.
      The tool is a seriously great value considering how much similar programs are
      worth. Basically, if you''re eyeing the program up at all, get it. Tip for new
      users too: If the program is running slowly, check what resolution you''re running
      the render box at, reopen the program and make sure it''s not too big. The resolution
      numbers for the CRT simulator on the open screen are different from the actual
      size of the render box, which can be scaled. I tend to just use one of the presets,
      I''d try a few of those first before inputting any custom resolution.'
