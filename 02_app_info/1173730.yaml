    review: It's a really interesting concept with a lot of potential. I've played
      the early access version 0.0.1, so it has been impossible to expect contents
      on contents, but for the minutes that I've spent, I enjoyed it. I'm wondering
      which shapes could be designed for the dungeons and how they will affect the
      gameplay during the expansion of the kingdom. At this moment they are still
      simple, so we will see. A good start in my opinion, I'll keep an eye on the
      next updates.
