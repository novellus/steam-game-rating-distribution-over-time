    about_the_game: "Neptune Flux is a story-driven, open world adventure game set\
      \ in a sci-fi ocean full of mystery and haunting beauty. The world above the\
      \ water is a dust bowl and an escape into space is out of reach. Humanity's\
      \ last hope of survival is the untouched ecosystem of the deep sea, and A.Q.U.A.\
      \ is the worldwide market leader in underwater colonization. In Neptune Flux,\
      \ you take on the role of Sarah, an A.Q.U.A. employee tasked with finding the\
      \ source of strange energy surges that are disrupting A.Q.U.A. operations. As\
      \ you carry out A.Q.U.A. missions and explore the sea floor, you\u2019ll discover\
      \ the dark secrets that lurk below.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPLORE THE OCEAN</h2>In\
      \ the deep sea there\u2019s no natural sunlight, but every A.Q.U.A. dive pod\
      \ comes equipped to see in the dark. Tools like flood lights and flares illuminate\
      \ nearby areas, while more advanced gear like visual sonar can cut through the\
      \ deep sea fog and highlight distant objects. Earn cash by recovering treasure\
      \ and reporting lost wreck sites to A.Q.U.A. Invest your earnings into dive\
      \ pod upgrades to increase your effectiveness as an explorer.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >DISCOVER THE TRUTH</h2>Working for A.Q.U.A. means being in the dark, literally\
      \ and figuratively. Sarah has learned to stop asking questions about her missions,\
      \ but when her assignments become increasingly unusual, she begins her quest\
      \ to learn the truth. Discover an open ocean filled with sci-fi wonder and supernatural\
      \ secrets. Experience the personal story of Sarah's struggle to survive in a\
      \ world that might be beyond saving.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">IMMERSE YOURSELF IN\
      \ VR</h2>Neptune Flux can be played with <i>or without</i> a VR headset, but\
      \ if you're chasing that feeling of VR 'presence', this game is for you. Strap\
      \ on a headset like the HTC Vive or Oculus Rift, grab your favorite gamepad,\
      \ and get lost in a fully realized world. Look around the humble interior of\
      \ Sarah's dive pod and hear her snarky comments. See the huge scale of wreck\
      \ sites in stunning stereoscopic 3D. Listen to professionally mastered positional\
      \ audio and hear everything - from creaking wooden ships to percolating bubbles\
      \ - in remarkable clarity."

    review: "Very short simple game.  Recommend purchase when it is on sale. Travel\
      \ around in a sub finding \"stuff\" that helps solve a mystery.  Nothing too\
      \ difficult.  \nSome bits don't make a lot of sense - like the salvage exchange\
      \ that you don't really need after the upgrades have been purchased.  \nOverall\
      \ its relaxing, simple, somewhat engaging.  But it is very short.  You can finish\
      \ it in about an hour."
