    review: '"Punch your way through a bloodthirsty and mature world to achieve glory..."
      it says before an incoherent mess of gags and references to martial arts pop
      culture in a haphazard compilation of useless stats and inconsistent story-telling.
      Honestly, I would have enjoyed the story if the plot synopsis had been even
      a slight bit accurate. "Fighting circuit in a video game-esque world" would
      have been enough on its own; but you tried to sell it as some epic, dark-action
      type story - which it plainly isn''t. It feels more like what a teenager thinks
      is an underground fight club adventure.


      Hell, even if it turned out to be a parody, I still would''ve enjoyed it if
      the stats system wasn''t a clunky mess with no clear objective on how exactly
      to build it or use it. Tried to build an all-muscle and endurance character.
      Lost every match. Tried a charmer and an intellectual; lost most every match.
      Tried mixing different stats; lost most every match. What am I doing here, exactly?


      In short; cool concept, funny jokes/self-parody, but terrible execution.'
