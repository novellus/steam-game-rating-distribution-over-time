    about_the_game: "---Intro---<br />\r\nCreated by a solo hobbyist, Lands Of The\
      \ Lost is a 3D third-person Action RPG with roguelite elements.  You take the\
      \ role of a volunteer hero, questing to save the land from an ancient evil re-awakened.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n-Action-<br />\r\nThis is a realtime game with a heavy focus\
      \ on combat.  You can move and look around freely, sprint &amp; jump &amp; roll\
      \ (with iframes) wildly with some stamina restrictions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      The player moves fast and so do the creatures, the basic melee attacks of the\
      \ player and all enemies has a small chance to stun.  The battles can be be\
      \ a breeze or a brutal beatdown depending on how you are equipped for the area.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nCreatures don't take too many hits to kill but neither will\
      \ you, loot will be dropping constantly, the enemy respawn rate is high and\
      \ cannot be stopped.  You will have to move quickly through areas while fighting\
      \ to advance.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game uses a collision based system for\
      \ combat so you will actually have to aim to hit your enemies, but you will\
      \ be able to dodge their attacks as well (especially projectile attacks).<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will unlock skills that you can use along with your basic\
      \ attacks in combat, you can have 3 skills at a time linked to your quickbar\
      \ where you will be able to switch between them for active use.  There is no\
      \ doubt you'll have more skills than you can keep on the quickbar so you'll\
      \ have to make good choices, though you can change them at any time.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nThe goal with this game was to not railroad the player and force\
      \ you down a slow and inevitable path filled with forced dialogue and quests.\
      \  Starting up a new game should be very fast and you'll be fighting in no time,\
      \ and that theme continues throughout the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-RPG-<br\
      \ />\r\nThe entire combat system is based on RPG style concepts.  The player\
      \ and all enemies have stats like ATK (attack) and DEF (defense) or MATK (magic\
      \ attack) and MDEF (magic defense).  All combat is based on these stats, which\
      \ you can raise directly with each level-up.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will find\
      \ that most gear will raise these stats as well further increasing your damage.\
      \  The various weapons you will be able to purchase of increasing power will\
      \ mostly just be boosts to these stats, however weapons also set the damage\
      \ type for your basic attack to either physical (scales with ATK) or magic (scales\
      \ with MATK).  Not only do basic attacks scale with these stats but you will\
      \ see that the attack skills you can unlock in the skill tree as you level up\
      \ will scale in the same way (and also be of either physical or magical type\
      \ damage).  These skills use mana but that will regenerate with time like your\
      \ health, also there are potions to restore both.  You'll also find armor to\
      \ boost the defensive stats.  Additionally you can get 'buff' skills that will\
      \ raise certain stats for a period of time before wearing off.<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nIn addition to finding consumable potions to restore your health &amp;\
      \ mana, you will get random drops from enemies that are crafting items that\
      \ can be brought to a village where the crafting NPC can turn it into goods\
      \ for you.  In town you will also be able to pick up quests to complete for\
      \ rewards, or to buy/sell new weapons &amp; armor &amp; magic rings or even\
      \ just more potions (including permanent stat boosting ones).  The towns also\
      \ have many NPCs that provide some backstory and lore to the game.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\n-Roguelite-<br />\r\nThis game embraces the concept of permanent death.\
      \  There is no saving or loading.  There are no checkpoints.  When you die your\
      \ character and all progress will be lost and you will have to start a new one.\
      \   Even when you win your character will be removed to 'retire' and your Total\
      \ Wins will increase by +1.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo make this work the game is\
      \ not very long (2 hours or so to get a victory) and it also heavily uses randomization\
      \ in the world creation - so you get a fresh game world with every new run.\
      \  This keeps the game from getting too stale hopefully and also makes the loss\
      \ of death less painful.  However the high difficulty will keep racking up wins\
      \ from being too easy if all goes to plan.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAdditionally there\
      \ is permanent progression to encourage replays as well.  Each time you beat\
      \ the final boss and win the game your Total Wins will increase, tracking between\
      \ game sessions.   Your first victory will unlock a new character type for you\
      \ to select at the new game screen.  Each of the two characters has a unique\
      \ skill tree and will play differently.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-World-<br />\r\n\
      The game takes place in a total of 4 worlds - each with an outdoor area, dungeon\
      \ and town.  All three area types have degrees of randomization when first generated\
      \ on a new game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach new outdoor area and dungeon will have\
      \ more difficult enemies.  Each new town will have better weapons/armor/accessories\
      \ and better potions to buy and better things to craft, as well as unique quests\
      \ for that area.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou will have to defeat the boss of each\
      \ dungeon to unlock the path to the next world, defeating the final dungeon\
      \ boss will win you the game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Accessibility-<br />\r\nThis\
      \ game has an option at the main menu screen to toggle on mouse inversion -\
      \ thus you are able to play either inverted or non-inverted with the mouselook\
      \ in game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExtensive effort went into supporting many different\
      \ resolution / aspect ratios.  You will see at the initial launcher screen that\
      \ you can select just about any resolution that your monitor supports.  This\
      \ game should work on any square or landscape screen, but will not work on portrait\
      \ (vertical) displays.  The following aspect ratios were specifically tested\
      \ -  1:1, 5:4, 4:3, 3:2, 16:10, 5:3, 17:10, 16:9, 18:9, 21:9<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThere is a hotkey guide that can be viewed at the main menu but also optionally\
      \ overlayed during gameplay using the 'H' key to toggle it on/off.  This can\
      \ be a handy rereference if you forgot how to access any of the GUI screens.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThere is a minimap that provides details to keep the player\
      \ oriented at all times not only in the zone they are in but hopefully giving\
      \ them an idea of their progression through the zones.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe\
      \ game should be able to support a very wide range of machines using the Quality\
      \ options in the launcher, the Low setting should run on just about anything\
      \ and the High setting should hopefully look good on powerful rigs."

    review: 'Been looking for a game like this... Fun indie rpg that''s definitely
      not as easy as it seems at first.


      Clean graphics style & creatures that are punishingly fast. Already died a good
      few times but that''s just solidified my resolve to beat it.


      Finally realized i could press I to pause the fighting & heal myself which has
      helped me move forward. The grind is real... but quick & straightforward.'
