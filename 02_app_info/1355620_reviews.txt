I was originally planning to sit down and try it for an hour but I got sucked in and played for almost two and  a half hours and I think that speaks volumes for how entertaining and addictive the game is. There is definitely work to be done on the game but the devs seem committed to patching and improving where required. \nQuite enjoyable, I would suggest to anyone who likes MOBA style games! \n\nFull disclosure: I am friends with one of the devs and was thanked in the Credits of the game,  but I paid for this copy of the game and I have given a truly honest review here. Have a great day!!","timestamp_created":1604357517,"timestamp_updated":1604357517,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ47J3KxfUCdLb0qwI="}
