Its not expensive at 4.99$ and I find it quite fun to kill a few hours, I find it fun to play with on the occasion in the dead of night. There's a ton of lot and a few different classes to mix and match your parties with. There will be no more updates as of posting this review but I do still think its work the price tag.","timestamp_created":1608186898,"timestamp_updated":1608186898,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5ZTat/YCc/zvugI="}
