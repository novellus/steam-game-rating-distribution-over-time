    about_the_game: "Escape Room VR: Stories is a game based on the popular real-life\
      \ escape rooms. It uses VR capabilities to its full potential. The locations\
      \ are full of objects that players can interact with, the environment is very\
      \ realistic and detailed. Each room has it own plot that combines together into\
      \ one story. Every location has three different endings which depend on the\
      \ player's success in unraveling their secrets. The plot is presented to the\
      \ player through graphic novel cutscenes. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCan you solve\
      \ the crime thriller awaiting?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou'll be playing as two different\
      \ characters put in quite difficult predicaments. You'll have only 30 minutes\
      \ to find your way out of each room. Every location offers a different variety\
      \ of puzzles and riddles which will test your logical thinking, wittiness and\
      \ even dexterity at times. On your way to solving the mystery and revealing\
      \ the full story, you'll get entangled in the white collar crimes of the financial\
      \ world in Dirty Money. Next, you will have to pass the final trial of the notorious\
      \ fraternity only to find yourself in a seemingly hopeless situation in Mad\
      \ Kidnapper. Good luck!"
