It is neither fun nor realistic. It is nothing except a load of shit. \nFirst of all, the protagonist's gender cannot be chosen. It is compulsory female. Many people studying psychology are female but not necessarily. Secondly, the impression of the tutor is too horrific. It not true for every tutor to be horrific. At the same time, the tutor will not LITERALLY let you to collect 10 references as it is a EXTREMELY SMALL NUMBER of reference. FIVE sample is also TOO SMALL. The ETHICS are violated as the participants have WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS. Also, they need VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION. NOT TO PERSUADE PARTICIPANTS TO JOIN IN! The sampling procedure is a CONVENIENCE SAMPLING. THE P - VALUE IS NOT TO BE CREATED BY THESE MULTI-ANALYSIS TOOLS! THE AMBIANCE OF THE GAME IS HORRIFIC AND EVOKES A SENSE OF DISGUST! YOU CAN PRECISELY MAKE A HORRIFIC GAME INSTEAD OF A STIMULATION GAME.\nOverall, I strongly not recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1609592904,"timestamp_updated":1609592904,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlNPN4fYCf5LcvwI="}
