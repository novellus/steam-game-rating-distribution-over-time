    review: '1.  You may have noticed that all of EcoGames games, are about easily
      making money with little effort.  It seems as though this is exactly what they
      expect from their games.  Easy money, no effort.


      2.  I have removed all other complaints, as if you cared about your game, they
      wouldn''t exist.  Thus my first complaint, says it all.  If you don''t like
      your game, why should we?'
