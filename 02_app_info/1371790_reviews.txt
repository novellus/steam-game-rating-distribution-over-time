I think the Idea of flashlight recharching is perfekt! I hope there would be nore Items to wield, like better flashlights, or something else upcoming. The only thing that I didnt like was the voice acting. Not the voice acting, but the mics for the recording where bad, I think. The voice acting itself is pretty good, I dont like only Kates. I will support this game and recommend it to friends. Please make some Updates, like Textures and 3d Models Updates, and to running animation!!! Good game.","timestamp_created":1604479532,"timestamp_updated":1604479532,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwvtebyfUCeN+arAI="}
