I bought this game in full expectation of it being \"so bad its good\" type thing where I could sink a few beers and have a few giggles. And it is good for that, but what I wasn't prepared for was getting genuinely invested in the story and characters. Sure, the characters are kinda Mary Sue-ish as another review points out but they do grow on you. This game is obviously a labor of love and I am genuinely sad more furries haven't played it or even left so much as a screenshot. The art really grows on you and my boyfriend and I had a genuinely good time playing through this. Warning, you will get hungry!\nMy only real complaint would be the price. $20 USD seems a bit steep for a visual novel especially when all the more well known ones are half or a quarter that price. I think a sale price would encourage more people to try this wholesome game.","timestamp_created":1608720623,"timestamp_updated":1608720623,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42ZTOx/YCfKC1vAI="}
