Control ship speed to control the range of your shots/bombs, interesting level completion benchmarks, unique upgrade path system, etc.\n\nIt begins relatively simple, but I very quickly began to see the complex interactions between the different weapons on the ships, and how difficult they can make your life. Some of the setups forced me into a hit and run mechanic that pitted me against the clock, as you only get so many runs before they reach earth. My only complaint is that on a rare occasion I would be pushed to the edge of the map and pinned there, which isn't much fun in a game that is otherwise about non stop shooting action. But, each level is hand crafted in a way that forced me to approach it with a fresh strategy, and that kept me coming back for more punishment. \n\nOverall it's a good challenge with some fresh mechanics, well worth the price of admission.","timestamp_created":1500842616,"timestamp_updated":1500842730,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47123602032661438","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwodTMuN0CfeDggAE="}
