I found the progression within the main story satisfying, with little touches which enhance the world around you. For me, some of the vignettes are stronger than others but overall they were a pleasing break from the main arc while remaining familiar enough. \n\nHaving waited some years for this game I do feel like I wanted more \"meat on the bones\" with Nick and Madison's story. The ending did feel a bit sudden and I was left wanting more. For some people this will be perfect and they'll appreciate the short, sad and sweet nature. \n\nOverall, apartment was a unique experience and deserves the couple of hours it takes to play. The team did a great job of capturing certain sentiments and the feeling of being alone, while still keeping the tone hopeful. Looking forward to seeing more games in the future.","timestamp_created":1588400432,"timestamp_updated":1588400432,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuOSC6vECfoj8hAI="}
