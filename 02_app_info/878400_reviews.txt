The devs probably made this to make a quick buck off of it. Not worth the money at all. Stay away.\n\nI cannot recommend this game unless the devs add more intuitive controls, a better UI(it looks like an old Ps1 game), more game modes, etc.\n\nDon't buy this even on sale.","timestamp_created":1530483514,"timestamp_updated":1530483514,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.699231982231140137","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqaP7q+QCcvbzpAE="}
