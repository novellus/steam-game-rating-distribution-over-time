The rest of them I enjoyed, as you can actually work them out given the clues. If you liked the first Leaves game you will like this one and vice versa. It is a slow, thinking game. And yes it does seem to get the PC hot but switching it off for a bit or changing to a lower resolution helped me.","timestamp_created":1609674986,"timestamp_updated":1609674986,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoeKG5PYCdfWFwAI="}
