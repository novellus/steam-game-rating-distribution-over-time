Alabeo has done a great job with this package, the detail and accuracy are really top notch. The in-cockpit engine noise is the deafening roar that it should be! Great fun to fly, highly aerobatic but very tricky to land. The original aircraft was absolutely lethal and all the original examples were lost in accidents, which gives you some idea of how tricky they were. The flight model in the game is perhaps a little more benign, but still a challenge. Aerobatics with a smoke trail are great fun! 10/10","timestamp_created":1609161512,"timestamp_updated":1609161512,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxILg1PYCcc2MvgI="}
