It is more a tactical strategy game. Battles are played on a map full of enemies, where each turn, each of your units may move, attack, and use one or two skills, the goal being to wipe out all the opponent's units. The game lasts about seven hours total.\n\nThere is a storyline, but beyond the initial premise, it mostly serves to lead in to the next battle. There are decisions to be made at some points, which lead the story along multiple paths, with multiple endings possible, but these are few in number.\n\nThere is very little exploration, and the tactical battles are the primary focus. These battles can last anywhere from ten minutes to an hour. They may look difficult, but if you know what you're doing at all, they are easy to beat.\n\nBattles provide you with money, which can be spent in stores to buy weapons, armour, and skill enhancements. These stores, however, appear at unpredictable points in the game, and may not be there when needed. Occasional treasure chests provide items which are useless, as far as I could tell.\n\nOverall, this game is best recommended to those who enjoy the tactical strategy gameplay. The story is fine, but if you don't like the battles, it will become tedious very quickly.","timestamp_created":1507856534,"timestamp_updated":1507856534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502233564853668213","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn5nQid8Ccb2OiAE="}
