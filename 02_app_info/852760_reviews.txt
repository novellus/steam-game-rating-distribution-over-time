Or you can just accept your punishments like not being able to use your flashlight for 1 minute or not being able to move for 8 seconds, etc. The enemy AI patrols around and you have to avoid it. Get caught and it's game over. Put out all the candles then ... I'll let you figure that out.\n\nRate 5.5/10. I honestly did NOT want to turn on my flashlight because the game looks so ugly. However, I had fun so buy it on sale.","timestamp_created":1526434025,"timestamp_updated":1526434393,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519003510475158691","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uo2ls+MCd/K4oAE="}
