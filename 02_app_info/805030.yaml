    review: "Phew! After (what I consider to be) the utterly dreadful and drab second\
      \ LC episode, things are mostly back on track with this one.\n\nIt's not clever\
      \ or original like the 1st one, and has almost none of that episode's quirky\
      \ charm. But it's a solid HOG, with vastly improved graphics over both the earlier\
      \ episodes, no problems running in HD, and decent (if unoriginal) puzzles. Also,\
      \ I didn't turn the music off; so it obviously wasn't completely irritating\
      \ like some HOGs seem to get away with.\n\nSome 'flaws' in the HO puzzles, though.\
      \ [spoiler]A shuttlecock is labled as a 'birdie'. A 'snowdrop' turned out to\
      \ be a sunflower. And using 'helm' to refer to a ships wheel was a bit obscure.[/spoiler]\
      \ Now; these may just be terms I'm not familiar with, or maybe just odd translations.\
      \ Completely threw me, anyhow. And when there are quite obviously two books\
      \ in a scene and only one counts.. irritating. (There are other examples, but\
      \ I can't remember them now.)\n\nDecent bonus chapter, too.\n\nRecommended if\
      \ you enjoy HOGs; this fits right in with most of them. Not recommended if you\
      \ are looking for anything original, challenging or particularly engaging. \n\
      \nI short; a fairly good, standard HOG which, if you like that kind of thing\
      \ is worth a look. \n"
