At least in the early levels. The controls are cumbersome, and the logic of the \"physics\" is tenuous at best. There is no sense of satisfaction in having completed a level; rather a head-scratching wondering why it worked the way it did in that instance whereas it seemed to work differently coming at the problem from a different angle.","timestamp_created":1608755727,"timestamp_updated":1608755727,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qYnUyPYCee7JvAI="}
