It is not that bad, but needs polishing.\n\nThe story is OK, short game 5 - 6 hours to complete. The story building is not bad, and features like the upgrade tree make me infer that these were designed for a far more longer game.\n\nI recommend  this game with reserves and only if you have tolerance to clunky and unpolished games.\n","timestamp_created":1609537780,"timestamp_updated":1609537780,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502369701862335205","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkq/73/YCcqzDvwI="}
