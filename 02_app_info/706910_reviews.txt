If you like what the devs made and want to support them, you can buy this.\n\nIt covers how the game went from conception to final release and how the art style developed throughout the game's years in development. The only thing I'm disappointed by is the lack of documenting new content, such as the precursor ship, the space whales and the behemoths.\n\nAlso, for the people who can't find the artbook, it's located in the local files of the game under the folder \"Artbook\". There will be a .pdf file there.","timestamp_created":1596549876,"timestamp_updated":1596549967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.576837420463562012","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yeXy3PMCc9KrmQI="}
