I suspect I should go back to v2.78 because I saw it in the welcome screen in one of these tutorial videos. \n\nDisappointed, needs a fix or work around, new dev debug asap. Is there un update I'm unaware of?\n\nSomeone please let me know.\n\n**I would recommend if there was a fix to use with new Blender version(s); it is now Sept 2020.
