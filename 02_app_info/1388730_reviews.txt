In no way would i buy this DLC full price, but luckily I got the base game and the DLC for $20.\nBasic summary: Its a time loop story, ala groundhogs day, but they don't do a fantastic job of taking advantage of what makes that genre work. What I mean by that is that in other time loop media you'll see things like people doing certain actions because they know there are no consequences and rarely doing the exact same thing twice (because thats very boring). The first only happens like twice, which are both fun moments, but they're just brief glimpses of what could have been. The second is the biggest issue with this DLC. You LITERALLY do the same day four times. What do I mean by that? After day one, no side quests change. Period. What was new on day one is it for the rest of the game. It is... intensely annoying and boring.\nThat being said, Bloop is a great character, I love the expansions this DLC makes to the MMPP universe, when the DLC isnt literally identical to the past day its actually very good, and the new cards are pretty decent.","timestamp_created":1604118415,"timestamp_updated":1604118415,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46ZC6vvUCfKOcqwI="}
