Even though the game was a little rough around the edges when I purchased it, I still  felt that the price point was somewhat low.  There are few Devs out there now that put in as much work and care into their games as Val does.  Keep up the good work Val.","timestamp_created":1606792987,"timestamp_updated":1606792987,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.585492253303527832","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l+iUjvYCevmYtgI="}
