But it IS remarkable how far ahead of its time this game was: Space exploration across 8 star systems, the ability to land on planets, speak to inhabitants, make money through trade, upgrade your ship, play video games within a video game (hive). Not to mention space based combat featuring optional newtonian physics and a good story/opportunity to be found where you get to be the hero. All in a DOS based game that didn't assume users had a mouse or even a sound card.\n\nThis is the spiritual parent of so many modern games... Elite Dangerous, X4: Foundations, Stellaris, No Mans Sky, Avorion. But despite the fancy graphics, I find most modern space games too complicated.  The magic of Space Rogue was its simplicity and the fact that it was equal parts space exploration, space combat and ground based interactions. \n\nSome hints: \n\nDon't use the games original save/load system.  Instead, start up the game using \"Play Space Rogue Classic in DOSBox Daum\". DOS BOX has the ability to take a snapshot of the game state at any time by hitting ALT + F5. This allows you to save anytime you want without having to be in the cockpit. More important you can load your last save at anytime by hitting ALT + F9 (even during the startup video). Thus you can continue where you left off without having to go find an online copy of the manual to get past the ownership verification question. \n\nHit ALT + ENTER to toggle between fullscreen and windowed. You need the window if you want to access DOS Box's Menu. Using the menu, you can have up to 8 save slots. \n\nDOSBox can also let you limit the CPU speed using the CPU menu. At certain points in the game, you may need to lower the cycles in order to run from guards and monsters. I used \"fixed 150\". Once those moments pass, you can set it back to 3000.","timestamp_created":1599497276,"timestamp_updated":1599497276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.602028906345367432","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpvHdtPQCfsG0oAI="}
