I managed to get pass through most of the game, but the giant robo beat'em'up mini game in chapter 21 might be the worst content blocker i have ever encountered:\n\n- Controls are janky as hell, very hard to read which action leads to which outcome. Sometimes, it feels like inputs are not registered at all.\n- The fight feels very unbalanced. Some phases can be cheesed by repeating the same action infinitely, in other phases my health bar depleted in a few seconds due to the seemingly unstoppable \"special attack\" of the enemy.\n-  The \"tutorial\"  before the fight does not care if you actually unterstood the fighting mechanics, it just lets you input all possible actions 3 times each and then proceeds. Even worse, the tutorial cannot be repeated once the fight has started even after reloading the game, making it very hard to come back after (rage-)quitting the game.\n- It looks awful and feels anticlimactic. This game has some very sweet pixel art, but the 3D models of the robots are rather ugly. \n- It demands a completely different skillset than the rest of the game. Yes, there already were many mandatory mini games to complete, but these were either pretty easy or at least easy to understand. I have not much \"classic\" beat'em'up experience, and the game did not imply for 15 hours that they would be required to beat the game.","timestamp_created":1609249311,"timestamp_updated":1609249747,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g86w1/YCePa4vgI="}
