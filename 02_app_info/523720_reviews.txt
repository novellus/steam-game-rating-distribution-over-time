Then this wave shooter kind of fits when and where the other wave shooters don't.\n\nSo basically NOT recommended for a teenage gamer with super fast reflexes and a big VR space to move around in, but instead recommended for everyone else : If you're too old, too young, too casual or simply don't have enough VR space to enjoy the other ones.","timestamp_created":1514166005,"timestamp_updated":1514166435,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y8fWxeACd6C0kwE="}
