    review: "This would be a fun game to play.\nThe controls are good, the turn base\
      \ combat is good, interacting with NPC is good, overall it is very enjoyable.\n\
      This would be a fun game to play if there was a Game to play.\nAt 20% complete\
      \ this game will be in Early Access for at least 3 yrs, maybe longer.\nAfter\
      \ 3 yrs something better will come along.  Save your money for that.\n\n04/16/2020\
      \ - The developer Stormtrooper has informed me that they will not make the stated\
      \ 9 months but insures me and I quote, \"But we are sure that the game will\
      \ be released in full release this year (2020)\"\n\n01/07/2021 - Called it.\
      \  The game did not release in 2020 like Stormtrooper (A Dev for the game) promised\
      \ and no reason other than stuff happened was given.  This put the development\
      \ time in the 3 to 4 year time frame I originally quoted.  The major issue here\
      \ is that Stormtrooper is attacking people, who has already purchased the game\
      \ or who wants to purchase the game, on the steam forum for asking legitimate\
      \ questions.  At this time I think it is fair to question the honesty of the\
      \ Devs when it comes to the information they put out about the state of the\
      \ game.  \n\n[b]I DO NOT RECOMMEND SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPERS OR THE PURCHASE\
      \ OF THIS GAME[/b]"
