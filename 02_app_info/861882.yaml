    review: brilliant scenarios, a lot of fun to drive. Nice challenge to drive a
      train with less tractive effort. you actually have to worry about wheel slip
      and locking the breaks in some scenarios. also like how they struggle up steep
      inclines. some spelling errors but worth the money 100%
