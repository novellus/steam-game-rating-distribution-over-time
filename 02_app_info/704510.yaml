    review: 'This game is fun to enjoy.

      Its replayability value is there, but is limited at the moment. I suspect if
      the fan base picks up we should see mods expand this game further. And speaking
      of expanding what I would like to see is more end game content, like say build
      a rocket on the surface and fly home or to a different planet or moon.

      The possibilities are there and I bet this game in its finished state will be
      just as enjoyable, if not more.
