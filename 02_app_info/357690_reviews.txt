I have not re-played this game in a very long time.\n\nOriginal Review\n--------------------------------------------\nThis review is subject to change.\n\n     For a puzzler of its type there is something to be said about the difficulty.  As a casual gamer you may find that most of the levels are easy until you get to that one level which requires an impossible jump.  An hour later you might get lucky and start patting yourself on the back for that silver/gold medal you finally claimed; and on you go to the next level.  However, if you do decide to retry for diamond, you have to be extremely precise, and perhaps gravity-defying.  For those who want to compete, this is a fun game to play.\n     The game is not without its flaws, but I am confident that the developers are going to fix them very soon.  For nearly two hours after installation the game performed horribly at 1920x1080 on an i7-3770k and Radeon HD 6870 (even with all settings on low).  By modding the assets of the game and removing a couple materials the game instantly became playable again.  As it stands I am convinced there there are some necessary optimizations that need to be done, because removing the materials is only a short-term solution and also subtracts from the game's polish.  If you have a more powerful rig than me, then you probably won't have any graphical lag.\n     Another issue I have with this game is the camera shake.  Almost anytime you perform an action the camera will shake violently which makes it very hard to land precise shots while rocket jumping.  I have a hard time keeping my mouse still while under pressure and the camera shake only makes it worse.\n     All that being said, this game is pretty hardcore (and fun).","timestamp_created":1440800053,"timestamp_updated":1600557138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.555717289447784424","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhfio1PQCedLgQw=="}
