      \ /><br>The struggle for survival continues as the year 1989 draws to a close.\
      \ Hope for finding the missing population has started to dwindle, as you and\
      \ your friends continue to do your best to stay away from the invading machines\
      \ and scour abandoned buildings for weapons and equipment. However, recent scouting\
      \ missions that you have conducted on your own and with friends have yielded\
      \ some unexpected results - structures that appear to be made by the FNIX machines\
      \ have started appearing along the Southern Coast of mainland \xD6stert\xF6\
      rn. Thankfully it seems that there are also survivors, scattered across both\
      \ the Southern Coast, the Archipelago and Farmland regions, putting up resistance\
      \ against the invaders.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">EXPANSION PACK FEATURES</h2><strong>ALTERED\

      stert\xF6rn, you discover that the machines have been busy repurposing the landscape\
      \ to fit their needs. Massive walls that make up fortifications, ominously glowing\
      \ generators and the looming cable network are but a few of the structures you\
      \ have sighted while sneaking through the area. Nearby towns are left in ruins\
      \ as Harvesters gather up any resource that can be of use, leaving only the\
      \ shells of buildings that once stood there. It\u2019s unclear what FNIX is\

      \ towns left in ruins and destruction and death everywhere you looked, you are\
      \ now finding individuals who have managed to survive despite the odds. Pockets\
      \ of survivors have managed to bunker down in key locations, utilizing strategic\
      \ positions to stay safe and maximize damage towards the hostile machines. However,\
