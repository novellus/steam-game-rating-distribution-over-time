    review: '[b][u]Game Information[/u][/b]


      "The Agency of Anomalies: Mystic Hospital" Collector''s Edition is a Hidden
      Object Puzzle Adventure game. The game was developed by Orneon and published
      by Big Fish Games Studio.


      "Mystic Hospital" is the first episode of "The Agency of Anomalies."


      Since this is a collector''s edition game, it comes with extra features that
      are not available in its counterpart; the standard edition.


      [b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]


      Game Visuals


      I want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely done. The visuals
      can be adjusted in the game''s option menu.


      Game Audio


      I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio
      is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game''s
      option menu as well.


      Gameplay


      There are two different difficulty game modes to choose from: Regular and Advanced.


      The notebook keeps track of progression in the game. Such as story events and
      clues.


      There is an interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel
      between each location quickly without having the need to constantly backtrack.
      It also indicates that there are a variety of tasks that can be completed at
      various locations within the game. The interactive map is automatically given
      at the start of the game.


      There is padlock no feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in
      place to make it stationary. The inventory panel comes automatically stationary.


      There are some interactive items in-game. Some of the interactive items may
      require extra components before they can be interacted with. All interactive
      items are marked with a symbol in one of the corners.


      The hidden object scenes consist of the following: Traditional word lists and
      Reversed objects. Some of these hidden object scenes may require little or no
      interactions.


      The puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of
      them.


      There is a collectible in the game: Postcards. They are scattered throughout
      the game for the player to find.


      Since this is a collector''s edition game, there is a bonus chapter, but it
      can be accessed only after the main story is completed.


      There are twelve different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the
      game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need
      to be completed before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game
      only.


      Miscellaneous


      The extra contents: Bonus Chapter Soundtracks; Game''s Strategy Guide; Wallpapers
      and Concept Art. Some of these extra features can be accessed only after the
      entire game is completed.


      Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay
      value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game''s
      full price value.'
