And let's not forget the discovery of Max' secret power where she's able to rewind time!\n\nFollowing up on such a rollercoaster is quite challenging per definition and I think episode 2 did a good job in the overall. Obviously they had to considering that this is one of the first chapters we had to pay for. [i]However...[/i] there are some things which I think could have been done a little bit better. For example... Max decides to trust her old friend Chloe and she tells her about her ability to rewind time. She even proves this by witnessing some events, rewinding time and then telling Chloe what is about to happen. So far, so good.\n\n[h1]Inconsistency in the story?[/h1]\n\nChloe is quite enthusiastic and already fantasizes about controlling the world. But for now she settles for Max and herself shooting at some bottles. This should be good because with Max' new power they will never run out of bullets, right?\n\nWell...  that's where I think the game somewhat creates a weird inconsistency. Sure, Max rewinds a few times after Chloe took the shot, but when she does so then Chloe would also forget about ever taking the shot. Ergo: while Max may experience the gun getting fired and then getting \"reloaded\" because of her time shift, Chloe would simply experience them shooting the gun and nothing more.\n\nIt's not wrong or anything, but I thought the whole thing was a bit weirdly executed.\n\n[h1]In conclusion...[/h1]\n\nAlthough this chapter started a bit slow and required some time to really kick in it was a very interesting story nonetheless. What I also really enjoyed was seeing that I actually got confronted with some of the results from my earlier choices. So, some choices which I made in Episode 1 now actually got addressed. Which I think is cool because this makes it a lot more believable that your choices do indeed matter.\n\nThis is a definitely thumbs up from me!","timestamp_created":1577027955,"timestamp_updated":1577048125,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.585307419300079346","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45JXZl+8Ce+OO5gE="}
