      roguelite platformer!</strong><br><br>You've been captured and sent to entertain
      aliens as a gladiator in a faraway planet called Tartarus. You will have to
      advance through randomly generated biomes with deadly traps and monsters blocking
      your path. Choose your opponents in the arenas, beat them for items and coins
      and you might be able to earn your freedom!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1144910/extras/banner_features.png?t=1608193540"

      and fight enemies without taking hits - the only ceiling is your own skillset!<br></li><li>Hundreds
      of hand-crafted rooms that are randomly picked to make every new run feel unique.<br></li><li>50+
      enemies and 10 bosses to beat with different movesets and attack patterns.<br></li><li>300+
      items including pets, weapons and trinkets that unlock new abilities for your
      characters. Pop your heart out to heal yourself, throw meatballs or fire a laser
      gun.<br></li><li>8 unique characters that fit different playstyles, including
      a potato and an alien worm in underpants.<br></li><li>Customize your runs by
      choosing harder paths if you're feeling confident or easier ones if you're on
      the brink of death. High risk, high reward.</li></ul>
