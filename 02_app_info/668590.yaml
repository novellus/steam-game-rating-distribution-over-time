      /><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>DIVE STRAIGHT INTO MADNESS, AND DO IT YOUR WAY</strong></h2>Live
      an all-new adventure set in H.P. Lovecraft''s otherworldy universe, where your
      choices and how you develop your character constantly shape the way your story
      unfolds.<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/668590/extras/coatte_compresso.gif?t=1602868708"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>IMMERSE YOURSELF IN A WORLD FULL OF ATMOSPHERE,
      BROUGHT TOGETHER BY YOUR IMAGINATION</strong></h2>There is quite a lot to see,
      but way more to imagine. We are bringing to the party more than 140,000 words,
      300+ hand-drawn images, and new original tracks. You''ll just have to relax
      and let your mind make the most of those elements to create the perfect composition
      for each part of the adventure.<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/668590/extras/coatte_2_compresso.gif?t=1602868708"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>CHILL AND FOCUS ON THE STORY. THERE WON''T BE ANY
      UNLUCKY DICE ROLLS TO RUIN YOUR DAY</strong></h2>Death is a meaningful concept
      in the Lovecraftian universe, but can also get in the way of telling an interactive
      story. We don''t want to let you down during your adventure, so we decided that
      dying has to be a narrative-driven event. Be careful though, some of your choices
      could have significantly worst consequences than death itself. <br><br><br><img

      1896. You play as Dr. Jake Huntington, and you enlisted in the army to forget
      the loss of your wife, Helen. Yet something ancient and sinister is about to
      overturn your life forever. All the hints seem to converge towards a single
      point: a terrifying disease that threatens to exterminate the entire human race.
      <br><br>To uncover the truth, you''ll have to dive into the shadows that inhabit
      the confines of the human intellect, unveiling the intrigues, the machinations,
      and the subterfuges that are tearing it away from your understanding.<br><br>Many
      challenges, friends, enemies, and mysteries await you, Doctor.<br>Are you ready
