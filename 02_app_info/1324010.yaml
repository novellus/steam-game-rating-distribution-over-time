    review: 'I was on the fence for parts of this game, but in the end I think I really
      like it. It''s definitely horror, and with slightly different handling would
      have felt self-consciously edgy in an obnoxious way, but as it is I''m impressed
      by the tone, which ends up being more melancholic, and even hopeful at times,
      than exactly scary.


      I will say, some of the puzzles were very difficult, especially the ones that
      break the hidden objects pattern. (I think I ended up finding a walkthrough
      for the flower puzzle, for example, because I had no idea what to do) and the
      game seems to expect you to commit everything to memory, even minor details
      not highlighted as having future importance. Your mileage may vary on whether
      that''s annoying or not.


      All in all, I found this a more nuanced game than I generally expect from hospital
      horror. It''s treatment of mental illness is... kind of weird, but not offensive,
      at least to me. There was a period early on where I thought about giving up
      on it, mostly because the aesthetic and slightly clunky translation (I think.
      I did come to appreciate the language by the end, too, but it definitely reads
      like it''s translated from another language) were close to being Too Edgy For
      Me, but in the end I''m glad I stuck it out. Short but satisfying experience.'
