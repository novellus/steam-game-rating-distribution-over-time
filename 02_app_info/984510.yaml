    review: 'This game is sweet! It has a very approachable scope; it takes place
      all in one little town, and there are even sections that take place inside just
      one building! This mitigates the classic adventure game problem of "man which
      one of the NPCs did I forget to talk to?" because there just aren''t that many
      people and you really can just go and talk to all of them.

      There were never any puzzles where the solution felt stupid either, which is
      another adventure game problem. I always felt like "oh yeah duh" whenever I
      finally worked something out. And even if you can''t work out the solution to
      something straight away, going around town and showing all your items to the
      NPCs was nice because they always had something to say about each thing, and
      sometimes react in really neat and unexpected ways.

      Also there''s a crab with buck-teeth and I love him.'
