Yes, that's how bad it is.\n- shitty achievements.","timestamp_created":1608702195,"timestamp_updated":1608702736,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.614425778388977051","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6PaJx/YCc8+uvAI="}
