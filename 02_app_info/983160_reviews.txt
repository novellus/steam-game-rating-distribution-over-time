If you start Online game alone, this is what happens. We are sorry, but this option is there only because of development purposes. We will remove it on the next update, for playing alone we suggest using Local Play and Bots. Only maps currently supporting bots are: Doomsday and Floating Island, this is noted in the update notes.\nWe are still early access and hope you come back later to test newer versions of the game :)"}],"cursor":"AoJ42b3/w/UCfv7fkAI="}
