      game where each button press controls all of the characters on the screen at
      the same time. The main feature of the game is that each character moves relative
      to the direction they are facing. This means that if you instruct the characters
      to move left, they do not move to the left relative to the camera. Instead,
      they move left relative to the direction they are facing. This makes for some
      interesting puzzle situations as you attempt to orchestrate a battle between
      the forces of red, blue, green, and yellow.<h2 class="bb_tag">Modes</h2><br>In

    review: 'A clever puzzle game that gets progressively more challenging as you
      clear levels. I''m currently playing Puzzle Mode, in which you have one or more
      warriors who have to move across an obstacle-laden map, with a goal of reaching
      their same-colored square in an optimal number of moves. Every warrior on the
      map turns / moves the same way when you press a key, which forces you to think
      spatially to get them all to their allotted spaces without wasting moves or
      getting stuck and having to re-start the level, and it can be pretty mind-bending
      when there are multiple warriors on the map. Finishing a level unlocks the next
      no matter how many moves it takes you (good for the impatient), but I found
      it more fun to replay levels until I completed them in the minimal number of
      moves.


      It''s casual yet challenging, and can be played even if you only have a couple
      of free minutes. Fairly priced at $1.99.'
