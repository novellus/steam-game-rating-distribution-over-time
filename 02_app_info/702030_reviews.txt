Funkatronic really know how to make a good VR title.\n\nI only bought this as part of the Funkatronic bundle on steam , owing their other 2 titles (Fuji and the brilliant Cosmic Trip) \n otherwise I'd never have heard of it!.\n\nThis is a great game with tight controls, great challenge and is just good fun to play. \n\nThe game has a kind of \"Crazy Taxi\" style mechanic, where you start off with 60 seconds, but gain time with each fare you pickup, if you deliver them quickly enough you wont lose any time, if you are late, you will be closet to game over.\n\nThe controls are TIGHT - You steer a ufo type ship by titling the controller and using the trigger to rise and letting go to fall - you pick up a variety of rides, some straight A->B trips, some with objectives. Other mechanics such as weight are there, but I won't ruin it.\n\nBrilliant arcade style VR game, well worth a fiver.","timestamp_created":1605829692,"timestamp_updated":1605829692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwppG68fUCdqexrwI="}
