    review: 'Huge fan since the first Crystal Story showed up on Newgrounds and Kongregate.
      This version boasts two new, huge never before seen, updates that add extra
      monsters, quests, bosses and a variety of extras! This also includes the first
      Crystal Story for those looking to have the full story to this point. It''s
      a linear turn-based RPG that has just the right amount of charm to keep you
      hooked to see you through the end. I highly recommend this game to the returning
      fans coming from NG/Kong who''ve played the browser based versions and I can''t
      recommend it enough to anyone who enjoys a flash game made with a lot of love.
      Taking both games into consideration, you''ve got yourself yourself at least
      10-12 hrs of game (minus grinding equips to max) with a rather silly cast of
      heroes as they embark on a journey to discover who is behind the invasion of
      the Dargons! (yes, Dargons!)


      Two great games for under $5.00? Great! Plenty of achievements? Awesome! Trading
      Cards? Awesome! What are you waiting for?!


      And as if you couldn''t get enough, Crystal Story: The Hero and the Evil Witch
      is available now!'
