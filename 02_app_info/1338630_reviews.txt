The AI on these is somehow even worse than regular dwarves.  The hover-guy routinely gets stuck on everything - which is absurd since he can fly.  The werewolf is somehow a worse fighter than regular dwarves, and regularly gets stuck trying to find his way to... anything.  I've had to manually save him from basic things like spiders on more than one occasion.  I've only tried one other so far, a mage, and I ended up restarting the game for an unrelated reason, so I don't have any way to tell if they're any better than the other two I've tried thus far, but I somehow doubt it.\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nSome of the heroes are so over-powered they make this worth the two bucks, even though there are some heroes you'll NEVER want to make.\n\n    Example 1:  The guy that makes portals will cast the spell that gathers up all the materials on the floor - that's insanely useful.  \n\n    Example 2:  The dryad that walks around and makes trees is really handy as well.\n\n\nI still haven't crafted them all, but for the price, the amount of stupidly good utility they provide does make it worth it--provided you either NEVER craft some of the heroes, or you are prepared to babysit the stupid ones.","timestamp_created":1609965573,"timestamp_updated":1610141035,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4n8348fYCcq+NwQI="}
