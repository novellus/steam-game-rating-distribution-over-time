    about_the_game: "In Diluvian Ultra(Demo) you play as Atilla, an undead king that\
      \ is awakened in deep space, aboard his tomb, ship by an invasion of unknown\
      \ enemies. He must fight to prevent them from stealing his most sacred object:\
      \ The Book of Life. Without the book, Attila\u2019s order can\u2019t revive\
      \ the long dead human species.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe spaceship is a living\
      \ combination of flesh and stone, teaming with creatures created to serve a\
      \ purpose aboard the ship. Even the doors are alive.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDiluvian\
      \ Ultra(Demo) is built around a damage system where you have to combine weapons\
      \ to be effective. Armor negates most damage, but some weapons are designed\
      \ to damage only the armor itself, setting the victim up for a lethal blow.\
      \ The player has to be careful, as enemies will combine their attacks in the\
      \ same way. Armor damage cannot kill you, but take too much and a single well\
      \ placed lethal attack will kill you in one hit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCombat in\
      \ Diluvian Ultra(Demo) is all about mobility. Dodge enemy fire, while you chain\
      \ together ranged attacks with close combat blows and devastating ground slams\
      \ to interrupt and stun your enemies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe weapons range from\
      \ living insect guns, to plasma spewing shotguns. Each has a unique special\
      \ reload function, like healing armor damage or turning the magazine into a\
      \ grenade."
