    review: "First things first, i love this game. I put hours upon hours upon hours\
      \ in to it filled with nothing but pure joy and ecstasy. This game has been\
      \ an amazing addition to my life, helped me through some dark times. I've only\
      \ ever played 2 games i've put this amount of time, effort and love in to; Shadow\
      \ of The Colossus, and Put In - Run Out. This game is amazing, so with a heavy\
      \ heart I say these words.\n\nI CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME.\n\nThis game could've\
      \ been so much more. The bustling E-Sports scene got absolutely no support from\
      \ the devs, in fact the only updates ever implemented hindered the athletes\
      \ and hampered the overall experience of the game. And that was when the devs\
      \ atleast tried to update the game. Ruskija Game Experience has completely abandoned\
      \ this game, leaving the most adamant of supporters in the wind to fend for\
      \ themselves. This game had the potential to be the next Fortnite killer, but\
      \ instead it just ended up becoming another game abandoned and forgotten by\
      \ the devs and players alike.\n\nMy friends and I used to have so much fun with\
      \ the online portion of this game, wether it was casual or competitive the gameplay\
      \ was smooth and responsive. The netcode of this game has only gotten worse\
      \ and worse, the servers have been abandoned by the devs and they left the players\
      \ to create the servers themselves. I HATE THE DEVS OF THIS GAME, THEY RUINED\
      \ EVERYTHING!\n\nI miss all the good times I used to have in this game, to those\
      \ who may have gotten the game recently, if you truly enjoy the game, great!\
      \ It's an amazing game, but when you've seen what it could've been, you've gone\
      \ to hell and back.... :(\n\nAll in all, this game is a FUCKING PIECE OF $HIT!\
      \ I WISH, I COULDVE HAD MORE TIME WITH THIS GAME WHEN IT WAS THE AMAZING LITTLE\
      \ JEWEL IT WAS BUT NO! THE DEVS JUST HAD TO FUDGING GO AND RUIN IT WITH THEIR\
      \ PETTY LITTLE GREEDY HANDS... IF I HAD THE CHANCE TO GO BACK IN TIME I WOULD\
      \ TELL MYSELF NEVER TO PLAY THIS GAME, BECAUSE ALL THAT WAS WAITING FOR ME WAS\
      \ PAIN, AND ANGUISH AND HURT! \n\nF*UCK I HATE THESE DEVS! \nI HATE HUMANITY!"
