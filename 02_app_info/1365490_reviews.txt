Well worth it and wanted to support by buying Stellaren 2 that was released on steam. This is a very underrated series. Story is intriguing, players becomes attached to the characters and the flow going from each game in the Stellaren series was enjoyable. Art and music is nice. Atmospheric sound is great. This English VN is well worth the money considering also the number of hours you spend on it. I think it was around 15 hours when I played this particular one but take in mind that I am a very fast reader. Looking forward to the new game ninedux is currently making. Keep it up man!\n\nPersonally, I recommend reading Stellaren, Stellaren: Acrux, before moving to this Stellaren 2 as you really appreciate the story more. They are on mobile for free as well. Enjoy.","timestamp_created":1608231845,"timestamp_updated":1608231845,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yM+FufYCdZiBuwI="}
