    about_the_game: "<strong>unWorded </strong>is an innovative Narrative Puzzle Game\
      \ where everything is built from letters. Use your imagination to create objects\
      \ by assembling letters together and discover the story of a writer hospitalized\
      \ after a serious accident...<br><br>Dive into his damaged mind and experience\
      \ his inner creative world through strange and wondrous tales. Help the writer\
      \ reassemble his memory and thoughts in this narrative text-based puzzler. Think\
      \ outside of the box, drag letters and signs around on the canvas to form pictures\
      \ worth thousand words. Divided into five books tracing back the author memories,\
      \ Unworded is a unique, emotionally-engaging and story-driven indie masterpiece\
      \ that appeals to the inner workings of human complex minds with its poetic\
      \ and dreamlike puzzles full of letters.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Artistic statement</h2>unWorded\
      \ is born from a profound love for typography. Letters not only convey meaning\
      \ but can also bring a strong sense of space. We asked ourselves if we could\
      \ build an entire world out of simple letters? How would it look like? What\
      \ feeling would we get, if we were to immerse ourselves in such an universe?!\
      \ With that came along the desire to dive into a writer's head and his thoughts,\
      \ to see how memories form themselves to bubble up to the conscient mind. We\
      \ finally chose a very simple but engaging gameplay experience, assembling letters\
      \ to create objects, each one triggering an important memory of the author.\
      \ One key aspect for us was the intimacy the player would experience with the\
      \ writer, actively participating in his introspection. <br><br>We really wanted\
      \ to tell a story about feelings and thoughts through unWorded. The game deals\
      \ with the subject of grief, it is something we all have to go through but that\
      \ not easy to discuss. The player would have to live each phase of grief along\
      \ with the author: shock and denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance.\
      \ The unWorded story is about a children's book writer, who was just hospitalized\
      \ after a serious accident. As his wife at his bedside reads to him fairy tales\
      \ of his own creations, you dive into his mind, sharing his last thoughts as\
      \ he reminisces about his life and past works, standing with him at the death's\
      \ door!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The unWorded team</h2>Bento has been making mobile\
      \ games since 2010. Based in Lyon, the team is made of two passionate individuals\
      \ who were brought together by a common project: making original and creative\
      \ games. Benoit breathes life in the games, making art, sounds and musics, while\
      \ S\xE9verin gets the engine running with his programming. With unWorded the\
      \ Bento team accomplishes their long-awaited dream of doing a narrative game\
      \ conveying a truly meaningfull story!"
