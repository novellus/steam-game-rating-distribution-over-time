Customisation of leagues, purchasing OP robots, smart AI. This game has many features that you'd certainly enjoy.\n\nI bought this game without having a clue as to what I'd spent my money on. I got in, and played the tutorial which, I must add, was very intuitive and helpful. After completing the tutorial I went onto knockout mode and chose the easy AI. At first I couldn't beat them. But after 30mins of playing I was able to enjoy the thrill of murdering robots. The smell of oil is good.\n\nThis game is NOT about sports. Its strictly strategy. So if you like strategy, you'll love this.\n\nGive it a go. :D","timestamp_created":1424457802,"timestamp_updated":1590763947,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.664572179317474365","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v/C6sPICc4PHNw=="}
