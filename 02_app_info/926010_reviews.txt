From what I saw, the game reminded me of Wolfeinstein. A game I spent a lot of time on. Still missing it today. \n\nThought this might be my time to relive it. Maybe you could set dates for those interested in the game, so there were people where at certain timesin the servers, the enthusiasts could play against others. But it didnt happened, I could not even log in, tried three times. Patience is something I do not have. Thanks and hello, back to my other games.","timestamp_created":1609315564,"timestamp_updated":1609315564,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwnter2fYCce3avgI="}
