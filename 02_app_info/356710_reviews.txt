The barriers are force-fields which allow units and damage to only pass one way. Often you have to be careful when entering a space as you will not be able to see if there are enemies within.\n\nIt is like a maze, uncovering rooms as you move along the best route you can see.\n\nI like that the units have different benefits, so I often split my band ...each with a scout and an assault drone. The scout moving forward and disrupting enemy weapons/flipping barriers with the assault then following to destroy enemy units. Heavies are good for clearing heavily defended rooms.\n\nI like that the game is side-view rather than top-down. You have to consider which rooms to advance into, cover, barriers, sight etc. It just seems like a more effective way to present an area than top-down, reagardless; it works very well for this game.\n\nI like the backgrounds.\n\nYou can upgrade drones to have different abilities or fulfil certain tasks. I always unlock hacking and pick the best disrupter for scouts and increase clip capacity and unlock mines for the assaults. Accuracy improvement would be a good idea for heavies.\n\nA really fun strategy game.\n","timestamp_created":1427900208,"timestamp_updated":1427900208,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.638507306575775146","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuILfuswCeZ/oOQ=="}
