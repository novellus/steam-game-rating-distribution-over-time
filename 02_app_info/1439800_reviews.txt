Despite its simplicity and shortness, it definitely was worth the money (it's not really that expensive at all), the sounds are pleasant, the design is pretty to the eye and not lacking at all. I definitely would recommend it to anyone who is thinking of actually buying a fun yet relaxing experience, if you're thinking of buying this game, go for it!\n\nEdit: Just finished this little game and I can safely say that still, for its price, it is still as worth it as you could imagine. Definitely grab it if you enjoy ASMR, especially if you come across it on sale! I'll definitely re-play it once I feel like it, it did not take me too long to finish it without rushing it at all. (Slightly over one hour at its easiest difficulty.)","timestamp_created":1607312783,"timestamp_updated":1607569589,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sKinpfYCf+jytwI="}
