    review: "This game is mind numbingly bad in almost every possible way.\n\nStoryline\
      \ is childish and poorly written and since it's completely text based the spelling\
      \ and grammar mistakes are just glaringly obvious. (I wouldn't care that it's\
      \ text based, but get someone to check your spelling and grammar, please)\n\n\
      It acts like you have some freedom, but you really don't; the story is linear,\
      \ you move your ship in a very straight forward planet to planet progression\
      \ or you fail. Most of your time is spent reading background story for each\
      \ planet or hailing new people just to listen to them spout drivel that is poorly\
      \ written and just has no value to what your goals are.\n\nYou'll meet a new\
      \ species and get pages of text that amount to: \"We are is the guys that do\
      \ crawl from water aned will be the eating you todday, ok? Do you agree?\"\n\
      \nYou either agree and the game ends, or you fight. Rinse and repeat for about\
      \ 2 hours until the game is over. I'm not joking. Short game filled with bad\
      \ dialogue, linear hand holding and nothing of real interest happens. Oh, and\
      \ to add insult to injury, the combat mechanics are stupid.\n\nBefore each fight\
      \ you pick a simplistic loadout. Would you like to use shield 1, 2 or 3 today?\
      \ Would you like to use computer 1, 2 or 3 today? Would you like to use engine\
      \ 1, 2 or 3 today? Again: not joking, this is what the equipment in the game\
      \ is called. The only minor attempt at strategy comes from picking which weapon\
      \ you will use, either short, medium or long range and through trial and error\
      \ (fail and reload) you'll figure out which weapon type works against each alien\
      \ race. The problem is it just doesn't matter, once you die and figure out you\
      \ need a different weapon type you just kind of win. There's no strategy beyond\
      \ that involved. You don't even have control over shooting in this game. Combat\
      \ is just floating in a direction while aiming, the ship auto-fires for you\
      \ at whatever enemy you select. If you have the right weapon to hit their speed\
      \ and flight pattern you'll win, if you don't you will fail, change weapons\
      \ and try again. \n\nAnd that's the entire game. Bad writing in a childish storyline\
      \ punctuated by boring combat and lackluster strategy choices; and even if it\
      \ was a good game (and it's not), it's so short you'll barely notice it exists.\
      \ If you see me with more than 2 hours played on this game it's because I decided\
      \ to idle it and get the steam cards, or I'm drunk and hate myself enough to\
      \ get 100% achievements just to prove I can. \n\nIf you want a real testament\
      \ to how bad this game is, take one look at the world statistics for achievement\
      \ completion. The achievement with the highest completion rating is 4%. That\
      \ means 96% of the people who own this game do not complete the very first achievement.\n\
      \nYou can reach the first achievement (a boy and his goat) after playing less\
      \ than 5 minutes of the game and without effort or combat, all you need to do\
      \ is click through some storyline and fly to the very first planet (the only\
      \ one on your map, you can't miss it). That means 96% of the people who own\
      \ this game have not even played it for 5 minutes.\n\nThose people were smart\
      \ enough to see how bad the game was and just shut it off. I hate myself enough\
      \ to keep playing longer than that, but I don't recommend anyone else be this\
      \ much of a masochist. \n\nJust to add further insult to those who buy it: the\
      \ game asks you from the moment you launch it whether you want to play act 1\
      \ or act 2. The developers never bothered to make act 2. So even pretending\
      \ this was a good game, it was half a game and then abandoned and it will remind\
      \ you of this every time you start it up. So even forcing yourself to \"finish\"\
      \ puts you half way through this very bad story that never ends.\n\nThis is\
      \ one of those games that make steam look bad for even allowing it to be sold\
      \ in the store.\n---\n\nEDIT: This game currently has 6 positive reviews out\
      \ of 56, but the store page summary at the top says it only has 6 reviews total\
      \ and won't post its positive/mixed/negative summary. (which should be glaringly\
      \ negative)\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While\
      \ you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want\
      \ to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]"
