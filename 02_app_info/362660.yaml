    review: "Even though I'm marking my review as not recommended, I want to make\
      \ clear that the game isn't TERRIBLE by any means. I really like the art (especially\
      \ the background art - I know nobody buys VNs for the backgrounds art, but this\
      \ is legit the most gorgeous background art in any VN I've played). The world\
      \ has interesting lore, not quite as fleshed out as I would have liked it but\
      \ interesting nonetheless. The heroine Lena's relationship with the antagonist\
      \ is actually very well-written, and I really enjoyed the complexity of it.\
      \ Unfortunately, in my opinion that relationship is the most interesting one\
      \ in the game. The romance routes were mediocre at best. Gavin's was the most\
      \ interesting, as he had a bit of character development and backstory that paired\
      \ very well with Lena's. The others, though, were a bit flat and not really\
      \ memorable (Simon and Lena don't even really get overt romance). The writing\
      \ also drags a bit in some parts, especially where you're \"choosing\" the one\
      \ location on the map that's available. \n\nAgain, overall, it wasn't irredeemable,\
      \ and if you're a VN fan and/or fantasy story fan there might be something here\
      \ for you (although I'd recommend picking it up on sale like I did - sixteen\
      \ dollars would have been a lot when I really only enjoyed the art, one love\
      \ interest, and the antagonist). Even though I didn't ~love~ this, I'll be looking\
      \ at the developer's next project to see if it's something I'm interested in."
