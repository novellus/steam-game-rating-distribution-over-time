It was great game for that price, theres not much offered in it, I believe we only played 2 games of the local multiplayer and it was already repeating questions. It does have a couple othere gamemodes like, \"Which country does this flag belong to?\", I personally believe those should be added into the regular trivia game and not be their own seperate gamemode. Another little thing that should be added would be sounds for answering the question right and wrong, as well as sounds for if time is running out, you didn't answer, etc. Needs alot of work. Overall the content is just not there yet, I'm glad I only spent what I did on this.","timestamp_created":1515568870,"timestamp_updated":1515568870,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541415274143218994","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwp7a87+ACeovRlQE="}
