    about_the_game: River Relaxation VR is a relaxing hands-free virtual reality simulation
      of calmly floating down a river in a kayak. The simulation includes both a &quot;morning&quot;
      and &quot;night time&quot; experience of the same river.<br><br>Watch the trees
      gently sway as the birds sing and circle overhead while the kayak takes you
      through sun and shade. Listen to the water trickle from the waterfalls down
      into the river as butterflies hover over bending flowers. Challenge yourself
      to stay awake while the crickets chirp, the fireflies dance and the full moon
      lights up a darkened river.<br><br>You may configure the audio levels and kayak
      speed by turning your head to the back of the kayak and looking at the first
      two soda cans on the left in the cooler. Look at a can for one full second to
      bring up a panel with buttons you can look at to configure settings and dismiss
      the panel.<br><br>River Relaxation VR runs for approximately 25 minutes before
      auto-replaying itself. To end the simulation, either press the Escape key or
      turn your head to the back of the kayak and look directly at the last soda can
      on the right, and then at the confirmation button.<br><br>River Relaxation VR
      is a 100% <strong>hands-free kayak-on-rails</strong> simulation. Paddling or
      any other controlling of the kayak is not supported.

    review: 'The quality is very poor. Possibly it''s worth the money on sale, but
      I would suggest you save up your money for something more impressive. Ambient
      sounds are sparse. Graphic quality is super low. What bothered me the most was
      bizarre things in the world: poplar trees a metre across, a glossy wet rock
      surrounded by dry rocks, big trees growing out of solid rock, waterfalls with
      no splash or foam, water sections joined with visible seams, blocky objects,
      a single burned tree trunk, and some things we just can''t identify. I wasn''t
      relaxed. I was looking around wondering ''why?'' and thinking how much it looked
      like a bunch of Skyrim assets tossed together.'
