Once upon a time, it was nearly $7. I tried it then, and gave up.\n\nTrue to my nature, I picked this back up 4 years later and it's still awful. There is no horror at all. Normally these sorts of games are supposed to create a suspenseful atmosphere or build up to something. Nope. \n\nYou're just plopped down in the woods with a flashlight and terribad combat mechanics with no explanation or guidance. I mean, I don't need a lot of guidance when I have an axe and there is a bad guy, but some sort of actual story(beyond the store page) would have been appreciated. \n\nMy biggest problem is that I just can't get into the game. I've played games that were poorly optimized or had corny jump scares and all the hallmarks of bad games, but they at least had something to pull me in right at the beginning and keep me interested. This didn't do that for me at all. Bummer. :( \n\nI wanted to like this game after giving it some time to be patched, but it still fell short of what a horror game should be. Not scary. Not interesting. Not for me. \n\nSorry, friends. <3","timestamp_created":1606219377,"timestamp_updated":1606219377,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.606557369232177734","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ltWI/fUCeIydsAI="}
