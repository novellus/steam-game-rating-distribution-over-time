A song for each of the six stages plus two for the intro and the final boss fight. All 8 of them available in both .flac and .mp3 formats. But it does seem to be on the pricier side compared to the main soundtrack which has over 3x as many songs. Recommended to grab on a sale...\n\n[b]P.S.:[/b] You can press Download Album in the Soundtracks section of the library filter and then find it in \"..\\Steam\\steamapps\\music\\Trine 4 Melody of Mystery Soundtrack\". Or in the game directory if it downloaded with your game.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this DLC review you can find more in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]","timestamp_created":1609183326,"timestamp_updated":1609183326,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.55921638011932373","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw852z1fYCfsiZvgI="}
