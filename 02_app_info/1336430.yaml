    review: "Fun game, definitely worth the price. \nIt's a zombie killing game and\
      \ it doesn't try to be anything more. There is no artificial difficulty where\
      \ zombies gain more health as the waves progress, only more types of interesting\
      \ zombies that are original in design.\nThe upgrade system between waves is\
      \ simple and rewarding but you may find that some upgrades aren't worth taking\
      \ over others.\nThe animations are so well blended into the greyscale environment,\
      \ everything is clear and easy to see.\nGood music too.\n\n\n\n\n"
