      you, and nurse you back to health.  The king himself is kind enough to allow
      you to stay on a piece of abandoned property to make your living.  With nothing
      more than a few rusty tools turn strike out and attempt to breathe life back

    review: "I not going Lie I like playing Verdant village I played demo on Itch.io\
      \ and it was very cool.\n\nOn steam its bit more developed then I previously\
      \ thought. I hoping to see more of developments. \nHunting -> Fishing -> Exploration\
      \ -> Magical events at night that probably not at your farm.\n\nLike: I like\
      \ forest it pretty amazing and Swamp it reminds eye for detail. But then relaxation\
      \ comes to mind when you play and gather. \n\nDislike: ??\nPersonal Opinion:\
      \ ??"
