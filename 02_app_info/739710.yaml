    review: I recommend this game for the effort and for the general fun mechanics,
      but mostly so the developers will work on it and improve it. It might be different
      for me with the Samsung Odyssey, but I have the hardest time getting bowling
      balls to the bosses, so the game kinda just goes on forever. It would be great
      if it had a few more weapons, or maybe some kind of auto-aiming setup, or something
      to clear up the monotony. However, it's simple and good for the price.
