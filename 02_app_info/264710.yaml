      /><br><br>You have crash-landed on an alien ocean world, and the only way to
      go is down. Subnautica''s oceans range from sun drenched shallow coral reefs
      to treacherous deep-sea trenches, lava fields, and bio-luminescent underwater
      rivers. Manage your oxygen supply as you explore kelp forests, plateaus, reefs,
      and winding cave systems. The water teems with life: Some of it helpful, much
      of it harmful.<h2 class="bb_tag">Scavenge, Craft, and Survive</h2><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/264710/extras/HeadingDivider.png?t=1609982984"

      /><br><br>After crash landing in your Life Pod, the clock is ticking to find
      water, food, and to develop the equipment you need to explore. Collect resources
      from the ocean around you. Craft diving gear, lights, habitat modules, and submersibles.
      Venture deeper and further form to find rarer resources, allowing you to craft
