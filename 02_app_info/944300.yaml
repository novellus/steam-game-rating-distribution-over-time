    about_the_game: "In 1978, a unique machine started showing up in arcades all around\
      \ the world. With its distinctive gameplay and state of the art vector graphics\
      \ projected over a raster display, it quickly became a major hit. In 1979 more\
      \ quarters were dropped in the coin boxes of Byte Driver than all of that year\u2019\
      s other machines put together.    <br><br>Sadly, the combination display was\
      \ notoriously failure prone and arcade operators found their upkeep difficult.\
      \ By 1981 the last known Byte Driver machine went offline. Since then the whole\
      \ craze has been largely forgotten.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">What is Byte Driver?</h2>\
      \  <br><br>Byte Driver combines a classic driving game with a bottom up shooter.\

    review: 'What a hidden gem!

      Hard and classic gameplay with retro graphics.

      Once you got the hang of the controls it becomes really enjoyable.

      I recommend a controller, it feels way more natural to play.
