I totally understand its a one man dev and there for sure is nice work. But there is a ton of things missing (even for E.A.) like sound effects, music and story. You just start the game out of nowhere.\n\nBut my main problem was the movement and swordplay. Its just way to slow. He moves like you just want to push him on, his sprinting is a trot but it helps a little. The turning though is just horrific, slow isnt even the word and the directional combat is barely existent, but is made more so by the slow movement/turning. You will find yourself spacebar pushing continuously just to move or get turned around.\n\nIts got promise but it really needed to launch with more, even for E.A. I think if it wasnt for the sound effects missing and the nightmarish movement and turning speed plus the frustrating directional combat.... i would have liked this game.","timestamp_created":1567463914,"timestamp_updated":1567464160,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwsJ+J+uwCedPK0QE="}
