The bridges and catenary, especially in Manchester, look pretty cool.  The scenery is pretty nice to look at and the cities are quite fun to see.\n\nTrains: The 158 is not much different from previous releases of the 158.  It sounds as good as a DMU can be expected to sound.  I'm not a major fan of it, but it's an alright train for this line.  \n\nRoute: From Manchester you go on a cool brick bridge with views of the city and some pretty nice stations to boot.  It's slow but it does pick up once you pass the stadium.  After that there's a long boring straightaway; it feels like a chore to drive this section.  The midpoint at Warrington has a brick bridge and is curved, giving you a nice view of the town.  Beyond that is another straightaway that is not particularly scenic.  There's a ramp that takes you to a mainline section that then leads straight to the tunnel right into Liverpool Lime Street.  If there's a highlight, it's the endpoints and the middle; the rest is just more boring.  \n\nScenarios: These basically introduce you to the route.  I haven't found any gamebreaking issues with them.  They're alright overall.","timestamp_created":1605741084,"timestamp_updated":1605741084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1o/o7vUCfZaarwI="}
