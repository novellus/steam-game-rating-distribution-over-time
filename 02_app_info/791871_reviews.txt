It's not really as scary as I had hoped for but I think they went more for a family experience rather than a horror experience. \n\nA goofy but fun halloween rollercoaster, there's not much else to it :)","timestamp_created":1602324863,"timestamp_updated":1602324863,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gaOAifUCcMH+pgI="}
