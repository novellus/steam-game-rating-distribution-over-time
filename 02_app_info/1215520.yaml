    review: 'The main goal is to get to the end of each level and optionally, get
      3 gems and rescue a captive or get a piece of some type of medallion that I''ve
      not completed yet. It is similar to the games Sword of Xolan (mobile) or Devious
      Dungeons 1 & 2 (mobile and PC). We need a name for this sub-genre.


      I have completed all of the above, and this one compares favorably to them.
      The levels seem a bit longer to me and definitely more difficult, and the action
      is a bit slower. There is a good amount of jumping from moving platforms over
      saw blades and things like that. Those are actually more of a challenged than
      the enemies. The controls are fine and I really have no complaints about anything.
      There are checkpoints in the longer levels.


      I bought it on sale at release for about $2. It''s now $10. I ''m not sure I
      would pay $10 for any game like this, including the ones mentioned above. But
      it is well done and fun. It''s up to you if it''s worth the price.'
