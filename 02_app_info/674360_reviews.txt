It's completly broken and an utter disaster.  \nMovement controls are horrid at best. Clicking on cubes doesn't register most of the time.\nNo visual clue to re-enable cubes you've disabled.  \nAnd there's no way to predict which direction the orb will go, since all the cubes look exactly the same.\nI guess they were trying to recoup the lack of sales on their last game.\nInstant refund.","timestamp_created":1507267988,"timestamp_updated":1507293239,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571428537368774414","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1551828916,"developer_response":"It is actually very easy to predict the direction the orb will go.  If you toggle a cube off, the orb will simply follow a straight path from its previous cube.  If you toggle the cube back on, it will go the direction that the cube had previously altered it to go.  So, the way you solve a puzzle is by looking at the current path that the orb takes.  If a cube is causing the orb to go left, and you want it to go straight, simply toggle off that cube.  If you later decide that was a mistake, toggle the cube back on.  Regarding clicking on the cubes, you do have to be near a cube for it to toggle.  The reason for this is that it is a true 3d maze, so you have to fly to the cube you want to toggle.  It actually is a fun puzzle game but that's my opinion of course."}],"cursor":"AoJ47bLr+N4Ce/66hwE="}
