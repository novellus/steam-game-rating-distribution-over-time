    about_the_game: 'Drive a kart, a racing car or a offroad car (currently only kart)
      on different locations (currently 10 racetracks) in first person driver view
      only.   Each car has his own dynamic physics, behavior and racetracks.  Complete
      quests like getting a good racetime or for example slalom driving (planned).  Complete
      the quest for one ractrack to unlock the next racetrack (planned). As further
      you come as more powerfull will the cars get (planned). Per example you start
      with a 25PS  kart and in the end you drive a 250PS superkart (planned).   <br><br><img

      /><br><br>You can drive the cars with keyboard (WASD or Arrow keys , R restart
      track , 1-9 for radio , /*-+ for volume control). Its a development focus that
      you can drive good with keyboard. Gamepads and steering wheel are also planned
      to be supported. (Update: Steering Wheel + Force Feedback works now according
      to player feedback)<br><br>In moment the game is focused on singleplayer only.
      Multiplayer racing will maybe added later. Content can be missing, added or
      removed while in development. How the game looks finally at the end of the development
      is open.  There will be frequent updates while in development (see update thread
      in discussions) and you can watch the game grow.  Any comments or sugestions
      in discussions are welcome. When you found any bugs it would be nice when you
      can report them in discussions.<br><br>The game is being developed on a Ryzen
      5 1600 processor with a AMD 570rx graphic card. The graphic card is reduced
      to 50%  performance in AMD driver settings. So the game can run on less powerfull
      systems. The 3dmark11 performance benchmark score is P9126. The final requirements
      will be settled when the game is finished developed, but will not exceed the
      developer system.'
