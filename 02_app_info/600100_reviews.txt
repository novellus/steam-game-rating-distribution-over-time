If the NHL license is a big deal for you then you may want to skip this. You can edit the names and such, but why bother when there's a much deeper hockey simulation with the NHL license in Franchise Hockey Manager 5. This game may be fine for a casual hockey simulation, but unless they make massive additions to it, it's not in depth enough for me personally.","timestamp_created":1557598390,"timestamp_updated":1557598433,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542168676853179932","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ47r2G1OoCfO2AwQE="}
