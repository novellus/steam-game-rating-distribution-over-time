      /><br><br><strong>Kebab it Up!</strong> is a highly difficult running game in
      which you have to avoid obstacles and finish levels by strafing or using one
      of the handy abilities: jumping, dashing to break the obstacles, or the less
      destructive approach: sliding under obstacles. However, you must only use your
      abilities when necessary.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/745400/extras/Only-For-The-Brave.png?t=1608234733"
      /><br><br>The game comes with plenty of challenging levels that will put your
      reaction time and muscle memory to the test in the streets of Bucharest, filled
      with obstacles such as cars parked on the sidewalk, hardworking guys carrying
      glass panes and many more.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/745400/extras/Not-Convinced-Yet.png?t=1608234733"
      /><br><br>You play as <strong>Sherban</strong>, a regular middle age guy who
      is the main protagonist of the game and has a crazy love for kebabs and expensive
      suits.<br>In a hurry to work, Sherban decided to make a stop at his favorite
      fast-food and ordered a tasty kebab, then bit into it like a starving barbarian.
      He couldn''t believe what happened next. The kebab jumped from his hands and
      started running desperately. Being hungry and late to work, he wanted to buy
      a new one, then realized that his wallet was empty. His last hope was to run
      after the kebab.'
