    review: "A fun but challenging game where you have to navigate through each level\
      \ and rescue your mates. no killing.\nbut watch out for the cave walls to many\
      \ hits and your ship will explode. \n\nuse your arrow keys to navigate up and\
      \ down are the same but left arrow key is right and right arrow key is left\
      \ when navigating with \nyour spaceship. Also watch out for the timer - first\
      \ few levels are easy but once you get further in the game its gets a bit more\
      \ challenging, can you navigate in a timely matter. or will you explode with\
      \ frustration.."
