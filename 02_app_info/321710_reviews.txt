Controls take some time to understand, if only because they seem EXTREMELY sensitive. Also, I’m not sure my spacial awareness is all that great. Seem to get a bit of vertigo. As such, I cannot really describe the game more than a multiple ways to crash simulator.\n\nAlso since it is a older game, the graphics are not up to today’s standards.","timestamp_created":1598007612,"timestamp_updated":1598007612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548387110233306885","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpqKriPQCedHnnAI="}
