    about_the_game: <strong>Fear of spiders?</strong><br><br>Arachnophobia is a VR
      application within the field of health and psychology, a - not too serious -
      self-controlled implementation of a virtual reality exposure therapy session,
      where you gradually expose yourself to spiders.<br><br>Virtual reality exposure
      therapy is a psychological approach to learn dealing with irrational fears of
      a specific object (phobia) by ways of systematic desensitization.  <br><br>By
      generating enough phobic stress while immersed in a virtual reality environment,
      psychological effects can be invoked that will dampen your phobia over time.
      It is a scientifically proven and therapeutic procedure to help people deal
      with their phobia.<br><br>In this VR experience you will be seated at a table
      in a small apartment. By looking at specific spots on a piece of paper in front
      of you, you will be able to control the amount of exposure to virtual spiders.
      You can increase or decrease the number of spiders in the room yourself. You
      will not be able to move your virtual arms in the experience.<br><br>There are
      5 levels of exposure in this virtual reality experience.<br><br><strong>You
      may quit at any time!</strong><br><br>It is advised to install yourself into
      a sitting position and put your arms on the table in front of you just like
      your virtual avatar in the scene. This way your brain will create an psychological
      association between the virtual arms of the avatar and your own arms in the
      real world ( rubber hand illusion ). This will improve the possible psychological
      effects by increasing immersion.

    review: 'As a trained psychotherapist, working with anxiety and exposure this
      application is completely inapprioprate. It is not an accurate reflection of
      what virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) should be. Nor is it an accurate
      representation of exposure in general. This VRET system is potentially harmful
      to any one with clinical or subclinical levels of anxiety. I would NOT recommend
      this to a client and if I did I would open myself up to legal action due to
      the potentially psychologically harmful content within (i.e., the ''warning''
      page and the entire antidote thing).


      Also to the delivers, please learn the different between rubber hand illusion
      and general and other proprioception illusions. (You can could both from this
      environment - not that you do - but what is described is a general proprioception
      illusion).'
