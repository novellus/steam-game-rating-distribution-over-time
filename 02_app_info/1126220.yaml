    review: 'Really fun and the midi support gives endless possibilities.

      I was sceptical about the pattern generation at first, but it''s really well
      done.

      The sound is one of the best digital piano sounds I''ve ever heard.

      As someone who plays a lot of rhythm games competitively and for fun, I can
      tell you it has most of the features you''ll need and is unique enough that
      it''s worth the try.

      Don''t bother looking at any negative reviews before 3 november 2020 since it''s
      got a mayor update fixing a lot of problems and adding a lot of new stuff.

      definitely worth a try if you want something new or like piano games.'
