I played Conception 2 and loved that game as well. If you are coming from Conception 2 first then you will notice some changes but you have to keep in mind that this game is a remaster of the original game. It means it may not have all of the things and features from the second game. Conception Plus has enjoyable combat and I love the story as well as the interactions with the characters. I also like that this game has English audio and I love it. One downside I do have to say is that you can't fight with the heroines in the labyrinths like you do in conception 2 but again this game came before conception 2 so that is understandable.","timestamp_created":1609827234,"timestamp_updated":1609827234,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjcbL6PYCe//OwAI="}
