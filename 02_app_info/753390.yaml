      \ by your part, the only person that i faced and treated patiently, and cost\
      \ me a lot.\n\nYou don't break any rule, but you just treating me and my game\
      \ like garbage, and i will not accept that, at least, i have respect to left\
      \ your review here, and let the people know about the things, and keep working\
      \ until maybe one day, your review turn possitive, because at least i keep going\
      \ foward and solving problems.\n\nYou are hateful, not for being critical, but\
      \ for being disrespectful to me, i'm still here working, and talking with valve.\n\
      \nIf you have never been treated so poorly as a customer like that, i never\
      \ been treated this bad by a customer.  I know it was a bad decision, and i\
      \ solved it.\n\nIf you show me, that i'm wrong, and that you have some respect\
      \ at me and the game. i will not only unban you, but also you gain my respect,\
      \ because i still thinking you are great at criticism like you show in your\
      \ reviews. Cause i still want to do the things well, so please, don't be rude\
      \ at me anymore. \n\nYou have been unbanned, i am nice person, it hurts me when\
      \ people do this things, and i know the failure about not talk with valve at\
      \ the moment of the exe problem. but i expect good behaviour by your part, anyway,\

    review: "Update: I lost my game progress about 7 times when the game kind of worked\
      \ (mostly because of poor patches). The developer removed the exe from the game\
      \ to fix it, so anyone that purchased the game could not play it for months.\
      \ I have never seen anyone disable the game for months to fix it, while people\
      \ pay for a broken product. Then he banned me for \"hate\", or rather me pointing\
      \ out his incompetence. Then he removed my thread from the forum which did not\
      \ break any forum rules (the thread simply stated the lack of exe in the game\
      \ which other people also pointed out). I have never been treated so poorly\
      \ as a customer in my life. After all that I have been through with this broken\
      \ game, he bans me for being somewhat critical of his endless excuses and selling\
      \ a product with no exe (for over 2 months now).\n\nAnyway here is my old review\
      \ for the game when it worked...\n\n\n[b] The Eerie Adventures Of Kally [/b]\
      \ plays somewhat like a roguelite, although the decision making aspect is almost\
      \ nonexistent, as such the game is little more than a button masher. I really\
      \ like artstyle due to its aesthetic and detail, but I can't play it for more\
      \ than 30 minutes because glitches always reset my progress. I already restarted\
      \ 5 times because I had 3 crashes and 2 other glitches. Sometimes the enemy\
      \ might leave the stage or controls could stop responding, if that happens you\
      \ might as well restart the game. \n\nIt is possible to set the game to fullscreen\
      \ and remove black boarders, but the game menus have some weird glitches that\
      \ could complicate the process. Aside from all of the technical issues, I think\
      \ the developer needs to add those basic roguelite elements, you know like picking\
      \ 1 of the 3 bonuses every so often. There are some randomly generated elements\
      \ to the gameplay, such as running into random loot. However, the game generally\
      \ does not give you a choice between one or the other, that \"risk vs reward\"\
      \ aspect is missing.\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ interesting artstyle and stage\
      \ design\n+ unexpected gameplay elements \n+ decent story and some funny jokes\n\
      \n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\n- frequent crashes\n- numerous glitches\n- some issues\
      \ with controls and menu \n- needs more decision making \n- bad enemy AI\n\n\
      [b] Overall Thoughts: Kind of Broken [/b]\n\nI think this game has a lot of\
      \ potential and I really love the aesthetic, but there are too many technical\
      \ issues. Right now I can't even play for 30 minutes without running into a\
      \ serious glitch. If you really like roguelites and cartoon animation, keep\
      \ it on a wishlist and see if developer can address the problems. This is a\
      \ game that I could enjoy if it was in better condition.\n\n[code]Review By:\
