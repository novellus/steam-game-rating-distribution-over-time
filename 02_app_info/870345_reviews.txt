Only the three main characters have the spotlight, there are no villain of merit only local trouble from one pit-stop till the next. Oh and a lot of talking.\n\nI was so bored after the first episode that I almost fell asleep, and after the second episode I seeked something else to watch.\n\nIt has the potential to get better with the next season, I'd personally give it a 6.5/10.0","timestamp_created":1530775801,"timestamp_updated":1530775801,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yqHWtOQCceOepQE="}
