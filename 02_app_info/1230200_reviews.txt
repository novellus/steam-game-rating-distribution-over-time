You play as a dwarven adventurer who (with a party of friends) slew a great beast several hundred years ago, and has since settled down with the party's healer. Your wife has passed away before the game begins, and you are living on a remote island with your war relics and your talking cat. Then one day, your magic axe (yes, the one used to slay the beast) gets stolen, and in order to find it you need to re-enter society, and in so doing see the ramifications of your actions from centuries before. I really enjoyed the story overall, and most of the side quests and characters were fun.\n\nThe game is in an isometric style like an old-school RPG, and you have the ability to buy clothes/hairstyles/beards for your character at some locations in town and then see them on your sprite. You can also have a significant number of pets following you around (I think at the height of my pet collecting I had a talking cat, 3 chickens, a sentient rat, a talking crab and a hedgehog. They don't really do anything though (except the ones that can talk) except kind of obstruct your character's pathfinding and look cute. There are also several romance options (I found 3 m/f and 2 f/f options) but the romance path I played was pretty bland.\n\nThe art looks great, with unique looking characters and locations, and the music is nice (especially the song at the speakeasy). The characters are \"voiced\" but it's just an Animal Crossing-esque burbling sound, not surprising for the price. I liked that there were multiple solutions to many of the puzzles and lots of chances to express your character's opinion. I did find a few quests were buggy for me (I would have quests to talk to people but they wouldn't have anything to say if I tried to talk to them) but nothing game-breaking. You can continue your quests after the ending, until you choose to sleep in your bed, which gives you a slide show epilogue about how some of your friends are doing and ends that save. I found the epilogue kind of underwhelming and it was weird to me which characters got mentioned in it, but it was fine. There's no manual save unfortunately, so if you want to try out other choices or romances, you will have to play it a second time.\n\nOverall I am satisfied with my playthrough and really enjoyed my time with this game.","timestamp_created":1608811992,"timestamp_updated":1608811992,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524456560611724854","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvNqqyvYCcNLgvAI="}
