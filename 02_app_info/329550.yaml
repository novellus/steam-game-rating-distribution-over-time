    about_the_game: "Following his victory at Actium in 30 BC, Octavian became the\
      \ absolute master of Rome. After having celebrated three triumphs, he reorganized\
      \ the empire by using the wealth of defeated Egypt. He returned to the Senate\
      \ the management of all but three provinces (that he reserves for himself: Gaul,\
      \ Hispania and Syria). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to strengthening the\
      \ borders in his provinces, he decided to put an end to the home fronts by eliminating\
      \ the last pockets of resistance to Roman rule. Thus in Hispania, he orders\
      \ Titus Taurus Statilius to reduce the Vaccaei tribe in 29BC. That tribe calling\
      \ help to the Asturian and Cantabrian mountain neighbors, a pretext is found\
      \ to launch a military campaign against those nations still clinging to their\
      \ independence and lands in northern Hispania.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat the imperial\
      \ administration had not expected, however, was the duration of the war, which\
      \ will continue until 19 BC, and require sending many legions, and even the\
      \ personal intervention of Octavian, who became the Emperor Augustus in 26 BC.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy 19 BC, the Asturian and Cantabrian peoples will eventually\
      \ accept the Pax Romana, at the cost of many massacres and executions performed\
      \ under the orders of Agrippa, final winner of the last independent tribes of\
      \ the peninsula."
