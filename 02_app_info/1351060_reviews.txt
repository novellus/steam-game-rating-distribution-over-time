This one will be forgotten quickly since most of these stats are copied and pasted from weapons like the M1911 or Contractor pistol.\n\nThe M60 however is rather nice, the slower fire rate allows for better control over recoil but otherwise there probably isn't a lot going for this weapon pack.\n\nA mod which increases the viability for the M308/Mk14 DMR has been introduced, making it viable for dodge, however I find myself avoiding DMRs (and my review on the Scarface character pack further strengthens my opinion on his HK417 and the class it's in) as a whole due to the serious issue of a lack of self reliance when it comes to ammo management, you're spending a lot of time to pick up several ammo boxes off of dead police to only get one bullet, or two if you're lucky. \n\nThis is an invitation to get shot at by anything or anyone on Death Wish and above, making things not only harder for yourself, but your team as well.\n\nidk, I'd say buy it for the LMG and maybe the R700 if you don't have the Sniper pack. We already have plenty of pistols in the exact damage range as many, many other handguns which are only divided by looks, mods and variance in magazine size.","timestamp_created":1596171285,"timestamp_updated":1609908973,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.577464103698730469","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43K2D6/YCdobHmAI="}
