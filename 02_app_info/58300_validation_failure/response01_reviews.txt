Not very intuitive with a steep learning curve. It does have a tutorial, but it is extremely long-winded with too much information covering all the game complexities by brute force.\n\nI ultimately leaned more in 5 minutes of real gameplay using trial-and-error than 30 minutes spent in the tutorial. Tron-like vector graphics are nothing spectacular.\n\nNo wow factors. Easy to lose interest.","timestamp_created":1385668319,"timestamp_updated":1574959031,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rfS32e4CfazmHQ=="}
