    review: 'one complaint is the control scheme, its awful, just let us use mouse
      buttons to shoot than those shots. also the menu is pure garbage, this game
      has great potential but needs lots of small things to get better. when my complaints
      get fixed imma come back and change this review to a positive one.


      gameplay is not yet very polished and the ai pathfinding is really bad right
      now'
