It doesn't give you an advantage at all while playing. You and the other people you are playing with will be the only ones seeing it. They are fun and change the feel of your character. But the skins don't give any advantage at all. These skins were obtainable when the game was really popular as weekly missions so its nice to be able to purchase them. Some of the missions that we had  to do were sometimes hard. These are fun skins and add a nice look to the game.","timestamp_created":1345332969,"timestamp_updated":1345332969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545633077621459961","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44v+FnrkCeMaxCg=="}
