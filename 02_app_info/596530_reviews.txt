This is the second review out of over 100 that I've ever swapped my decision on.  This is currently my (at least) 3rd playthrough since my first is the one that crashed, and the second I seem to have locked myself out of an area for 100% completion.  \n\nThis game is VERY hard.  A lot harder than most RPGmaker titles, and I appreciate that.  However to make things easier for the common folk out there I found a method that makes a lot of the later game enemies and bosses MUCH easier.  Which I'll be sharing.  I call it the Inversion Tull method.\n\nThis method you cannot fully implement until your around lv 11-13 (lvls are based on story progress not grinding in this game) but you can even at the start begin to make this build viable.\n\n1) Whenever you gain new CP early game for Tull upgraded the following stats: health, evasion, crit, and speed (dexterity).  All other stats on him for this are totally irrelevant.\n\n2) You will eventually get manawell and fortitude chaos spheres, equip all of them onto Tull.\n\n3) Around 1/3 to 1/2 the game (lv 9/10 depending on how you went) your party is split up, and when they regroup Tull has two new abilities; analyze and Program 12.  Program 12 is what we're focusing on.\n\n4)  Program 12 is based on Tull's max MP, not current but MAX.  Now then you should receive the quest from the prince of Rekshava to retrieve the relic from Grisilweir's tomb.\n\n5) once you pass through the forest there is a village nearby with an optional dungeon in it to go into Evandra's nightmares DO NOT SKIP THIS.\n\n6) Inside Evandra's nightmares there is a chaos sphere this will swap the HP and MP pool of the user.  Note how we've upgraded Tull's health so far?  This should give him a HUGE health pool.  \n\n7) Also in the nightmare nearly every enemy has a chance to drop a 'broken soul shield' this will auto regen 6 TP for Tull a round.  There should have also been an accessory at this point to also regen another 4 TP a round for Tull (can't remember where it is)\n\n8) Once done in the nightmare, go into the tomb make sure to enter the far room on the first area to reach a save crystal, and the giant's glove for Tull this will boost his Hp (now MP) pool by an additional 1k points if not more.\n\n9) once done with Grizilweir and return to Rekshava and get entry into the desert, head into the desert temple and examine EVERY pot, one pot after getting to the boulder & statue puzzle has the expert medallion in it which will regen 8 tp a turn.  This along with the shield will generate 14 tp a round meaning Tull can cast Program 12 EVERY ROUND.\n\nAfter that just equip hp boosting gear to increase his MP and you will have an uber powerful member for your team.  He will need revived a lot though.","timestamp_created":1531054768,"timestamp_updated":1560878680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/NDntesCdrDHpQE="}
