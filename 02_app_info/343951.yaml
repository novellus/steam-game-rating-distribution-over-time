    about_the_game: Great Britain is described as one of the most beautiful places
      on the planet. Take the opportunity to put that description to the test with
      a series of flight adventures that encompass the length and breadth of Great
      Britain, Ireland and the Channel Islands.<br><br>From the beaches of Jersey
      and Guernsey to the Outer Hebrides, Discover Great Britain invites you to take
      to the air for a panoramic view of the natural splendour of these islands. Take
      a flight over Central London, explore Wales and the Lake District or search
      for Nessie at Loch Ness; no nook or cranny of Great Britain is left undiscovered.<br><br>Work
      through 65 different flights with added optional routes. These optional routes
      can be found in your flight plans when available. Full details of these routes
      can also be found in the detailed flight plan manual.<br><br>To complement your
      journey we include an authentic recreation of the Auster Autocrat J/1, regarded
      by enthusiasts as one of the most elegant British aircraft designs ever. Over
      400 Austers were manufactured as touring aircraft and our included example is
      perfect for our journey around the highlands, islands and shores of Great Britain.<br><br>Also
      included are detailed pilot's notes with a full tutorial on flying the classic
      Auster. Detailed flight plans and a travelogue offering information on each
      location visited ensure that you have all you need to embark on this epic journey.<h2
