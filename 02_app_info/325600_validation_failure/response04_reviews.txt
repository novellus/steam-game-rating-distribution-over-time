Its was keeping me entertained. Tried the DM portion of creating a module and was very unimpressed. \nWas hoping for a newly improved NWN type DM system. This system has very few options and very limited on what you can actually do.\nMaybe I'll pick it up and give it another chance, but overall first impressions are about a 6 out of 10.\nHowever, the single player game is actually quite good. I woul dgive SP a solid 9/10. \n\nOverall that's a 7.5 out of 10. and only if you get it on sale.\n\n","timestamp_created":1450661647,"timestamp_updated":1606849119,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sfjqj/YCdNTLSw=="}
