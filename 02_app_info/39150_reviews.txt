(Around the time I learned I could press F1 to accelerate time during walking around and climbing on ladders and other slow stuff, but that might just be a coincidence.) There's a lot to complain about, don't get em wrong; the junction system, the frustrating-and-frantic pseudo-realtime turn based gameplay, the fact that characters' faces are made from 5 sided polygons, etc, but this is ultimately a good game, even without any nostalgia, as I had never played it before. Overall: 7/10.\n\nIf you're a fan of the Final Fantasy series, you should play this game. If not, you're better off starting at X, as I believe it's the best one.\n\nThe remastered version didn't work on my computer, otherwise I would have played that.","timestamp_created":1610179127,"timestamp_updated":1610179146,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkf6J8/YCdM7fwQI="}
