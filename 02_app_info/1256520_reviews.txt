I especially love the Primus-esq soundtrack... it's really different and wonderful.\n\nWhat's bad?  Graphics are not great, controls are floaty, hit detection is pretty poor, and overall progress and design is meh.  Don't get me wrong, it's all definitely passable if you're looking for a Metroidvania, but at the price point there are many other options out there you should be looking at.\n\nI'd say if you can pick this up for under $5, it's definitely worth it, otherwise tuck it into your wishlist until it does.","timestamp_created":1609740532,"timestamp_updated":1609740532,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkueA5vYCdqCnwAI="}
