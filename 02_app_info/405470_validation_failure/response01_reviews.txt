It worked last year & other years but now it won't even launch. I uninstalled it and redownloaded it, still nothing works.  \nAnother wasted effort. I had to re-download this app to a new computer as well as the same computer and all of the stuff I saved under my account is missing AGAIN. This is the 8th time and every time more stuff goes missing. I've registered my complaint with Audials several times but they do nothing and waste my time by making me find, redo, and save things all over again, wasting a lot of time. Some things are no longer available because the sites block this software. What did I pay money for, software that's barely usable for 2-3 years and then stops working without warning? I have several older games and software that works better than this no-ware. I would recommend another software since this malfunctioning piece of junk will only waste your time and money.\n","timestamp_created":1472961811,"timestamp_updated":1579128662,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528023600578308105","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/+TZ1e8CdqvUYA=="}
