      \ henchmen stole the Christmas tree. The old gnome Elvenar brought this news\
      \ to the princess while she was sipping lemonade and redesigning the landscape\
      \ to make it look more Christmassy. <br />\r\n\u201CWhat do you think, Elvenar,\
      \ should I redesign the garden, or should I focus more on the main square? On\
      \ the one hand the townspeople can have picnics with their neighbors in the\
      \ garden, neighborhood games, walk their dogs, and I\u2019d be able to go there\
      \ with my pussy cat. On the other hand, the main party will be in the square...\u201D\
