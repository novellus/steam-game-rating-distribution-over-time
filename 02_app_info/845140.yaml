    review: Excellent plane! so nicely modeled inside and out. Not easy to fly (set
      full realism) and takes getting familiar with the aircraft. nice variety of
      liveries and after my first 1 hour long flight i had no issues like some have
      described. It is possible for there to be issues with the visuals loading improperly,
      but this can happen with any HD model and is easily remedied by simply restarting
      FSX if it happens. Its always a good idea to restart FSX after any flight and
      before starting a new flight to avoid such issues.  Totally worth having.
