I mean games has to give you some enjoyment in order to keep playing them. Unfortunately not here. I have played lots of games, that involves solving puzzles in many different ways, but this has to be the worst of them all. The game is hard, but not just hard, it's extremely hard, meaning if you fail a tiny movement in one of the levels, that only increases in difficulty, than you have to restart. You got to control a bouncing ball, that bounces up and down all the time and moving it left or right. As I see it, the levels can only be solved by a clean run, which will only happen 1 out of 100 attempts the least. And that is of course if you want to get all the stars and achievements. Very disappointing game, if you don't like my review, then you should definitely go try it and see if you get a mental breakdown.","timestamp_created":1590582080,"timestamp_updated":1590847335,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538789927959442139","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pf34svICedPMigI="}
