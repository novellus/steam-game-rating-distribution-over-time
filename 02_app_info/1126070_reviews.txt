The visuals are a little simple and the geometry can be a bit buggy, but overall, this game does exactly what it's supposed to. \n\nThe movement is fun as well as unique. At first it feels quite janky and honestly a little daunting, but with enough practice, it's pretty swell. I love finding new ways to speed through the level and skip over certain points, it's quite fulfilling. \n\nPerfect for the raging gamer or the tryhard speedrunner. 7.5/10","timestamp_created":1574992411,"timestamp_updated":1574992411,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l5+32u4CftKX3wE="}
