    review: "What's here is very pretty and interesting. Unfortunately, something\
      \ strange happened about an hour into my first playthrough. I had been having\
      \ a great time following the story and admiring the beautiful designs. Suddenly\
      \ the narrative took an intense turn and the plot really seemed to pick up.\
      \ I was so excited to see what was about to happen when suddenly a new character\
      \ appeared, said a few words, and everything went dark before the credits rolled.\
      \ I was so confused as to what glitch had occurred that caused the game to crash\
      \ right when it was getting good. But sadly, after scouring the internet for\
      \ other people's playthroughs I realized that it didn't crash. That really was\
      \ the \"ending\" of this game. It was only after digging a little deeper that\
      \ I realized that this is NOT a complete game. It is only the first game in\
      \ a trilogy that never got made. \n\nI got this game on sale for a dollar, and\
      \ in its current state I think that's what it's worth. If the other two games\
      \ in the series had been made then I'm sure it would've been worth more. But\
      \ sadly, this game by itself is nothing more than a lot of build up and world\
      \ establishment for a really interesting story that the player will never get\
      \ to see."
