    about_the_game: <strong>Experience drumming in VR! <br>Build your own drum set
      the way you like it and start drumming away! </strong><br><br>The goal of this
      game is to give you the same drumming experience as playing the real drums except
      at a fraction of the cost!<br>I plan on adding many features such as multiplayer,
      custom drum texture, different drum sounds, and much more! At the moment you
      can build a good sized drum set almost being able to cover any song! You can
      move and rearrange the drums into any position you choose making some very cool
      drum sets and very crazy ones if you choose! The triggers on the controllers
      control the kick drums making it more convenient to play. The game has a double
      kick drum kit only available at the moment for more of a metal feel. There will
      be more kit options later in the game for HiHats instead of double bass drums
      or even having both at the same time for more experimentation! Updates will
      come very frequently and some changes will be made to the gameplay!

    review: "As of now I think this definitively needs improvement. I can see that\
      \ it is an interesting concept, but there are major problems. Problem one is\
      \ that your drumsticks don't rebounce from the surface as they would do in real\
      \ playing. That leads to you hitting through the drum, and when you move up\
      \ to beat again, you go through the drum, cause a sound, and then back down\
      \ through the drum with the next strike. Sounds and feels awful. Then there\
      \ is the trouble with the missing bass drum, which is emulated through a fingerklick\
      \ on the trigger. Not working for me, as it completely disturbs my drumming\
      \ rythm. Unless there will be some kind of pedal controller one solution would\
      \ be to have the bass drum as a pattern you can set up and which loops in the\
      \ background. One big problem will always be the latency of course, from controller\
      \ movement to -sensing and then from collission detection to sound output. \n\
      But well, it IS a Beta, so let's see how the final product will work out. I'll\
      \ take a break until after the next update/s. \n"
