    review: "This game is very Celeste-esque, but it really fails in feel. A lot of\
      \ the time I start accelerating in a direction when I stop holding the direction,\
      \ other times the bounce pad should bounce me, it animates that it is, but it\
      \ just doesn't bounce the character. The bounce pads even give me a very high\
      \ amount of horizontal momentum, much more than you can get by mashing through\
      \ the \"signs\" or whatever they are called. \nThe wall bounce pads also do\
      \ not make much sense, how do I gain height by getting bounced sideways?\nFinally,\
      \ most of the monster attack for too quick so you are unable to dodge, this\
      \ wouldn't be a problem if you can predict when they attack, many times i think\
      \ an enemy is going to attack, but instead it just stands there. Enemies are\
      \ far to easy to just run past.\nGood idea, nice visuals, lacks polish on movement."
