    review: "I was looking for a nicely lit airport and surrounds for instrument and\
      \ night flying. The two Orbx DLCs that I already have (Innsbruck and Eagle Country)\
      \ are both too mountainous, and Palm Springs does not have an ILS. Monterey\
      \ fit the bill perfectly. The airport and its immediate surrounds are exquisitely\
      \ detailed and beautifully lit at night. It has an ILS approach to 10R, a LOC\
      \ approach to 28R, and working MALSR and PAPI lights from both directions. Taxiway\
      \ edge lights make it possible to taxi at night but it is not easy, as there\
      \ are no taxiway centre-line lights and the aircraft landing lights do not illuminate\
      \ the taxiway (an Aerofly limitation). Performance is good - even my puny MX150_0\
      \ 2GB graphics card is getting 30+ fps on high graphics quality.  \n\nOn the\
      \ downside, the DLC does not cover nearly the same area as Innsbruck, Eagle\
      \ County or Palm Springs - just the airport and the small town around it (less\
      \ than 400 sq. km compared to 1500-2500 sq. km for the others), and has less\
      \ animation than other Orbx offerings (some animated people, but no vehicles).\
      \  \n\nIf you are looking for a region to fly around in fair weather, then Innsbruck,\
      \ Eagle County or Palm Springs may be better choices. However, Monterey is an\
      \ excellent destination for instrument and night flying. It's a pleasure to\
      \ break through the cloud on the precision approach to 10R and see the Old Fisherman's\
      \ Wharf come to life before you."
