    review: 'you want to play a randomly generated runner game? this one is the perfect
      fit. you gain abilities, based on how many levels you''ve beaten and how many
      coins you''ve collected, to be able to purchase better versions of your abilities.
      like more hover time, a doublejump recharging more quickly, a jetpack or being
      able to shoot more bullets in the shooting sections. progress feels great! and
      the 3 castles are HUGE. was very fun to explore and play through those, but
      be sure to have all the necessary upgrades for it, otherwise you won''t be able
      to complete them. you unlock abilities before you hit a dead end, usually these
      abilities allow you to clear the castles. sometimes i''d say it is better to
      upgrade these abilities a bit first, as that will make the castles much easier.
      so play until you hit the gate, before you do the castles. that worked very
      well for me.


      the randomly generated levels, will have a lot of repeats after you played quite
      some time, but getting further and further in the game, unlocks more and more
      different sections that at some point can only be beaten by obtaining the mentioned
      upgrades. like a jetpack for example. without upgrades the jetpack is almost
      not there, but after a few points in it, it''s your best friend in this game.
      its definitely enough content to play for a long while and trying to 3 star
      everything, especially for the little pricetag that this game has.


      i had many suggestions and the developer put almost everything in the game,
      making it better and better. at first it felt kinda random at some points and
      you died because you couldn''t see the next platforms etc. but now everything
      is only bound by your own skill. it''s not always easy. it can be pretty difficult
      at times. especially the castles, but thats a good thing!


      the game has bossfights in every castle and 4 of them in the automated running
      levels. they aren''t much different from each other, but that isn''t a problem
      for such a small game. they feel fair, you have enough time to react and generally
      are probably as good as you can make bosses in a runner game haha


      definitely a well deserved thumbs up for this game and the hardworking developer,
      who puts a lot of love into his games and trying to please his community :)'
