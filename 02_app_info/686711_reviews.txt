This means that you'll breeze through some levels and find yourself cursing the developers and the people who gave birth to them in others. Beach mode is the worst because your health will start to deplete if you don't collect bottles of sunscreen fast enough. Shantae is basically a vampire now since she can't stay outside that long, even when she's indoors (for some reason). This makes certain levels and boss fights a lot harder, [spoiler] especially the Dual Baron fight. [/spoiler] It's worth noting that even the developers have admitted that the sunscreen feature is a bit convoluted. Anyway, the whole package is kind of disappointing considering what was promised to us back during the Kickstarter campaign.\n\nThat being said, I can't bring myself to completely hate this DLC. It [i] is [/i] incredibly satisfying when I finish a hard level or earn an achievement. The dialogue is charming, even when it is a little awkward [spoiler] like the ending of Ninja Mode. Just. Why. [/spoiler] Maybe it's just hard for me to hate anything Shantae in general.\n\nYou're not going to find any new story content or lore or anything. If you like hard challenges or just want the achievements then buy this on sale. I got it 50% off and I think that's plenty.","timestamp_created":1564177103,"timestamp_updated":1564202479,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.597692668437957764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42fXumOwCcZ6XzwE="}
