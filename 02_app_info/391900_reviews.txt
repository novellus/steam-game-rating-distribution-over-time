For me at least, it is worth the 2$ so if you liked the game and want to support the creators, go ahead.\n\nYou should know I'm fool for soundtracks in general and really appreciate Game developers who care about soundtrack in their games and even more, those who add it as DLC so - a big shout-out to the devs, if you're reading this.","timestamp_created":1471699666,"timestamp_updated":1471699666,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxdiI1NYCdvS+Xw=="}
