Like SC2, this is an arcade \"SpaceWar\" ripoff with a plethora of ships, where you control your own upgradeable super-mothership, fly around the galaxy, interact with comical and interesting aliens and eventually work your way through the grand plot of the game. \n\nThey opted for an unusual 2.5D combat mode, and that's just one of many experimental gameplay choices.  I know the game got a lot of flak, it simply wasn't as good or entertaining as StarCon2, but if this was 1996 I'd definitely recommend it.  Today, however, it's an old DOSBox curiousity that's only worth picking up for nostalgia's sake.  DOSBox is clunky at best, you have fixed resolution and no widescreen support...  I couldn't recommend anyone stops playing CS:GO or DOTA2 for this.","timestamp_created":1609860377,"timestamp_updated":1609860377,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mv3J6fYCcKvdwAI="}
