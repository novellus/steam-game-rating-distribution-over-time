I don’t know why but the developers did it. There are ten levels – which are pretty boring and nothing new except a couple – and you try to finish as quickly as possible or with minimum moves. As you can imagine DLC is pretty short (episodes gold medals around a minute) and annoying, especially with the hitboxes. Unfortunately for me, I bought the other game and I had the first version too. Because of that, I bought this DLC, because I wanted to 100% it. So, it was a forced buy for me but I wouldn’t mind if it was a puzzle DLC. Sadly, it wasn’t.","timestamp_created":1596403078,"timestamp_updated":1596403078,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548829734325408936","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt7rC2PMCeZmFmQI="}
