    review: The first game in this series was SO FUN, and I was very much looking
      forward to this one, and it just left me cold. Maybe it was my own fault for
      trying to play as a bard--there was just NO chance at all to build up any skills
      to the highest level and toward the end the skill checks were ridiculous. But
      even that would be tolerable if it weren't for the two very, very long parts
      where I had an entire army and their petty squabbles to deal with. I swear to
      god if I read the words "We're running low on food!" one more time I was going
      to have a fit.
