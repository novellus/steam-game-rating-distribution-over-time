Combination comes either with npc telling you the complete recipe or you get nothing. Several specific mats appear only once in the entire game, but you still need it repetitively for other recipes.\nThe foe becomes unreasonably strong in late game (from 3rd year) and balance become completely broken.\nStory is mainly crowded in first 2 hours (1st year) and for the next terribly boring grinding 2 years you get almost no conversation. Not to mention script flows like underage bedtime story.","timestamp_created":1609597687,"timestamp_updated":1609597687,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zfLf4fYCe+nevwI="}
