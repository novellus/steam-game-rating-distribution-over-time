    review: '[b][u]Game Information[/u][/b]


      "Griddlers Victorian Picnic" is a Puzzle game. The game was developed by Big
      Up Studio and published by 8 Floor Games.


      [b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]


      Game Visuals


      I want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely done. The visuals
      can be adjusted in the game''s option menu.


      Game Audio


      I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio
      is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game''s
      option menu as well.


      Gameplay


      There are no game difficulty modes to choose from. Each puzzle has its own difficulty.


      This is a logic puzzle game, but it is also known as the following: Picross;
      Sudoku; Nonograms; Paint by Numbers and Griddlers.


      There are two game modes: Adventure and Training. The adventure mode contains
      six chapters with  hundred twenty different logic puzzles to solve. The training
      mode is the tutorial levels.


      There are eighteen different achievements to unlock from playing the game. Each
      of these achievements does come with some requirements that need to be completed
      before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game only.


      Miscellaneous


      Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay
      value for the game is moderately high. I would recommend this game, but not
      at the game''s full price value.'
