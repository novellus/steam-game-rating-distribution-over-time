There are some other things that do need some improving like handles on the Boxes they are really low on the thing, maybe put them on top or something. But by no means is this game bad its a great game with A LOT of potential in it I love this game and cant wait to play it with some friends and i look forward to new updates because this is such a fun game!!!","timestamp_created":1608606619,"timestamp_updated":1608606619,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ416KbxPYCd+6KvAI="}
