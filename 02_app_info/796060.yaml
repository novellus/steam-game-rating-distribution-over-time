    review: "Recommend but only on sale.\n\nPros\nEngaging, coherent mini-stories\n\
      Ominous ambience\nClear, clean atmospheric artwork/graphics/scenes\nAdequate\
      \ music/sounds\nEntertaining voice acting\nThree difficulty modes (no custom)\n\
      Mini-map with fast travel\nLockable toolbar\nIntricate adventure play\nUndemanding\
      \ but enjoyable hidden object scenes  \nUndemanding but enjoyable mini-puzzles\n\
      Interactive elements in scenes \nTwo types of static collectables\nBonus chapter\n\
      Bonus content\nStrategy guide\n\nCons\nThe story explanation for the three incidents\
      \ was weak and out of left field\nNo indication when objects in correct position\
      \ for possible use\nOn the short side, even with bonus chapter\nCannot complete\
      \ bonus chapter due to bug in final mini-puzzle\n\nFinal words (6/10):\nWhile\
      \ the majority of it was good, the poorly done story explanation and bug had\
      \ a serious negative impact to my overall enjoyment."
