      \ to the world as Jigsaw. In both The Pig and Jigsaw\u2019s minds, they believe\
      \ they are doing something necessary. Something that\u2019ll make those placed\
      \ inside their devious contraptions see life for what it really is once again.\

      \ /><br><br>The Pig comes with <strong>3 new perks.</strong><br><br>The focus\

      \ Checks.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hangman's Trick</h2>Your ingenious modifications\
      \ to Hooks prevent tampering and permanent damage. Hooks destroyed by sabotage\
      \ or sacrifices repair after a short moment. Gain a notification when someone\
      \ starts Sabotaging the Hooks.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Surveillance</h2>Unlocks\
      \ potential in one's Aura reading ability. The last regressing generators' Auras\
      \ are revealed to you.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Make your Choice</h2>When a survivor\
      \ rescues another from a hook at least 48/40/32 meters away from you, Make your\
      \ Choicetriggers and applies the Exposed Status Effect on the rescuer for 60\

      \ the right to unleash torture upon the world as it was considered \u201Cneeded\u201D\
      . A frantic chase began, making David end up at the Realm of the Entity where\

      \ reading ability. When completing a Generator, the Auras of Generators, Chests\
      \ and Totems within range are revealed to you for 3 seconds. If you are holding\
      \ a Map that can track objectives, objectives revealed by Detective's Hunch\
      \ are added to the map.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Stake Out</h2>Getting close to the\

      \ Radius for some time and not in a Chase, you gain a Token up to a maximum.\
      \ When Stake Out has at least 1 Token, Good Skill Checks are considered Great\
      \ Skill Checks and consume 1 Token.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/750381/extras/saw-store-new_map_preview.png?t=1541602111\"\

      \ is no longer a place of death designed for animals. Its focus has shifted\
      \ towards the human race. You can still sense a scent of blood mixed with rust\

      \ but those humans who enter the premises are not supposed to die. They are\
      \ meant to survive and learn. But the majority of those who participate will\
