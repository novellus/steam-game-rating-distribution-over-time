I didn't see any glitches or anything bad...cool atmosphere, etc.. The bases you have to destroy kinda remind me of a 3d version of Zanac on the nes. You'll need a controller. There's different button profiles as well... I like how you earn cash during campaign events to upgrade your ship, even if you fail. That way you can try again with an improved load out. It's kinda hard to control the ship but if you're patient you can last and heal up. The ship you first get sucks as it should since it will improve as you get new parts.","timestamp_created":1572096974,"timestamp_updated":1572096974,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.439542174339294434","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwy4OShO4Cf5Xw1AE="}
