      /><br><br>The Chills is a 2D Top-Down Survival Horror game based on the paranormal
      activities experienced by Jim, who lived in a room in one of the most Haunted
      hotels in America without knowing that the place has a dark history. In the
      19th century, before the hotel was built, there was nothing but a burial ground
      of Native Americans. But in 2005, the Hotel was built on the same site and many
      rituals were performed by some Devil worshipers in the basement of the hotel.
      It had definitely opened a portal to the spirit world which could not be undone.
      Jim explored the Hotel to find out more evidence of the Paranormal. But when
      he discovered the presence of many evil entities he was desperately looking
      for a way to escape the Hotel. <br><br>Will Jim be able to escape the place
      unharmed? His life is in your hands now.<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1008140/extras/ct_gif_2.gif?t=1588901649"
