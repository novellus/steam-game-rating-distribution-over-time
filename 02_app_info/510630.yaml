    review: Very good game in my opinion. Easy to play once you get the hang of it.
      I manage to play and sign players just fine without spending any money on SM
      credits. All you need to do is win matches and leagues and use that prize money
      to purchase whatever players or facility upgrade you require. The fact that
      you can play the same saved game over different platforms (mobile, pc, steam)
      and pick up where u left off, whatever the platform, is something that is very
      useful and works well.  Overall i think it is a very good game, fun to play.
      I highly recommend you at least give it a try, you might like it as many others
      do.
