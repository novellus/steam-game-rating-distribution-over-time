I certainly didn't expect it to be the game of the year, but I thought it could be an interesting little top-down shooter to poke around in.\n\nEvery level appears to take place in the same map, with increasing numbers of batteries to collect and enemies to slay. The map isn't particularly small, so it can get a little tedious trying to figure out where that last battery is.\n\nAlthough what I've described so far certainly isn't engaging, it's also not offensive. But unfortunately, there is a camera issue that makes the game almost unplayable. When the player equips the rifle, the entire screen begins to sway back and forth and in small circles. Is this radio tower on a ship? Why am I getting seasick?\n\nAnyway, don't play Tech Madness.","timestamp_created":1605192229,"timestamp_updated":1605192229,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50648576021194458","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iLS63vUCda34rQI="}
