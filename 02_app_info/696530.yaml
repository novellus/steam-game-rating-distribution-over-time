    review: In some ways I really enjoyed Lake Ridden. The graphics are nice, the
      mystical atmosphere and the sense of exploration while navigating the forests
      and abandoned buildings are right up my alley. At its best, Lake Ridden feels
      like a mix between the melancholy storytelling of Gone Home/Firewatch and the
      no-nonse logic puzzle-solving of, say, Myst. Sadly, Lake Riddens atmosphere
      only works up to a point. The environmental storytelling gets increasingly confused
      as the game progresses, and lacks the emotional punch that one demands from
      the story-driven adventure game genre. And despite some good puzzles, sadly
      most of them are far to repetetive and uninspired. Lake Ridden is all right,
      but in the end, a bit of a disappointment.
