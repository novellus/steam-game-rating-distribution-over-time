    review: 'Funcom is now owned by Tencent, a Chinese super-corp that notoriously
      creates or purchases games and services to squeeze money out of microtransactions.
      Be warned that purchasing their games is now condoning their part in the decline
      of quality in online games.


      South Africa is the only actually-new-content to speak of since relaunch. It''s
      "okay" at best.


      The starting missions are a neat sort of tongue-in-cheek meta-critique of a
      lot of the grindy missions in MMOs, framed as you actually-grinding them in
      a cult compound, but the rest of the writing in that section feels so ham-fisted
      and poor that I''m sure it''s unintentional and they really just wanted to put
      in a story-sanctioned timesink. The premise is neat but poorly-executed. It
      may be the smallest zone in the game, in terms of both area and actual mission
      content. It''s neat for about ten or twenty minutes before you both get the
      point and just want it to be over. It has a neat "final boss" that''s marred
      by the game''s crummy new targeting mechanics that make some fights - like the
      one they wanted this boss to be - more frustrating than they ought to be. It
      is also the least-party-friendly part of the game, so forget about playing with
      friends or randos by the end of the story.'
