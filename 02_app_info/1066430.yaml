    review: 'Great game that feels like an PS1 with a lot of dithering in classic
      mode and like a ps2 game with an cel shading style in modern mode. Asides from
      the graphics the way how you control the character changes in both styles. I
      really like how the tank controls are implemented it creates a sense of fear,
      combat becomes rather methodical, where every enemy type has it s own unique
      way how to defeat them.


      The game is quite short, shouldn''t take longer than 2 hours, maybe a bit more
      if the puzzles don''t click immediatley with you, by the way where I say "click",
      the game combines the survival horror action gameplay with elements of point
      ''n'' click adventures, you can examine almost everything in the game, while
      there is not that much to investigate you can find a fair share of hidden items
      if you are wary of your surroundings.


      Saving only works with items you can find in the game, but I never had problems
      running out of saving item. I think they may could''ve placed more healing items
      than saving, since I ended up with 3 or 4 saving items but with nothing to heal,
      in these situations you have to bite in the sour apple and move on.


      I can recommend this to any videogame nostalgic who has no problem with inconvenience
      as an seling point itself, it pulls you more in into the experience if you ask
      me.'
