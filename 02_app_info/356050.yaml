    review: 'A wonderful way of experiencing a different sensorium. Its nice to see
      things not yet encountered getting a fuzzy image based on interpretation of
      the sound- water running/splashing sounds can of course be many things and assumptions
      are made on experience.

      When immersed it can be startling to come across something unexpected, even
      low level scary- which means the game is doing its job right

      Enjoying it a lot, the art style is simple watercolourish which lends nicely
      to the slowly expanding environment'
