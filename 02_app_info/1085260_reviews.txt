I loved the ship sinking graphics too and sometimes that really hurt losing your ship, so close to riches yet so far...\n\nI was disappointed to see elements like this missing in modern imitations to this game.  \n\nI am delighted to see that a newer C21 version: 4XXL is in the works which I wish the esteemed Devs all the success for getting it off the ground and I hope to see it on Steam in the future.  \n\nI also notice a book is out:  'Ports of Call - the making of'  which I look forward to reading.\n\nThanks for all the many, many, many hours of fun I have had playing this game 'Sparks' n Co.","timestamp_created":1603226752,"timestamp_updated":1603226752,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwNrwo/UCd+aPqQI="}
