It can be used as a training tool for sure, but it's even more than that. Personally, I think it's a great strategy game, but it's even more than that. It's an experience allowing you to hone the intelligent strategy of the always target prioritizing mind. The graphics and music is gorgeous. The mechanics and features sometimes contain a few bugs, but the developers of the game are generally responsive to bug reports over Discord. Your opinions and ideas can shape the game as well, as you can request a feature too.\n\nIn short, it's an excellent game definitely worth it's price.","timestamp_created":1608327910,"timestamp_updated":1608327910,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwp4r0u/YCesykuwI="}
