    review: The graphics are simple yet convey the form of the creatures well. Combat
      is fun and there is a big variety of enemies to fight. However, there are improvements
      that could be made. For example, the lack of a titlescreen makes the game seem
      less polished. It is kind of jarring to be thrown straight into the game. Despite
      this, Deepsea Salvor is a decent little roguelike and I see a lot of potential.
