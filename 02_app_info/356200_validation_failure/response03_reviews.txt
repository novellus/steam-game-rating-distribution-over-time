It was never intended to be a full on release (And to be honest, it shows, missing things such as music and some of the abilities Keen gained in Commander Keen 4).\n\nAt the same time, it is interesting to see the development of the engine that was finished off for Commander Keen 4 and 5 (Somebody get the rights to Keen 6 already dammit!)\n\nIf you enjoy platform games, or like me have nostalgic childhood memories of the series, or just want a taste of 90s platforming action, this is definitely a recommended game.","timestamp_created":1443696196,"timestamp_updated":1600171609,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.619163393974304199","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uqHqyPQCf/faRQ=="}
