The \"twist\" in this course is that there's a lot more ghosts than in any other course, and not just in those long chains that usually show up after a power pellet; in a sense, you'll have to really think which path to take during super mode so as not to waste your time, while also making sure to get extra pellets.\n\nA pretty interesting course, but again, I'd recommend buying the whole bundle on sale.","timestamp_created":1592371457,"timestamp_updated":1592371457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532577931880950928","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4voWv4PICc5PEjgI="}
