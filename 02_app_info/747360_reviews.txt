On its surface, it is a walking simulator played from the first person perspective of a priest who is seeking redemption. It has find and use inventory, collectibles, and a number of mechanical puzzles. Inventory is automatically picked up and used, as needed, so the interface is very streamlined. There is an auto-save feature as well as an explicit save with multiple slots. \n\nWhat is most striking about Gray Dawn is the music and art depicting the Eastern Orthodox church and practices. The game takes place in the early 1900's in Russia or Eastern Europe. The religious artwork, architecture, and icons are done in incredible detail. The various prayers, exorcism, funeral, and mystic rituals are portrayed with supporting scriptures and prayers. Even the cemetery has been crafted in enough detail to make you want to spend time strolling and looking at the different graves.\n\nThe game has \"real life' scenes and dream-like vision sequences that are surreal and (often) disturbing. I found the entire game a bit edgy as our priest struggles with guilt versus forgiveness, salvation versus damnation, and the forces of God versus the forces of evil. The voice acting is especially well done, although I found the 'evil' voices somewhat distressing.\n\nI would recommend this game to those who enjoy exploration and an unfolding story with art and music that is thought provoking and engaging.","timestamp_created":1609981823,"timestamp_updated":1609982013,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.587967097759246826","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45P2Z7fYCd/2TwQI="}
