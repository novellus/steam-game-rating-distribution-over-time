    review: 'When I was young I played AceSpeeder!, which was the previous game and
      by now almost 20 years old. This game was more or less the follow up and from
      what I can tell its sadly worse then the first one.

      The series in its entire shape and form is a very low budget project, but this
      game sadly takes away all the charm from its previous title. The graphics are
      depressing and the controls are a lot more clunky.


      The main issue tho is the track design itself. While the last game had tracks
      which are around 30 seconds long, the tracks here are way longer stretched out
      to around 50-60 seconds. Because your ship automatically accelerates you cannot
      stop, there for all curves cannot be sharp. The tracks in general feel not as
      creative, repetitive and forgettable.'
