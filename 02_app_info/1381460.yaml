    review: 'Path of the Martyrs is an excellent adventure!


      The time I spent as Saiyato in the world of Delma was rewarding.


      While battles proved somewhat easy, they were also a lot of fun. The combat
      and skill systems have depth, and fun realtime arcade elements in some cases
      that keep you on your toes. Resources are plentiful for thorough explorers.


      The real challenge is the puzzles. Kazuki Takamura is a clever designer when
      it comes to these. There are many types of puzzle, and the difficulty level
      is a nice balance between frustration and satisfaction.


      What kept me going most, though, was the story. Through a combination of current
      events and meaningful flashbacks, you experience the story of loyal retainer
      Saiyato and Princess Machia, and the forces of darkness and light at work in
      Delma across time.


      This bittersweet story is also adorned with original art in Kazuki''s unique
      style, and some original music from Naoki Takamura that fits it''s feeling perfectly.'
