      \ Shady Hollow is known for dark legends of centuries past.  The most famous\
      \ of these is the legend of the Hollow Creek Witch. Some believe she is a legend,\
      \ others believe something else. However, everyone will discover that there\
      \ may be more truth than fiction to the legend of the Hollow Creek Witch--and\
      \ something darker than death itself. <br><br><strong> BACKSTORY </strong><br>It\
      \ was in 1695 when Elizabeth Ainsley was accused of being a witch. She was betrayed\
      \ by the one person she cared for the most, Rev James Beaumont. Little did he\
      \ know the terror he was about to unleash upon the small town of Shady Hollow.<br><br>In\
      \ the late 1970\u2019s, Cliff Beamount would resurrect the mining company opened\
      \ several decades earlier by his father. Several months after reopening the\
      \ mines, his daughter Sally went missing. For weeks, the town\u2019s people\
      \ searched the woods and the coal mines but all they would find is a shoe belonging\
      \ to Sally by the Hollow Creek. Most believed that Sally must have fallen into\
      \ the creek and drowned while others believed it was the curse of The Hollow\
      \ Creek Witch.<br><br>A year later, both Cliff and Linda Beaumont grew ill and\
      \ soon died. It was rumored that the loss of their daughter was too much for\
      \ them to handle. John, being the sole remaining member of the Beaumont family,\
      \ was taken to an orphanage.<br><br>John spends the rest of his adolescence\
      \ growing up in an orphange, until the night shortly after his 18th birthday\
      \ when he killed several employees at the orphanage and escapes. John is never\
      \ seen from again after that night.<br><br><br><strong>Episode 1:</strong> \
      \ <br>Episode One begins with the events surrounding the night of October 15th,\
      \ 2015 when two teenagers break into the abandoned orphanage outside of Shady\
      \ Hollow. Driven by unrelenting curiosity and an obsession with the macabre,\
      \ Emily Baxter was never one to run from danger.  As her long-time friend, Ray\
      \ Wilkinson, you accompany her on perhaps the darkest escapade of her life:\
      \ breaking into the abandoned Shady Hollow Orphanage. Inside, Ray and Emily\
      \ begin to uncover the true story of why the orphanage shut down, and the one\
      \ person who escaped: John Beaumont, who some claim was possessed by the Hollow\
      \ Creek Witch herself. The events that occurred that night are still unknown.<br><br><strong>VR\
