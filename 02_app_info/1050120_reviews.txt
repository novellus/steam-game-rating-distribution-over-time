Yes, this DLC may add the \"Road to Celestia\" dungeon that wasn't part of the actual game and yes, this DLC may utilize (= recycle) some monster models that also weren't used in Re;Birth 3, like the fat otaku and the Clione from Re;Birth 1 (in an oversized version), but frankly, that's all it does. The dungeon itself feels extremely bland and empty, there are no items to be gathered, there's nothing to pick up or discover, there are no events linked to it, no hidden blocks to search for like in all other dungeons, the monsters drop nothing at the end of combat and as far as I know, there aren't any Change Dungeon plans either. All you can do is go in, kill the few enemies -some of which give huge amounts of experience, something that was actually missing from Re;Birth 3- and... that's it. The whole thing doesn't make any effort to become one with the rest of the game and simply feels weird and out of place. Unless you want to turn the Super EXP UP Plan on and level up to 999 in one afternoon, you won't ever feel the need to enter this dungeon a second time for any reason.\n\nThe exact same review applies to the \"Mini Island\" as well. With these DLC packs at â‚¬1,59 each, if you buy them you're simply supporting the company with practically nothing worthwhile in return. And while I do approve of any support of IF/CH, I wholly disapprove of this DLC for its (massive lack of) content.\n\nPS: Developers, if you truly want to add something meaningful to this game, make an actual expansion pack - a short story of 3-4 chapters taking place after the events of Re;Birth 3 that revolves around Rei & Arfoire and make them both playable in that expansion [i]and[/i] in the main game as well, as part of a NG+. [b]That[/b] would be one excellent addition to Re;Birth 3.","timestamp_created":1559683559,"timestamp_updated":1559683559,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.692361295223236084","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45c2YkusCcrjgwgE="}
