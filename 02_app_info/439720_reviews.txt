However, due to its bugs, I just can't recommend the game.  The bugs don't make the game unplayable, but present themselves enough to where immersion is broken quite often.  Some a critical - like a save game getting corrupted.  Some are minor - like user interface not working under specific circumstances.  Others are immersion breaking - like warp gates not observing the restrictions you place on them (in your own captured sectors).\n\nI idea behind the game is awesome, but the game isn't finished.  The developer had to cease production on the game due complications with the provider of the coding platform...forced abandonment - at least, this is what people on the discussion board are saying.  So, the bugs aren't going to fixed.  So, sadly - I have to give it thumbs down.","timestamp_created":1605976440,"timestamp_updated":1605976440,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzPfp9fUCf/vZrwI="}
