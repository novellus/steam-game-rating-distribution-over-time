Maybe it was ahead of its time before the roguelike craze. I have a hard time understanding all the bad reviews. It's not a AAA game but its also at a low price. I had a great 10 hours of enjoyment trying to figure out how to clear the dungeons with different teams. Like a simple version of has been heroes.","timestamp_created":1594479818,"timestamp_updated":1594479818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0eaZn/MCfebKlAI="}
