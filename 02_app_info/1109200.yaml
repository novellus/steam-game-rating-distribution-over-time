    review: "Route is rather short, yet it has lack of quality.\nThere are a lot of\
      \ points, which doesn't make any sence:\n\nThere are no career scenarios for\
      \ this map\nThere are tracks and junctions lack of speed limit signs, so be\
      \ ready to get from 40, down to 15, without any warning sign.\nThere are colissions\
      \ in textures, which create strange \"blinking\"\nThere are a lot of \"wasteland\"\
      \ territory on the map, especially at the yards.\nThere are no sounds at the\
      \ map at all! (There are towns, industrial zones, train yards which shouldn't\
      \ be silent irl. The whole map just feels [u] dead[/u])\n\nI like the idea of\
      \ the map, it is quite interesting to make a fictional route for some sort of\
      \ freight and passeger services. But the route right now doesn't feel, like\
      \ done, and you need to make it better by yourself in editor (SERIOUSLY? For\
      \ the money you paid for the route? How would you like to buy raw meat at the\
      \ market, for the price of the cooked one, in order to cook it by yourself?).\
      \ \nThere is a lot to correct there.\nDon't buy it, unless you want to waste\
      \ your money on unfinished route."
