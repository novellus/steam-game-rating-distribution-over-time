I love every single song from the start and of course I also wanted to support the person who wrote the OST, Harold Faltermeyer, by buying the soundtrack here on steam.\n\n„Introduction“ already confused me and I seriously thought Steam gave me the wrong files. It‘s a rap song performed by Vanessa Ekpenyong who can clearly sing (I checked her stuff on youtube), but wtf does that song have to do with Jack Orlando? Did I miss something?\n\n„Jack Orlando Main Theme“ is at least within the genre I expected, but I don‘t really remember hearing that song in one of the JO versions I played. It‘s clearly not the song from the menu. Or any song which could be close to „Main Theme“.\n\n„In The City“ is finally the first song I remember and love. And it‘s even the same version as in the game. \n\n„Streets Of Crime“ also sounds familiar but the version on the soundtrack is a bad remix. No, it did not land there by accident. This is the version the composer wanted to have on the OST. At least it‘s the original song... they just added beats on top of it. Another skip.\n\n„I close my eyes and think of you“ has a woman singing, it may have been in the game or not, at this point I don‘t care anymore because they again added beats and bass on top of a great song. \nThose beats sound like those free beats which were in hip-hop ejay. I was only waiting for the „clash clash bang bang hiphop jam gangster slang“ computer choir. Keep it moving gotta keep it moving. Back to the JO OST.\n\n„Casino“ doesn‘t sound familiar at all. Maybe I wasn‘t far enough in the game.\n\n„The Night Time Is the Right Time“ please please please don‘t mess this one up... And there are the hip hop beats again. Messed up the best song, GREAT!!!\n\n„Mystique“ sounds familiar but just average.\n\n„Blues At The Harbour“ Hell yes, another wonderful saxophone song. I absolutely love that one too. They actually didn‘t rape this one and left it to rot on the streets.\n\n„Scaletti and the Bad Guys“ Absolutely okay version, but not representative for the JO OST.\n\n„The Attack“. Well I heard parts of that song in the game but I don‘t really remember it. \n\n„Epilog“ is the song from the menu (Sax sets in at 0:48), unfortunately it‘s also not the version from the game. But this one is actually good. The bass and the beats are okay this time. \n\n„Military Grounds“ Okay. What is going on.\n\n„The Night Time Is The Right Time (Authentic Swing Version)“ is tagged wrong: This is actually „Close My Eyes And Think Of You (Swinging Version)“ and should be tagged like this.\nHowever, this version is soooo much better than the other version from before.\n\n\nSo... This OST is a mess. I absolutely regret buying it because I could have had the same for free and even the correct versions on Youtube. At least I only paid less than € 3,- for it and it has 2-3 good songs. \n\nBefore you buy, please check the OST on Youtube and decide after hearing these versions.","timestamp_created":1603399919,"timestamp_updated":1603734699,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v6+Cs/UCfLu/qQI="}
