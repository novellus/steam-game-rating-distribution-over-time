    about_the_game: "Lazerbait is a free arcade strategy game set in virtual reality\
      \ with one simple goal: capture all the planets to build more ships and destroy\
      \ your enemies!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe player is presented with a god-like perspective\
      \ of a system of planets. Each planet that a player owns will produce ships\
      \ over time. Using the motion controllers, the player can direct their fleet\
      \ of ships from planet to planet in attempt to capture as many planets as possible.\
      \ The more planets a player owns, the more ships the player can produce. Eventually\
      \ players can build up fleets of many hundreds of ships that lead to awesome\
      \ massive space battles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe player is challenged by up to\
      \ 7 A.I. characters in free-for-all style who are also working hard to capture\
      \ all the planets and eliminate their enemies. The game is highly configurable\
      \ allowing players to choose the game speed, map size, ship limits, number of\
      \ A.I. players, and A.I. difficulty. Maps are procedurally generated at random\
      \ for each game played so no two games will ever be the same.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nGlobal stats and leaderboards are kept over time for the total number of ships\
      \ destroyed and the total number of A.I. players defeated at each difficulty\
      \ setting."

    review: "really solid 'war of the worlds' simple planetary expansion game.\n\n\
      +good onboarding videos, really nice to see the gameplay explained with gameplay\n\
      +solid strategy and easy to understand.. often a hard balance to hit, kudos\n\
      +good use of the \u2018included\u2019 vive controller buttons to maximize engagement,\
      \ grip is so often ignored.\n\n-I Would LOVE to see online multiplayer... would\
      \ greatly increase the replayability."
