    about_the_game: 'The world is under siege by an alien armada. - Fight the aliens
      back and destroy the master alien ship. To get there you must close the 5 Gates.<br>We
      know you have saved the world a lot of times, that is why we need you as a pilot
      to do it again. - Join now!<br><br>Pterodalien is the next Shoot ''em Up which
      takes another step forward in the evolution of the shmup-genre. As the story
      is made for players who act up to the principle &quot;first shoot - ask questions
      later&quot; the sophisticated gameplay-cycle gives the succesfull player the
      opportunity to stand out from the other players to get all the<strong> 48 achievements</strong>.<br><br>Now
      as the mission is clear the player will be equiped with high-tech<strong> space
      ship that can be upgraded</strong>. The player is able to <strong>earn upgrade
      points </strong>(attributes) after a Level-UP in the <strong>experience-system</strong>.
      The player can <strong>choose between</strong> different upgrades: main-gun,
      lasergun, homing-missle, Rocket, Speed, Health. - But decisions should be chosen
      <strong>wisely </strong>because some upgrades have a<strong> trade-off</strong>...
      So for <strong>example a homing-missile makes an easy hit but only a hit with
      the main-gun brings aditionally XP for you next Level-Up. </strong><br><br>In
      the tradition of Shmups, Pterodalien has it''s <strong>own </strong><strong>combo-system</strong>:
      with each alien ship you shoot you will get a card from the type of alienship
      you have shot, you can get an XP-Bonus for <strong>3-of-a-type 4-of-a-type and
      5-of-a-type, also another XP-Bonus for a 3+2 combo</strong>. But it is not that
      easy, the player <strong>starts with the chance for a 3-of-type, once this is
      reached the chance counter raises to 4</strong>. Then the player is able to
      reach a 4-of-a-type and so on. In case the player is not succesfull the <strong>counter
      is reset to 3</strong>. - So the succesfull player will <strong>first aim and
      then shoot.</strong><br><br>After making achievements the player will get aditionally
      <strong>rank-points</strong> with reaching certain amounts the player will be
      <strong>promoted </strong>and reach a higher rank. <br><br>Pterodalien comes
      with<strong> 11 stunning sci-fi levels</strong> each of them has <strong>boss-fights</strong><br><br>Many
      <strong>Alien Bosses have a character and are giving comments</strong> during
      the bossfight<br><br>The game has <strong>a lot of different types of enemy
      spacecrafts and turrets to shoot</strong>'

    review: Seems like a good game in the making but, it looks like all development
      on this game stopped quite awhile ago as it's still listed in-game as a beta.  If
      anyone knows otherwise I'd like to know.  Maybe the developer will get back
      to it or have someone else pick it up and finish it.  Currently can not recommend...
