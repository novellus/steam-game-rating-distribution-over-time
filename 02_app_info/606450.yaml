    short_description: Guts faces off with Mozgus, who has transformed into a giant
      monster, while trying to save Caska from being burned at the stake. Guts has
      trouble defeating Mozgus in his current form, due to his body being so hard
      that even his sword cannot break through. Meanwhile, the Egg has a fateful encounter.
