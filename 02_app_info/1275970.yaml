      Stats is a visual stats system available on each token while in play mode. Stats
      can be hidden and shown as needed, on each token. This gives players access
      to quickly tracking HP and other important stats, to make playing easier. This
      works great with the token system and works with real miniatures by sitting
      tokens beneath them on the map.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1275970/extras/Token_Stats_Promo.png?t=1588468093"

      Initiative System to help track turns.. because even when playing with 3D printed
      miniatures, paper character sheets and real dice.. no one likes to track initiative!
      So let us track initiative for you!<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Give your
      tokens a unique name<br></li><li> Click the &quot;add to Initiative&quot; button<br></li><li>
      Play!</li></ul><br>The tokens can mark their turn as done, delay until the end
      of the turn, be added and removed at any time. Clicking an image in the initiative
      bar pings the token on the map! (Tokens are also auto pinged at the start of
      their turns). And, you can also clear initiative and start fresh when ever you
      need.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1275970/extras/DDT_v1.8_Initiative_System_002.jpg?t=1588468093"

    review: "Update 12/18: I've used this for several months now, and while the things\
      \ I love about it still stand, I'm having a hard trouble with saving. I'll make\
      \ a map, save it, continue making changes, and save it again. I'll re-save over\
      \ the previous one, clicking 'yes' that I would like to overwrite, but when\
      \ I close out the program and re-open, my changes are not retained.  I've lost\
      \ a lot of work that way :( . For a while I could save it by giving each save\
      \ a new name but now each map, no matter what, loses all details and lighting\
      \ and just keeps the footprint every time I reopen a map from close.\n\nSadly,\
      \ this makes the product unusable so I've changed my review from 'recommended'\
      \ to 'not recommended'. \n\nPrevious review:\n\nI love all the extensive dungeon\
      \ items and tiles! I wanted to create a burial chamber with coffins, offering\
      \ urns, chests, skeletons and motifs on the wall. To my surprise, everything\
      \ I wanted was available as an asset, plus more! Also the lighting is awesome,\
      \ really makes the map come alive. Each object reacts to every light you place\
      \ in the dungeon, and each light has different brightness according to its size.\
      \ \n\nOnce I got the hang of how to move, scale, and rotate items, I was able\
      \ to build a dungeon for my roll20 game very quickly! If there was a way to\
      \ search assets, that would be great, because there are a lot of them! (Any\
      \ expansion packs down the road...? I'm interested!). \n\nYou can even rotate\
      \ tiles! I was frustrated at first because I was using 1x1 tiles and each time\
      \ I put down a tile, it looked the same. I wanted to see some variation in the\
      \ narrow tunnel I was making. Then I figured out you could rotate tiles and\
      \ voila! Problem solved.  \n\nAll in all, this was exactly what I was looking\
      \ for. I wanted a nice looking map that I could put together quickly with pre-made\
      \ elements, and this software delivered! I can't wait to show my players the\
      \ map! Our last one was nice, but there was no color, lighting, or textures.\
      \ This is way cooler :)"
