Playing this with my friends has been a blast, whether it be just messing around or actually fighting the bosses. The only true gripes I have is the menu, the graphics, and the lack of being able to walk with left stick. But honestly, those all kind of don't really matter all too much to me. If you're planning on getting this, try to get some friends to play with you too!","timestamp_created":1609823905,"timestamp_updated":1609823905,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zuy+6PYCde7NwAI="}
