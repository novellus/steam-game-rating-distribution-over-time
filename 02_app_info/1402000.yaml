      /><br>Multiplayer platformer <strong>Trapped Guys</strong>, where four friends
      unfortunately have to go through several dozen rooms with various traps of varying
      degrees of danger. As you progress, the traps in the rooms become more and more
      dangerous, and their location is more and more intriguing.<br><br>Be careful
      on your way, do not give others a chance to seize the initiative on the way
      to the goal!<br><br>Sometimes it is worth stopping and looking at the room in
      a new way, perhaps the built route will not always turn out to be correct.<br><br>Game
      Features:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Multiplayer Mode For Up to 4 Players.<br></li><li>
      Over 40 different rooms full of traps, as well as extended versions of rooms
      that might have seemed too easy to you before.<br></li><li> Many traps and game
      situations directly related to them.</li></ul>
