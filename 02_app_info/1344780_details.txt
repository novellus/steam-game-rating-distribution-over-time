Press Oculus Touch B or Y button to retry.<br \/>\r\nBe careful when you throw the normal gray stone. If you failed, it rolls away and the next time, you are in an unexpected place. Once you've thrown the gray one, you can not retry.<br \/>\r\nYou can switch between the red one and the gray one by pressing Oculus Touch A or X button.<br \/>\r\nRegardless of your dominant arm, you can throw it by your either hand.<br \/>\r\nShowing the Menu is assigned on Oculus Touch Menu button. <br \/>\r\nThis game is a fully auto-save. You cannot save at will, and if you quit the game and then resume it, you will resume from where you were last.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nYou're not always just throwing the stone. Sometimes you are required to play just to put it at your feet. Therefore, you need to install a tracking sensor so that you can track down to your feet.<br \/>\r\nAlso, play in a room with high ceilings, as you may be throwing stones high right above you or placing them high up.<br \/>\r\nAnd also, this is an obvious one, if you don't want to get injured, play in a tidy and spacious enough room when playing VR games.<br \/>\r\nYou will likely experience real heights in this game, so if you have height phobia, don't play this game. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThrow the stone, and get the goal above.
