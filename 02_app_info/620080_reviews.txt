I really enjoyed the way that they handled the \"magical investigations\" and the dynamics of the school as well.  On the whole, the group has fun dialogue and good chemistry. I also think that they did a good job unfolding parts of the underlying mystery and the MC's backstory within each route, making all of them worth playing. \n\nSpeaking of the MC, this is a rare VN main guy who is neither annoyingly weak and spineless, nor aggravatingly juvenile, pervy and cringey to the point of being unlikeable.   He's got his issues, but he's also a competent and decent guy. Not only did I root for him, but I also found myself genuinely wanting to know what his deal was (yes, I'm being purposely really vague).\n\nAs far as issues go, there were just a few noticeable hiccups with the translation. On a couple of occasions, the text didn't wrap properly and/or the font got wonky in the middle of a sentence, causing things to shift around in a slightly confusing way. There was also at least one text box that wasn't translated at all, so that bit of dialogue/description was entirely missed. Additionally, it doesn't record playtime accurately. I spent MUCH longer than 6.8 hours playing this game so that makes it difficult to say just how long it took me to finish. (I played this quite some time ago, so I am unsure if these problems have been fixed or not.)\n\nOther than those issues, I don't recall having any major problems with game.   In my opinion, it's a good visual novel and I wish that more people would play it. Not only would they hopefully have fun, but maybe then Sekai would stop dragging their feet and finish localizing the other two entries in the trilogy. I am itching to find out what happens next!","timestamp_created":1608805028,"timestamp_updated":1608805473,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ruuRyvYCfdrdvAI="}
