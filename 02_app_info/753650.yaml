      /></a><br><br><strong>DUE PROCESS</strong> is a tactical FPS where tactics finally
      matter. <strong>Planning &amp; teamwork</strong> are essential for victory because
      every map is<strong> procedurally generated</strong>. You'll be faced with a
      new challenge every time you play.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/753650/extras/titles_01_maps.png?t=1609880602"

      /><br>Fresh maps make Due Process great. Levels are built in-house via a procedurally
      assisted level generation process and are <strong>delivered weekly via steam
      update</strong>, which means you won't be playing on the same stale level. Our
      level designers edit each level before it goes out and are constantly trying
      new concepts.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/753650/extras/titles_02_plan.png?t=1609880602"

      /><br><strong>Teamwork starts with a goal. </strong>Discuss your strategy over
      voice chat, and use the <strong>planning phase</strong> to draw up a plan of
      attack. Deploy your assets wisely over the course of three rounds, as anything
      fielded from your armory won't come back if destroyed or lost. <br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/753650/extras/titles_03_execute.png?t=1609880602"

      /><br><strong>No plan survives first contact.</strong> The plan is a start,
      but you're going to have to think on your feet and coordinate with your team
      when things go awry. Getting your teammate to open fire to cover your footsteps
      just might secure you the element of surprise. <br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/753650/extras/titles_04_twosides.png?t=1609880602"

      /><br>A corporate military force contracted with enforcing indefinite martial
      law. Armed with the best tactical gear and weapons for a CQB environment. <strong>Speed,
      surprise, and violence of action</strong> are the essential elements of good
      execution. Once a plan is made, move forward with purpose, either by systematically
      eliminating the opposition room by room, or by striking swiftly at the heart
      of the defense.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/753650/extras/titles_06_defenders.png?t=1609880602"

      /><br>A rag-tag band of outlaws who oppose the corporations by any means necessary.
      Their weapons and gear are relics and rudimentary, but are not to be underestimated.
      <strong>Cunning is their strength</strong>. Anticipate what the enemy is planning,
      then set up the kill zone. Lay traps, coordinate crossfire with your team, and
      exploit breaks in the attack to flank the enemy and bring a decisive end to
      the fight.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/753650/extras/regions_worldmap_br.png?t=1609880602"
