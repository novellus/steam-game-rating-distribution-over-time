This will require an enormous amount of money. In fact, it will require so much money, one could simply have bought a new house for the cost of redecorating one room for granny. Fortunately for you, Emma is a sociopath who has turned her granny's invitation to \"bring new furniture\" to redecorate a spare room into permission to sell all of her grandmother's possessions in order to fund a shopping spree.\n\nEmma describes these possessions as \"unused items\" ... \"unused items\" like family pets, treasure chests full of doubloons, diamonds the size of a man's fist, a Thanksgiving turkey, and the occasional housefly. Emma's customers range from a Vin Diesel lookalike (with a totally not suspicious hat that simply says \"SPORTS\") who repeatedly asks for dozens of random tools to fix his wife's pipes, to a 6-year-old boy who on different occasions purchased from Emma a noose, pliers, and a squirrel. This raises the question - are these actual customers and items, or are they Emma's hallucinations? Is grandma even alive or did Emma send herself that invitation?\n\nPersonally, I find Emma's potential severe mental illness to be one of the more interesting storylines upon which to base a casual hidden object game. Big Fish was really taking a risk with this one and it paid off in a big way.\n\nAs for gameplay, the game is oriented towards rapidly finding a moderate number of easy to find objects over swiftly recycled boards, rather than poring over hyper-cluttered boards looking for difficult to distinguish objects. The boards can be played with or without timing. Objects to find may be presented as pictures, silhouettes, words, or scrambled words. There is a recurring match-3 game interspersed with the levels. Between levels, the player has a chance to buy hyper-expensive decor for granny's house. It was worth $5 to me, and I recommend it on sale at that price.","timestamp_created":1595798848,"timestamp_updated":1595798848,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoMDBxvMCddTdlwI="}
