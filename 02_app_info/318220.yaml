    review: "Here is a serious review of the game; developers if you're reading this,\
      \ this is for you as well as any future customers.\n\nLet's get the cons out\
      \ of the way:\n- First up let me address the vehicle physics, it isn't the best\
      \ I've seen the vehicles can drive around and get up to speed and although they\
      \ do have some suspension physics for the vehicles the vehicles don't react\
      \ like they should. For example turning the vehicle at a high rate of speed\
      \ doesn't sway the vehicle and what do I mean by that? Look at games like Grand\
      \ Theft Auto 4 or 5, or the Driver Series of games. Sure these were made by\
      \ vastly bigger studios, but they should give you an example of what the vehicle\
      \ physics should be like. No, I don't mean that you \"need\" destruction physics,\
      \ that is not what I am getting at, when a vehicle turns at a high rate of speed\
      \ the vehicle should react to this momentum. Every action has an equal and opposite\
      \ reaction. When you turn left at high speed the vehicle's suspension on the\
      \ right side should be compressed while the left side should decompress.\n-\
      \ Next up is the camera controls and the overall experience with the game cameras:\n\
      \ * The players \"body cam\" meaning the third person camera that the player\
      \ uses to see the player character through (also is the camera that is used\
      \ when the player is walking/running/on foot) isn't that bad. I feel it's a\
      \ little close for me, but it gets the job done.\n * The third person camera\
      \ for the cars aren't that bad either. The default view is stationary and stays\
      \ behind the vehicle facing forward all the time. The second view for the vehicles\
      \ is a free-look camera which allows you to freely look around the vehicle without\
      \ much restriction, this view even allows you to zoom in or out.\n- The AI in\
      \ the game aren't always the brightest bunch, sometimes they get stuck behind\
      \ obstacles.\n- You should be able to go to the Police Station and Go On Duty.\
      \ Although, in-game you can only go off duty at the police station.\n- The game\
      \ doesn't tell you how to respond to calls, should I respond Code 2 or Code\
      \ 3?\n- Your only form of Police Backup is a Police Transport, who only transports\
      \ suspects you arrest.\n- Sometimes AI Vehicles will despawn in font of you\
      \ near the Police Station. This is probably do to some game logic at the end\
      \ of the AI's waypoint telling it to despawn to increase performance. Which\
      \ is a good thing, but it takes away from the realism.\n- There isn't a penalty\
      \ for the player when they run a red light. If you speed through a red light\
      \ without reason (only acceptable reasons I can see are if you're responding\
      \ to a call code 3) you aren't penalized for it.\n- Graphics aren't amazing,\
      \ but it's good enough for me.\n- Sometimes AI Vehicles turn around at intersection\
      \ which causes a traffic jam. It's nothing too bad, just letting you developers\
      \ know in case you don't know about this.\n- The default price of 19.99 US Dollars\
      \ is a little too much. I think at most $8 to $10 bucks are good.\n- Scale seems\
      \ off, but it could just be me though.\n- The Taxi Price is $20 (in-game currency)\
      \ no matter what. I feel it should change depending on your distance from the\
      \ destination.\n- The green highlighting boxes aren't need, just have an invisible\
      \ trigger setup that tells the player to press 'E' or whatever to interact with\
      \ something.\n- The cars seem a little too metallic either that or reflective.\n\
      - You can only ram suspect vehicles to get them to stop, you should be able\
      \ to order them to stop the vehicle through a PA system to stop the vehicle.\n\
      - You should be able to order a suspect to stop running while in a foot pursuit.\n\
      \nNow time for the Pros:\n- It is exactly what it is advertised to be, a simple\
      \ police simulator.\n- It is great if want to pass time irl.\n- You can chase\
      \ some vehicles, have foot pursuits, ticket people, catch speeders, among other\
      \ things.\n- You can \"hang out\" with your character's family and friends in\
      \ game.\n- You can upgrade your police vehicle or get a better one.\n- You can\
      \ buy a civilian vehicle in-game to help go around and do stuff in-town.\n-\
      \ You can call a taxi to transport you around if you don't have an off-duty\
      \ vehicle.\n- You have a choice between two characters a male officer and a\
      \ female officer.\n- You have to keep an eye on vehicle maintenance and fuel\
      \ which adds to the realism since the game doesn't currently have vehicle destruction.\n\
      - A working options menu, thank God for that.\n- The interface is nice. In my\
      \ opinion.\n\n\nI might have missed a few things, but this is what I have noticed\
      \ so far. I hope the Developers continue working on this, it has potential,\
      \ but needs some work done.  Overall if you're just looking for a simple Policing\
      \ Simulator this is a good start although personally I will only give it a 3/5\
      \ stars."
