You know how unresponsive RPG Maker movement is? Imagine that in a precision-movement game. Doesn't work. The gameplay is your generic dodge the instant death as you memorize the movements of different hazards. \n\nSorry to say the dev seems really proud of this, and the store page is cute, but the game isn't any good. The writing once you're in the game is bleh. \n\nI was optimistic going in, but this is another piece of indie trash for the steam dumpster.\n\nOne last thing, when I launched the game it opened some weird javascript dialogue. I ran an antivirus scan and it seemed ok, but be warned.","timestamp_created":1599024964,"timestamp_updated":1599024964,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmpTUpvQCefiknwI="}
