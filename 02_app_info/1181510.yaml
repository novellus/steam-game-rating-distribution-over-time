    review: "Something different, something new.\n\nWhat drew me in was the graphics\
      \ and the theme - retro stuff, computer science. Not yet-another-schematic-stuff.\
      \ Same old sci-fi or fantasy setting.\n\nThis is basically twin stick shooter\
      \ mixed with a\_lite rpg, but this last thing is optional. You like dark humour\
      \ and reading? Don't skip the quest part. Don't like? Skip it. Kinda 2 games\
      \ in one, almost.\n\n\nThe steering is much alike any other twin stick shooter,\
      \ with a little difference needed to support camera rotation.\n\nAt the beginning\
      \ you must watch out not to fall down, but once you get a grip, this stops to\
      \ be a problem.\_\nThe game is easy at the beginning and becomes difficult around\
      \ level 3, which I like. You can learn the basics fluenty, then just focus on\
      \ annihilating enemies."
