      /><br>After a surprise betrayal from his most trusted mage, the king of Le Scardia
      falls ill from the effect of the mage's curse, and a mysterious labyrinth formed
      out of darkness subsequently appears in the ruins outside of the city. A few
      days later, swarms of ferocious monsters begin to emerge from the labyrinth,
      and the people of Le Scardia start to panic as the kingdom is thrown into chaos
      by the upheaval.<br><br>The labyrinth, which has come to be known as &quot;the
      Abyss&quot;, hosts not only monsters but also vast quantities of treasure. Rumor
      has it that the source of it all can be found on the very bottom floor. With
      the king incapacitated by the curse, it is now up to his daughter Princess Olivia
      to set foot into the Abyss and seek a way to restore order to the kingdom.<br><br><br><strong><h2
