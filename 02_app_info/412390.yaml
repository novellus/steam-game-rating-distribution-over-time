    about_the_game: 'Lucadian Chronicles is a strategy, puzzle and card-collecting
      game with a full single-player campaign and multiple competitive online modes.
      <br><br>In Lucadian Chronicles each card has a variety of stats and abilities,
      as well as a color and cost. The heart of the game is creating teams that conform
      to color and cost limits while taking advantage of card synergies to conquer
      the opponent''s team.<h2 class="bb_tag">Demo Details</h2>The demo allows players
      to play the competitive League and Draft modes, as well as play the first set
      of maps in the single-player campaign.<h2 class="bb_tag">Single Player</h2>The
      single-player portion of the game has a full story with branching paths. It''s
      designed to test the strategy limits of the player with challenging optional
      branches and objectives.<h2 class="bb_tag">Multiplayer Leagues</h2>In Leagues
      you join a pool of other players and fight them asynchronously. League play
      stresses the overall strength of your collection, the ability to identify trends
      in the meta strategy, and to adapt to what the players in your specific leagues
      are doing.<h2 class="bb_tag">Multiplayer Drafts</h2>Draft mode is a real-time
      pure test of skill in which all players begin on even footing, regardless of
      existing collection. In drafts you first pick the cards you''ll use , then enter
      a mini-tournament in which you have access to only those cards.<h2 class="bb_tag">Cross-platform
      Play</h2>The Steam version of Lucadian Chronicles allows for matchmaking in
      both leagues and drafts with the existing Wii U player base.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul

      the major logic and account data is server-based. This is to prevent cheating
