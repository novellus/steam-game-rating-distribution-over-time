      by the Carolinas and Georgia. The chosen location allows for a huge variety
      in terrain and environments. You''ll encounter dirty cities, beautiful beaches,
      farmland, snow-capped mountains and everything in between. All of these areas
      are inspired by real locations in the United States, resulting in an incredibly
      believable and immersive world.<h2 class="bb_tag">The Town Square</h2><br>The

      fans while waiting on future modules and the full Identity world.<br><br>Following
      the Town Square, two additional modules will be released: <strong>SWAT </strong>and
      <strong>Racing</strong>. After all modules are playable, you''ll get access
