    review: "Yikes. Not bad... if this is a first project. I say go back to the drawing\
      \ board and try again.\n\nThere were a lot things that weren't correct with\
      \ this game. The environment was very minimalist and I felt like I was plunked\
      \ down into Lego Land. Not very scary. \n\nThere was constant chase music on\
      \ loop when nothing was chasing me. This contributed to the Lego Land feeling\
      \ and sapped any fear I may have felt. \n\nFinding items wasn't always obvious\
      \ and in some cases, they didn't spawn at all. Clues were sometimes really vague.\
      \ \n\nI hope the Devs keep trying. Not every game is going to be a huge hit,\
      \ and I get that. Hopefully they can take something positive from my criticism\
      \ and use it to improve the next game. \n\nAnd at the risk of sounding harsher\
      \ than I already do-- With all the Slendy clones out there, you really need\
      \ to bring the thunder if you're going to add one to the pile. This ended up\
      \ being pretty meh. Sorry, friends. \n\n\n\n"
