No purpose to this game really other then to see how high you can go for waves defeated. Even though I bought it cheap its not really worth it. The walls break to easy and the constant repair every round sucks. Nice that you can pause it and plan at your leisure and build. I give it a reluctant thumbs up. Needs a purpose to the game.","timestamp_created":1578478338,"timestamp_updated":1578478338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530831098556518555","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw/f+owu8CceXU6gE="}
