I have noticed there is a slight missed opportunity due to the lack of a main story line. Who is arranging the fruit? Why must the fruit be arranged? Who eats the fruit after they have been arranged? Where does the constant supply of fruit come from? I feel like these are important questions that could easily be answered with an engaging and thought-provoking story mode.\n\nAlso, I was absolutely astounded to find that there isn't a vibrant e-sports scene surrounding this game. After training for months on end, I was crushed when I discovered that there isn't a single professional Fruit Arranger league. I have plans to become the first pro player, pioneering a new age of e-sports through this magnum opus of a game.\n\nOverall, the feelings evoked by Fruit Arranger verge on sexual arousal. It's gotten to the point where I can't feel complete as a human being unless I'm putting three matching fruit in a row. I skipped my mother's funeral because I almost had a new high score. I missed my own child's birth while I was engulfed in Fruit Arranger's majesty. This is not your typical game. Fruit Arranger evokes a symphony of emotions, and Mihai Morosanu is the composer.","timestamp_created":1609710066,"timestamp_updated":1609710066,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlcuM5fYCdJWawAI="}
