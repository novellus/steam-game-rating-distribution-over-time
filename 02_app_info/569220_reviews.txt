I was a bit anxious that it would not be as good as I remembered, but it does not disappoint.  This is not your typical \"point and click, solve puzzle\" game, but a rather complex deciphering of information using spycraft tools such as computers, photographs, and human interactions.  This is by far the best espionage pc game I've ever played.  If you have an interest in espionage and research, you can't go wrong with Spycraft: The Great Game.  Yes, the game is very dated, but once you get into the storyline, you won't even notice, as the game is about information more than anything.  I'd LOVE to see an updated version of this game released someday.","timestamp_created":1606360585,"timestamp_updated":1606360585,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sqqjgfYCetrEsQI="}
