    review: "ForestFortress is a really good adventure romance with a really nice\
      \ storytheme.\nThe story goes about  a human boy, setting on on search for a\
      \ medecine to cure his village from an unknown illness, until he met a squirrelgirl\
      \ which saved his life from a Vine plant. After this we meet a dryad girl which\
      \ are considered after the squirrels warning as evil and have to be avoided.\n\
      These warings thoughs couldnt be cnfirmed by him and the dryad seemed t be actually\
      \ really caring.\nLater on after encountering again the squirrel he got informed\
      \ that the forest the dryad are obscured by a dark  god s powwer thank tothe\
      \ dryadd Lady and therefore it is known that the humans in the village felll\
      \ ill thanks to this dark presence. Soon he found himself encountering another\
      \ squirrel which ended up bringing him alongin her village and to be the princess\
      \ of the village and therewe meet again Rika the first squirrel we met.From\
      \ there on we are ordered to do all kind of things as to purify, to do, to entertain\
      \  and to go on mission, do participate in a sacred ance etc.... From there\
      \ on we also build relationships and with each event event if chosing the right\
      \ option we are likely rewarded with a scene of some adult content.\n\nThe storyflow\
      \ is rather quickpaced but the universe it is set is a interesting and intriguing\
      \ one, with alot of different places. The races are also well though the artstyle\
      \ is relatively  good, though for there expression there is some adjustement\
      \ and improving necessary, they are not really how expressions should be and\
      \ so its missing some authentiity of the current subjects, \n\nI can definitely\
      \ recommend this VN, it is not a complete story, it seems like a second part\
      \ will be coming in near future and complete the already good story. The story\
      \ itself n this part isnt long, for slow reader around 10hours the story has\
      \ been read and little more if you through all 3 different routes."
