    review: "An excellent and relatively long casual point-and-click adventure that\
      \ would surely please fans of the genre.\n\nThere's a lot of fun \u201Cadventuring\u201D\
      \ content here in a large number of scenes. It's mostly diverse, though there\
      \ are a bit too many tasks that are of the \u201Cfind the tiles for the next\
      \ puzzle\" sort. The puzzles themselves are of easy-to-medium difficulty. There\
      \ are not very many hidden-object scenes, but they are all good and even require\
      \ some creative thinking.\n\nThe story won't blow you away in its originality,\
      \ but it's well developed and satisfying. The characters are annoying and prissy\
      \ rich people, but they are appropriately conceived and fit the tone of the\
      \ narrative.\n\nEven the bonus material is terrific. There's a quest that adds\
      \ an important new dimension to the story, an extra casual game, and a fun video\
      \ and photos from the development process. It's great to see a little bit of\
      \ the real people who made this lovely game. I wish all games would do this.\n\
      \nAnd there's even a charming companion cat! How can I not give a thumbs up\
      \ to that? :)"
