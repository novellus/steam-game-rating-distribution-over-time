      \ better quality cut-scenes, improved audio, higher poly models, numerous fixes\
      \ and improvements, and trading cards, badges, emotes and backgrounds!<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">About the game</h2><br>Players guide Mudokon champion Abe, and his\
      \ aquatic Gabbit partner Munch, in Oddworld's third adventure, using special\

      \ in a can of gabbiar.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2><ul\
      \ class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Play as a team - players use Munch and Abe cooperatively\
      \ to make their way through the trials of Oddworld. Leverage both characters'\

      \ a path to safety.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Munch - Munch can swim around\
      \ the new realms of Oddworld. When on the ground, zip along with a wheelchair\
      \ power up. Need to move some yapping Slogs out of the way? Just use Munch's\

      \ other creatures as well, but why think small?<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>As\
      \ Munch - If Abe can't mesmerize someone into getting the job done, Munch can\
      \ use his handy remote control head port to hijack nearby machines including\
      \ cranes, and 50-caliber Anesthesia bots to tackle the really tough obstacles.<br>\t\
      \t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Power-Ups \u2013 Every friendly character you can find\
      \ becomes a fighting ally, Fuzzles, Mudokons\u2026. Need to get somewhere quickly\
      \ or get over a wall, like right now? Use Oddworld's consumer power-ups like\
      \ Expresso and Bounce to amp up Munch and Abe's abilities to perform cool moves.\
      \ For the more direct approach, possess high-caliber weapon toting enemies.<br>\t\
      \t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Oddworld, now in &quot;new and improved 3D!&quot; - it's\
      \ a whole new Oddworld, with lush rivers, towering mountains and hundreds of\
      \ trees that bloom or die.<br>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li><li>Interact with dozens of\
