    review: "Best movie I have ever played.\n\nJokes aside, here's my serious review:\n\
      \nThe Good: The game combat is excellent, not flawless but still very fun with\
      \ tons of unlockable weapons and equipment and a wide variety of moves. The\
      \ desmemberment mechanic is something that I wish more games had, most objects\
      \ in the game can be cut cleanly in pieces including enemies, pillars, fire\
      \ extinguishers (that explode), etc. The game soundtrack is also awesome.\n\n\
      The Bad: \n- The game is very short, and there's an abuse of FMV's, animated\
      \ transitions, radio calls and quicktime events in the game. The first playtrought\
      \ they're not so annoying if you are enjoying the story, but if you are on subsequent\
      \ playtroughts they can get really irritating. At the end of the final mission,\
      \ or when completing Sam and Wolf side-stories you will be forced to watch 15\
      \ minutes of ending credits and an unskippable FMV, every time you beat them.\n\
      \n-Fights are constrained with force-field walls that take a while to go away\
      \ after you defeat all area enemies, so sometimes you just stand there awkwardly,\
      \ waiting for a wall to dissapear. This, in combination with my previous point\
      \ really spoils the good combat and action the game offers.\n\nThe Ugly:\n-\
      \ It's a PS3/Xbox 360 port with some issues and dated design elements... The\
      \ game runs at 24hz for some users, some workarounds exists that try to fix\
      \ this but it should be a native fix in the game.\n\n- The parry mechanic, outside\
      \ of easy mode auto-parry, can be a real pain to get right because it's unclear\
      \ where the game wants you to point your analog stick or the timing.\n\n- The\
      \ camera can behave erratically or lock itself to high ground enemies while\
      \ ignoring the ones just behind your back, for dire consequences.\n\n- Some\
      \ enemies will magically block and stagger you, even if they are dismembered\
      \ and crawling on the floor.\n\n- Some VR missions are extremely easy to fail\
      \ and restarting shows long introduction sequences that are unskippable.\n\n\
      - The game color composition really shows it's a product out of a 2013 console\
      \ game.\n\n- Boxes and other props can go haywire and float in zero gravity\
      \ randomly. Other props like fences or glass panels are hard to walk trought\
      \ after cutting them.\n\n- The stun-recovery mechanic is bound to violently\
      \ mashing the analog sticks back-and-forth, which will inevitably destroy your\
      \ controllers. Terrible input choice.\n\n- Some enemies, like the UG Gorillas\
      \ (Mastiffs) or UG Bulls (Geckos) are completely overpowered in higher difficulties\
      \ and will aggresively spam stunning moves, making them more annoying then some\
      \ bosses.\n\n- While most of the dub is good quality, some voice lines could\
      \ see improvement, particularly many of Raiden's ones, or one of the death soundbits\
      \ where a teammembers -quietly- screams \"Raiden? RAIDEEEEEN\" as if trying\
      \ to not wake up the baby on the next room."
