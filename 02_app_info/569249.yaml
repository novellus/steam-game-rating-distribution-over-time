    about_the_game: "Mustang\xAE Premium 'Boss' (2014): celebrates 50 years of one\
      \ of the most iconic muscle cars ever made, the Ford Mustang\u2122. Players\
      \ are challenged to race a variety of Mustangs against an array of colorful\
      \ characters in eight different racing scenarios including drag racing, drifting\
      \ and road racing. This is a fast playing table with clear shot goals and excellent\
      \ multi-ball modes. The gorgeous playfield features twin stacked ramps, full\
      \ spectrum color LEDs, a show car on a turntable and artwork by famed Ford GT\
      \ car artist and designer Camilo Pardo. Actual Mustang engine sounds, narration\
      \ by professional race car driver and TV host, Tanner Foust and an awesome soundtrack\
      \ featuring eight generational cruising tunes makes this table a fitting tribute\
      \ to an American classic!"
