      \ crop fields to grow all kinds of vegetables. You\u2019ll also have a farm\
      \ with chickens and pigs to take care of. <br><br>But be careful, because this\
      \ isn\u2019t as easy as it looks! You\u2019ll also be able to fish in a pond\

      \ feel like you\u2019re growing up with Koa, bonding with her and with all the\
      \ other people in the archipelago.<br><br>You\u2019ll be able to sail to new\

      \ over twenty characters, each one with their own story and lives. They\u2019\
      ll give you quests, hints about the world, or just anecdotes about their experiences\
      \ and travels. Getting to know them is a significant part of the game, so we\

    review: "After finishing he demo and getting super hyped, I was afraid that Summer\
      \ in Mara would eventually disappoint. But it does not! I simply cannot stop\
      \ playing - the vibrant world, colorful graphics, cheerful music, funny characters,\
      \ and the neat attention to details keeps me glued to the screen. I must pick\
      \ the all the fruits, feed all the dogs, recycle (who leaves trash near the\
      \ beach, really!), make all the juices, catch all the fish, learn to craft new\
      \ things, and Oh its a lot to do when you have a tiny island in Mara! \n\nSummer\
      \ in Mara is a very cute, super optimistic and pleasant game and I suspect it\
      \ will keep my attention for quite a while. After 2 hours of trying to stop\
      \ playing but being unable to, I was not asked to slay anything, nor go explore\
      \ any dark dungeon, nor become some obscure and mighty hero. This game is a\
      \ breath of fresh air in a time when we all could use some cheerful optimism\
      \ on a sunny island with golden beaches. Now please y'all, wish me luck that\
      \ I can get some sleep - it's 2am!"
