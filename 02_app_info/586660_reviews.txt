Exploration is rewarded, which, together with several bonuses, adds to the replayability factor â€” as does the main mechanic. In short, you talk to people, solve puzzles, explore, and write.\n\nFor more precise interactions, verb input is required. Trackless improves the historically often tedious word search by allowing for a larger range of words for each interaction and rewarding the player for originality or precision, so a player, who wants to move on, can do so with the most plain of word, while others can take their time to get more bonus points. These points are by no means important for progress (with one exception), but allow you to spice things up a little. Some of the upgrades you can get will be more helpful than others. Not much is told about them, and you might even miss them being upgrades (as did I during my first playthrough), so you will have to explore and experiment.\n\nThe phone you carry has a few important features that you better keep an eye on and also functions as a radar, which is a nice, immersive way of showing you which objects are important and which are not. The music goes very well with the over-all mystical vibe. \n\nFor me, as a non-native angloglot, I found the game motivated me to try and extend my vocabulary, which is always welcome.\n\nYou can finish the game pretty quickly if that is your only aim, but with some proper reflection and exploration you'll find that you can spend more than just a few hours with it. I've gotten all endings, explored a lot, played the game twice from start to finish, and still feel that my 11 hours already spent aren't enough: there's still more to discover. The game encourages you to take it slow, which fits me perfectly, since I am quite the opposite of a speedrunner.\n\nFull review:\nhttps://maskinkultur.com/2020/05/13/trackless/","timestamp_created":1589438549,"timestamp_updated":1589698338,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzfPZkPICfKfOhwI="}
