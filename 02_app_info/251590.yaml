    review: "So...okay.\n\nI remember when I added this game to my wishlist.  A LONG\
      \ time ago, almost a year now I believe.  At that time, it came across like\
      \ a standard RPG.  It seems (at least according to the developer) that based\
      \ on a desire not to go with the traditional mechanics, the game has now changed\
      \ to something more resembling a visual novel with occasional airship-ness.\
      \  I believe the airship-ness is what they wanted to use as the selling point.\n\
      \nNormally this would be okay, except that (at least from what I did play) the\
      \ game has become absolutely dry.  Instead of a fully explorable 3D world, you\
      \ are basically just advancing text like a visual novel.  A visual novel is\
      \ NOT what I wanted, else I would have bought that kind of game.  \n\nThings\
      \ just \"happen\" - here's a guildhouse for you, here's an airship for you,\
      \ here's your first guild member, etc.  There's no real \"build\" to any of\
      \ it and the story isn't enticing to go through.\n\nI could forgive the pacing\
      \ issue, if it weren't for the horrible airship parts.  Controls are clunky\
      \ (in my opinion) and it's just an exercise in fetch quests.  Looks nice, but\
      \ not fun compared to what originally attracted me.\n\nSadly, I did ask a refund\
      \ because this isn't at a point where I even see potential to get better.  Not\
      \ without a complete rewrite (which I know won't happen).\n\nI am always willing\
      \ to forgive developers that get it wrong when they fix it.  And he appears\
      \ to be course correcting. But he maintains a very smarmy, very arrogant attitude\
      \ about it - like he's offended that so many people dislike his current direction.\
      \  Maybe, sir, you need to understand that your vision is your vision, but you\
      \ then will reap what you sow if people don't like it.\n\nWorst case, release\
      \ two games - the original game you put out AND this other Frankengame that\
      \ you developed and see which is more popular by sales numbers.  Because at\
      \ the end of the day, that's all that matters - what's going to sell, not necessarily\
      \ what YOU like.\n\nHere's what we ALMOST got, by the way.  Now, if the below\
      \ video is an insta-buy for you, let the developer know this.  Please.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUn2KX-bppQ\n\
      \nBut in the bigger picture of a thing, if you choose to try this game, be forewarned\
      \ of how you will be treated by a developer that will happily take your money\
      \ and not respect you as a customer.  He'll ban you for challenging his design\
      \ direction and threaten you for trying to help him understand that he got it\
      \ wrong.  It happens.\n\nThe difference is - as with No Man's Sky, for example\
      \ - instead of going dictatorial, they FIXED their game and welcomed criticism,\
      \ instead of asking for an echo chamber."
