    review: 'Amber Maiden is the first in the Spirits of Mystery series and has the
      look and feel of an older HOPA game. It doesn''t support widescreen, there is
      no map, and the HO scenes are made up of many jumbled objects (although always
      objects that fit the scene).  There are no achievements, and thus no penalties
      for using hints when you need them.  Despite what may appear to be a list of
      negatives, this is a well-constructed game with nice visuals, and I have no
      hesitation recommending it to those who enjoy HO scenes.  In fact, if you enjoy
      word lists and more old-style HOPA games, you may enjoy Amber Maiden more than
      more recent games.


      [b]Overall:[/b] An enjoyable game despite the lack of fancy options, collectibles,
      or map.  It''s old-school, but has lots of game play and looks nice enough since
      there is no attempt to force it into a wide screen setting.  Buy it on sale
      and relax!


      Pros:

      - lots of HO scenes

      - a reasonable number of puzzles (mostly easy, a few more challenging)

      - no glitches (running in Windows 10)

      - bonus chapter (short, but adds new HO scenes and locations)

      - basic story that provides a coherent vehicle for a straightforward HO game
      with nice art and locations

      - music is slightly repetitive, but not bad

      - voice acting is limited but generally decent


      Cons:

      - no map, no collectibles, no variety in HO scenes (word lists with 2-3 concealed
      objects)

      - very basic, linear story (but it flowed well, and the various locations fit
      together)

      - no widescreen

      - resolution for HO scenes is moderate'
