It takes a long time to play. It is a game that you play for a while and then stop and go back to at your leisure.  You you want an instant gratification game, it is not for you.  It can be tedious at times. So before you buy, understand the game for what it is and is not.   I took a chance on the game  in spite of the negative posts. I like train games and  it was a cheap game to buy.  Think of the game this way. It is a puzzle with many pieces that you can go back to at your leisure. Also, you have the ability to start the game over again and try a different strategy.","timestamp_created":1575790180,"timestamp_updated":1575790180,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499923348426818848","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6r6a8u4CfNfx4gE="}
