    review: "Serious Sam 2\n\nSerious Sam 2 is a first person shooter developed by\
      \ Croteam and published by 2K Games in 2005. It is known for being the weirdest\
      \ game in the franchise due to its vastly different atmosphere and overal tone.\
      \ \n\nThe original Serious Sam is a retro-like first person shooter that depends\
      \ on hoards of enemies, big guns and a badass protagonist. Serious Sam 2 takes\
      \ a drastic change from its original 2 encounters. It sticks to the original\
      \ gameplay, but mainly changes in the visual and story department. the game\
      \ is made like a cartoon, and cutscenes are now more comedy orienter rather\
      \ than story oriented.  The gameplay is the same as the original: strong guns,\
      \ tons of enemies and open levels. The music and graphics are, honestly, amazing.\
      \ The music is very well made and has multiple general like tribal beats, techno\
      \ beats, hard rock music, etc. Damjan Mravunec made a fantastic job with the\
      \ music and even sound design, as the guns feel strong and satisfying (besides\
      \ the revolvers and uzis, that have both weak damage and weak sounds). The graphics\
      \ are also really nice, I personally like it more than the graphics of the last\
      \ games. Everything is very colourful, vivid and you can easily see where enemies\
      \ and items are. What changes up the formula is that most weapons can be used\
      \ in any situation so swapping between them isnt as necesarry. A great example\
      \ for this is the minigun. It was made stronger and it doesnt eat through your\
      \ ammo nearly as fast as before. It can be used against bosses, large amount\
      \ of enemies or even against bigger bad guys. It simply fits any situation.\
      \ Another change is the grenade. Sam can now collect and use grenades whenever\
      \ he wants. These are very convenient and useful and i like how well they work\
      \ in the game, without making the game too easy or unbalanced. The enemies in\
      \ the game also got changed up, and there are even completely new enemies. The\
      \ beheaded soldiers (besides the kamikaze) are now orc soldiers and have different\
      \ attacks. The bio-mechs are now replaced with a T-mech, which is just a rocket\
      \ shooting T-rex with a cigar in its mouth. The laser bio mechs are now bull\
      \ sodiers, either tank-like that shoot lasers, or human-like with rocket launchers\
      \ (like a mini t-mech, but as a bull) and they both speak Croatian, often trying\
      \ to intimidate you. The game also includes a few vehicles, which have some\
      \ sort of weapon on them. Besides that, there are also turrets, but those are\
      \ more uncommon.\n\nThe story of the game is what confused many people and turned\
      \ them away (which also includes the tone and weird design of the games world).\
      \ Sam is tasked with finding pieces of a medallion that would help him weaken\
      \ Mental. Each piece is located on a different world, guarded by a boss. The\
      \ first world is a tribal themed one, where Sam fights a giant gorilla named\
      \ Kwongo. The second world is Magnor, which consists of a swamp, a giant tree\
      \ village and finally a giant themed garden, where you face off against ZumZum,\
      \ a giant bee. Next is Chi Fang, a china themed world that is ruled by Prince\
      \ Chan, a big fat cannibal human. Then, we have Kleer Planet. A hell-like world\
      \ with rocks, lava, and tons of Kleers. There you will fight a skeleton wizard\
      \ named Kleerofski. Lastly we have Eleniere. It is a fantasy inspired world\
      \ very similar to Shrek, but it has an Elvis theme. Here u have to save a princess\
      \ from a dragon named Cecil to convince the King to give you the last medallion\
      \ piece. But this isnt the end for Sam. He then travels to Kronor, the moon\
      \ of planet Sirius where he activates a laser and frees some prisoners so they\
      \ can all enter planet Sirius. After Sam defeates a giant toy robot on Kronor,\
      \ he enters Sirius, but just before the opening of the shield closes. Once inside,\
      \ after some exploring, he gets captured and placed in a sadistic game show\
      \ where he later gets rescued by the resistance members. Sam then travels to\
      \ Mentals home, defeats his robot building and attempts to kill Mental. His\
      \ plan fails, because Mental escaped just as Sam arrived. And thats it. The\
      \ plot acts as if it never existed then, yet opens the possibility for a sequel.\n\
      \nSerious Sam 2 is a big step away from the original Serious Sam games, only\
      \ linked to them through gameplay and characters. But, even with all these flaws,\
      \ i believe that the game is still really enjoyable and fun to play. The story\
      \ and enemies may be wacky, but they are quite interesting in design and offer\
      \ a wide variety of targets to shoot. The guns are also preety enjoyable to\
      \ use. Some arent very satisfying, like the revolvers and plasma gun, but the\
      \ weapons like the double barrel shot gun and minigun are preety fun and devastating.\
      \ The story is obviously not taking itself seriously, but it is at least some\
      \ kind of motivation to keep playing. Some cutscenes honestly made me chuckle\
      \ a bit, like Sam getting stuck in Magnor. The music is also a big highlight,\
      \ as it offers various generas and are well made. The graphics are the most\
      \ colourful in the franchise, so its easy to spot enemies and just enjoy in\
      \ the beauty of the levels. In the end, i recommend playing this game if you\
      \ are a fan of FPS games and Serious Sam."
