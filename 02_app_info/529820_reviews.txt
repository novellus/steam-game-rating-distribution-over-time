I used the Oculus Rift S and It worked completely. It isn't even compatible yet. I bought it for myself and my friend. We played it for 1.6 hours and I'm about to buy it for my little bro. I recommend this for people who really want a VR game that's like Dragon Ball. I do wish that there was something you could do to charge your energy faster other than waiting, but at least it goes up. And even though it worked completely for Oculus, there are still some bugs so I ask for full Oculus support please.","timestamp_created":1578920029,"timestamp_updated":1578920029,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tPW9z+8CcO7c6wE="}
