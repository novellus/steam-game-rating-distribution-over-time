The good first. MOON KNIGHT great and fun table for all skill levels. I enjoyed my time with this table very fun. X-MEN: another fun table but a little harder then Moon Knight. However still good.\n\nThe Thor table I was mixed on. Their was one shot where I could not hit on a consitant basis to complete this one mission. So their is that. Not a bad table. Need a good skill level to get very far in it.\n\nThen we come to Ghost Rider. OMG. Bad. I am going to say it right here. The game makes no sense of what your supposed to do or how to do it. Yes if you read the instructions or go online you can enable stuff right away. If your a reg. joe just playing this your going to be confused and baffled by the game. This game could have been great however its a confusing mess of a game as is.","timestamp_created":1450917870,"timestamp_updated":1450917870,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm7fc6NECe4jxSw=="}
