      focus on story. Play as seven different heroes, all with their own abilities
      and playstyles. Fight through steadily greater hordes of enemies, as you learn
      about each character and find out what happened in the cursed tower you find
      yourself in.<br><br>Greatly inspired by 90's era action-RPG's, but with a faster
      pace and a focus on randomized replay value.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Customize
      each character with their own upgrades and equipment sets that change their
      movesets and abilities.<br></li><li>Over 100 different monster types. Over 300
      hats (IMPORTANT)<br></li><li>Unique story events for every playable character.<br></li><li>Many
      different areas, room types, rare rooms, encounters, and secrets.<br></li><li>Unlockable
      game modes, including Endless Mode.<br></li><li>Heavy replay value due to randomly
      generated levels, multiple character types, and randomized enemy groups.</li></ul><h2

      /><br><br>Renee uses her mobility to dash through enemies. Her Power Attack
      is a kick that stuns, with effects depending on her boots. She frequently finds
      items that let her blind, stun, or poison enemies. All of these let her perform
      very damaging backstabs.<br><br><strong>Equipment and Upgrade Examples:</strong><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Mirage Dagger randomly gives her short bursts of stealth during
      her dashes.<br></li><li>Giantstomper Boots upgrade her kicks to send enemies
      flying far back. Flung enemies will then damage and stun enemies they crash
      into. The Giantstompers also interrupt larger enemies that are stun resistant.<br></li><li>Toadskin
      Cowters poison enemies that hit her, stunning them after a few seconds.<br></li><li>Her
      Low Blow Upgrade permanently makes it so defeating large enemies will make her
      next dagger attack stun whatever she hits, even if her slash hits multiple enemies.</li></ul><br><img

      /><br><br>Blythe combines durability with a big sword that cleaves a wide area.
      He has a shield to block enemy attacks, and throwing axes for when he needs
      a faster or more long ranged option than his sword provides. <br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Duskhander
      Sword replaces his default Power Attack's charging slash with a whirlwind spin,
      hitting enemies over a larger area.<br></li><li>Magebane Gauntlets reduces the
      damage of enemy spells, while making his throwing axes destroy any enemy spell
      they pass through.<br></li><li>Stonebeard Slab is much more durable than the
      default shield, but makes him move very slowly when holding the shield out to
      block.<br></li><li>Drakefire Oil is an item the Warrior can use to make all
      his sword swings emit a traveling wave of flame, for a limited time.</li></ul><br><img

      /><br><br>Abbie has long ranged magic attacks that do heavy damage. Her Power
      Attack uses her staff for shots that are longer range and pierce multiple enemies.
      In a tough situation, she has limited use spells for both offense and defense.<br><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>Salamander's Breath Staff turns her magical shots into bursts
      of flame that pierce even more enemies, but have very short range.<br></li><li>Tremor
      Garb gives her a powerful footstomp that creates a shockwave to stun enemies
      and destroy enemy projectiles.<br></li><li>Manablade Arts lets her summon a
      sword that does high damage, interrupts enemy attacks, can reflect enemy spells,
      and has a small chance to stun.<br></li><li>The Mage can find powerful one use
      scrolls such as Fireball or Lightning Bolt, which inflict massive damage and
      stun to multiple enemies.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Four Additional Characters
      to unlock, each with their own abilities and story:</h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Cyril
      the Adventurer, who mixes quick sword attacks with a varied assortment of spells,
      items, and anti-magical lanterns that burn all nearby foes.<br></li><li>Hassan
      the Spellsword, combining mobility with direct shortsword attacks and fast charging
      attacks that can stun crowds of enemies.<br></li><li>Svala the Cultist, cloaking
      herself in stealth and blinding enemies to set them up powerful dagger backstabs,
      with options for more direct damage spells.<br></li><li>The fallen Paladin,
      who has overpowering magic and physical attacks, but has limited options for
      healing damage he sustains.</li></ul>

    review: 'I wrote my initial review at 10 hours, and now I am writing a new one
      after 200 hours. I stated that this could potentially be a masterpiece. I was
      right.


      Many of these negative reviewers choose to blame the game. They were broken
      down, and didn''t stand back up. Nothing meaningful in life is obtained without
      struggle, and the beauty of this game cannot be appreciated without it.


      It''s a beauty that doesn''t just reside in its gorgeous 16-bit pixel art out
      of the golden SNES era, atmospheric lighting, somber music, and creative enemy
      design. Or its story that is carefully fed to you in digestible bits instead
      of force-fed exposition dumps, memorable rare encounters that add more dimension
      to side characters, and world-building elements that allow players piece together
      themselves, if they so choose.


      Its a beauty that is within yourself.


      While the world-building is optional, piecing yourself back together is not.
      As you will be broken down and be forced to rebuild. You will write page after
      page of mental notes and will cherish your triumphs. Only to rip those notes
      in frustration and be reminded again that your best isn''t good enough. But
      atop the mountain with rolling clouds stretching across the infinite horizon
      you will find something that cannot be experienced for you, because it is unique
      to you and only you. Yourself. Nothing meaningful in life is obtained without
      struggle, and the beauty of this game cannot be appreciated without it.


      For every death comes a choice; to learn more of ourselves, or to lose more
      of ourselves.



      Choose.'
