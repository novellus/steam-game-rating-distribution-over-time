    review: "This game is something different, it's a base building/space survival\
      \ game that focuses on mechanics of survival equipment and atmosphere manipulation\
      \ (both in base and out) to survive and push ahead.\n\nIt's not for everyone,\
      \ but those that enjoy a technical challenge that can be increased or decreased\
      \ in difficulty as you learn.\n\nGraphics are pretty simple, but the gas, power,\
      \ etc simulations are pretty in depth.\n\nSurviving the elements and space itself\
      \ is a challenge, from volcanic like planets, to mars, and the moon, building\
      \ a base to thrive and eventually build a rocket, farm, or experiment.\n\nThe\
      \ UI is different and uses a left hand/right hand mechanic that takes some getting\
      \ used to but it's not bad once you've learned it.\n\nAlot of fun can be had\
      \ in the Ooops moments, too much pressure can and will turn things into bombs,\
      \ mixing the wrong gasses in too hot an environment has ..flammable.. consequences.\
      \ \n\nI enjoy the challenges, and the community is full of helpful people, and\
      \ it's not unusual to see the head developer or other developers conversing\
      \ in discord about things.  The development team is one of the best i've ever\
      \ encountered when it comes to content addition and overall involvement in the\
      \ community at large.  \n\nI totally recommend this game if you're technically\
      \ minded and looking for a fun challenge, though at times can be a bit grindy\
      \ when it comes to mining (though there are solutions there).\n\nYou can control\
      \ things with programmable ic chips, or good ole fashioned buttons, and your\
      \ level of automation is entirely up to you."
