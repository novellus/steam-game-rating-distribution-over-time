Expect to spend a lot of time in transit, but there's a lot to enjoy along the way.\n\nGoing at barely highway speeds with a great-handling plane with excellent visibility makes it weirdly good at ground attack, provided nobody is shooting back at you. There's enough time to really get to know your targets before hosing down the poor convoy with rockets and bullets.\n\nIt's goofy, sweet, and a very nice ride.","timestamp_created":1606522716,"timestamp_updated":1606522716,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9ueNhvYCe5iGtAI="}
