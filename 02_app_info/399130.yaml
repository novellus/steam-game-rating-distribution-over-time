      with simple arcade mechanics (move left, move right, high attack, low attack),
      and it starts you off with an easy amount of zombies to re-kill. But each level
      adds more and more zombies, and eventually dogs that will chew your face off
      in a couple seconds.<h2 class="bb_tag">New in the Awesome Edition</h2>For people
      who play the whole game in one sitting I wanted to give them a break from the
      repetitiveness of hacking and slashing 2D zombies. So in the later half of the
      game I added new levels where you hack and slash (or shoot) 3D zombies!! Pretty
      brilliant right? I think so.
