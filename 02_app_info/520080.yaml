    review: "[b] Your Star [/b] is somewhat of a cult classic among horror enthusiasts.\
      \ It is kind of like a weird mixture of Silent Hill and Witch's House (plays\
      \ like RPG-maker but it has 2 worlds). This game has some serious technical\
      \ issues and very cryptic puzzles. You definitely have to enjoy a campy experience\
      \ to tolerate its flaws. Nevertheless, Your Star is a relatively unique for\
      \ a horror adventure. I have played a crap load of RPG-Maker horror, but this\
      \ game is weirder than all of them. Now there is a free version of this game\
      \ on the internet, which is actually available from the developer. However,\
      \ the Steam version has more polish,new puzzles and improved effects. If you\
      \ having second thoughts, you can always use the free version as a \"demo\"\
      , to see if you want to buy the Steam alternative. Unlike most of the games\
      \ in this genre, Your Star is completely hand drawn, which is always better\
      \ than assets if you ask me.\n\nThe gameplay includes combat, resource management,\
      \ and lots of puzzles. I had to use pencil and paper for some of the riddles\
      \ that require math, so don't expect it to be straight forward. About 60% of\
      \ the game is logical and the other 40% is convoluted, to say the least. There\
      \ is a neat alternate world mechanic where things are different (sort of like\
      \ Silent Hill or Fran Bow). You will also find different kinds of power-ups,\
      \ some of which hidden in secrets and side-quest. When you kill enough enemies\
      \ you will even level up your attributes and get items. Perhaps my favorite\
      \ thing about Your Star is a psychological aspect of the game design. Your character\
      \ has 3 resources which are mind, light, and will (basically health, ammo and\
      \ armor aura). I think Mind is the one that drains overtime as in your character\
      \ is going insane (even if you just stay still). The game sort of implies that\
      \ crazy events have the effect on the character and it also impacts gameplay.\
      \ Your Star has a very unsettling atmosphere, as a horror game should. I experienced\
      \ loneliness and sadness playing this game, with some relief toward the end.\
      \ It is very easy to get lost in the mood.\n\nYour star has a mature story that\
      \ was well paced and explained toward the end . There are side quests, secrets,\
      \ and even several endings. I am a little skeptical that someone would make\
      \ the effort to beat this game several times, just because it is so hard. It\
      \ took me 8 hours to beat the game without a guide, but do to glitches it was\
      \ closer to 14 . So with several endings, I would say game has about 15 to 20\
      \ hours worth of content .\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ a lot of content (8 hours+multiple\
      \ endings and NG+)\n+ alternate world mechanic (Silent Hill style)\n+ very campy\
      \ and spooky narrative\n+ hand drawn environment \n+ many challenging puzzles\n\
      + a lot of different gameplay mechanic\n+ psychological events have impact on\
      \ the character\n\n[h1] Cons: [/h1]\n\n- very glitchy\n- some music does not\
      \ complement the game\n- can be very hard due to cryptic logic\n\n[b] Final\
      \ Thoughts 7/10 [/b]\n\nYour Star is not for everyone. It is very unique horror\
      \ game, but you have to forgive its many problems. I personally value creativity\
      \ more than just a generic game with good quality. Playing this game is almost\
      \ a masochistic experience, a few can truly appreciate it, or have the patience\
      \ to get through it. You can always try the free version instead (Steam version\
      \ is better though).\n\n\n[code]For more hidden gems: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/\
