    review: 'I wanna get it out of the way that this is like a 5.1/10 positive review.
      In no way would i buy this DLC full price, but luckily I got the base game and
      the DLC for $20.

      Basic summary: Its a time loop story, ala groundhogs day, but they don''t do
      a fantastic job of taking advantage of what makes that genre work. What I mean
      by that is that in other time loop media you''ll see things like people doing
      certain actions because they know there are no consequences and rarely doing
      the exact same thing twice (because thats very boring). The first only happens
      like twice, which are both fun moments, but they''re just brief glimpses of
      what could have been. The second is the biggest issue with this DLC. You LITERALLY
      do the same day four times. What do I mean by that? After day one, no side quests
      change. Period. What was new on day one is it for the rest of the game. It is...
      intensely annoying and boring.

      That being said, Bloop is a great character, I love the expansions this DLC
      makes to the MMPP universe, when the DLC isnt literally identical to the past
      day its actually very good, and the new cards are pretty decent.'
