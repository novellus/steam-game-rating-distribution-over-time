There is no real in-game quit button(in fullscreen mode), 2. you can't open the little steam window to look at achievments while in-gameand 3. The water that refills your energy does spawn at the bottom od the screen when you've already passed that point a bit earlier, and an added thing that goes hand in hand with no. 3 is that the flower has to be pretty close to the top of the screen for it to move upwards.\nAs I said earlier though those are quite minor complaints and the rest of the game makes  up for it.\nMost certainly worth the money(1,49â‚¬, as you probably can see).\n\nEdit: The thing about not having the ability to exit the game, I know you can close the window if you have it in windowed mode but if you don't it doesn't exit windowed mode when you disable it in the settings.","timestamp_created":1532022975,"timestamp_updated":1532023828,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.643970847129821777","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4o3v2eQCcIW3pgE="}
