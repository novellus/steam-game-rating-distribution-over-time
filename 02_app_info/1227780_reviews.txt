I think it still needs some improvements on indicating the number of building required for maxing Guardian Droids and Rangers. I just over built a lot of those droid and ranger buildings and I think a replay mode to view the towers in action from different points for gameplays would be really nice. And don't like that random upgrade on forged, it really makes a waste of resources.","timestamp_created":1583560798,"timestamp_updated":1609839612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.505494534969329834","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhuL66PYCdLLG9gE="}
