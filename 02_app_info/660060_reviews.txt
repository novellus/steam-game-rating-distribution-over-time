In my opinion, World of Guns is useless without at least one DLC pack - although theoretically you can unlock all of these ten guns on your own without paying money, it would take you weeks and weeks and weeks of playing time. \n\nHowever, do be aware that some of the guns in this pack, like the Desert Eagle, can be unlocked by other packs, and unlocking a gun for the second time is useless and you will have essentially wasted your money.  This seems to be an issue with all of Word of Guns' DLC and I find it pretty unfair. Don't buy the DLC via the Steam Window without first checking in the game's own shop whether you have actually already got the guns.\n\nBasically, a player has two options: he can download a single DLC pack of his favourite weapons and forget about unlocking the others. Or, he can purchase the Guns Full Access pack, which looks incredibly expensive at first, but if he wants to unlock everything it will prove to be the best value by a LOOOONG way. Especially when it is on special.\n\nIn short, I will recommend this DLC, but only because it was on special and I like pistols. The All Acess Pack would be better value for money in the long run, however.","timestamp_created":1510192783,"timestamp_updated":1510192783,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558629810810089111","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46aOgz98CepvnigE="}
