You could probably get around 5 non-consecutive hours out of it before you get bored and never touch it again (times may vary). Also this game is not coming out of early access so don't get your hopes up, the game is dead so enjoy it in its simple fighting state.\n\nI would recommend watching some gameplay of it, and know that what you see in whatever video you watch is all there is and there will probably never be any more.\n\nStill it's fun to feel like you are a bender in the world of Avatar.","timestamp_created":1589675804,"timestamp_updated":1589675804,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw1viDkPICeNehiAI="}
