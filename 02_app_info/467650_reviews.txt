Specifically, the fonts and stuff work great on a 4K display now, and the window is resizeable like a normal one. Additionally, the FOV and mouse sensitivity are not just fixed by adjustable. Since these where the big things I ranted about, and they are fixed, I've removed my previous comments.\n\nI have also ticked the box 'received this product for free' since the developer kindly provided an additional key, after I returned the original for a refund, so that I could test the changes and comment on them.\n\nThere are still some 'features' that are not optimal, but since the developer is open to suggestions and actually fixes things, I am changing my review from a don't recommend to recommended, but note that this game is very different to most and is probably an acquired taste.","timestamp_created":1572306413,"timestamp_updated":1575923837,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561752974987030029","comment_count":7,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1572372373,"developer_response":"Thank you for playing the game, I am sorry to hear you are not entirely satisfied with some of the features. \nUnfortunately the game was not tested on a 4k display. \n\nI would like to ask if I can make some changes such as:\n-Being able to change the field of view,\n-Adjust the font on the instructions/menu,\n-Adjust the mouse sensitivity for movement\n\nWould this help you to get a good experience and view of the game? Please let me know if you are interested to test these, give the game another chance and I can  look to provide an update."}],"cursor":"AoJ4hK2Y9u4CepmP1QE="}
