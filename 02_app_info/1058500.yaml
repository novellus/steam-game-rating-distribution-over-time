    review: This game is laughably bad. I played for 20 or so mins, couldn't figure
      out how to transform or do much of anything. The response time is sooo bad,
      When u do a jump u need to wait for a long animation to finish before u can
      move and the FBI is also overpowered, even tho u play as a robot, they do around
      half ur health in a couple of seconds. It also has a deception symbol in the
      mini map, idk what the point of linking this with transformers is, because they
      are great and this game is mega trash. (at least its only $1.50)
