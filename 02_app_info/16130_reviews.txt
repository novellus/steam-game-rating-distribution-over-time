After learning that this game still exists, I decided to purchase it and experience a nostalgic trip. I'm honestly surprised that I enjoyed this game even a little when I was younger. There is no game at all. You get on, feed your fish, sell a few, make them have babies, then get off for almost the whole day (even on 2x speed). Then you get on again and feed, sell, and f**k. Next morning- feed, sell, f**k. That's all there is to it.","timestamp_created":1608086525,"timestamp_updated":1608086525,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xKLbtPYCearMugI="}
