    review: "Super fun, have played many times. Combined with Mountains DLC and survival\
      \ mode it can be really challenging, especially if you don't have the maps memorised\
      \ and where certain things occur on them. \nThe controls can be a bit slippery\
      \ at times and sometimes the character can bug out. The cubs might also stop\
      \ following for no reason occasionally. However the bugs aren't game breaking\
      \ and you get used to them after a while and become able to work around them\
      \ so that it's almost as if they don't exist.\nThe graphics are beautiful and\
      \ unique although the repeating pattern can sometimes be a bit annoying to see.\
      \ However as long as you're looking at plants and not open ground or water it\
      \ shouldn't be too obvious.\nThe only thing that really annoys me is the auto-save\
      \ feature. Having to continue playing until it saves so that I can close it\
      \ is frustrating, especially if I suddenly need to do something."
