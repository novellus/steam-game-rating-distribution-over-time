It was a good idea with great atmosphere but the game portion needs some improvement. I was going to give the game a positive review because it is free (and that counts for something, even though I have played similar free apocaylse virtual novels that I enjoyed more) but I am now running into a lot of bugs and my crowbar has been removed as an option.\n\n\nSpeaking of crowbars... I don't get what the big deal was. I wouldn't call them a \"specialy\" tool: we always had one growing up and at the current moment I have two or three different types. But the game treated owning one as a huge deal... But it's just like owning a hammer - at least, where I live in the USA, it is.","timestamp_created":1488135729,"timestamp_updated":1488135729,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.538656532764434814","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49qXzvdoCd/Kbcw=="}
