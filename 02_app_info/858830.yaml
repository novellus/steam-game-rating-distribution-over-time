    review: "When I finished it the first time, I said that I like it\u2019s mini\
      \ game, hated the voice actor of the PC, and felt that the art was inconsistent\
      \ in its aesthetic.\n\nafter a 4th time playing it... \n- The mini game got\
      \ old. It was hard written into the narrative and there were some light to moderate\
      \ consequences to the story if you didn't win. So it wasn't like you could ignore\
      \ it and just auto lose to get it over with. \n- The voice actor is only super\
      \ annoying when she's trying to be cheery. When she was actually serious or\
      \ angry, I kinda liked it. \n- The art didn't stop being inconsistent, but I\
      \ guess my eyes got used to it. Steampunk american for the PC and French with\
      \ wigs for the nobility why not? :P\n\nAdditionally, I would have to say a HUGE\
      \ flaw of this episodic game where I got the implication you carve your story\
      \ out slowly is that the continuity is terrible. Epi 0, there was no romance\
      \ but none of the decisions I made in epi 0 mattered. I assume a cannon was\
      \ chosen for the 0.5 little story they wrote to bridge the gap to episode 1.\
      \ The character is hard written to be an ethical slut, and I use the term correctly\
      \ not pejoratively So the romances, even if they seemed to be going somewhere,\
      \ are hardwired to end in some way. I romanced -person A- in episode 1, and\
      \ in episode 2 I never saw person A or heard of them again, even if you chose\
      \ the events that would literally have kept them in town/ The game does ask\
      \ you about the decisions you made in episode 1, but they don't seem to have\
      \ much affect. Four main characters that are both in epi 1 and 2 treat PC the\
      \ same regardless of whether I said I slutted it up, didn't slut it up, argued\
      \ with them all the time, got along with them fine, or trusted/distrusted them.\
      \ And even in an ending where I tried to start a relationship with -Person B-\
      \ we break it off. And what I thought was a cool default poly option with person\
      \ C that occurred because you weren't with anyone romantically, it happens every\
      \ time no matter what. so... what does that even say about my romantic choices,\
      \ if PC is cannon open to a threeway with person C and person D?\n\nA visual\
      \ novel should also just have a \"skip to unseen text\" option every time. Between\
      \ having to manually skip AND play the mini game, I am unsure of how much of\
      \ the 23.5 hours spent on this game according to steam was actually enjoying\
      \ the story vs pressing shift, loading screens, and a turn based mini game that\
      \ sometimes lagged. \n\nThis has a strong but flawed female protaganist is absolutely\
      \ their own character and personality with a lot of auto default dialogue. I\
      \ found the story very absorbing the first round through. I recommend playing\
      \ this game exactly twice. Maybe a 3rd time, after a long break, to prepare\
      \ you for the episode 4 that hopefully will come out."
