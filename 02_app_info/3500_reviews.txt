These games are meant to play as a casual relaxing experience, and this is where this game fails, since it imposes a time limit (which is very easy to circumvent with screenshots, etc, so it's annoying and ultimately meaningless). Using time limits is a game design failure in my book -- I don't play games to have another deadline-related stress (I've got work for that), so this game gets a No from me. \n\nPS. BTW, if you happen to click through all items on a level too fast, you might get stuck without ability to invoke the mini-game that gets you another puzzle peace, and there's no solution for this. Sucks if you completed almost the whole game already (which happened to me).","timestamp_created":1608413446,"timestamp_updated":1608413446,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw96+6vvYCdLfEuwI="}
