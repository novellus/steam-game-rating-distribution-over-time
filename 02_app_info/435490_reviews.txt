I really, reeeeally want to, because I'm all about some arcade fun, but... oof. For instance, the controls are rough on some of the games. I'm playing on the Steam Index. In order to play the Skeeball game, you need to grip the controller. Obviously, right? Well, to let go... you need to let go, but then grip again. It's really weird and it'll make your throw go askew a lot of the time. Also, when you pick up a gun for ons of the shooting games, the gun doesn't point forward. It points straight down. So, in order to shoot forward, you have to hold it like you're holding it straight upwards a la rooty-tooty-4th-of-July-celebratory-shoot-in-the-sky... which sounds fun, but it's really awkward.\n\nAnd there's a sequel out? From my view, his one isn't finished... :/ I may need to get a refund.
