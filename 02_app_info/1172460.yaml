      \nIt supports custom themes (having its own designer), and has an addon system\
      \ for any future custom extensions (we are listening). <br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      You can design a surface where links, files and games are next to each other,\
      \ creating your personal computer workflow frontend. Handy with projects too.\
