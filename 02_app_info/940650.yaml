    short_description: Controversial Visual Novel that blurs the lines between fantasy
      and reality, as AR game developers, Judgement 7, see their creations break into
      the real world and threaten to destroy Tokyo. It certainly raised a few eyebrows
      on release, but few can argue with the quality of its rich story-telling.
