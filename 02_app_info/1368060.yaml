    review: Sokpop is an intriguing little studio. The games are incredibly fun, due
      in part to the simplicity and playfulness. I would probably play this game for
      hours if it didn't have so many bugs. If this game worked it would be worth
      much more than the $3 they are asking, but at present it is worth nothing because
      you can't play it long enough to get anywhere or do anything without reloading
      constantly. I hope this game gets fixed! I want to drive to my hometown.
