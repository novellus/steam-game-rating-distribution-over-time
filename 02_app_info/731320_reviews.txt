But incredibly lacking, especially for the price. You would be much better off putting your money towards any other number of platform games.","timestamp_created":1609095032,"timestamp_updated":1609095644,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.483697593212127686","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtuDk0vYCeL/rvQI="}
