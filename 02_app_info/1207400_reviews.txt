At the price you can't go wrong!\n\nKlym is about climbing buildings and leaping from building to building to find ducklings and then bring them back to their mom! The controls are, well, interesting to say the least; To jump, you must hold left click, drag the mouse opposite where you want to go, then release, and off you go! With general movement (WASD), you don't have a method of preventing you from falling of an edge outside of avoiding the edge (thanks captain obvious), so you can accidentally walk off an edge trying to make a long jump.\n\nDon't expect much replay-ability from this game, as there's not much to do other than explore and wear ducklings on your head to transport them to their mom! The game has 4 achievements, two of which you have to put effort into achieving without playing the game \"normally\".","timestamp_created":1592270615,"timestamp_updated":1594694331,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p43MpfMCfOmojgI="}
