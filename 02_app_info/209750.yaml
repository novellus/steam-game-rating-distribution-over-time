    review: "This is a fun game that you don't need to think too much about.\n\nYes,\
      \ it's true that it takes an unbelievably long time to load between levels.\
      \  It's no exaggeration to say there's ample time to make a cup of tea, boil\
      \ an egg and make toast in the time it takes to load. I've done it!  I considered\
      \ giving it a thumbs down for that reason.  But the truth is there are faster\
      \ and newer games that are so much less fun than Cannon Fodder 3 and I could\
      \ spend hours on an inferior modern game, be far less entertained and have no\
      \ time between levels in which to chuck the hoover round or feed the cat or\
      \ whatever.\n\nOther reviewers have compared it to the original Cannon Fodder\
      \ and I can see why they were generally disappointed but this is essentially\
      \ the same game with some modifications. There are a whole load of new weapons,\
      \ gimmicks and vehicles that, on the whole, look good and are fun to try but\
      \ hardly help you complete the missions at all. But I don't mind that.\n\nThere's\
      \ something strange about the way the game scrolls which is reminiscent of trying\
      \ focus on the landscape whizzing past you while you're facing forward on a\
      \ fast moving train which is distracting and irritating and takes some getting\
      \ used to. \n\nIt's not hard to play and not hard progress through the levels\
      \ but I don't play this game for a challenge. I play it to veg out.  So, I would\
      \ recommend this game for those times when you just need a distraction and you\
      \ don't want something that's going to take up too much brainpower."
