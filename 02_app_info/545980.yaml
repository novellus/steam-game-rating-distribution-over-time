    about_the_game: "The classic character platformer is back for the first time in\
      \ over 13 years, and now in glorious high definition! Vince\u2019s adventure\
      \ takes him from the streets of New Orleans to the depths of a Louisiana bayou\
      \ to find the whereabouts of his keeper, Madam Charmaine. In true voodoo style,\
      \ Vince encounters and defeats quirky monsters and villains ... by kicking his\
      \ own butt! By racing under a falling safe, jumping into a high-speed blender,\
      \ or leaping under falling rubble, Vince is sure to defeat his enemies\u2014\
      all while managing to escape completely unscathed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n\u2022 Voodoo combat action: Players can employ more than\
      \ 30 voodoo attacks that do outrageous things to Vince, but it's the monsters\
      \ who end up hurting! Unlike in other games, players must actually USE dangers\
      \ and hazards, instead of running from them. Falling safes, prickly pushpins,\
      \ and bolts of lightning bring a whole new meaning to the phrase &quot;no pain,\
      \ no gain.&quot; <br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u2022 Magical voodoo world: Thrust into\
      \ the depths of a twisted and dangerous world, Vince must trek through 30 detailed\
      \ levels, including crawfish-laden swamps, a graveyard filled with imps and\
      \ lost zombies, a fantastic French Quarter, and a network of boggy sewers. <br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n\u2022 Vehicles and minigames: As the game unfolds, Vince\
      \ must master and pilot a number of vehicles, including a fanboat, a submarine,\
      \ an airplane\u2014and even a rat gives him a lift at one point. Vince must\
      \ master one mind-bending minigame after another to complete his quest. <br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n\u2022 Dynamic cast of characters: No adventure would be complete\
      \ without its host of surly characters. Offbeat creatures with all the charm\
      \ of New Orleans are around every corner. Vince encounters everything from Ginger\
      \ Dead Men (who are not exactly sugar-coated) to a pair of intoxicated gas pumps\
      \ that offer up a fiery challenge."
