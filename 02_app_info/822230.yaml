      \nEach player controls a turret that fires magic missiles at the various dragon.\
      \ However knowing which dragon to hit at which time can be deceptively challenging.\
      \ What's more, with every magic missile you shoot, you spend a bit of gold.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce a dragon is sufficiently weakened, a player can capture\
      \ that dragon, gaining both its magic power as well as gold, weapons, and other\
      \ upgrades."
