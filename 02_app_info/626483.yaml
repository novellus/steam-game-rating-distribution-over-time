    short_description: The operation to capture Yamaguchi heats up as Hoshimiya Eiji
      learns it's all a ploy to turn him into a moving target for tactical nuke strikes.
      As the nuke draws closer, Eiji is forced to fight against all the hatred turned
      towards him as he struggles to save Yamaguchi from the nuke all by himself.
