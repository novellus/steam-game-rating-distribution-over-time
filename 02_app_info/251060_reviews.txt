There is no game at all. Just artillery, shoot, type up some cryptic profanity and quit out. I think Eugen are all sociopaths. \n\nThis game has a bit oif playability in single player but the AI notoriously cheats by spamming units freely while you struggle with very little so it is not so fun. Eugen uses bad AI to force you to switch to multiplayer which is toxic and cancerous.\n\nNever buy anything from Eugen cause they want to sell you hate, frustration and cancer.","timestamp_created":1558933619,"timestamp_updated":1610047437,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jMeT7/YCcreLwgE="}
