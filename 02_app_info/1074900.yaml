    review: Simple up-to-date tutorial. Helps one learn how to simply use Excel's
      advanced features. It will not turn you into an Excel prodigy though. You WILL
      learn how to use advance features but expertize will come by grinding use of
      Excel. I found that the printing tips were the most useful. Page layout, page
      breaking etc. Got what i came for.
