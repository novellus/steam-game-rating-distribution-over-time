It looks good, features great concept and vehicle design but also feels quite empty... And to play against the bots for me wasn't that fun at all, to be honest. \n\nFrom the gameplay aspect, the game is pretty straightforward, there is not much to do, you basically collect scrap metal from shooting down enemies or towers, then you bring it to the base, unload the scrap on the ground, get points from it, get upgrades with the points and use them in order to get more scrap, rinse and repeat until the timer runs out. \n\nHowever, I spent approx one hour playing the game, both, solo and against bots and after that, sadly, I had little desire to return to the game. I strongly feel what I got is not nearly enough for the price of 17â‚¬. I'm really not happy with the idea of having purchased another early access game that it's already dead on arrival, only to be rotting in my library. Sorry for the awful analogy, but it's true. I requested a refund, but In case it gets significantly improved in the future I will DEFINITELY buy it again and change this review! However, in its current state, I'm sorry, I just can't recommend it.\n\nOn a final note: I also have to say that the devs are a nice team. I have contacted them about an issue I've been having and their reply was quick and helpful! Kudos to the devs for the effort and the responsiveness. So perhaps there is hope for future improvement...?","timestamp_created":1524730254,"timestamp_updated":1526056926,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.423089265823364258","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws5eFqOMCeJWHnwE="}
