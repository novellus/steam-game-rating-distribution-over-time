    review: 'The first time I completed Undertale, I was shocked. I judged games too
      much by their graphics in 2017, so when I completed Undertale I just sat at
      my chair and didn''t say anything. I was so invested in the characters, the
      story and everything about this game that I was truly stunned. That is why the
      game is so special to me. The soundtrack is the best video game soundtrack ever
      made: every song is catchy and links in with one original song. Words cannot
      describe how brilliantly crafted this game is: it is disguised as a simple RPG
      yet hidden underneath is a well thought out masterpiece. There are many routes
      that you can take in the game, and for me the game never gets old. In conclusion,
      you should definitely buy this game. It is a gaming experience that will stick
      with me for a long time, and I highly recommend it to all types of people who
      enjoy video games. 10/10

      Thanks for reading.'
