Now, maybe I'm a dumbass, but there was a LONG period where I was left in the town all by myself and I couldn't for the life of me figure out what I needed to do (thank goodness for walkthroughs!), but overall I think the puzzles were reasonably difficult.

If you've been following their relationship through the games like I have, this one's a real treat!","timestamp_created":1609932433,"timestamp_updated":1609932433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45uzc6/YCc9D8wAI="}
