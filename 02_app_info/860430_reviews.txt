The enemies are now a lot slower which helps but if you allow them to they will still move inside your character. It's an okay fix for the previous problem but it really sort of just hides it rather than fix it. It's better than before although it could use further improvement. The game is still a bit clunky and there is still some trial and error type of areas that quickly become frustrating due to there being no checkpoints. The platforming can be hard to judge when jumping and very punishing as missing a jump can often be an instant death. Great job on the update, I love how a bit of information on what you are supposed to do was added, that's great. The game is slightly better overall now but it still isn't where I'd need it to be to give it a positive recommend. It definitely feels better though, that's for sure.\n(End Of Update)\n\nI bought this because I liked the art style and the fact that it had something to do with burgers. Unfortunately, it isn't quite up par in many ways. I wish the controls were better but they are pretty bad. There were a lot of mistakes made with this game, I think these developers are fairly new but it seems like they tried.\n\nThe story is pretty cool, at least what's written here on the Steam description. There is a bit of a cutscene before the game starts to give a tiny bit of the story but i wish it had the whole story, also that it was skipable because it doesn't seem to be.\n\nThe controls are probably the worst feature of this game. On the xbox 360 type controller for PC, the right analog stick is move and X is attack with A for jumping. This means you have to use both hands on the right side of the controller in a very awkward way. The keyboard is much better but still not very good with E being attack but when using wasd, pressing E is awkward. Unfortunately there is also no possible way to remap your keys or buttons so you are forced to play with these brutal controls.\n\nThe hit detection is pretty weak. Your hits register most of the time but enemies will move inside of you causing constant damage over time and it feels very wrong. Because of this the game is extremely hard in a way that it shouldn't be.\n\nThere is no tutorial or instructions on how to play at all. You can pick up bullets bu there is no mention of a gun and none of the buttons on the keyboard or controller fire these bullets. I have no idea what they are for.\n\nFirst Impressions / Gameplay Video\nhttps://youtu.be/_-WqiDIaUkM\n[b][url=store.steampowered.com/curator/18710490/] --> Follow My Steam Curator Here <--[/url][/b]\n\nI like the art style and the story. I hope the devs can update this to make it better. I wasn't able to make it past the first level or even get to the boss. The controls really are that terrible and I can't recommend this in it's current state unfortunately.","timestamp_created":1527735571,"timestamp_updated":1529250303,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.643373072147369385","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wfmah+QCcLTdoQE="}
