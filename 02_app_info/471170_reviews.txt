This game has workers that you need to assign to tasks that then take time to complete; and there's a reward for finishing on time. Gameplay is using these workers to build houses that generate income and infrastructure that adds bonuses to this income, wasting as little time as possible while following an efficient building strategy. The staple of time management games, clearing obstacles for resources, is also present, but mostly you can simply buy resources from your income.\n\nRomopolis differs from typical city builders in several ways:\na) small maps (5x5 max.)\nb) no running expenses, the city is always profitable\nc) population figures don't depend on how well the city does; if you build a house, it's populated, and its income depends only on the bonuses applying to that house\nd) no street building, no utility lines, no traffic\n\nI believe this is a nice change from typical time management game in that it has less micromangement: you don't need to send workers to clear roads, you don't need to send workers to repeatedly harvest stuff, you can focus on managing the buildings to achieve your goals, which means the levels are less cumbersome and faster to complete.\n\nIf you're looking for a casual city builder, you're going to be disappointed; and that's the reason for most negative user reviews.\nBut if you like to play casual time management games, and are looking for something different, you could give this a try! The developer has also published two similar games, [i]Townopolis[/i] and [i]Megapolis[/i], so there's more material if you find this game too short.\n\nRecommended as a casual time management game. Not recommended as a city builder.","timestamp_created":1609519316,"timestamp_updated":1609592660,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533333301544189453","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgtzM4fYCdaO5vwI="}
