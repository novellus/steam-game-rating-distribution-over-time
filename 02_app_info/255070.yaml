      \ characters to perform combos, chaining attacks and releasing a flurry of blows\
      \ in order to survive what lies beneath.  Your path into the unknown may start\
      \ out with three fierce warriors, but when you learn to possess your enemies,\
      \ you can challenge the abyss with their skills and combat abilities.  Each\

    review: It's a fun fighting game requiring precise timing and spacing in your
      actions. You die a lot. Beautiful art and music. The three characters are all
      unique and interesting though I like the starting one best personally. There
      are a few unlockable skills (6 per character of which 3 can be active at any
      given time) which make figuring out the combat a bit more interesting. I like
      that there's Chilean soldiers in the rift helping you fight,  love those dudes,
      especially the pistol/sword dude and shotgun/axe guy (spearman is fine I guess,
      but he's got molotovs instead of a firearm, so boo). Found myself trying to
      save them in combat as much as I could and kneeling at the wounded guys' sides
      a minute before dashing off into the abyss to avenge them. Good for a few hours
      of pretty fun combat at a time. Repetitive environments. Each character is stuck
      using their single weapon type. I enjoy the story, but there isn't much to it,
      you're part of a warlocks dream and have to go down and end it before it starts
      up again and the next hero gets a go, or just dive back in. The monsters of
      the abyss can be captured with your special ability once you charge it up through
      power ups and you can swap  to your captured monster and play as them which
      is a pretty awesome dynamic. When your hit points hit 0, you must control a
      Chilean soldier as they struggle to survive monsters and get to an alter to
      resurrect your main (and way more powerful than the little guys) hero.  The
      gameplay requires patience and precision, and sometimes you still get killed
      even though you did it all right, but that's life. It's a fun game with satisfying
      combat, great music, and a couple really cool and unique ideas well implemented.
