I'm tempted to refund it, but for now I guess Ill keep it. I mean it is quite cheap.\n\nThe game is quite ugly. it has some animations, but overall its not super pretty to look at. Considering its genre, a roguelike-Roguelite mix (or so it claims) thats a perfectly alright thing. I dont mind bad graphics if that means amazing gameplay!\n\n\nThe biggest issue for me is a total lack of guidance. The game plops you into a random part of town, with no gold and no items. Your mission is to kill the evil guy. Basic stuff. Well, some doors wont open, others lead into empty buildings, and the town itself has shopkeepers, a \"tip\" NPC, and soldiers. First I did the tutorial, which is quite nice and adequately explains the base controls. Thats it though- skills, how you get them, alchemy, and tons of other things that you'll find in the world arent even described in the tutorial.\n\nAfter that I started searching around. All I could find in town was a stool to fight with. I died a few times trying to attack soldiers to steal their sword. I then found a sewer, where I was insta-killed by a spider. I then left the town to the south, and got murdered by 3 bandits. I then left the town to the East, and again killed by 3 bandits. I talked to the tip guy- he said find a stool to fight with and take your time exploring! YEA........ I was pretty frustrated. I tried to talk to everyone- nothing helpful. The combat trainers need money to train or require level 6? Didnt even know there was a leveling system.....\n\nIn other words, so much of this game is left undescribed, I feel like I cant play. Most roguelikes use this to their advantage- DCSS forces you to relearn scrolls and potions every run, COQ has randomized weapons and artifacts. Everytime you die you learn something new, and you as a player get better. This game suffers from not explaining enough so I can actually start learning.\n\nBUT..... I've saved the worst for last. COMBAT. Jesus christ. This game is absolutely not a roguelike. The combat is real time, set in a grid, and just feels awful. Its like a rythym game without music- instead you get feet noises. Listen to the trailer with the sound on, thats what you hear all game. yea. well the combat is not strategic or smart or tactical. essentially, you sit still as a creature approaches, then hit space bar right as they are in front of you to damage. If you arent fast enough they hit you, and too early theyll hit you. So you have to time it just right..... did I mention you can only survive two hits? combat against multiple enemies is impossible. Its terrible. \n\nIf you feel like ambling around trying to dechiper this game, be my guest. I hope it gets wildly better over time, but seeing as its not early access I doubt it.\n\nAt the end of the day though, this does feel like someones personal project and I can tell someone really put in some serious effort into this game. Its by no means in any way perfect, but its more of a game then I'd ever be able to make! With some tuning and overhaul I'm sure this could be a great game, but as of now it is not.","timestamp_created":1603665663,"timestamp_updated":1603665663,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502074718475341797","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wYL7sPUCeb+SqgI="}
