      second in the Star Fleet series of advanced space strategy simulations. Having
      fought as an Alliance starship commander in Star Fleet I to stem the onslaught
      of the Krellan and Zaldron Empires, now you get a chance to try command on the
      &quot;winning&quot; side.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1470940/extras/sf2_015.png?t=1607708819"
      /><br><i>A Pitched Battle with an Enemy Starbase</i><br><br>As Commander of
      a Krellan Battlecruiser with four destroyer escorts (forming a &quot;battle
      fleet&quot;), your mission is to explore the star systems of the United Galactic
      Alliance looking for planets to conquer and Alliance warships to destroy. Your
      ships are equipped with the latest technology, including phasers, homing torpedoes
      and deadly obliterator pods. Also at your command are elite shock troops for
      boarding and capturing enemy vessels, and legions of Krellan warriors for planetary
      invasions.<br><br><strong><i>Star Fleet II</i></strong> gives you more depth,
      complexity, and realism than any space war simulation before or since. But that''s
      not all! <strong><i>Star Fleet II</i></strong> is actually two games in one.
      Every time you invade a planet, <strong><i>Star Fleet II</i></strong> switches
      to a complete planetary invasion game that allows you to control the conquering
      Krellan forces in their attempt to overwhelm the planetary defenders.<br><br>From
      up to dozens of military targets on the detailed planetary map, select and control
      up to eight invasion zones from your Invasion Control Screen, or take personal
      command of your units. Your objectives: to capture cities and factories; knock
      out shield generators, planetary defense phasers, point defense lasers, and
      missile launchers; and eliminate both UGA troops and native militia forces.
      Like combat in space, planetary combat is real-time (no turns, but you can pause!).<br><br>Explore
      uncharted star systems and planets - your landing parties may even discover
      the ruins of ancient civilizations that may contain beneficial alien artifacts.
      Attack and pillage planets, wipe out civilizations with a single command, interrogate
      prisoners from a captured starliner, then beam those prisoners into the sun
      or empty space to improve your crew''s morale! Who says command can''t be fun?!<br><br><img

    detailed_description: "<h1>Quick Description</h1><p><strong><i>Star Fleet II:\
      \ Krellan Commander</i></strong> is a complex and detailed space war simulation.\
      \ Starting with just a single Krellan battlecruiser, as you rise in the game's\
      \ seven ranks (each rank has five missions), you'll gain more complexity, such\
      \ as escorts, planetary invasions, and eventually full sector command. <br><br>Each\
      \ mission is a randomly-generated galactic war sandbox, and while you have specific\
      \ objectives, how you accomplish them is entirely up to you. No other space\
      \ game gives you this much depth, detail and control. Fight, board, and capture\
      \ ships, send landing parties and full invasion forces down to planets. Bombard\
      \ cities (sparingly, as you want as many cities intact as possible) from orbit\
      \ while avoiding planetary defense fire from high technology planets. It's all\
      \ here.</p><br><h1>A Bit of Background/Quick Things to Keep in Mind</h1><p>Version\
      \ 1.0 of this game was published by Interstel Corporation and distributed by\
      \ Electronic Arts. When this game was originally released in 1989, it was rushed\
      \ to market in order to get it in stores in time for the Christmas season. The\
      \ result was a very buggy release. Debugging and development continued until\
      \ 1991 with the release of an enhanced and fairly bug-free Version 1.5B, which\
      \ is the most common version found on websites that provide old games. Then,\
      \ in 2018, with the developer\u2019s original 486 PC back in action, the author,\
      \ Trevor Sorensen, resumed development to produce what is now 2.0.<br><br>As\
      \ this game came out in 1989, it has absolutely no multithreading of any kind.\
      \ Therefore, due to the real-time nature of the game (although you can pause\
      \ at any time), sometimes responses to your commands might be delayed a moment.\
      \ Have patience with the game, it's doing a lot at one time, from calculating\
      \ AI for dozens of ships and even individual torpedoes, to managing your ship's\
      \ systems and much more. <br><br>While the game might look daunting at first,\
      \ there are eight fully-documented and detailed tutorials in the game to help\
      \ teach you everything from basic navigation to ship combat to planetary invasions\
      \ and more. <br><br>Also please note that there is no mouse control in this\
      \ game, instead there is a detailed list of keyboard shortcuts at your disposal.\
      \  <br><br>This is the pinnacle of the DOS gaming experience from the 1980s.\
      \ Going in with these expectations will help you have a much better time. Thank\
      \ you!</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1><strong><i>Star Fleet II: Krellan Commander</i></strong>\
