Among a tank sim and bomber sim was a game called U-boat. It was a crude game released in 94 before I was even a teenager, with black and white graphics. Sad to say, I loved that game. Then, Deadly Games released U-Boat II, Drumbeat. This was similar to the first release however it had better graphics that were actually in color, better sounds (some of which were taking from Das Boot) and came with a booklet with all the info you needed in order to identify and sink enemy ships. I still have the book.\n\nAnyway, time went on, the games got old and I no longer played them. Fast forward to current time. I am a few decades older and regularly browse Steam for old games I used to play. I plugged in U-boat and up popped this game. I was skeptical at first but decided to get it and check it out. It is eerily similar to the original Deadly Games releases but up to 2019 standards with excellent graphics and more duties, control, options, upgrades, and tasks in order to survive and fight among other things.\n\nTo sum it up - you have to be a certain person in order to enjoy this game. I grew up playing these types of games so I love it. Deep Water really did a great job on this one. I can spent what seems like 30 minutes playing this and when I look at the clock, three hours has gone by. I would love to see future updates and releases on this one. Thank you Deep Water, again, great job on this!","timestamp_created":1610063683,"timestamp_updated":1610063683,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ428PR7/YCfLK0wQI="}
