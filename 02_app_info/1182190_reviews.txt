This means I've missed out on 3 scenarios and will have to play the whole thing again to get to them. They are not extra scenarios as advertised but alternative ones. Moral of the story, create a save for the start of each scenario in case you don't get a major victory. There should be a clear indication about the consequences of particular results so that you could restart before moving the campaign on. \n","timestamp_created":1605290708,"timestamp_updated":1605290708,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwomy4fUCet2UrgI="}
