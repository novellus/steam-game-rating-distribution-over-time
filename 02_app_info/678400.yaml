    review: "It's a fairly decent HOG based on the famous story by Edgar Allan Poe,\
      \ \"The Fall of the House of Usher.\" Of course, there's a lot of liberty taken\
      \ with how the story plays out, especially given the locations you visit. However,\
      \ it's not a bad game overall. I've played a lot of hidden object games...probably\
      \ dozens at this point, so I feel I can point out some of the positives of this\
      \ specific one.\n\nSince this is the Collector's Edition, you get a \"bonus\
      \ chapter/game\" (Not really a chapter like most other collector's editions.\
      \ This one has you analyzing some evidence from an unrelated crime to find out\
      \ who the culprit is. Hold up if you think this sounds good because it's not\
      \ as good as it sounds. I'll explain in a bit). You also get wallpapers, music,\
      \ the cinematics, achievements (that don't matter for Steam at all since they\
      \ don't count on here), and a strategy guide.\n\nThe map is a decent feature.\
      \ I've seen better in other games, but since there's a lot of backtracking,\
      \ you will want to use the map since it can allow you to jump to areas where\
      \ there are things you can do. Teleporting on the map helps a lot in games like\
      \ this where you're stuck going back and forth repeatedly over the same areas.\n\
      \nNow, for that bonus chapter/game I mentioned above. As you play the normal\
      \ game, you have to find these model houses in the game scenes, click on them\
      \ to get a minigame where you use a magnifying glass to find coins, and use\
      \ those coins to buy gear for your forensics lab. I know you think this probably\
      \ sounds cool, but it's not as cool as you'd think. I was pretty sure I got\
      \ every house and every coin in the game and still was missing like 40 coins\
      \ to have my lab completely outfitted, which meant I couldn't access the bonus\
      \ game...without replaying the entire game and looking for houses I might've\
      \ missed. No thanks. That's absolutely not fun and not okay with me. It pissed\
      \ me off so much I almost didn't recommend the game at all. As it is, I'm just\
      \ warning anyone who wants to play the game to look for those collectible coins\
      \ in the houses and check the strategy guide often to make sure you aren't missing\
      \ anything.\n\nThe HOG's were not that great. I did appreciate the ones where\
      \ you had to do extra steps to find an item, but overall, there were a few of\
      \ these HOG's that didn't seem to make a lot of sense (like finding all the\
      \ tiny pieces to make a shovel or all the miniature pieces to make a well-shaped\
      \ figurine). Not enjoyable. I've seen games do HOG's much better than this one\
      \ did.\n\nMinigames ran the gamut from extremely easy to \"what the heck is\
      \ this even supposed to be doing again?\" At least some of these minigames were\
      \ unique, compared to other games in this genre.\n\nBut, the biggest irritation\
      \ for the game (aside from the coin issue I already mentioned) was the ending.\
      \ It is abrupt...it's like, \"This is what you do..\" You do it and the credits\
      \ roll. There's nothing much to it. Not much of an ending, to be honest.\n\n\
      But, it's not a bad game. It's just not a game I want to play again just so\
      \ I can have all the coins to access the \"bonus game\" that shouldn't (in my\
      \ opinion) have required this to be able to be played. It's either a bonus you're\
      \ getting for buying the game...or it's not. I don't feel it was fairly set\
      \ up personally. \n\nOtherwise, it's an okay game for the genre and not a bad\
      \ way to spend a few hours. Mainly play the game if you really love HOG's and\
      \ like Poe's work. Otherwise, find a different HOG that might be less annoying\
      \ in the long run."
