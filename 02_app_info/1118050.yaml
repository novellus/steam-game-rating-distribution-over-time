    review: 'Some neat ideas, but when you get down to it its just Bejewlled with
      a lot of grinding and repetion added to it. The skills are just buffs, which
      your expected to keep farming levels to buy, you''re stuck with the first 4
      items unless you want to grind to get anything else and get it up to scratch
      and you have very little options in combat.


      It''s fun for a bit then it gets really repetitive and grindy. I was hoping
      for Puzzle Quest with mechs but this is not that


      It''s telling only 2 reviews have played for more than 10 hours'
