Not my favorite genre to begin with to be fair, but combat felt tedious, grindy and repetitive. Enemies seemed to soak damage, it just took forever, felt poorly balanced especially for an initial experience. And combat triggered way too often, I couldn't even take two steps and back to the grind. No tutorials or course, but there were few options to use anyway so I could figure out what little was there I guess. Animations of the characters walking looked way off, sliding at a speed inconsistent with the steps they took. The art style felt inconsistent between the backgrounds and characters. On the plus side, I feel like quite some work went into the game, although that doesn't make it fun for me unfortunately.","timestamp_created":1574644673,"timestamp_updated":1574644673,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569977164268493652","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nt2I0O4Cccy/3AE="}
