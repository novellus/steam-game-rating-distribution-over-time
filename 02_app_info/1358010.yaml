    about_the_game: "EBE is an action-adventure game set on a planet in the Lyra constellation.\
      \ The player takes the role of a small extraterrestrial biological entity (EBE),\
      \ who recovers a strange micro-device from a humanoid alien lying dead in his\
      \ crashed flying saucer. Using this device, the player will be able to connect\
      \ to an alien network, solve puzzles, see distant locations (some of them on\
      \ Earth), and bring back to life alien entities to contact the player himself.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nEBE takes you on a visit to another planet teeming with life,\
      \ from strange PSI energy-producing plants to small insect-like creatures. Everywhere\
      \ you can find remnants of alien civilization: old buildings, antennae, and\
      \ communication devices. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou navigate the little EBE through\
      \ the hostile environment: it can climb trees, rocks, or ancient buildings and\
      \ explore the alien world. EBE needs to collect PSI from living beings to recharge\
      \ alien devices. They can be used for seeing different parts of the planet and\
      \ secret locations on Earth. These hidden places serve as teleports for alien\
      \ entities to visit our world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the most distinctive\
      \ features of the game is it\u2019s unique visual style: The whole scenery is\
      \ almost all based on colorized drawings, resembling scientific illustrations.\
      \ The movements of EBE and most other creatures are not pre-animated but based\
      \ on physics - with the goal to make the alien world more organic and vivid.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nGameplaywise, EBE is close to an action-adventure game, with\
      \ emphasis on exploration, free movement, and solving of puzzles."
