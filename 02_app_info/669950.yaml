      \ /><br>Big Drunk Satanic Massacre is basically a shooter with strong RPG elements\

      \ where the main hero, Lou, is to find booze and rescue the hottest Mistress\
      \ from the clutches of a fat clown. The game consists of four levels / chapters\
      \ representing different areas of Hell, such as the hellish Big Wack fast food\
      \ caf\xE9, Skeleton Slums and the Red Light District. The idea behind those\
      \ levels is to kill specific bosses. Each boss represents a unique multistage\

    review: It is a very entertaining game to play. If you enjoy dark humor and are
      wanting to play a game where you just run around and shoot - this is the game
      for you. Now the only advice I will give is that every action has a consequence.
      But this game makes sure to allow you to have lots of fun in your choices.
