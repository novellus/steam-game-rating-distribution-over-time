    review: 'I played this game in my childhood and I loved to play it again. I''ve
      had a lot of fun in there and also laughed at some good dialogs. Puzzles are
      kinda difficulty sometimes but still possible. Except for that one puzzle on
      the door where you can open the chest: it''s impossible to solve. Otherwise
      it''s still a very fun and good game :).'
