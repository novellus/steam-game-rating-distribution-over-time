If you have experience with dabbling with manual mode, this is also worth picking up since it's quite curious to see how this game emulates the settings and see how this develop and as well give feedback on how this game differs in real life so the dev can improve this. \n\nI could see this being very useful to be as a teaching aid to encourage beginners to dabble with manual/shutter priority/aperture mode to expand their flexibility on taking shots.\n\nWhat you get for now (I'll constantly update this part as the game progresses):\n- 1 world/scene\n- Around a dozen of objects in the scene\n- Dusk time only\n- 1 Camera with the following features:\n    * Aperture control from f/1.4 to f/22\n    * Shutter controls from 1/125 to 1\n    * Screen emulates final photo you will capture (motion due to shutter will be emulated)\n    * Lens focal length from 6mm-150mm\n    * Aperture/Shutter/Manual modes\n- Only 1000x700 photo capture resolution\n\nCurrent issues I see:\n- Ugly bokeh on larger apertures\n- 1s exposure emulation is broken\n- Ground elevation not smooth so you get those weird sensation that the floor changes.\n- Distortion on wide lens feels wrong","timestamp_created":1482393464,"timestamp_updated":1482400613,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.580212950706481934","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4qMj9ktkCesTnbA=="}
