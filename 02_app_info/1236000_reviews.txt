Mines also count as towers... which is dumb since you have a tower limit number next to a mine limit number. The difficulty is wack as fuck. Love TD and have played and beaten all TD games that arent garbage but in this game shit happens and nothing fucking nothing you can do about it... Support shield tower is total shit as you can't put towers even close to each other. Game feels incomplete. I want to recommend but not yet.
