There is a huge storyline and also a lot to do around your horses. Also, you can play with your horse and lounge it, very nice. The riding is exactly as \"hard\" as it has to be. The lessons are sometimes repetitive, but this is what you do with young horses: repeat, learn, and then show it. I could spend days at the breeding center! I love that you can continue the game after finishing your story. Also, a lot of old characters from the series \"Abenteuer auf dem Reiterhof\" are included, that's lovely.","timestamp_created":1607454405,"timestamp_updated":1607454405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549549520015716553","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mPbvofYCfaifuAI="}
