It won't start on Mac OS X.  Supposedly when installed, when you start up the game a menu will come up that will allow you to select the DLC instead of the main game.  It doesn't.  It does come up on Linux, but it still won't play.  Too bad, because the base game is fun.","timestamp_created":1477617736,"timestamp_updated":1477617736,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.431485354900360107","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlKu4hNgCcvOTZA=="}
