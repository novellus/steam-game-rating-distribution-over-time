    review: "TLDR: I would strongly advise playing Howl of the Ravager before starting\
      \ the main game campaign. Only caveat is the soul-crushing end-game filled with\
      \ mazes that really yank you out of the story and turns the game into an endurance\
      \ slog of stamina and will to keep playing.\n\nHowl of the Ravager is a prequel\
      \ to the main game that reveals the back story of one of the playable characters\
      \ in the main game, as well as revealing some hidden secrets of the nobility\
      \ class. It plays exactly like the main game, minus the gear enhancing or party\
      \ member switching since you only have three characters and two of them are\
      \ Sword Bearers weilding two of the three legendary blades.\n\nThe writing is\
      \ excellent, but the game itself falls way short of being a good vehicle for\
      \ it. Art assets have a lot of clipping and flickering, world design completely\
      \ fails the plot and story at the end. \n\nStill, I would recommend the DLC\
      \ for the story, the revealed secrets, and to add a certain bittersweet enhancement\
      \ to the main game. I only hope that the horrible, horrible end-game slog doesn't\
      \ burn out potential players from playing the main game. This is just case study\
      \ number one when it comes to excellent story-telling combining with a poorly\
      \ developed vehicle to carry it."
