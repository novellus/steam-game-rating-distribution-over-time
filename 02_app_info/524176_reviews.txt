And you will get a real feeling for how difficult it would have been to pull off this operation (spoiler: it was unsuccessful).","timestamp_created":1555321558,"timestamp_updated":1555321558,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.62704843282699585","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv/KYkOoCet6jvwE="}
