    review: 'The beautiful music and wonderful artstyle did not save this one for
      me, unfortunately. First of all, there are no options. I was missing at least
      a volume slider and a fullscreen button.


      The game has three endings, I got one of them. Not sure if this was due to some
      choices I made, but the story seemed to end all of a sudden, right when it felt
      like we were getting started. Perhaps there is more in the other endings...


      For someone with no experience with Tarot cards, choosing the right one was
      purely trial & error. (Choosing the wrong one leads to instant fail + retry.)


      The UI is simple, working, but clunky. It feels like playing an old Flash game.
      The transitions between scenes and music switches did not feel smooth.


      It''s a trippy little story with awesome art, if that''s enough for you, this
      game is great. I wish there was a little more polish for the price, so I cannot
      recommend it.


      (About 10 minutes of my playtime was spent trying to make the game fullscreen.)'
