While the combat has a lot of different statistics at play there is very little in the way of skill or tactics involved, It's just a standard grid-based AP system with no twists or otherwise interesting mechanics or items.\n\nThe main story seems quite intricate but beyond that there are very few meaningful choices to make (other than deciding whether you want to make a random skillcheck or just start the combat immediately) and while the setting is interesting the writing itself is generally pretty mediocre and could have used more proofreading. Overall it's just not a very good RPG by any metric.","timestamp_created":1609894889,"timestamp_updated":1609901558,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj4nn6vYCfaLvwAI="}
