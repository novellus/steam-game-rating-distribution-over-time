The story is easy to follow and the gore is there. Another gripe is the dialog seems to be off... meaning people usually speak immediately after eachother without any sort of a pause. It happens here and there. Overall a great animation with no plot holes. Definitely recommend for anyone who enjoyed the first one.","timestamp_created":1559003922,"timestamp_updated":1600714558,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.643351733684539795","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo7mB2fQCfPaUwgE="}
