    review: 'I really like this game. I found it when I was trying to think of a name
      for a god (or trying to see if there a was a god with a name), and this popped
      up. It sat in my wishlist for a long while, until I eventually bought it.


      I do like it. Sometimes, the controls have a hissyfit at me (and I get titchy
      back), but the concept is amazing and the music is great. (I recently bought
      most of BARCHboi''s discography). The worlds are beautiful, and I love the aesthetic.


      -I''m not sure what the "multiple endings" means, but I have finished the game.
      My favourite room is the one with all the orbs that hum when you get close to
      them. And the one with the purplish twisting thing.


      -The lore is great. For some reason, it really reminds me of Roger Zelazny''s
      "Lord of Light," and it''s so beautifully twisted? Maybe twisted isn''t the
      right word but eh.


      I just really like this game. Definitely not fore everyone, but I really, really
      like it.'
