Most times it was an even smaller object (bed) that took more tile space.","timestamp_created":1560630452,"timestamp_updated":1560630452,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.612277865409851074","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8tu0rusCfoK+wwE="}
