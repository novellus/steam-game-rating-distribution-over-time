After seven hours of game play I would recommend this game.\n\nAt the time of this review the game is in Early Access and yes there are a lot of bugs that you will come across while playing this game. I strongly recommend that you try this game with a friend or two. It's not hard to learn, but having some buddies to learn with you will always speed up the process. After choosing a server you will spawn in a random location. The game starts you off with a broken weapon with a little bit of ammo. The gun will fire but it will most likely jam after one shot. Making your way to the nearest town is your best bet. The whole goal of this game is to prepare for the nightly hordes that you will encounter. You can choose to stand your ground or you can run away from the horde by running outside of the red circle that will show up on your map. You may also come in contact with other player on your journeys. This doesn't happen very often because as of right now there is only 15 player slots, but that may change in the future. There is in game proximity chat, but it is very delayed. The zombies and player models aren't the best, but they aren't too bad. The zombies look like titans from Attack on Titans and the players... well they just look off. The in game scenery was actually quite better than I expected when I first started playing the game. The game isn't too demanding so you shouldn't have a problem running it and I have yet to experience a crash. \n\nOverall, I rate this game a solid 8/10 and if you like games like dayz or 7 days to die I would definitely give it a shot.","timestamp_created":1609931774,"timestamp_updated":1609931774,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwg6va6/YCc6z8wAI="}
