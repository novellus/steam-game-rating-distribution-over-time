It reminds me of a classic \"Snake\" game but with a little more flare. There are plenty of levels to unlock, Centifeed body parts to equip, and several different types of bugs to \"eat\". I particularly enjoyed the Slime level. That level made me smile whimsically as I destroyed different colored slimes and collected their DNA.   In addition to the Slime level there are Desert, Forest, Water, and more levels to explore. \n\nI hope there is a mobile (Android and iOS) release of this game as it would be an even better platform for this type of game.","timestamp_created":1547481967,"timestamp_updated":1547481967,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mZ3HpugCeNuuuAE="}
