    review: "A very charming SIM/Visual Novel hybrid about a cat faerie called Nim\
      \ who is tasked to search for her prince in a city called Valora.\n\nYou have\
      \ 1 month to increase your stats than can trigger storylines of different Shakespeare\
      \ characters and get several endings that shapes the fate of Nim. 1 month doesn't\
      \ seem like a lot but this game has a lot of storylines, which actually made\
      \ me interested with Shakespeare's works. Not to mention a lot of endings and\
      \ different ending variations that gives this a high replay value. It was enjoyable\
      \ and addiction to the end.\n\nAdmittedly I was a bit taken back by the artwork,\
      \ but it grew on me and I find it quite nice. \n\nOverall a nice game!\n"
