Also, objects continually disappearing through floor and ceiling. Buttons discussed in tutorial are missing from the mapping. \n\nThis could have been good if the developer had actually bothered to play it through before release.","timestamp_created":1596525196,"timestamp_updated":1596525196,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrqaU3PMCct6jmQI="}
