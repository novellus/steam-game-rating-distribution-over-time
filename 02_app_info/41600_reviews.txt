I’ve only been able to play this out of luck with a really old computer. On modern Systems however it crashes all the time and for some odd reason there’s a message saying “Jump if you want to play” that just pops up at random, there’s no way to make this message go away, forcing you to restart the game. How ever there are some gameplay mechanics that just haven’t aged well, perfect example being the atrocious camera. I can overlook this but for other people this can be a significant issue. Now as much as I love this game it pains me to say it’s really not worth it unless you have an old pc and have heaps of nostalgia for it.\nWith the abundance of remakes and remasters of older games at the moment, this game really does deserves one.","timestamp_created":1607429696,"timestamp_updated":1607429696,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469798654317855835","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoNWRofYCdNGVuAI="}
