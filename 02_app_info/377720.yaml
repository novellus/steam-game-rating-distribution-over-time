    about_the_game: "Michiru's quest to save the world by sealing the Chaos that threatens\
      \ it is progressing flawlessly... except for the fact that her fellow Magical\
      \ Girl and rival, Kazuki, is beating her at every turn! She wants to prove her\
      \ worth as a Magical Girl, and win the Magic wish that can make her dreams come\
      \ true, but so far, all she's proven is that she's a failure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThen, just as it seems that Michiru may have actually done something right\
      \ for once, and earned Kazuki's respect in the process, a flash of light and\
      \ an ominous rumbling noise interrupt her rejoicing. Michiru is dumbfounded,\
      \ while Kazuki merely remarks: &quot;I never thought it would come so soon...&quot;\
      \ Just what could be heading their way?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis visual novel,\
      \ a spinoff of the popular &quot;Fruit of Grisaia&quot; series, follows Michiru's\
      \ adventures in an anime-like format of 13 episodes. It is split into two Parts:\
      \ Part 2 continues where Part 1 leaves off, and contains the last 6 episodes."
