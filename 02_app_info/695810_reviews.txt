Another six minutes until I had a 1,000+ horde. I was hoping there was something to spend the gold on, or anything.\n\nI like the art, I like the thought process behind the game, but it should not be on early access yet. Right now it's more like a proof of concept. I'm not going to refund it, but I highly recommend to other individuals to wait to purchase. Honestly you can watch a ten minute Youtube video and see the entire content of the game thus far.\n\nEdit: I did not realize the dev abandoned the game. Their website, Youtube, and the pages on Steam have had no updates for a long time. Do not purchase this game. In addition, their website offers the alpha version for a free download if you wish to try the game.","timestamp_created":1531086021,"timestamp_updated":1531169328,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.532293975353240967","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwuLmzwOQCcLrMpQE="}
