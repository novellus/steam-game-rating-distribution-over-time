    review: "[h1]Oh boy, where to start-! [/h1]\n[u]First[/u], this obviously ties\
      \ back to Hikaru Book 1 review. Idk if this review even matters sincei assume\
      \ anyone who buys book 1 will buy book 2 but hey, i'll get my opinion out anyway!\n\
      \n[u]Second[/u], i really hate that we dont have a \"information\" or \"neutral\"\
      \ option for reviews. I really dont want to vote this down, because its way\
      \ to harsh as a judgement BUT [b][u]i also write this for people who might have\
      \ second thoughts[/u][/b] -- [u]people who rather look at negative points instead\
      \ of bottomless praise. To get to these people i'll give it a negative review,\
      \ eventho it kinda hurts :([/u]\n\n [h1]Game overall: [/h1]\n- CS were good\
      \ but i would have hoped for more (or i'm used to get more of them in other\
      \ VN/Otome).\n\n-> the music loops seem to be a lot better in Hikarus playthrough.\
      \ maybe bc he got some new tracks too. anyhow its not a negative point anymore!\
      \ yay!\n\n+ Other that that the game is unusually polished\n+ i personally enjoyed\
      \ a more western/realistic artstyle for once \n+ and the writing was good (both\
      \ in grammar AND storytelling)\n+ the maincharacter is normal, in a GOOD way.\
      \ She reacts grumpy when someone is rude, shes flustered if its the situation\
      \ but shes not overly anything. The writing conveyed a fully fleshed charcter\
      \ wich you shape with your reaktions one by one. I really enjoyed seeing this\
      \ instead of one blunt character!\n(-? some of the options feel a bit wierd\
      \ in how he reacts. Like some of tehm make sense later on / in retrospective\
      \ but not all of them - its a really tiny problem tho)\n\n [h1]This particular\
      \ Route: [/h1]\n+++ well well well now we actually get some real hikaru time\
      \ - or this is what i thought. I mean the journey is cool, you get to meet up\
      \ with basically now the most important people of the game [spoiler]hikaru,\
      \ shizuha[/spoiler] and get to first hand unvail all the main secrets. Thats\
      \ really cool\n- but it comes at downsides. As i mentiones in the book 1 review,\
      \ theres barely no time with the main guy alone and if it is its always plot\
      \ not personal development. Like sure, the second kinda ties into the first\
      \ but not enough to get you anywhere out of the platonic radius. They kidna\
      \ tried to break through with the thoughy scene before the sealing, but it wasnt\
      \ enough.\n(and yeah i get that he wouldnt do much bc [spoiler]he was still\
      \ in love with HER[/spoiler] but then - and i'm sorry - plan ahead better next\
      \ time. You tell the story, and you need to make it so that in a romance plot\
      \ actually romance happens.)\n+/- we are greeted with a lot of cool fight scenes\
      \ and cool new music but in the end with the unvailing of all these secrets\
      \ new chars and world building we learn the actually main part (the relationship)\
      \ just is left behind, so that when it all raps up its really, really awkward.\n\
      [b](the long story:)[/b]\nHe was really cold and now they are really in love\
      \ bc of suffering and their destined. --- a point the writers kinda acknowlegded\
      \ in their ending(s) and epilogue as they talk about it feeling wierd and unsure\
      \ etc. But even tho it \"kinda\" gets resolved in a (literally?) steamy scene\
      \ it just doesnt really pay of. you dont actually see their relationship be\
      \ there or grow. Just telling \"they go on dates and hes percets\", just showing\
      \ they hug and hold hands and finally kiss (and more?) is not a relationship.\
      \ What i mean is: yeah you have a romantic ending as they get together but it\
      \ is an very unsatisfying one. \nLook at takumis route or maybe tatsuyas (or\
      \ i'm inclined to say ANY of the others) wich had time to develop bc they had\
      \ time to meet up and have interactions that made them get closer as persons,\
      \ as partners and finally as lovers. You had 2 books (and a lot of stuff to\
      \ fill all the gaps, i know!) but its really sad that the main point of it all\
      \ suffered bc of it.\n\n [h1]In short:  [/h1]\nIts an amazing climax and and\
      \ amazing story and twist (only toped by the chaos route maybe) but the romance\
      \ could easily have been the best of them all - yet it hardly lived uo to any\
      \ of the others quality (bc lack of time presented). My heart is really hurting\
      \ over seeing such great potential beeing swept away by something wich could\
      \ very easily have been prevented.\n\n[h1]Verdict:[/h1]\nIf you just want a\
      \ \"should i buy of not\"? then let me tell you, [list]\n[*]you probably should,\
      \ but dont do it for the relationship/romance. Do it for the conclusion the\
      \ story, the secrets you want to know. Do it for the writing and game over all\
      \ wich you probably grown fond of by now -- then you wont be let down (and maybe\
      \ even pleased with some unexpected sweetness - bc if you expect nothing, all\
      \ you get is better than what you expected, right? xD).\n[*]If you some how\
      \ end up here tho and didnt like the main story... well then it should be a\
      \ no brainer not to buy, ehh? ^^\"[/list]"
