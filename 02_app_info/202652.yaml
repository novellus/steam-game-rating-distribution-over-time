    review: I wasted $1.99 on this DLC.  It won't start on Mac OS X.  Supposedly when
      installed, when you start up the game a menu will come up that will allow you
      to select the DLC instead of the main game.  It doesn't.  It does come up on
      Linux, but it still won't play.  Too bad, because the base game is fun.
