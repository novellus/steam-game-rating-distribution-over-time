    review: Hmmm.... I think its overpriced for what it currently includes. The model
      quality is decent enough and even the texturing is ok (clean/new). It would
      have been nice if it included some alternative textures (used or worn/bloody).
      Also, this set has some odd choices of individual models (like door handles
      being separate from the doors or the single standing curtain,  IDK just kind
      of odd really, though I do wish the reception sign was its own entity). Its
      not bad overall but its not great either. I don't feel as bad about this purchase
      as I did about the construction site one. but still overall I just don't think
      its a good value for your money. Look at the antiques in the attic for a much
      better lot of models.
