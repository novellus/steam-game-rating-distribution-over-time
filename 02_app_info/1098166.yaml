      \ the 1980s rolled around, many of British Rail\u2019s regional passenger trains\
      \ were ageing and in dire need of replacement \u2013 however, the Government\
      \ were being tight on BR, and as a result they didn\u2019t have enough money\
      \ to produce a new unit that could bring a step change in quality across the\
      \ network.<br><br>Instead, another plan was put into place; 2 new trains would\
      \ be developed, the \u2018Sprinter\u2019 and the \u2018Pacer\u2019, one matching\
      \ the quality and evolution that BR were aiming to achieve, with the other being\
      \ a lower cost type that would get the job done but ultimately with the intention\
      \ of just being temporary. The Sprinters would be derived from the Mk3 body\
      \ shell profile and be put to use on urban, longer-distance services, while\
      \ the Pacer got its design from a very different source\u2026<br><br>The concept\
      \ was simple, use the body of the bus set atop what was essentially stripped-down\
      \ freight wagon, this ensured cost was kept to a minimum as very little bespoke\
      \ construction was required. There would be various Pacers based off multiple\
      \ buses, but the largest and most prolific would be those built with assistance\
      \ from British Leyland with their \u2018Leyland National\u2019 bus design \u2013\
      \ and these units were dubbed the BR Class 142.<br><br>A fleet of 96 Class 142\
      \ Pacers were built between 1985 and 1987, and they were quickly put to use\
      \ on regional services in Devon and Cornwall, as well as the North West. It\

    review: 'PROs:

      ====

      + Generally a nice model.

      + Generally nice texturing.


      CONs:

      ====


      - Train loads with no brake on; if you''re on a gradient you will roll as soon
      as TS loads.

      - No start up or shut down sounds: sound just ends/start abruptly.

      - No difference between cab and outside engine audio.

      - No change in sound when the window is opened.

      - Engine sound far too loud in the cab (even for a Pacer); not pleasant to drive.

      - Has different destinations for Lancashire region but these are not adjustable
      in use.

      - Does not rev correctly on power up (no torque converter simulation when in
      low power).

      - Supplied only in vintage (80s) paint.

      - There are many more cons but I''m trying the forget the whole torrid affair
      of buying this awful product.


      This Class 142 really is a new low for DTG.  Whoever did the rather good modelling
      and texturing has been thoroughly and shamefully let down by the utter disregard
      for any level of acceptable quality in SOUNDS.   DTG - You have always received
      some deserved criticism for poor sounds in releases but this is truly a new
      low.   The core engine sounds are not too bad but it''s how the sound has been
      implemented that''s the main problem.  Being in the cab is just an awful experience
      in the sim - the tinny engine sound is deafening.  You notice the engine start
      and stop buttons - then immediately regret pressing them - no sound simulation
      whatsoever of a start up or shutdown sound - the sound just stops abruptly.  Pulling
      away, the engine behaves nothing like a mechanical diesel with a torque converter.  RPMs
      are too low until you really open the throttle.  Having reviewed the sound files
      and PROMYXML files I can see why. The sound has not been set up at all to behave
      like a mechanical diesel with a torque converter and final drive.  Then there''s
      the fact that you load this train and it spawns with no brakes on - come on!!  Are
      you serious?  Something as sloppy but critical as this has not been fixed in
      11 months since release?


      Based on the modelling and texturing (particularly the cab texturing) this could
      have been such an opportunity to release a quality, much needed Pacer to TS.    Instead
      we have the most sloppy and quality-lacking release I''ve ever seen from DTG.


      DTG''s quality is so inconsistent.  You can buy a product from 2014 or so and
      find that the level of functionality and general quality is far ahead of some
      products like this, released in late 2019.


      DTG - Seriously, I''ve never written comments like this about you, I am not
      a DTG hater, I own almost everything you''ve released for TS and TSW ..........
      but this 142 is just 100% unacceptable.


      The final insult is that I spent hours trying to fix the sound files, and then
      testing in TS (to no avail), and was therefore refused a refund because of 2+
      hours of "game play".'
