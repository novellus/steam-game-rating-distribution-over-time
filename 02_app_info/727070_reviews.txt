You'll need to find your way around a hexagonal board, touching each tile to make it disappear - you complete the level when all tiles are deleted. At least initially, as with your progress, more and more types of hexagons will appear, which do different things - some won't even disappear (but in some levels, you can blow them out of existence anyway :) ).\n\nThe presentation of the game is nice but not spectacular, and the controls are appropriate. With one exception - there's no undo. It's an annoyance on levels longer than 10-15 steps, and a almost a dealbreaker on some of the challenge levels. The dev says he didn't include undo on purpose, to avoid abusing it - I find this argument understandable, just not very strong, as games with much shorter levels (see Splice for an extreme example) do have undo, and don't seem to suffer for it. The only \"legitimate\" reason for excluding undo is to hide subpar level design - but this is not the case in Hex, far from it. I don't recall any particularly bad levels, and most of them were ranging from good to great, generally stopping short of being brilliant though.\n\nIn short, Hex is a great puzzle game with some brainy content - not quite good as Achromatic, but still well worth the price of admission. Recommended.\n","timestamp_created":1609781631,"timestamp_updated":1609781631,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gcud5/YCdf+5wAI="}
