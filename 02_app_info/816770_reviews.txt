It is a good challenge for those who enjoy real game applications of fun math concepts, but the poor user interfacing makes this a harder sell. You cannot save while in the middle of one of the levels (as far as I tried) and the menu to select a level is slow to scroll through. I do not have a problem with the simple visuals of the interface, but the control over it is lackluster and the game could use some quality of life improvements, but the core puzzle solving is worth the asking price, or wait for a sale.","timestamp_created":1588213379,"timestamp_updated":1588213379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+5255PECd5m5hAI="}
