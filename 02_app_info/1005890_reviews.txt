Both games feature a dominantly female cast in which everything isnt what it seems at an eyes glance. The protag has to interact with several people while growing themself in order to complete an objective often personal growth. In the process losing everything in their starting situation. While Vanilla focused on atonement and acceptance from a spirtual pov which was captivating, the message of Stella seems to mirror that but falters. It does this thing where \"space\" has to be forcefully injected into most conversations making it sound deep but in reality sounds completely nonsensical by the end of it. To make it easier let me bullet point some points of contention/pros I had with Stella.\n\n/Manako as a protagonist has a lot of potential however he is squandered as his growth is very inconsistent if not present at all. Despite wanting the world to end and having nothing to do with it, he attempts to save the world out of obligation and up until the end he seems like the same character as when he started. Which im all for static characters however the game makes it seem like hes grown when he still complains about the same shit from the start. Also if I hear him complain about him not being able to do his schoolwork one more fucking time I will snap\n\n/Mira's motivations dont make sense for a multitude of reasons. I dont see why she'd help Manako if her intent was to save Mars, a more fitting role would be to mislead Manako or confirming his insecurities in order to make him either fail or give up saving the world. Instead she only has one instance of this happening and it seems unintentional.\n\n/Meme: Actually one story beat I find to resonate with, I think this is the best part of the game for me which compliments Manako a lot (aside from the bath scene).  Manako having to move past the fact he contributed to his sisters death and was very resentful of her was deeply touching, they also make use of a mechanic in Stella explained by Gaea which was clever given Meme comments on it just meeting them. Only real flaw is for some reason MIra somehow remembers despite acting like they cant at the start which she never talks to Manako about substantially.\n\n/References to old stories: While for long time Charon supporters seeing old figures come back for this entry would have been amazing to see... however for me that wasnt the case. Games like Tsukimi Planet and Cradle of Ruin had their stories concluded perfectly, so to give them a reboot to continue with this game just felt like manipulation of what came before. While I admit Kujirata's character was fantastic and greatly written, the implementation of Kaguya with Tsukimi planet in mind is just something I cant justify.\n\n/Mahori: God, this characters execution was just fucking awful from start to finish which is a honest shame. This ties in with my previous bullet but in summary the way they deal with this character feels insulting to say the least. Wouldnt killing Mahori result in the cult's resolve being strengthened 100%, because they did not tackle the root of the problem at all? Which was the fact that the world is so fucked that restarting it would be the only logical thing to do. Seeing Mahori die the way she did would 100% boost the resolve of the cult thus leading to calamity regardless. A personal way id like to see this play out is since Mahori is a near perfect representation of Manako's desires realized, have Manako persuade Mahori into believing otherwise. Instead she gets killed and is proven to be right by the end of it because Manako's and everyones fucked up life is still worse for bare along with mars getting yeeted.\nEdit:Another insult to injury is this is the only character where the best option is to just beat the shit out of them. Instead of an option to improve their mindset they get shafted. It rubs me the wrong way hard.\n\nMain complaint and summary: Really the liberties taken with the story can be excused up to a certain point, however this game fails with its message. Manako despite \"overcoming\" his hardships, at the end of the day would have benefitted from the meteor destroying the planet. He lost Meme, Mira, and is left wondering what else is their to do. Since he didnt sacrifice himself to take Gaea's place the world will one day reach its end so its just delayed. A good post I saw from someones youtube channel narrating it is that this game is too long, which it is. If Charon got someone to review the script, remove space from every other dialogue and shortened the games length it would have been a good game. As of now this is the only Charon game that Ill forget, which is a shame since that it has a higher quality production but worse story.","timestamp_created":1608325913,"timestamp_updated":1608333080,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3OaHvPYCd+yjuwI="}
