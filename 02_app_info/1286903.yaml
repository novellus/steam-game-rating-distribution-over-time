    about_the_game: 'The second generation of the MINI Countryman is the biggest and
      most versatile model in the entire range of the tradition-steeped British brand.
      And another superlative now applies to the power unit of the MINI John Cooper
      Works Countryman. With an output of 170 kW/231 hp, it is the most powerful engine
      ever to be fitted in a MINI: in combination with the standard all-wheel drive
      system ALL4 and a robust vehicle concept, it ensures that the latest addition
      to the family of top John Cooper Works athletes takes the MINI experience to
      a whole new level - in terms of both race track feeling on the road and extreme
      driving fun over unsurfaced terrain.'
