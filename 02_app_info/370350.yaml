    about_the_game: "LOTUS-Simulator is a driving simulator in a class of its own!\
      \ At the beginning, the player chooses freely a vehicle and drives it around\
      \ town, enjoys the ultra-realistic feeling of driving and the original sounds\
      \ and may even forget that the vehicle is virtual. Once gripped by the excitement\
      \ of simulation driving, the standards increase: stick to tight schedules, carry\
      \ special passengers, master the difficult traffic. But that\u2019s not all.\
      \ The ambition grows with the experience: Now the multiplayer is played under\
      \ real conditions \u2013 the colleagues in the control centre coordinate by\
      \ radio, the game leader set challenges in the middle of the road, unpredictable\

    review: "Der Umfang ist zwar zur Zeit noch sehr eingeschr\xE4nkt (eine unfertige\
      \ Stra\xDFenbahn und eine sehr kleine Karte), aber was das Grundspiel bietet,\
      \ ist in Ordnung.\n\nEDIT: Mittlerweile wurden KI-Fahrg\xE4ste hinzugef\xFC\
      gt, die mir pers\xF6nlich nicht gefallen, da sie zu gro\xDF wirken."
