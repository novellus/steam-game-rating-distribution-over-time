    review: "The 1.0 patch is a great step forwards that's made the game a lot more\
      \ fun to play.\nIt takes a while to get the hang of combat and it feels rewarding\
      \ when you stop dying and start getting the hang of things.\n\nI really like\
      \ the feeling of open exploration and the text-based dialogue that gives the\
      \ game a nice old school vibe. \nGraphics are nice and crisp and the game feels\
      \ stable. \nI don't have a lot of time to play these days, but I look forward\
      \ to seeing what's been changed and added. \nThis is my first time jumping on\
      \ the early release bandwagon and I can finally say that I get the hype. \n\n\
      Anyone looking for a fun way to hack and slash away a few hours should check\
      \ this out."
