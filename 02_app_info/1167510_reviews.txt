I wasn't much of a fan of the original set and Klei didn't disappoint with doing more outlandish and interesting designs with this one. Should be Wortox's default skin, he looks so much better here. \n\nThese optional cosmetic packs of course help them afford to keep servers running and continuing to add free gameplay content, AND all the seasonal events they host that feel like their own complete games. So, yeah, you really can't feel bad shelling out some cash to buy skins from this company. \n\nCame exactly as described.","timestamp_created":1594238714,"timestamp_updated":1594238714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.585798859596252441","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiYiCmPMCdpvwkwI="}
