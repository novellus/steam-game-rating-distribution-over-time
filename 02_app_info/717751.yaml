    short_description: Ranma and the others pay a visit to a hot spring inn called
      Ningyo-kan, the House of Dolls. There is a legend at the inn about a mysterious
      doll called the Vengeful Doll. It looks like an ordinary Japanese doll, but
      when someone is rude to it or gets it dirty, it gets mad and takes revenge.
