    review: "[i][b]Watson's Watch[/b][/i] is a gem ! [i][b]Watson's Watch[/b][/i]\
      \ is one of those nice little games you sometimes stumble on and feel quite\
      \ lucky you did.. Because these kinds of games tend to amazingly surprise, entertain\
      \ and catch you in their storyline. [i][b]Watson's Watch[/b][/i] has all of\
      \ these features : \n- it's an astonishing game,\n- it has a fairly enjoyable\
      \ gameplay and pace, \n- it has an entirely immersive intrigue.\nIt may be still\
      \ in early access, it's quite well developped as it is. No annoying bugs. Achievements\
      \ are unlocking adequately. \n\n[i][b]Watson's Watch[/b][/i] is a decent little\
      \ adventure game, in the detective field, putting the RPGMaker softwares to\
      \ a good use.\nThe storyline is intriguing. The way the main character learns\
      \ things leaves room for suspense till the end of the game. \n\nThe gameplay\
      \ is good.. During the inquiry you'll fastly travel by cab through the city\
      \ where the events take place, preventing you from the feeling of eternal back\
      \ and forth. \nThe game pace is fine, going along with the development of the\
      \ plot. \n\nThis is supposed to be the 1st episode , if I understand. \nAs a\
      \ matter of fact the game feels a bit short. The end comes rather abruptly..\
      \ leaving the gamer waiting for more, impatiently waiting for a kind of sequel.\n\
      \nThe basic idea of [i][b]Watson's Watch[/b][/i] is excellent, the plot/storyline\
      \ is tricky and the game developpement very promising... \nLet's hope [b]Retro\
      \ Warp Gaming[/b] the developping/editing team will be able to get back on the\
      \ tracks of this encouraging game and give it its due sequel..  Meanwhile, thumb\
      \ up !"
