So let me try again, because it's important to keep my rambling in check.\n\nSo this is a \"meander and explore in an open world' type games, kind of like Bethesda's Fallouts, or Elex, in that there's a lot of ruins and you can rummage through lunchboxes for handfuls of loose nuts.\n\nIt's also kind of like those crafting survival games, where you need to build a base and craft up various nailbats and Doors of Zombie Repulsion +3.\n\nIt's also got some driving elements, because some of the epxloration map sections are ambitiously large.\n\nSo there's a lot going on in there.  Open world exploration/crafting/vehicles?  Sounds broad as the ocean.  And, as is true for those games, that ocean is as shallow as a puddle.\n\nCombat is, frankly, kinda hilaribad; there's no animal, zombie or melee human you can't outwit by backpedalling while firing, and the guys with ranged weapons miss 90% of the time and do a pittance of damage when they do connect.\n\nThe base building is almost entirely pointless.  You can if you want to.  It's some place to keep your crates and maybe grow some plants or something?\n\nThe inventory system is frankly, bizarre and annoyingly small.  I nearly quit and refunded over it.  Yet, here I am, writing a positive review.  That's because of the driving.\n\nThe car physics have been made by somebody who cares about cars to a greater extent than your usual dev.  They look good.  They drive decently.  They sound alright (although the old 1940's pickup with a 4 cylinder engine sounds as snarly as my offroad muscle car, which is hilarious to me).  They move at a decent clip, can catch air, and require you to brake if you want to make sharp corners.\n\nSo in short, a game that has \"drive\" as the first word of its title actually lets you drive decently.  The car does come with a really terrible automatic transmission but maybe that'll get fixed.  Please let it get fixed.  Oi vey.\n\nThe rest of the game, well, it needs more content.  But I feel reasonably optimistic about it.","timestamp_created":1609588268,"timestamp_updated":1609913828,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519999980926513672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwqvCV6/YCeODZvwI="}
