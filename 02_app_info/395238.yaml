      \ Pack contains:</h2>\u2022 PLAS-1 \u2018Scorcher\u2019: The first ever Helldiver\

      \ M-25 \u2018Rumbler\u2019: The \u2018Rumbler\u2019 is a heavy portable mortar\
      \ firing three round bursts of 80mm grenades. Though heavy and prone to ammunition\
      \ shortage, the rumbler has the capability of firing at a variable distance,\

      \ \u2018Dum Dum\u2019: The AC-22 is a 20mm cannon commonly found in the Helldiver\
      \ arsenal, though usually mounted on vehicles. This is a shoulder carried version\
      \ allowing for Helldivers on foot to carry a very powerful weapon that is excellent\
      \ for taking out medium armored targets."

    review: 'Scorcher- Kinda bad, and you will kill yourself if something is up close.

      Rumbler- Very high skill ceiling, easy to kill yourself, but probably the best
      AT weapon out there

      Dum Dum- Good on most factions, but mostly illuminates since it has no AT
