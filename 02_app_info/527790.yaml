    review: 'Abandoned. There is no campaign or sandbox and the workshop only works
      (50% lol, you can upload stuff but other people''s uploads download as empty)
      in the right depot. Still can get all achievements, check AStats guides. All
      the screenshots of this game are a lie. There is nothing but a finicky level
      editor.
