Having an option to turn the ui off (fps, coordinates, time etc) during gameplay in favour of a larger image of the maze would be ideal, especially since turning your pof can cause the ui to block part of your vision.\nsecond is gameplay. I love this idea, especially as a avid lover of mazes. while sometimes it can be hard to see the paths, with time and patience you can solve all the mazes ;)\noverall its a cool game, and I like playing it. but it seems as though it was thrown together pretty quickly (although its a pretty simple idea for a game, as i mentioned some things which you see in almost all games are not present)\nI don't write reviews much, but I thought this one needed some feedback ;)","timestamp_created":1549414437,"timestamp_updated":1549414437,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iIKT4OgCfJCOugE="}
