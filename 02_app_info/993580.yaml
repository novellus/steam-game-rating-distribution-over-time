    review: '[h1]Pleasant puzzle game but with some trial-and-error elements[/h1]


      [b]As other Nannings titles, this one has [url=https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/721025]a
      free version[/url] available on browser.[/b]


      A pathing puzzle, [i]Enchanted Path[/i] is an isometric game, with arrows (re-bindable)
      or gamepad moving the protagonist in diagonal directions. This kind of control
      is always confusing for me. You can opt to use mouse, like I did, to click the
      control in the right-hand corner.


      Your task is to grab all the gems, then head for the revealed exit. As some
      paths are usually locked after visiting once or twice, you need to plan the
      route beforehand.


      [h1]Trial-and-error in puzzles[/h1]


      The exit is not always where you think it will be, and as it only reveals itself
      after gathering all the gems. This exposes a trial-and-error element.


      Also, there''s no zoom. Some levels are big enough that you have to try twice
      or thrice before getting it right because not knowing where the exit appears
      or where a previously hidden path appears.


      [h1]Repetitive puzzles[/h1]


      Some puzzles seem like retakes of some previous ones. That said, there are a
      couple of really nice puzzles that took a minute or in one case ten to complete.


      The whole game lasted about 45 minutes for me. An alright puzzler in my opinion.


      [h1]Free vs. paid? [/h1]


      Steam version has 10 puzzles more than the free version. I got it on sale, so
      I felt it was appropriate, particularly as an additional support for the dev.
      That said, it''s prudent to wait for a sale nevertheless.
