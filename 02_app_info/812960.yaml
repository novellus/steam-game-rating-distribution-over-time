    review: "Update 11/12/2020 - Developer has started posting in the forums again.\
      \  Keep watch and see what, if anything, happens.\n\nUpdate 8/21/2020 - DO NOT\
      \ BUY THIS GAME.  IT IS ABANDONED AND UNFINISHED. \n\nI just wanted to post\
      \ a quick positive review for this early access game.  It is still pretty early\
      \ in development, but there is a lot here to enjoy.  It's not the most mind-blowing\
      \ game ever, but it's pretty unique and just good old fun.\n\nYou play a guild.\
      \  You have a stable of dudes and gals in your guild, and you manage their skills\
      \ (and possibly stats as they level up - I haven't gotten that far yet), and\
      \ equipment.  Then you form them into parties and go on quests, which are mainly\
      \ combat oriented quests so far.  I haven't seen anything other than go to a\
      \ place, find out what the problem is, accept the quest, and enter a combat\
      \ to defeat the bad guys.  You get loot, fame, experience and gold for completing\
      \ quests.\n\nYour Guild Hall is your base of operations, where you rest, train,\
      \ equip items, gain new skills, and possibly some other things that aren't fully\
      \ implemented yet.\n\nThe best part is the developer is EXTREMELY, no joke,\
      \ extremely active in the forums and very quick to listen to player feedback,\
      \ criticism, and suggestions.  I've just played for a very short time and already\
      \ the developer has put out a very nice update.  He says he will continue putting\
      \ out updates all the time, daily, hourly, whatever it takes.  \n\nSo, it's\
      \ still pretty early in development, but the developer has a good track record\
      \ of finishing his games in a timely manner.  I enjoy Zavix Tower by the Batholith,\
      \ and this one looks to be a lot more interesting.\n\nSo . . . a nice recommendation\
      \ from me for now.  I look forward to see how the rest of the development goes,\
      \ but I know we'll have constant, quick, and meaty updates.  Good stuff.  Great\
      \ developer!\n\nUpdate 8/21/2020 - I am changing my review to very negative.\
      \  The developer has abandoned the game, left it very unfinished, and does not\
      \ even have the balls to come to the Steam forum to give his customers an explanation.\n\
      \nYet, he continues to sell it for full price.  For shame, Batholith dude. \
      \ For shame.\n\nUpdate 11/12/2020 - Developer has started posting in the forums\
      \ again.  Keep watch and see what, if anything, happens."
