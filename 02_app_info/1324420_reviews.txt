This is one of those cases. Granted this game is still enjoyable and even though it is short it still manages to be fun enough. However because it is so short it doesn't get enough time to flesh out the characters motivations, personalities and stories outside of passing remarks or Daichi's past/reasoning. So becuase of that everything feels rushed and you never really get to settle into the world enough to be immersed in it. However, the writer managed to still make the experience enjoyable and the game fun to play.\n\nThe biggest area I think a lot of this CoG could be improved is by including tags to options that specifically state what stat the options use to make the choice. More often than not options are so vague that you cannot tell what stat it is using, and it was particularly annoying in this instance as certain abilities use specific stats but it doesn't tell you which ones. So you could choose Mind Control as your main focus and continually choose options that focus on it but as you don't know what stat it uses, and it doesn't have its own stat, more often than not it will not work. Even if you have used it at every opportunity. This is a problem with all the games from CoG, not Fox Spirit specifically, but it must be brought to attention.\n\nRegardless even with the issues I have I enjoyed the game. I'd give it a 6/10.","timestamp_created":1609122713,"timestamp_updated":1609122713,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42oHM0/YCfZX7vQI="}
