      \ that year at Gamehole Con. We had a bag of cookies with us and someone asked\
      \ for the cookie bag because they NEEDED a cookie. Secret Project Cookie Bag\
      \ was born in that moment. What if there was a magical bag that could grant\
      \ your fondest wish; give you what you want, even if it's not always the best\
      \ idea? Well, for everyone's favorite, loveable imp Pipyap, it would be filled\
      \ with endless cookies that if he ate them, would allow him to never have to\
      \ go back to the Nine Hells again. We hope that as you peruse Pipyap's Guide\
      \ to All of the Nine Hells, you find your fondest wish within; even if you are\
      \ going to Hell...<br> <i>Converted by:</i> \_ <strong>Zacchaeus</strong> <br>\
