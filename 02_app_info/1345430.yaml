    about_the_game: "Simple Experiment game of Sudoku.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe classic\
      \ Sudoku game involves a grid of 81 squares. The grid is divided into nine blocks,\
      \ each containing nine squares. The rules of the game are simple: each of the\
      \ nine blocks has to contain all the numbers 1-9 within its squares. Each number\
      \ can only appear once in a row, column, or box.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe difficulty\
      \ lies in that each vertical nine-square column, or horizontal nine-square line\
      \ across, within the larger square, must also contain the numbers 1-9, without\
      \ repetition or omission.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery puzzle has just one correct\
      \ solution."
