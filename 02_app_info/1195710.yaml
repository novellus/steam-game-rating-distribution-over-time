    review: 'A very charming JRPG sums it up nicely.  Don''t expect the most serious
      of stories, but it is very cozy and reminds me of childhood games.  Collect
      about ~20 monsters to tag along with you (although you will only ever use two
      given party size).  In the beginning it is very linear but around the level
      30 range, the game opens up and there are several spots that you can explore
      that are out of the way.


      Good game, nothing more to be said'
