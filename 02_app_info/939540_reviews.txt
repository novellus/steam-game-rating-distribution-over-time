The graphics are great, watching the plants burn away is very satisfying and the lighting gives it a nice sense of depth for a 2D game. But what I appreciate the most is how tight the controls are, because this game is CHALLENGING. I died a lot, but I always felt it was my fault for being too hasty rather than a fault of the game. \n\nOverall, this is a really well made game, definitely a hidden gem worth checking out for how cheap it is.","timestamp_created":1578118865,"timestamp_updated":1578118865,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583421409130096436","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4htzNt+8Ce5na6QE="}
