Big things you may notice is the camera rotating with the player and doors going spastic. The more you play it, the more you will get use to the camera. Doors can be your guardian angels or your soul crushing doom.\n\nFor those who like a challenge, want an indie feel, don't want to spend too much time grinding and just have fun. I would recommend this game to you.","timestamp_created":1596121379,"timestamp_updated":1596172992,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4N/U0fMCepW5mAI="}
