    review: 'I bought this pack thinking that I was going to experience an environmentalist
      utopia. What I got was a version of the base game that looks like the sims are
      rebuilding after the zombie apocalypse. Visually Evergreen Harbor is very unimpressive,
      especially the docks. This pack implements a few interesting concepts like:
      Voting for different initiatives to impact your eco footprint, changes in the
      environment based on what you vote for and how much power and water you use,
      being able to recycle stuff in order to create stuff you already have or don''t
      need. The new careers are also fantastic and pay well, the activities also make
      you feel as though you are making a difference in the world. The goal of a "green
      fiend" is to contribute to a greener environment by following a strict set of
      rules. You may have to live without certain commodities (if you care about the
      environment) like TVs, computers, electronics, etc. You could also live in a
      crummy "off-the-grid" home (I definitely do not recommend) and have your power
      and water shut off regularly. However, you can combat your footprint by planting
      trees, using wind and solar power, and also conserve water. Sometimes your effect
      doesn''t make much sense, for example, last night I was playing and a random
      old lady sim told me that the trees told her about my small TV and computer
      destroying the ecosystem. So she came over and literally destroyed both of them
      until I had beat her up to leave my house. It sure was interesting, but my plan
      is to move my sims out of the harbor ASAP. It seems as if the voting and eco
      footprint concepts translate to the base game and other DLC (I''m actually not
      100% sure about that), but overall the DLC is meh. If you''re looking to keep
      playing Sims 4, this is still a good pack, but get it on sale and don''t pay
      full price.'
