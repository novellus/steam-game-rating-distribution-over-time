This Version seems so clunky like the robot can't move but one spot with each mouse click or key press and the timing of rock falls is insane, you have to move insanely fast not to get squished! And forget about explosions you do not get enough time to get away from the TNT before it explodes before you squished! \n\nFor the positives\nYes I do like the new look... Mostly the old map is odd The 3D effect is kinda cool for a bit but does get old fast and does have a toggle for it in the options menu The map itself is odd with caverns and whatnot make the game a bit more of a challenge which I liked a lot and the fact that the map goes let to right forever is sweet you can cheese the game a bit just by digging til you hit a rock and ladder up then go over one then dig down till you hit a rock or a hole rinse and repeat till you can afford your upgrades then reset the map and then hut the diamond. \n\nFinal Thoughts on this game. At this time I have 7 hours played. and I do find it frustrating at times but as stated I cheese it and got the upgrades early and simply. I do not recommend this game to any one who played the original Robo Miner because you will feel disappointed in how clunky it feels from the original.","timestamp_created":1592319434,"timestamp_updated":1592319434,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0cvo3vICfZO1jgI="}
