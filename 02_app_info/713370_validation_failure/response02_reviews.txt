The combat is nothing super special, but still fun to play. The story is pretty good though. The art looks good too. A small game to play when you have nothing else to do. Too bad it's only in Japanese in the moment. If you don't speak Japanese you won't understand the story and then it's not really worth playing. Hopefully it will get a translation. I've been having to translate it slowly myself.\nI also wish you could change the controls. I don't really like the wadr movement. I'd rather have a wasd movement. Other than that it runs well.","timestamp_created":1509288745,"timestamp_updated":1509288947,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.607722461223602295","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ407WotN8CeN7hiQE="}
