    review: "Les jeux VR me donnent rarement des effets secondaires, mais alors celui-l\xE0\
      ... Mal de cr\xE2ne instantan\xE9, la t\xEAte qui tourne. Visuellement mal optimis\xE9\
      , tr\xE8s flout\xE9 et pas de sons...\nAucune envie d'y rejouer, \xE7a ne vaut\
      \ vraiment pas le coup."
