    review: this VN has a pretty straight forward linear path depending on the options
      chose, however I would still recommend it as IMO it's one of the best i've played
      so far. Graphics and photos are similar to what you would see in a comic book
      from the 90's/2000s, but there are HD versions available as DLC
