Most of which did not work without a few resets.\n\nThe developer(s) seem quite active in the forum so kudos for that, and if you have a decent PC that can run this then I think it could be a fun little simulator. \n\nBut I can not recommend it in it's current state, based on my experience. But I will be keeping an eye on this for the future\n","timestamp_created":1609693209,"timestamp_updated":1609693209,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4mqTM5PYCf4uQwAI="}
