    review: 'In my opinion, this game and others by this developer  - Hexwar Games
      - got a bad rap from many reviewers. First of all, comparing it to a real time
      strategy game is apples and oranges. Ultimate General may just be a great game,
      but rts isn''t for everyone, or doesn''t have to be every time you want to play
      a game. I like turn based hex games!


      Other games of this style and genre may be more historically accurate and more
      complex, but again, it''s apples and oranges. This game is a little on the casual
      side, and it definitely isn''t a real battle simulator. But sometimes I just
      want to charge those cannons or outflank that line, without feeling like I need
      a Ph.D. in military history just to play a game. Every tree may not be in the
      right place, but that''s OK with me.


      I sunk over 50 hours into this game and I enjoyed every bit of it. I only played
      the game on medium (of 3 levels) difficulty, and I only played as the Union,
      so the game offers future replay ability. I definitely feel like I got my money''s
      worth.


      I also own and played Civil War: 1861 - no idea why i skipped 1862, but I will
      go back for it. I also recently took advantage of a big sale here on steam to
      buy 2 more Hexwar Games titles - Civil War: Bull Run 1861 and Civil War: Gettysburg.
      Rebs be warned, I am a battle hardened Hexwar veteran, and I''m coming to run
      you off the map.


      In a nut shell, whatever this game isn''t, it is a lot of casual fun and I recommend
      it for those looking for this particular brand of apple.'
