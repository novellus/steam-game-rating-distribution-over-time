You can split the screen into 2, 3 or 4 windows.  As that review said, it might be interesting to allow an option for all the players to use a shared map (ala Duck Game and Ultimate Chicken Horse), but maybe it's just too small to see if you do that.  But don't be scared off, it still works fine as is.","timestamp_created":1606538568,"timestamp_updated":1606538568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.549749612808227539","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlKTKhvYCdpKVtAI="}
