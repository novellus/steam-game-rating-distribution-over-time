Devs seems to agree so at $20 it's an easy recommendation.  Crazy to me that a VR game with solid performance, decent graphics, free locomotion, quality 90s Fear Factory inspired soundtrack, and a pretty wicked leash system (for weakened enemies) is sitting on Mixed reviews.  On a 50% sale this is an absolute steal but it's worth it at $20.  \n\nThere's even destructible environments / cover and I can't even think of another VR game pulls that off as well as this one does.  And sure the story is goofy and by-the-numbers but if you're playing sci-fi VR shooters (that aren't HL: Alyx) for the story then you're gonna have a bad time.  \n\nThis game bangs and needs far more exposure.  Will at least watch for more from these dvs.","timestamp_created":1595044430,"timestamp_updated":1595044430,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi9CDsPMCeqL/lQI="}
