    review: 'As of today (11/11/2018) this game has received an update that completely
      overhauled the UI, graphics, and added some new content including a horror/halloween
      mode (which will be permanent, don''t be fooled by the name "halloween" mode,
      I am sure the devs will change this at a later date)


      The devs are very much engaged in gathering and listening to community feedback.
      The developer clearly cares a lot about this game and If you are a fan of games
      where you grind to get the highest score on the leaderboard, if you want to
      be #1 and compete with others, this game is for you.


      This game puts you in a hostile environment where you have to survive for a
      set amount of time, or in the horror mode, as long as you can (with enemies
      that get stronger and stronger as the game progresses). The end goal is to gain
      the highest score that you can get by killing animals, building, crafting, ...
      Basically it roughly comes down to your APM (actions per minute).


      Even though this is the first real game made by a relatively new company, it
      is already in a very nice state and with all the planned updates the devs mentioned
      on discord/twitch, it seems like this is the kind of game every lover of the
      Survival, roguelike, or builder genres will fall in love with.


      Definitely give it a go! At the current price it is a total bargain and there
      will be much more content and gamemodes to come!'
