While there are 5 added chapters, some of the game play is so short or insignificant that it doesn't feel like it's worth the $4 DLC.  \n\nThe particular beef I have with it is the chapter where you play the reaper.  There is really no game play here.\n[h1]SPOILER ALERT: [/h1] \n[spoiler]  You spend the whole chapter chasing after characters so that you can land on them and kill them.  Kind of boring.  On the other hand, to complete the challenges, you have to make certain characters gain gold or strength.  Well, you spend 5 or 6 turns just trying to land on the character, then when you do and try to help him, he chooses the option to gain that doesn't meet your goal.  So 60 or more rounds of \"skip to my next turn\" just so you can TRY to land on someone is not my idea of fun.  What a wasted chapter.  Playing an NPC in a game is not what you play a game for.[/spoiler]\n[h1] End spoiler[/h1]\n\nI did learn about the ghost characters and how the Veil works, so that was good.  However, there are some challenges I don't understand how to achieve and it is not explained well.\n\nStill and all, I will recommend it just because I like the overall game.  I would hope that with the next paid DLC you would get at least 2 books worth of game play - by that I mean REAL game play, not just rolling the dice as an NPC.","timestamp_created":1562622365,"timestamp_updated":1562622623,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.701774835586547852","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40Z/k6esCd7nyzQE="}
