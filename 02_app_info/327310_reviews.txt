In theory this means the player must think and react quickly, but getting caught immediately results in a loss, which forces the player to restart and hope the guard positions are more favorable next time.  While most levels are relatively short and provide checkpoints, the repeated restarts can be time-consuming.  Overall not terrible, but not good enough to recommend.\nPros:\n+ Levels have some replay value because there are multiple characters with distinct stealth mechanics.\nCons:\n- The randomized guard behavior makes success seem luck-dependent, and leaves little room for strategy or planning in advance. Being forced to repeatedly restart a level can quickly become frustrating. \n- Character movement is imprecise because multiple different controls (walk, run, open, move camera, etc) are mapped to the same context-based click input.\n- The fixed isometric camera can make movement unreliable when trying to navigate behind objects or walls, and the inability to zoom out often means getting caught by off-screen guards.","timestamp_created":1575878579,"timestamp_updated":1610125853,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517871201038360596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lNi+8fYCf9SS4wE="}
