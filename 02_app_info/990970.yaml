      \ RPG with lots of hard decisions to make. Set in early medieval England.<br>Rule\
      \ Wessex and conquer other kingdoms. Unite England before William The Conqueror\
      \ shows up. No fantasy stuff, only down-to-earth and sometimes gruesome reality\
      \ of early Middle Ages.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Different Story Every Time</h2>Instead\
      \ of a fixed story arch, we\u2019ve created a nebula of branching-out subplots.\
      \ The game generates them in a different way every time you play.<br>Your decisions,\
      \ personal traits of your kings and other characters, relations with NPCs and\
      \ social groups, developments in rival kingdoms \u2013 all this shapes the timeline\
      \ with thousands of events.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build a Dynasty</h2>Choose a\
      \ wife for your king and remember: your heir will inherit some of his parents\u2019\
      \ attributes. Raise your children, further molding their traits with kind or\
      \ callous words and deeds.<br>Maintain decent relations with the nobles, the\
      \ royal family and the church. Your son will need their votes during witan if\
      \ he is to be the next ruler.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Construct And Conquer</h2>Battle\
      \ with enemy kingdoms, taking over their provinces. Defend against Vikings.\
      \ Build good relations with your direct vassals who rule the provinces in your\
      \ name. You don\u2019t want to deal with sudden revolts inside your kingdom.<br>Gather\
      \ taxes and invest in market towns, ports, mills, mines and abbeys. Develop\
      \ your domain, gain material and political profits. After all, the crown needs\
      \ a lot of silver and prestige to operate.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Look And Listen</h2>Admire\
      \ the original soundtrack, as well as hundreds of handmade graphics and animations\
      \ that perfectly reflect the gameplay character. Not bad for a tiny team, huh?"
