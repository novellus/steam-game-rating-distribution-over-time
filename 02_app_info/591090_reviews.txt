The artwork is very nice, and the music is even better.  I normally turn music off for almost all of my games (it gets annoying quickly).  However, I am still enjoying this light jazz theme.\n\nYou basically connect as many gems of the same type as you can.  There are certain goals to achieve, and once you meet them, the moves left detonate areas of the board.  All of this adds to your start level (one to three).  The game gives you power-ups, and for ones you don't use, you get them added to your score.  I really enjoyed using the power-ups sparingly to get a higher score.  I found that part of the challenge of the game.\n\nThough the game is not very difficult, it's still quite enjoyable.  I payed full price, and I have no regerts (thanks Postal).","timestamp_created":1577790685,"timestamp_updated":1577790685,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49Ofpre8Cf/jP6AE="}
