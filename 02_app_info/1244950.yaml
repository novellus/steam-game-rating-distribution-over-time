    review: "As someone who grew up on this franchise and other titles like Streets\
      \ of Rage, Final Fight and Double Dragon, I had high hopes for an updated version\
      \ of this game.\n\nBattletoads goes from being an exciting revival of a 90's\
      \ classic to a train wreck equivalent to the year it was released in what feels\
      \ like an instant.\n\nWhat starts as a great beat 'em up goes to sub par mini\
      \ games and a complete shift in genres (platforming and shoot 'em up) as if\
      \ you were never playing a beat 'em up from the start.\n\nThis would be ok if\
      \ those segments were done well, but they're not after their first introductions.\n\
      \nPlatforming levels are introduced with the first being peaceful and relaxing,\
      \ only to show their a$$ once you get to the next one and suddenly realize how\
      \ slippery the controls feel in certain areas.\n\nThe puzzles also make little\
      \ sense most times in all parts of the game (that I played, at least) and seem\
      \ more trial and error than anything.\n\nThis leaves the player with no real\
      \ feeling of accomplishment as every puzzle seems to be solved with \"dumb luck\"\
      \ more than actually figuring anything out.\n\nShoot 'em up levels also start\
      \ out good until you get to the next levels and realize just how broken they\
      \ are, too.\n\nProjectile patterns from enemy ships becoming incredibly overwhelming\
      \ and the lack of a \"bomb\" option makes things even worse.\n\nEven with a\
      \ dodge for your ship, it makes little difference since its functionality is\
      \ iffy AF.\n\nProgress a little more and you'll get one of the worst mini games\
      \ I've ever played (yes, the f@#$ing system restore s@#%).\n\nThis could have\
      \ been one of the best things to ever happen in gaming for 2020 but it isn't\
      \ even worth playing after Act 2 (and there's only FOUR ACTS in the whole damn\
      \ thing).\n\nThank God 2020 is finally over and may this piece of dog s@#% stay\
      \ there with it.\n\U0001F595\U0001F595\U0001F3FB\U0001F595\U0001F3FC\U0001F595\
