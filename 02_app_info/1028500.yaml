    review: 'A hidden gem of an NES game.  Nightshade is an adventure game, emulated
      from the NES.  It is not perfect, for one the hotkey to load save states doesn''t
      seem to work.  It''s a more basic version of the emulator overall.  But it''s
      functional.  Besides, you can take the ROM from the game data and use it in
      any other emulator if you wished.


      For the game itself?  There''s a lot of clever bits in it.  "Game Overs", for
      the first four time, are not actually game over screens.  You can escape the
      death traps.  As an adventure game, most of what you have to do is understandable.  There
      are a few points that don''t make a lot of sense, but overall the game''s not
      difficult to figure out.  There are combat sections as well, and those are let
      down slightly by the game not being that responsive.  Sometimes you''ll have
      inputs dropped which can make you take some excess damage.  And healing is limited
      in the game.  Limited, but there ARE ways to defeat everything, usually you
      can figure out patterns that let you take minimal damage.  So there''s enough
      healing to go around.  Once you start figuring the game out, everything fits
      nicely into place.  I played with save states to try to mitigate damage from
      combat and while trying various things, but it''s also a game that''s gated
      by knowledge.  So knowing what to do will help speed you through early parts
      of the game if you have to start over.


      I do recommend this game.  More people should check it out.  And I''m glad that
      someone''s decided to preserve some NES games and make them accessible again,
      legally.'
