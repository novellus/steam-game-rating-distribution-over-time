It's a remake of an old 1990s game and it shows. The graphics haven't really been improved, the UI is really small, and the maps are also small. Not worth buying even in a Steam Sale which is a shame because this was my favourite Close Combat game when I played the original years ago. But the graphics are not looking good now, looks pixellated.","timestamp_created":1609876257,"timestamp_updated":1609876257,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jseG6vYCfbnmwAI="}
