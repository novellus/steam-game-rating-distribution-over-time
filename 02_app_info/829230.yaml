    about_the_game: Move naturally in VR in any game that supports trackpad/stick
      locomotion. Walk in place to move your body in the virtual world, instead of
      sliding on your invisible remote-controlled skate.<br><br>Natural Locomotion
      is an application that emulates the controller trackpad (to use in any game),
      to move more naturally swinging the arms and moving the body. It includes a
      driver for SteamVR for this purpose.<br><br>Unlike other &quot;arm swinger&quot;
      implementations, Natural Locomotion uses an unique algorithm designed to walk
      and run with the speed one would expect, and with very precise and intuitive
      control of speed and acceleration.<br><br><strong>The demo version doesn't have
      any driver and it's just a photogrammetry scene to walk around, and a friendly
      robot that fools around, moving with this same locomotion system.</strong>
