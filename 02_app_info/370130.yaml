    review: "[h1][b][u]Overall - 24/100[/u][/b][/h1]\nThis block-based platformer\
      \ is not put together well and is barely even about lions.  Save your money.\n\
      \n[h1]Playing as a cat - 20/20[/h1]\nReally the only thing this game gets right\
      \ -- you are playing as a lion! You have animal friends!\n\n[h1]Acting like\
      \ a cat - 0/20[/h1]\nIf the game hadn't told me once or twice that the lead\
      \ character was a lion, I would have zero idea that he was one.  This is a generic\
      \ platformer with a questionably-lion-shaped group of blocks as your character\
      \ sprite.\n\n[h1]Adorableness Level - 0/20[/h1]\nFor a game with a lion protagonist,\
      \ nothing is cute about it.  The game is made of of squares.  Probably about\
      \ 50 squares overall.  It's just not much to look at.\n\n[h1]Polish - 2/20[/h1]\n\
      This game was designed in a way so that nothing is intuitive.  What is a part\
      \ of the level and what is background is indistinguishable.  The level select\
      \ screen is a confusing level in itself, without a lot of signposts helping\
      \ you figure out where to go if you just want to play the game.  They tried\
      \ to solve all of this by starting you out with 4 (!) tutorial levels, which\
      \ tell you what the deal is with everything--since every gameplay element looks\
      \ like a cube, it requires a lot of explanation.  At times, the screen will\
      \ be overflowing with an unreadable amount of text giving you help, at other\
      \ times you'll get nothing.  Even the settings screen is a completely non-intuitive\
      \ blending of gameplay and menu.  \n\n[h1]FUN? - 2/20[/h1]\nI abandoned this\
      \ game shortly after the tutorial.  Nothing about it draws you in, and it's\
      \ just a frustrating mess."
