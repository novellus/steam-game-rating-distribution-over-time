    review: "The \"Rocketbirds OST Compilation\" is really nice compiliation for those\
      \ who liked the soundtracks of [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/215510]Rocketbirds:\
      \ Hardboiled Chicken[/url] and its successor [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/470210/]Rocketbirds\
      \ 2 Evolution[/url].\n\nThe songs all are performed by [url=https://www.facebook.com/NewWorldRevolution]New\
      \ World Revolution[/url], which really deserve your attention. Describing their\
      \ genre as \"Science Fiction Rock\", they hit the point. Being \"spacy\" and\
      \ rock together, they either can calm you, or boost you to levels way beyond\
      \ your thoughts. \n\nI'd consider a compiliation to consist out of more songs\
      \ though... the [i]only[/i] negative remark I had to make, since I am missing\
      \ the OST of Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken still... and then, on the other\
      \ hand, the ones from Rocketbirds 2 Evolution. But things might take their time\
      \ - I will keep these as my wishes for future updates.\n\nIt is all up to you\
      \ to listen to this or not. If not, you will definitely miss something. But\
      \ hey, it was your choice, cannot blame you for that or your different taste\
      \ of music. :D\n\n\nAgent R out!\n\n[b]P.S.: You can support New World Revolution\
      \ outside of Steam [url=https://newworldrevolution.bandcamp.com]here[/url] -\
      \ they have loads of good stuff on their bandcamp page, including both of the\
      \ full Rocketbirds soundtracks![/b]"
