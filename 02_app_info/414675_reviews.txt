It's missing about half! \n\nAlso, it does help to know even a little bit of Korean so that you can better follow along. Not all the sound effects seem to be something I can hear. One of the main reasons I did get the Cheritz games, aside from them being great, is to help learn a few more words and get used to listening to it being spoken. \n\nThe sound of the mic they use for these recordings is really interesting and was a new experience for me! It was just odd that the sound seemed to come from one side or the other, and not just balanced/straight on, when the character is supposedly in front of you. It sounds pretty neat when they go behind, or up close, though.","timestamp_created":1519027674,"timestamp_updated":1519027674,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwudvG1uECf521mQE="}
