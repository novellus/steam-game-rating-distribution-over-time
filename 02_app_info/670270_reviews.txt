Not a deal breaker since the game is fairly straight forward.  However, this game is not very well optimized so will not be the nicest experience on lower-end VR systems.  \n\nStill, can I really complain for the price?  And, knowing me, I probably even bought it on sale for a dollar or less.  Seems fun when you're in the mood for this type of game (arcade shooter?).  If it runs on your system smoothly enough, it's a decent enough game to pick up.","timestamp_created":1526010102,"timestamp_updated":1526010102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj8jSpuMCdsWOoAE="}
