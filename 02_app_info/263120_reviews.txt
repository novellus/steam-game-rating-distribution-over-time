The best thing about Ludwig is how unique it is. The graphics are absolutely beautiful, the characters have very natural personalities and the main character you control is so fun to play with. I love the little tools that pop out, the animation is amazing. The story is definitely the best part. \n\nThe problem is, the story feels a little unfinished at the end when (SPOILER ALERT) Ludwig just walks away from the humans. Ovos, the game’s creators, need to create a sequel or something like that.\n\nIn all, this game will keep you company for a few hours.","timestamp_created":1563447761,"timestamp_updated":1563447761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hvOvguwCftjNzgE="}
