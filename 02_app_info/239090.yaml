      \ players. Each samurai is armed with a sword and gun, with only 3 bullets to\
      \ a life. Strategy and quick reflexes are the key to deflecting bullets and\
      \ sending your opponents\u2019 heads rolling.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/239090/extras/SamuraiGunn_Description_02_showdown-snow.gif?t=1597438768\"\

      \ their waterlogged gun is too wet to fire. Hold down the slash button to change\
