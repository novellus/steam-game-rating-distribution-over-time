      \ an unsuspecting Japanese high-schooler, suddenly awoke in a world not his\
      \ own \u2014 a war-torn alternate reality in which mankind was on the brink\
      \ of extinction, locked in a decades-long struggle against the ruthless extra-terrestrial\
      \ invaders known only as the BETA. In that time, he\u2019s been through an awful\
      \ lot \u2014 enlisting in the military, meeting parallel-universe versions of\
      \ his old friends, and even falling in love. But unbeknownst to Takeru, he and\
      \ his squadmates were being trained to participate in a top-secret UN contingency\
      \ plan known as Alternative IV \u2014 a last-ditch effort to take back the Earth\
      \ via experimental technology. Unfortunately, however, development screeched\
      \ to a halt when the project\u2019s chief executive, Professor Kouzuki, hit\
      \ a wall in her research due to technological constraints. With tensions rising,\
      \ and pressure to shift gears from governments all across the world, the UN\
      \ delegation opted to scrap the project in favor of its successor: Alternative\
      \ V. This was humanity\u2019s last resort \u2014 a plan that utilized all of\
      \ their remaining resources to build a migrant fleet of interstellar craft,\
      \ allowing a tiny fraction of the population to abandon the Earth in the hopes\
      \ of finding life anew in another star system. Takeru and his comrades-in-arms\
      \ were among those left behind, condemned to death by their fellow man.<br><br>But\
      \ it seems the hand of fate has bigger plans for Takeru, because it\u2019s at\
      \ this point that he wakes up to find himself back in his childhood bedroom\
      \ once again. Not in his own world, mind you \u2014 but back where he was first\
      \ spat out into this hellscape three years prior. This was no dream; this was\
      \ a recurring nightmare. But then it hits him: this is a second chance. If he\u2019\
      s truly been sent back in time, then he\u2019s the only one who knows of the\
      \ impending doom that awaits this world. Perhaps he can use this knowledge to\
      \ warn Professor Kouzuki, and together, they can somehow find a way to prevent\
      \ Alternative V from ever being enacted. And who knows? If he can change history,\
      \ then maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 he\u2019ll find the answers to all of\
      \ his questions. Why has he gone back in time? Why isn\u2019t Sumika here? And\
