    review: 'Acid Nimbus is a great solid foundation. It heavily reminds me of EtG
      and Ubermosh. I think if you like one of those games you will like this one.
      The Skulls and Boxing DLC is just another great addition to the game and I bought
      it because I liked the base game. If you unsure just try out the base game.
      I am pretty sure you will like it.
