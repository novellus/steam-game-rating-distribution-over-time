    review: 'If you like this type of game, it is still fun to play.

      Yes 8 hours is not much as yet. However i have played SPARTAN on retail version
      many hundreds of hours.

      LEGION is what I expected it to be, similar to SPARTAN in gameplay, interface,
      and visuals. I has less depth than SPARTAN, as the latter has a more elaborate
      diplomacy, more and different types of resources, a trade option and a  tech
      tree.

      Buy it on sale though, scenarios are limited and there is no grand campaign
      feature to conquer the ancient world.

      More feedback to come as I push though the different scenarios'
