    review: 'This is an enjoyable game and one that piqued my interest in the hidden
      object genre as something more than the simple flash games available in the
      early days of internet gaming.


      The game has lovely artwork and detailed backgrounds. The music is soft and
      relaxing and compliments the relaxed pace. The puzzles themselves are fairly
      easy, with the difficulty largely coming from finding objects within the detailed
      backgrounds.


      Story-wise, it''s enjoyable and enough to keep you engaged, but nothing phenomenal.


      I did miss some of the quality-of-life features that more recent hidden object
      games employ, such as maps that allow instant travel to visited areas, but not
      having them isn''t an issue.


      Overall, this is a fun, relaxing game that I enjoyed.'
