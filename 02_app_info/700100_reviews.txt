I'll be briefly analysing each game from best to worst and I'll give a score out of 10 for each of them (based on the other games and their quality)\n\n[b] 1 -  Spookids (10/10) [/b]\nGreat shoot'em up overall, the pixel art is gorgeous and the gameplay is incredibly fun. It has 4 playable characters, at the moment I'm writing this I've only played with one of them but I'll definitely will play again to test the other three. It has a wide variety of weapons which are very well balanced, they all are consistent while being pretty different gameplay wise, and that's a pretty incredible feat for a game to pull.\n\n[b] 2 - Wishing Sarah (10/10) [/b]\nWishing Sarah is the sequel to Dreaming Sarah, a great puzzle/adventure/horror game that you should definitely check out if you haven't yet, it's available in the Steam store for a extremely cheap price. Wishing Sarah is a short adventure game with some easy puzzles and an extremely unsettling atmosphere that doesn't rely on cheap jumpscares to make the player feel a false sense of horror. The pixel art is pretty and the gameplay feels good.\n\n[b] 3 - Thursday the 12th (9/10) [/b]\nExtremely unsettling first person exploration game, doesn't need to pull of cheap jumpscares in order to make you feel uncomfortable or scared. You play as a murderer trough his daily routine and find some unsettling stuff about his \"job\" while at it. The only downside of this game is that it is pretty short, I would love to have this as a completed game with a fully fleshed out story. The controls are simple as they should be and the kinda drawn graphics just accentuate the horror aspect of this game, as if the graphics are trying to lure you into this false sense of security with the cartoonish aspect.\n\n[b] 4 - Tower of 100 Floors (8/10) [/b]\nSolid and challenging rogue-like with great pixel-art and good gameplay. This is one of the games with highest replayability in this pack, you'll probably be stuck with it for a long time before you can complete it (hell I didn't even complete it yet). I just think there are some issues with balancing, there are 5 guns in the game and definitely the SMG is the best one, dual-wielding it just makes it even more powerful. There is a remote controlled RPG which is also pretty powerful, but things start to look kinda odd when the RPG (which drops from chests) are weaker than the dual wielding SMGs (you can get one SMG right when you start a run, also they drop from enemies and chests kinda frequently). There is a katana which is basically a long range knife, it's pretty useful for deflecting bombs, for example, and decently powerful overall, so you'll feel like using it along your runs. The pistols are weak to use solo but decent when dual wielding and the shotguns are just underwhelming, I honestly feel no motivation to use them, solo or dual-wield. Also the pit mechanic is pretty infuriating.\n\n[b] 5 - Spooky Cooking (6/10)[/b]\nA game where you have to tap a pumpkin to throw it into a cauldron while avoiding some obstacles. You can collect 2 powerups, one that makes your pumpkins invincible for a while and one that lets you throw pumpkins faster also for a while. The art is good and there's nothing wrong with the gameplay, but is a pretty bland game, it brings nothing new to the table nor it attempts to, it's not bad but it isn't good either. It ends up being the game with the most replayability value out of the pack for the number of achievements this game has. Again, it's not a bad game, so getting these achievements might get you hooked for a while.\n\n[b] 6 - Killing Moon (6/10) [/b]\nA pixel art puzzle game that I would've given at least an 8 if it wasn't for the awful controls. The pixel art of this game is pretty good, the plot is interesting enough but the person who made the controls (at least for keyboard + mouse) really dropped the ball. The controls are confusing, moving your character with the mouse doesn't feels good and it would just not work randomly at some times and interacting with objects or people is pretty infuriating. An easy fix for this game would be to just put movement in the WASD or arrow keys and polishing more the interactions with the mouse or, even better, tying interactions to a key in the keyboard.\n\n[b] 7 - Worship the Demon Lord (5/10) [/b]\nCute game that is probably fun to play with a friend but not really that interesting playing alone. You play trough some simple minigames, most of them you collect things to gain points. There are 3 minigames that catched my attention, one being the invisible maze one which is the most interesting (at least for me), the other 2 being one in which you have to collect candles (and if you die you just get spawnkilled because the respawn system sucks) and other that is a really awful rhythm game that really doesn't sync to the music or anything at all. \n\n[b] 8 - Cosmic Rain (4/10) [/b]\nA game about putting blobs in a certain order into a cauldron. The controls are pretty clunky, the powers are kinda weird and the music is a 5 second loop that will drain 1% of your sanity each minute you play. I kinda dig the graphics but they also need some polish. The game is not randomly generated, so once you finish it you won't feel like playing it anymore, I honestly think the random generation factor would be a huge thing to improve the game, instead of playing the same levels over and over.\n\n[b] 9 - Curse Bringer (0/0) [/b]\nIt's a text based game that takes about 5 minutes to complete if you're a fast reader. It's boring, there are around 4 choices in the game but I don't think they even matter that much, there are about 2 soundtracks that are used kinda randomly, the main character or any of the characters she interacts with aren't interesting at all, I zoned out at a point and that while playing a text game is saying something. When you complete this game you are awarded with an incredible black screen and nothing more. Honestly, playing trough anything with just text and a black background is pretty boring for me, but when the thing I'm playing is so short that the characters aren't even introduced properly or the plot isn't interesting nor goes nowhere... Like, come on, it could at least be a VN with images or something, I don't know, but it could be something at least, I feel like I just played nothing.\n\nAs you can see, it's kind of a mixed bag, however the low price of the game makes it worth your buck, the top 4 games alone are worth the value of the pack. Also I think it's important to support these devs, I'm sure they all have potential and the ones who kinda let me down in this pack just didn't have their moment of glory yet, so give them all a chance, I'm sure if you play this you'll have opinions that are different than mine.","timestamp_created":1602297585,"timestamp_updated":1609549450,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586721122264862061","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsfGn4PYCfLz3pgI="}
