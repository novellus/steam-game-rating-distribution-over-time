It gives you 5 new support items to defeat your online enemies with. My favorite item from this pack is the Impact grenade because you through it and it blows up fast instead of a small wait time which can give the enemy time to move away. Everything else is useful but needs some time to get used to their different function.  This content just speed things up for customizing things with your character. You can skip buying this and buy these items with in-game money. This just gives it to you early, I recommend it if you want to speed things up.","timestamp_created":1346487879,"timestamp_updated":1346487879,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561413228511810303","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41dC7wLkCcdWxCg=="}
