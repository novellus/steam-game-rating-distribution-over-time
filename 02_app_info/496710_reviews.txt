Somehow they think that the US will actually give in to these demands before a SWAT team or Navy SEALs kick in their door and ventilate them. \n\nThe best way to describe this movie is bland. The attempts to humanize the terrorists fails as the actors seem uninspired and so does the dialog. A lot of it is just the basic \"The US attacked first\" and \"The US has killed Muslims\". It failed to bring an understanding of the mindset of a terrorist or why someone would do this. This could have been an interesting character study but the script just wasn't there. \n\nThe only scene I enjoyed was when [spoiler] when after one terrorist murders another for having relations with his sister (who is also a terrorist), she screams \"Call 911\", because it's not like there's a kidnapped hostage here or anything... [/spoiler]. Everything else was boring and dull.","timestamp_created":1472221917,"timestamp_updated":1472221917,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.593470513820648193","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49PXQ49YCc7v+Xw=="}
