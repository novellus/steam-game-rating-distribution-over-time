On the one hand, the game delivers exactly on what it promises.  The store description says 7 levels of increasing difficulty.  You see the video on the game store page and the game screen shots.  So you know exactly what you're getting.  [b][u] Note: I played this on the Oculus Rift with Touch controllers, I had to do a windows 7 compatability fix, but then it worked fine after I started from Steam VR (didn't work if you start app directly from Steam) [/u] [/b]\n\nSo it comes down to value really.  Is this game worth $4.99?  Nope.  Is it worth $2.49?  That's where I'm struggling.  I don't want to give a negative review because the game worked exactly like it said it would.  It's a stand still, racket game where you basically have to knock down moving targets before you run out of time.  Priority is placed on the zombies that are destroying the fence.  \n\nI found that  you can control where the ball goes.  You really have to be good at both your forehand and backhand swings though.  I found it helps if you're staring at your target and time your swing correctly to achieve the right angle on the swing.  \n\nI think in the end, sadly, this game is a $.99 cents game really.  I almost finished this game in 30 minutes.  It was 1 environment, with only two enemy types (zombie, zombie with helmet), with only one powerup target (a bomb).  The 7 levels really don't change anything up, other than there's more zombies.  \n\nSale Price Rating 4.5/10 ... close, just needs more content to justify the current price or a further price drop to justify it's lack of content","timestamp_created":1511762670,"timestamp_updated":1511762838,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.606134772300720215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn8iF/t8CfdqBkAE="}
