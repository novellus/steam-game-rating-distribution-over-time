    review: "Absolute Gem of a trading game, first played this when i was younger\
      \ and still holds up to this day.  Nice chilled out experience with some fantastic\
      \ mechanics such as; \n\nauto buy and trade \nconvoys - for protection and cargo\
      \ increase \nreputation system in the form of various ranks to be achieved\n\
      ability to become lord mayor and improve towns\nchance to open trading offices\
      \ in other ports to further improve trade possibilities\nexpeditions to far\
      \ away lands - will you find trade, new lands or certain death!\nbecome a pirate!\
      \ \nhunt pirates!\n\nI struggled to get it to run for 20 mins or so when I initially\
      \ got it, however I'm running a 1080p patch and win 7 compatibility (could try\
      \ win xp too if in doubt) and launched it via exe in game files folder now it\
      \ launches perfectly and runs just swell, aside from random unexpected frame\
      \ drop when a large siege happens for some odd reason but it's nothing much\
      \ to complain about\n\nsolid 9/10 \n\nONLY BUY  if you're not going to miss\
      \ the 'thrill' of fast paced action games, this is a sit down and plan your\
      \ routes and course of action game, and I highly recommend it"
