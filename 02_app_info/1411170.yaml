    review: "I sorta liked it at first however the when you use the flashlight it\
      \ is that bright that you can't even see in front of you.\n\nSpoiler:\nAt the\
      \ end you have to find 5 ritual candles but because it takes so long to find\
      \ them you run out of batteries for your flashlight so then you are just running\
      \ around in the pitch dark so I ended up just leaving the game because I couldn't\
      \ progress further.\n \nI don't really see this as a really bad game but it's\
      \ just frustrating that your walking around for ages in such a large area running\
      \ out of batteries.\nIn most horror games you never get the time to explore\
      \ before your batteries run out seems to be happening all the time no matter\
      \ what horror game you play.\n\nI actually got a copyright strike on this video\
      \ to.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/b0oCmCSn8z4"
