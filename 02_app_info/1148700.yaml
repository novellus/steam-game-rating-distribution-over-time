    review: "TL;DR Enjoyed it but became monotonous. Check this game out later when\
      \ there is more content.\n\nPositives:\nGameplay was really satisfying, all\
      \ the attacks were very simple and you can easily dodge seeing all the numbers\
      \ when killing enemies with aoe is very satisfying. Each weapon has a different\
      \ feeling, different knockback when firing, different movement when firing,\
      \ different movement speed without firing. Some of them you want to be very\
      \ close to maximise damage, some can work really far, some ignite enemies so\
      \ hitting an enemy and then leaving is best.\n\nPerks you can get with skill\
      \ points from leveling up can be combined in meaningful ways and can have massive\
      \ impact on how you play. For example my favourite combination is kaboom(15%\
      \ on kill to explode), engulf(25% on kill ignite nearby enemies) and berzerker(double\
      \ damage when low) you would sometimes set off a chain reaction which killed\
      \ everything on the screen which is really fun on the endless waves mode (blitz).\n\
      \nNegatives:\nI say this with a heavy heart that it just becomes very monotonous.\
      \ After 2-3 hours of playing I unlocked everything and just needed to unlock\
      \ void run which was level capped. And the most efficient way to get there without\
      \ it feeling to grindy or taking to long is to just repeat underworld blitz.\
      \ \n\nTutorial how to beat the game:\nplay tutorial world until you can unlock\
      \ underworld\nplay underworld until you unlock its blitz mode\nspam underworld\
      \ blitz mode using the following build\nperks: \nLVL:5 quick learner + specialist\
      \ \nLVL:20+  quick learner + kaboom + specialist \n\nweapon: pheonix\naddons:\
      \ weapon damage \n\nYou can get to the end game content within 5 hours doing\
      \ this.\n\nThe end game content is to just repeat a void runs for random legendaries(a\
      \ random weapon from any of the zones with random damage numbers with a random\
      \ buff). Void runs is just shooting a giant crystal which doesn't have attacks\
      \ with a bunch of minions which can't hit you if you spam dodge. It takes 10\
      \ crystals to play a void run but you can just make that cost up if you kill\
      \ enough of the minions which respawn after you kill them. \n\n\nLack of content,\
      \ there is no co-op which I found very surprising for a looter shooter, you\
      \ end up just grind the void to get good legendaries so you can do the void\
      \ slightly faster, but not really since it has 2 phases where it goes invulnerable\
      \ for 30 seconds where you just wait. There is near to know story except in\
      \ the beginning it talks about there being a portal where monsters come from\
      \ or something like that. \n\n\n\n\n"
