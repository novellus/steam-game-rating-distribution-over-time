    review: 'Let me start off by saying that this is probably one of the most deeply
      technical games on Steam. The cryptanalysis techniques utilized in this are
      actual, real-life techniques used in academic cryptography and spy alike.


      How do I know this? I''m a cryptographer. :)


      By playing this game and learning how these techniques work, you will gain an
      understanding of how these attacks are performed. If you''re not familiar with
      the basics of cryptography, this game is likely too difficult for you, but there''s
      no better time to start than _right now_,


      The UX and UI definitely needs work, but this is a early-access game. As such,
      you should expect bugs and UX failures. I do think the price of $50 is far too
      much to ask for what is essentially a major technical demo, but as a cryptographer
      I couldn''t help but see this and say "wow someone made a game for me".


      From a cryptographer''s perspective, this game is realistic. This ain''t your
      average puzzle game - this is modern code breaking.'
