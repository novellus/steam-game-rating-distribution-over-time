    short_description: He got close a few times, but never won the Trashpit Championship.
      As skilled behind the wheel as your father was, there was something missing.
      Maybe it was instinct, maybe ferocity, or the hummingbird beat reaction times
      that success on the track demands.

    review: 'Phew Burning Cars...I play alot of games throughout a year and sometimes
      i''m finding some beautiful overlooked gems amongs all the games out there...Burning
      Cars is NOT one of those...This game is a serious contender to the number one
      spot of my most hated game 2015...This game is ridiculous, frusterating and
      awful in every way...Thank god there is ONLY 16 tracks in this...Now this would
      normally not be a good thing but in this game it IS a good thing...Everything
      is awful in this game...It''s so boring that i sleeped through 8 of the tracks
      and the other 8 i ate my keyboard in frustration, the graphic cut my eyes to
      pieces and absolutly NOTHING is fun in this game...there are only 2 freaky cars
      in this game!? A truck and a Buggy...I mean come on? And worst part is...There
      is a EASY and HARD mode...Fine i started with the hard mode and discovered a
      very strange thing...Apparently The developers haven''t heard that cars can
      actually turn...This shi t can''t be for real!?...I was litterly going 5 kmh
      through corners and STILL i had to reverse the car and SQUEEZE the car though
      a corner and THEN hit the wall...My waterbottle have not flown so many times
      around my livingroom EVER!...I was *F*R*U*S*T*R*A*T*E*D* to the limit...I was
      finally through the HARD mode with the last of my sanity and saw to my horror
      i had to do the whole thing in EASY mode...EASY mode was really EASY mode for
      one f ucking reason...The cars could TURN!? So the developers has chosen that
      the different between HARD and EASY mode should be that the cars can''t turn
      in HARD mode???....WTF!? I mean WTF!?!

      With all this said...Yeah you can upgrade your 2 cars...Weapons, armor, nitro
      etc. but these things dosen''t do jack for the game and it''s funess (is that
      a word?)...This game stinks in every aspect and it''s so boring...The 16 tracks
      is in the same place just add a few more corners and nothing else.

      Please people...DO NOT BUY AT ANY PRICE...To be perfectly honest, do not gift
      the game to anyone and if it''s gifted to you delete it from your inventory.


      My Judgement: 1/10


      Peace out Peeps!
