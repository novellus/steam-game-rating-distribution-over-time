    developer_response: About password, you never received in any levels. It's a secret
      code you that could find in random text around the game. I recommend you to
      play further more before judging my game, you just play only a few minutes.

    review: Too slow, with really unpleasant music. I also did not receive a password
      to access level 2 after beating level 1.
