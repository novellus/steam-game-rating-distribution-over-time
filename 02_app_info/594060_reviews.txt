I was a bit sad finding out, they're downloaded to your computer for use & nothing changes in game. \n\nOverall, I learned something new for future Steam buy's. I've been wanting this game & excited for it. The game seem's worth the sales price so far from what I've played & with the added on DLC purchased along side it! Happy, Thank You!","timestamp_created":1543106882,"timestamp_updated":1543107136,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":14,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.659852325916290283","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoMmWpOcCctLdsgE="}
