      /><br>Rescue Rina is a 2D Top-Down Sci-Fi themed adventure game based on the
      story of Rina, a young girl, who got kidnapped by the Evil scientists of Magix
      Corp. The purpose was to channel all of her human emotions into a special Heart-shaped
      Crystal capable of storing certain human emotions in the form of data that could
      later be transferred to the Robots.<br><br>One day, Hume, who is the main protagonist,
      confessed his feelings to Rina and wanted to meet her on the riverside surrounded
      by cherry trees. She agreed to his proposal and was looking forward to the day.
      Hume reached the location on time but even after waiting for about a few hours,
      she did not show up. However, things took a darker turn when he got a call from
      Rina''s mom who told him that she did not return home. Hume was restless and
      wanted to go to the location by himself for clues. But as soon as he reached
      the location, he found a Giant crystal which was shining bright. As soon as
      he touched the crystal he got teleported to The Magix Corp. world where he came
      across various traps and the challenges. <br><br>Soon, he came to know that
      Rina got captured by the Evil Scientists for experimentation on human emotions
      and he vowed to rescue her as soon as possible no matter what happens. <br><br>You
      play as the main protagonist, Hume, whose mission is to rescue Rina at all costs.
      Would you be able to solve the mystery of Heart-shaped crystals and rescue her
      unharmed?<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1400350/extras/rr_gif_1.gif?t=1601044205"

    review: Good game, I liked it. Basically you have to avoid traps and opponents.
      I have a couple of other games from the developer, they are not bad either.
