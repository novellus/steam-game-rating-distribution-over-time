Each character is a set of three horizontal lines be they solid or halved -- called \"trigrams.\"  Walking over the forked block, a trigram appears onscreen at right.* \n  *A web search of 'trigrams i ching' yields info on decoding the eight trigrams of the Taoist I Ching and the 64 hexagrams, corresponding to 64 levels in the game. Each hexagram presents a philosophy, to start the level. www -dot- taoistiching -dot- org  \n\n  A key point is to know you can replay later levels to exit in a different direction.\n  When the ending door opens, the color of the -- what looks like confetti -- behind it is important. White is passable. Commenters have shown frustration at the orange door which cannot be passed through. A developer has confirmed this, stating: \"yes, it's not a bug, when its orange means you can not enter. There is a chart in one of the levels that explains how to access later levels, you are basically trying to jump to the last level without finishing the others first :)\" http://steamcommunity.com/app/467090  \n  To understand this from a Tao perspective, the I Ching assists. To the effect of: \n  \"When the way comes to an end, change. Having changed, you pass through.\"\n  In other words, try a different path in order to exit.\n\n  The toggles are somewhat self-explanatory. Usually like affects like. Yin-yang changes some element blocks to their opposites. There are red ribbon blocks whose affect I don't understand/ recall.\n\n  I have unlocked 12 levels and passed nine of those. (I haven't found the level-key chart yet, personally.) Have owned it a year plus but play seldom. (It takes a certain patient, inquisitive frame of mind.) When I feel too single-minded, I quit for awhile. I feel I have played more hours than recorded, more than a dozen.\n\n  The price has come down since I bought it. If you can find patience within and desire to learn about the Tao, then IMO the current $5 asking is more than fair.","timestamp_created":1516521068,"timestamp_updated":1516521404,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596872448921203613","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5obui+ECe4DZlgE="}
