I still don’t really know. But for me playing this game was the best mind-sanitizer I could find on my first day of self-isolation. \n\nI couldn’t deal with the pandemic happening in the real world. Playing this game let me regress into a childish fantasy-land with retro feels and cool music, where the rules were very simple: “dodge bullets and shoot things”. Flatten the curve? No screw that, just flatten everything before your screen fills up with wiggly snakes, eye-balls, and celestial squids. Like a virus in a supermarket filled with bogans who don’t wash their hands, they’ll just keep multiplying until you can’t go anywhere. Power-ups come with sagely wisdom spoken by a robotic voice. And he speaks the truth! Carrots ARE good for you. Coffee DOES make you faster. And when you collect enough of those precious power-ups, your bullets really will “attack more better”. \n\nDon’t let this be the robo-fish that got away. Make friends with yourself. Play Zunius.","timestamp_created":1585960670,"timestamp_updated":1585977367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ncPnofECfN7r/QE="}
