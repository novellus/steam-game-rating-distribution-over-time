    review: Most towers are manually fired, which is fine in and of itself. however,
      the basic tower requires button mashing to fire at a vaguely reasonable rate,
      and when you're firing you can't run around collecting coins. When you're running
      around collecting coins, you can't fire. The flamethrower tower can fire just
      by being held down, which is fine, but it's very short range, so it's not usable
      as a front line of defense. May be more fun with multiplayer, since one of you
      could be collecting coins while the other shoots, and you can double up on shooting
      when you're close to losing. The button mashing killed the game for me.
