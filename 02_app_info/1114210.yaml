    review: "Don't be put off by the lack of reviews in English.  This is actually\
      \ a really nice puzzle game.  The levels are varied enough to stay interesting\
      \ and the learning curve is steady without any jarring leaps.  Colloc feels\
      \ very complete, with a nice outer map screen and charming backgrounds in the\
      \ levels.  There are simple and clear instructions for the main mechanics, which\
      \ I really appreciate.  \n\nThe only feature that was missing for me was an\
      \ undo button.  As most of the levels were short (less than 30 moves) it wasn't\
      \ a problem through the easier parts of the game, just on a few of the bigger\
      \ levels with 30-55 moves.  Still, it wasn't a huge issue as the character movement\
      \ is easy and fast.  \n\nI spent 11-12 hours to get all the achievements, and\
      \ nearly all of that time was enjoyable.  Something to note is that to get all\
      \ of the 'towers' for completing the game, the levels have to be finished below\
      \ a certain number of moves.  There's more than enough content for a casual\
      \ gamer who doesn't care too much about achievements or completion, or for a\
      \ more dedicated puzzle-solver who likes to optimize their solution.  Nothing\
      \ is ridiculously difficult, as the solutions aren't so open-ended that you\
      \ can go astray for hours on end.  \n\nThe only 'story' is that you are saving\
      \ an island from 'black hole 24' by defeating the tower levels that are accessible\
      \ after completing the main levels in each world (9 each+tower).  No timing\
      \ challenges.  \n\nWhen you move, any characters you have on the screen will\
      \ all move in the same direction, unless they have nowhere to move to, in which\
      \ case they stay where they are.  This is one of the main elements of solving\
      \ the puzzles, as it changes the configuration of your characters when some\
      \ of them move and others don't.  \n\nOne world has 'zombies' which cause you\
      \ to restart the level if you move to the same square as them.  The zombies\
      \ are controlled by your movements, and move in the opposite direction both\
      \ horizontally and vertically to your characters.  They don't move on their\
      \ own so their is no feeling of being chased or attacked, only blocked.\n\n\
      This is the work of one developer, which is impressive!  Well worth picking\
      \ up if you like tricky puzzles and cute graphics."
