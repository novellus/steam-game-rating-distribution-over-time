It is still a fun little game to play on and off but don't expect much. The biggest problem is: it is 60 levels which they try to make the game seem longer and more worth it but it just the same every level, they can just make it 30 levels I wouldn't be that upset.\n\nI really like the gameplay (at first), the game mechanic is great, little to no bug overall, but every level is so identical, it get boring very fast, it basically had no change every level, they just adding more customers to make the game more difficult, which just drag the level longer without any real challenge and fun, I play a lot of TM games and I know those games are kind of repetitive but this is another level kind of repetitive. I start to yell out it's boring at some point, this is the kind of game you play on and off, not some game that will make you want to play continuously. \n\nAnother point is the game artwork, it's kind of pretty in my opinion, but there is three restaurants, all just basically had the artwork change, the place where they place everything is still the same, customers had no different. The cutscene is also very boring, story is good but too many words squeeze in one picture, it also look very weird in full screen, it doesn't fit the screen, it stay on 1:1, not 16:9. It's a 2019 game, it shouldn't have this problem.\n\nI would recommend it if you buy this at lower price, it doesn't worth the money at full price. It basically like a mini game that drag on for 60 levels. I really wish the second one is better because I already bought it together with this one. \n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1609166927,"timestamp_updated":1609166927,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ydb01PYCctaPvgI="}
