    review: "Unplayable trash. The audio/video stutters so badly you can't work out\
      \ what anyone is saying or what's going on. The devs have known about this since\
      \ 2017 and yet did nothing. \n\nI regret wasting money on this. Saw it in the\
      \ summer sale, impulse bought it, and now discover it's an unplayable trainwreck\
      \ and the devs don't give a crap to fix it. Sadly because I waited so long to\
      \ install it, now it's too late for a refund.\n\nDO NOT WASTE MONEY ON THIS\
      \ BROKEN TRASH - THE DEVELOPERS ARE THIEVES."
