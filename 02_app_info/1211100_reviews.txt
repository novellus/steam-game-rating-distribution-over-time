They have a lot of moons and some don't.\n- Too many questions about dwarf planets\n- And at least questions about distances between earth, moon, mars. They are prone to change.\n\nProns definitely overweight cons.\n\nAnyway, It's a very good quiz for anyone very interested in astronomy and thanks to encyclopedia you can learn a lot.","timestamp_created":1600780389,"timestamp_updated":1600780389,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qMn82vQCddCtowI="}
