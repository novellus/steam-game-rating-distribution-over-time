    review: 'The makers of this game have been playing Master of Orion 2. The look
      is nearly identical and the tech tree, game play, and even tactical combat are
      carbon copies. It was a great game to be inspired by. Let''s see how they did...


      The good: The graphics are an upgrade. It''s more challenging than MoO2 was
      once you figured things out. There are more indigenous races and they''re quirky
      and interesting. The ships can be auto-upgraded. Every race can get every technology
      (which always annoyed a completionist like me in MoO2). You don''t have to build
      so many things to get a colony functioning, which speeds up the game. The "go
      back" button is simply genius, in that I don''t have to save my game every turn
      to avoid stupid and avoidable mistakes.


      The bad: The music is forgettable. The races'' back-stories mean they can''t
      be customized. The MoO2 antagonists (the Antarens) are space pirates here, but
      don''t seem dangerous and almost never happen (encountered once in three games).
      Diplomacy is missing a large number of actions (threatening them to get out
      of your territory, asking them to surrender, asking them to surrender a planet
      or system, surrendering a planet or system to them (possibly for peace or reputation),
      and the trade doesn''t seem to work with anybody but the mercenaries and slavers...in
      which case, why offer it for normal races?). This game, slowed down and on a
      large galaxy, could take days or weeks on normal...nevermind hard or very hard.
      The weapons for auto-upgrading ships can be very paper-rock-scissors and you
      can easily get pwned without seeing it coming. It''s the strategic equivalent
      of putting platforms off the screen on a platformer game and requiring a leap
      of faith...and hoping you won''t die. I guess you really need that "go back"
      button after all...


      The ugly: This game simply doesn''t pop. It''s not bad, but neither is it great.
      In 50 years or longer, I''ll never forget MoO2. I own a CD and now use a DOS
      emulator when I get nostalgic. I once saw a computer running MoO2 in a video
      game museum. My wife even asked if this was that old-fashioned space game that
      I used to play when she saw it. This game is a worthy effort, and kept me up
      for a few nights, but in the end this game seems like exactly what it is: a
      copy of a great game using current graphics and systems to seem better. Super
      Mario 2 may have had better graphics, but it wasn''t the massive improvement
      over Super Mario Bros. that SMB was over, say, Atari.


      My final word: They gave it a shot. This game is worth the try. But it won''t
      stand the test of time. If someone asks me about in in a year, I won''t know
      what they''re talking about. That being said, if you never played MoO2, and
      don''t want to pirate an emulator copy or buy a CD so you own a license, then
      this game is worth trying. It is a decent space game and carries the best of
      MoO2 over, with some new innovations. There are better games, but also many,
      many worse. I give it 3.8 out of 5.'
