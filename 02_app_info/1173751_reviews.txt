I found it to be full of repetition, with most of the images being compilations of the same or very similar graphics, and/or outright repeats of previous pieces. It even breaks out of the aesthetic by bringing in a more realistically styled painting for the large final piece, which is made worse because by that point you've painted that same image with less detail twice already in previous pieces. A boring grind, skip this one.","timestamp_created":1584102647,"timestamp_updated":1584102647,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zYT46fACfJTn9wE="}
