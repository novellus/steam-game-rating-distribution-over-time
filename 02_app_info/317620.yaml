    review: Very good rendition of Space Hulk with RPG elements, such as leveling.
      You can select weapons, equipment, and skills. Very nicely done. I have unlocked
      all achievements, except for one. Pretty good indicator of what I think about
      the game. From a former table-top 40K player, this is highly recommended.
