    about_the_game: Take care of a group of travelers on a post-apocalyptic road-trip
      across the United States in this turn-based survival game. Fight scary creatures,
      rescue stranded survivors, and scavenge for supplies like fuel, first aid kits,
      and weapons. Decide where to go next, whether it's upgrading this wrecked car,
      or rescuing that dog. Just remember, there are consequences for every action.
      Get ready for close calls, dramatic escapes, hard choices, arguing about whether
      or not that dog gets rescued, and the end of the world.<br><br><strong>Overland
      Version 1.2 is now available! </strong>Explore the end of the world with new
      pug dog companions and new rest stop levels. Enjoy the new introduction and
      prologue! This version includes 3 new difficulty settings, 7 new game modifiers
      including all dogs mode, tourist mode, and expert settings. You can browse records
      from your past trips and check out updated badge and stats displays. Overland
      v1.2 also includes dialog, item and environment updates to make Overland even
      better. <br><br><strong>Features:</strong><br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Always
      keep fuel in the tank. Stay away from the creatures. Be careful. Be quiet.<br></li><li>
      Loud sounds attract trouble, and there's no way you can fight them all. Grab
      as much gas as you can, rescue that trapped stranger, and get back in the car
      before it's too late.<br></li><li> Travel West, through grasslands, over mountains,
      across deserts, and to even stranger places. Every level, roadmap, and character
      is randomly generated, so each trip is new.<br></li><li> Equip dozens of items,
      including medkits, shields, axes, potted plants, scavenged armor, and luggage
      racks.<br></li><li> Twitch integration lets your viewers join in on your journey,

    review: I love it, find it addictive retrying levels to get through flawlessly
      and i can see replaying on harder difficulty just for fun which i never do.
      Usually i get either bored or frustrated with a game after awhile and move on
      to another but this game keeps me playing . Im not saying its perfect but a
      game doesnt need to be flawless to be fun.
