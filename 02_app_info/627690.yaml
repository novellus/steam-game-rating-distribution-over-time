      \ /><br><br>&quot;Where was this device discovered,&quot; Lazaapz whispered,\
      \ &quot;and how old is it?&quot;<br><br>The goblin artificer reached out of\
      \ her mechanized armor to run her fingers along the surface of the Eldritch\
      \ Machine, admiring the elegant craftsmanship. It resembled a large metallic\
      \ sarcophagus, covered in arcane runes written in an ancient language.<br><br>&quot;It\
      \ was unearthed during one of our recent expeditions to Xen'Drik,&quot; the\
      \ surly envoy of House Cannith responded. &quot;Our analysis has confirmed that\
      \ this device was constructed by the Cul'sir Dominion approximately forty thousand\
      \ years ago.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Incredible. THEY WERE SO SMART! I've only seen\
      \ a handful of other machines they've created. There was the one down in the\
      \ Cogs but it was broken, and then there was the last one your employers brought...&quot;\
      \ Lazaapz trailed off as she wandered around the machine, inspecting it from\
      \ every angle.<br><br>&quot;House Cannith trusts that you will keep the results\
      \ of your testing discrete as per our previous arrangement.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Did\
      \ you see this?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I'm not sure what you're pointing at.&quot;\
      \ The envoy shifted to get a better view of what Lazaapz was gesturing towards.<br><br>&quot;These\
      \ are symbols associated with Dal Quor. Do you see them? WHOA! If this machine\
      \ is from over forty thousand years ago, that could mean it has something to\
      \ do with the Quori. Weren't the Quori corporeal on our plane back then? OH\
      \ BOY! Do you know what this could mean!?&quot;<br><br>&quot;...I'll leave you\
      \ to it,&quot; said the envoy, turning to leave the workshop. Lazaapz didn't\
      \ notice. She rarely noticed people when her mind was fixated on a mechanical\
      \ puzzle. AND WHAT A PUZZLE! This will be fun...<br><br>Learn more on our official\
