    review: "Trumpi\xF1ata has a bug where it makes you do a complete 180 to actually\
      \ see Trump. It\u2019s actually metaphorical, making you \u2018look back\u2019\
      \ on things, such as looking back on the fact that you saw the \xA30.79 price\
      \ tag and still thought it\u2019d be a good idea. Looking back on the fact that\
      \ you wasted storage on it, looking back on the life decisions that made you\
      \ open the damn game. Trumpi\xF1ata is about looking back. And when you do,\
      \ you realise how much of a fucking idiot you are.\n\n10/10"
