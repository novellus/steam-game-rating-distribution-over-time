    short_description: Operation Freyja begins, but Hikari isn't a part of it. She's
      been shuffled off to the rear lines to keep her safe, while Takami stands at
      the forefront of the 502nd's flight wing. But when Freyja goes wrong, who will
      be there to help pick up the pieces and save the day?
