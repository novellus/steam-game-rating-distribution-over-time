      /><br><br>Following a bizarre cataclysmic event that cracked the moon in half,
      the Earth is struggling with the environmental fallout. Everything is already
      dead or dying... except you. Or so you think. Don''t Escape: 4 Days to Survive
      is a post-apocalyptic thriller from veteran developer Scriptwelder, creator
      of the popular horror series Deep Sleep and Don''t Escape. Players must figure
      out a way to properly fortify their home against each night''s new danger, as
      they learn the truth behind the apocalypse and search for a way to safety, if
      one exists.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/611760/extras/spider_gif_(1).gif?t=1594324734"
      /><br><br>Players will journey alongside David, a lone survivor after the end
      of the world, who finds himself having prophetic dreams... or nightmares. Each
      chapter of the game has multiple potential variations to encounter, from poisonous
      fog or spiders to a gang of murderous thugs or a deadly heat wave, and as a
      result, you''ll need to adjust your strategy on different playthroughs. But
      you don''t have forever. Certain actions advance the in-game clock, and you''ll
      need to complete your preparations to (hopefully) stay alive before night falls.
