    review: Beautiful visuals. The details of the VR spaces are amazing. There are
      some really nice effects like when you stick your head under water in the stream.
      Game play is a work in progress. There are puzzles to solve but there isn't
      a clear connection between them so things can seems a bit random. Given the
      on-going updates of the Early Access it looks like this will improve. There
      is definitely a lot of potential for this game.
