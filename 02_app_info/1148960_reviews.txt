The software (if you could call it that) has no depth to it. What you see in the video is what you get. There's always music when characters are animated. Text to speech has one male and one female voice and that's it.\n\nThe software has the potential of becoming a really fun animating studio if workshop support/more semi in-depth futures were added.\n\nIf you're looking for something braindead to the point that creativity is greatly limited, then this is for you.","timestamp_created":1596345369,"timestamp_updated":1596345369,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mqjm1vMCeOH0mAI="}
