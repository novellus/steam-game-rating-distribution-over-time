I think its a pretty great game! Being its .99 cents in the US. I find it a pretty nice experience! Its as if someone thought of taking a shooting game you'd find at an arcade and make it a VR game.\n\nIts a normal shooter. Two guns, Shotgun and an assault rifle. I had a problem before where the rifle wouldnt reload but you'd just have to reload the game. Its pretty fun with the bullet dodging mechanics and the shooting. Its a challenge which I find it more than 30 minutes. I would recommend this if you have some left over cash or steam wallet credit. Many compare it to bullet sorrow but I had never played and saying this it must be great.\n\nSome peeves are just not being able to use a controller to move, no dual wielding(or I just couldnt do it with my HTC for some reason?), no continues, no lore so you dont really have a role to play in this rpg, and I havent been able to find any medkits in the start and some bullets phase through walls. \n\nSome greats are the variety in enemies, barrels to shoot, the shotgun is great, the settings you are put in challenge you to move yourself and try being active for once, and the best thing for me is how it is just the setting. Its well defined and it is immersive. As if everything had quite a bit of effort into it.\n\nBut I still think that with its flaws. Its still a great game and I would prefer it. Its not everyday you find a game with some good quality and for such a low price.(good for me, a cheapskate.)","timestamp_created":1607570600,"timestamp_updated":1607570723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i9KrpfYCcJrFuAI="}
