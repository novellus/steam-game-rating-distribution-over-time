If you're playing on mouse/keybord I'm able to verify that controls work for WASD+Shift for P1 and Arrow keys for P2 on my machine. AJ is also full controller support, and is the recommended input device. What input are you using? \n\nSuper appreciate you taking the time to let us know!\nJeff"}],"cursor":"AoJ4+YbQ+PUCd4r3rwI="}
