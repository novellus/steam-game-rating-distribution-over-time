You always fill all available spots on a map with towers and get to max them out without any challenge. Which leaves your strategic choices to be your tower composition and perhaps when to sell your gold towers. Huge tower ranges makes positioning almost irrelevant. And towers with smaller ranges have mechanics like \"deal more damage to monsters with HP>50%\" (and the opposite), making position choices very obvious and/or uninteresting.\n\nThen the game plays out way too slow, even at 3 x speed. You have nothing to do except spamming upgrades until all towers are 100% upgraded, and then you just endure until you are dead. I would be surprised if *any* players can sit through more than 3 maps of this.\n\nOther than that the game looks alright and there are no obvious bugs, so it's not a complete train wreck. It's just tedious. :(","timestamp_created":1575117949,"timestamp_updated":1575117949,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hJGW3u4Cf9uF4AE="}
