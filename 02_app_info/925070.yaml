    review: This game is crap.  Not a relaxed hidden object game (which I love and
      have bought dozens) but everything is on a timer.  After getting past the clunky
      navigation system, I was finally on a screen with something to do.  One of the
      items I had to find was a comb, I could not find it at all, pressing hint revealed
      a hair brush!? It is this lack of attention to detail and clunky navigation
      which is making me uninstall the game.  Even though I purchased it on a sale,
      I fell ripped off by the very low price I paid.
