      (spacebar), sprinting (hold shift key while moving), and interacting with interactable
      objects (E key). The right mouse button will aim in the player's currently equipped
      weapon, and the left mouse button will fire said weapon. Using the scroll wheel
      will swap between the two weapons that can be carried at a time, and the X key
      will drop the currently selected weapon, allowing the player to swap for another
      weapon if they so choose to. Interactable items will be highlighted in yellow
      when the mouse cursor is hovered over them, prompting a instructional screen
      prompt to show up, which instructs the player to press the E key in order to
      interact with the focused object. All these features combined create a 'First
