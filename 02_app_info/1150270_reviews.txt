But to spend $8 on an asset template, mess with it and screw it all up, then export it and upload it on to Steam and ask money takes the lowest common denominator of a person.  And that's what we have here!  Oh how proud this indie dev must really be of this broken asset flip!\n\nHere it is on Unity (In perfect working order):  https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/packs/neon-space-fighter-shooting-asteroids-and-spaceships-endless-sci-107048\n\nAnd here it is when I played it all of about 35 seconds before I knew exactly what it was (an asset flip)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbf-uFRosNU\n\n\nMy Score;  A big fat asset ZERO.  Not worth the two cents this indie dev is likely selling each Steam key for on some Russian key selling website.  Definitely not worth 49 cents or 99 cents here.  Stay FAR away from this utter trash.","timestamp_created":1603273696,"timestamp_updated":1603275189,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.45098036527633667","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sL2ppfUCd+uaqQI="}
