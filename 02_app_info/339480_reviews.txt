As a small developer, OK and LL have to make their money somehow. But with the growing popularity of the game, charging 7 USD (10 dollars for me in Australia, due to tax) for 2 somewhat short heists is a little bit... overkill. If they had just included the Dragan character pack in the DLC, that wouldve been okay. From a business pov, well done OK, but as a consumer, this is a little bit of a rip.\n\n-THE FOREST HEIST is lazy.\nThe forest heists sounds like a cool idea, massive explosions, derailing a train, grabbing the bomb tactically and bailing back to your escape tug boat... but the reality is... this heist is lazy as hell.\nWhy? Well this is the 10-15 minute heist in order of objectives.\n\n1. Find a train car with the bomb (which is really that hard, as there is only a few objectives to push F on)\n\n2. Place thermite and wait.\n\n2. Wait for helicopter ( or connect hose instantly)\n\n3. Connect tube and wait.\n\n4. Wait.\n\n5. Wait.\n\n6. Escape.\n\nIts just lazy and boring, there's no cool features like the Big Bank. It's just press F, shoot and wait. You don't even derail the train yourself, this was obviously a rushed heist compared to the Docks.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[h1]PROS.[/h1]\n\n-Masks look awesome! (and they are actually fairly hard to get)\n-High difficulty achievements, that will require friends.\n\n-The Dockyard Heist STEALTH is a new stealth revolution.\nIf your into stealth, the Dockyards heist is a good place to practice while getting a good reward upon completion. Due to the size and space of the map, it is relatively easy to run past guards, but... the size also means there is a lot of stealth travelling to objectives. \n\n-DockYards is FUN.\nThe size, the complexity, and the reward make the Dockyards heist a playground for heisters. Stealth or Loud, there is a range of different objectives, which makes the forest heist somewhat lazy (again!).\n\n-Pistol performs just as well as it looks.\nEnough said. haha\n\n----------------------------\n\n[h1]Overall, the bomb heist feels like a cash grab, but some of the new additions make it worthwhile, especially the dockyards. As always, happy heisting and have fun getting those achievements...[/h1]","timestamp_created":1422239537,"timestamp_updated":1609936910,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.639317810535430908","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6/bt6/YCdZOINg=="}
