If it was 5 euros it would be somewhat acceptable. The flight controls are simple and the movement feels natural for the airship you are flying. Getting it off the ground is pretty easy as long as you follow the checklist but once in the air you don't ever have to worry about anything again so it's not really a \"flight simulator\" but it is still interesting.\n\nThe game however sorely lacks in information on how to do certain things. In two hours all I managed to do was fly around land take off again attach modules and put cargo back and forth. The game offers no real instruction in what goes where specifically or how to do certain things. There is also an astonishingly lack of information to get online considering the game is about a year old by now. I refunded the game and will keep an eye on it and see if it turns into a better game in the future but for now all I can say is wait patiently. If you are desperate for city builder games there are numerous great ones already on the market \"like cities skylines\" as well as the free open transport tycoon deluxe.","timestamp_created":1507572089,"timestamp_updated":1507572089,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.621449053287506104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4ipCTgd8CeLrnhwE="}
