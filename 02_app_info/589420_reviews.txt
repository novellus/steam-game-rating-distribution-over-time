Play it now! What do you have to loose. The music is hype and the artwork in Grass Cutter is awesome. The game itself is simple, or is it? You'll find yourself repeating the same level to get the best time and score and you'll challenge yourself to do better and better. When you run into the monsters sometimes your lawn mower will explode! You can choose from many different kinds of lawnmowers too. Grass Cutter is comical, challenging, fun, and addicting. There are TONS of levels so you'll be entertained for many many hours. I still haven't gotten to the end :)","timestamp_created":1609808605,"timestamp_updated":1609808605,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49L2E6PYCdPbHwAI="}
