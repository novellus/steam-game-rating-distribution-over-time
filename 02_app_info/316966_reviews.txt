I find myself CONSTANTLY trimming the aircraft and still seeing it pitch left and right. \n\nThe aircraft barely seems able to hold a heading - in fact, the heading and altitude controls just don't seem to work either - or are extremely sensitive. \n\nOr maybe this is just a crappy in-game flight model depiction of a decent real-life aircraft. Given its real-world missions (airshows and training) then I highly doubt this aircraft handles this poorly in real life.\n\nAvoid this aircraft.","timestamp_created":1609337205,"timestamp_updated":1609337205,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522471904754638672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kJ7+2fYCfrPkvgI="}
