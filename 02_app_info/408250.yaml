    review: 'Seems like this would be a really neat experience.


      Unfortunately, the game has not been optimised for different VR users. I''m
      playing wirelessly on a Quest 2, and I can''t use my Quest controllers, having
      to tether myself to a PC using a controller. I also can''t swivel around in
      my seat, the game hitting me with a ''tilt your head to more comfortably turn''
      message every time I try to play the way any other VR game allows you to. No,
      game, tilting my head makes me feel queasy.


      With an update that allowed me to play by turning 360 degrees while using my
      Quest controllers, I''m sure I would recommend this game.'
