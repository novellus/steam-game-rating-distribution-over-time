      normal games, mangy games and plenty of great rewards waiting to be redeemed!<br>There
      are 13 legal types of tiles that can be played in Dojo.<br>(1) Single: the order
      of size from 3 (smallest) to King (largest).<br>(2) Pair: two cards of the same
      size, from 3 (smallest) to 2 (largest).<br>(3) Three: three cards of the same
      size.<br>(4) Three with one: three and bring any one card, e.g. 6-6-6-8, compared
      according to the size of the three cards, e.g. 9-9-9-3 over 8-8-8-A.<br>(5)
      Three with a pair: three and bring a pair, similar to a side road in poker (Full
      House), compared according to the size of the three cards, e.g. Q-Q-Q-6-6 over
      10-10-10-K-K.<br>(6) Straight: at least five cards of consecutive sizes (from
      3 to A, 2 and odd cannot be used), e.g. 8-9-10-J-Q.<br>(7) Consecutive pairs:
      at least 3 pairs of consecutive sizes (from 3 to A, 2 and odd cannot be used),
      e.g. 10-10-J-J-Q-Q-K-K.<br>(8) Three of a kind jokers: at least 2 three of a
      kind of consecutive size (from 3 to A), e.g. 4-4-4-5-5-5.<br>(9) Planes: each
      triple with an extra singleton, e.g. 7-7-7-8-8-8-3-6, able to bring a singleton
      2 and a king, although a triple 2 is not available.<br>(10) Three cards with
      a pair of jokers: each of the three cards brings an extra pair, only the three
      cards need to be consecutive, for example 8-8-8-9-9-9-4-4-J-J, although the
      three 2s cannot be used, but can bring a pair of 2s [cannot bring a pair of
      kings, because the size of the two monsters is not the same], it should be noted
      here that the three cards with a single card and a pair cannot be mixed, for
      example 3-3-3-4-4-4-6-7-7 is not legal.<br>(11) Bombs: four cards of the same
      size, bombs can cover all other cards except rockets, and larger bombs can cover
      smaller ones.<br>(12) King Bomb: a pair of monsters, which is the largest combination,
      capable of covering any tile type including bombs.<br>(13) Four with two: There
      are two types of cards, a four with two singles, such as 6-6-6-6-6-8-9, or a
      four with two pairs, such as J-J-J-J-J-9-9-Q-Q. Four with two only compares
      according to the size of the four, and can only cover the same type of four
      with two that is smaller than itself [four with two and four with two pairs
      belong to different types of cards and cannot cover each other], and cannot
      cover other types of cards, and four with two can be covered by bombs that are
      smaller than itself.'
