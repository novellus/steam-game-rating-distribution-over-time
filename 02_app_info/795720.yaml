    review: "[h1]IN A WORD: [b]MAYBE[/b] [/h1] \n\n[h1]BITESIZE:[/h1]\n[quote=]\n\
      [b]OF A SIMILAR NATURE TO:[/b] \n[b]WHAT TO EXPECT:[/b] \nPreviously a one time\
      \ free, event. Stand-a-lone pve content. Now must be purchased as dlc. Get to\
      \ play as Chaos. Endless mode map designed with odds stacked up against one\
      \ character. New cards for player decks. Required for 100% achievement completion.\n\
      [b]ACHIEVEMENTS:[/b] FIVE. ONE IS VERY GRINDY.\n[b]STATUS:[/b] COMPLETE.\n[b]WHEN\
      \ TO BUY:[/b] AS PART OF COMPLETE BUNDLE. ON SALE.[/quote]\n\n[i]More info below....[/i]\n\
      \n[h1]THE LOWDOWN:[/h1]\nWarhammer 40,000: Space Wolf - Fall of Kanak (FoK)\
      \ is a prequel themed story played from the other side, the Chaos Word Bearers\
      \ legion. Landing on the planet Kanak their mission is to capture the planet's\
      \ key installations. Their opponents, Skull Taker units loyal to the Imperium.\n\
      \nFoK is a dlc that lets players experience firsthand the events that preceded\
      \ the main story. It provides a single themed pve endless mode to the base game.\
      \ First released free as an time-limited event along with achievements, it is\
      \ now a required purchase if you want to 100% achievement completion. Players\
      \ take control of a new character with its own fixed deck of cards, a mechanic\
      \ to gather heavy weapons required to stay alive for longer and periodically\
      \ spawning booster that can be picked-up to keep them alive against insurmountable\
      \ odds. Against him are an array of human warriors whos numbers appear infinite.\n\
      \nRequired for achievements:\nAcolyte of the Blood God -Take part in the Fall\
      \ of Kanak event.\nSkulls for the Skull Throne! (common) - Collect 100 skulls.\n\
      Skulls for the Skull Throne! (rare) - Collect 250 skulls.\nSkulls for the Skull\
      \ Throne! (epic) - Collect 500 skulls.\nSkulls for the Skull Throne! (legendary)\
      \ - Collect 1000 skulls.\n\n[h1]THE GOOD:[/h1]\n+ New set of six cards for the\
      \ main game. Two legendary.\n+ Play as the other side, the forces of Chaos.\n\
      \n[h1]THE BAD:[/h1]\n- One very grindy achievement.\n- A single map. A single\
      \ PvE arena \u2013 Imperial Guard Garrison.\n- Only one playable character.\
      \ Pollux the Flayer, Champion of Khorne.\n- Non-customisable deck.\n\n[h1]AND\
      \ THE ORDINARY:[/h1]\n* Play against new enemies \u2013 Kanak Skull Takers.\n\
      * Two new mechanics. Time dropped heavy weapons and booster pickups.\n* New\
      \ achievements.\n\n[h1]VERDICT:[/h1]\nWorth getting for the extra content. Even\
      \ if it is just one map, with continous waves of enemies attacking your only\
      \ character. No allies make an appearance here. Of the two legendary cards to\
      \ augment your deck, neither is required for achievements. The heavy bolter\
      \ is fine for the terminator build but can be overlooked for a lesser model\
      \ or bypassed for other comparable weapons.\n\nOverall the game mode is pretty\
      \ fun. Very, very repetitive if aiming for the 1000 kills achievement. I enjoyed\
      \ it till around 500 kills and then I farmed kills periodically to complete.\
      \ The spawn rate and composition seem over-balance to keep the player always\
      \ trending water and never coming up to get enough of a mouthful of air. Feels\
      \ in keeping with endless mode design.\n\nOnly worthwhile if you are planning\
      \ for 100% achievement completion. As it is separate from the campaigns, if\
      \ that is your only focus for this game, it can be passed. It does make a nice\
      \ change playing as the other side though. So if that makes your curious, its\
      \ as good a reason as any to get and play. Definitely one of the dlcs to consider\
      \ getting. In a complete bundle for a good discount would be my suggestion."
