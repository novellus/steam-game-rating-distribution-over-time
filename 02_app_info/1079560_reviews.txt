There is some back tracking that takes place to earn upgrades. Easy to get sucked in by the visuals and lose your place on the screen. Feels very satisfying to utterly blow up a boss and struggle against them for hours at a time until you master your ship.  \n\nAwesome game!","timestamp_created":1599643379,"timestamp_updated":1599643379,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ405yLufQCdtDdoAI="}
