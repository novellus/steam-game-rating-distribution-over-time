From this arises constantly deluded hope and so also dissatisfaction. Deceptive images of a vague happiness hover before us in our dreams, and we search in vain for their original. Much would have been gained if, through timely advice and instruction, young people could have had eradicated from their minds the erroneous notion that the world has a great deal to offer them.”[/quote]","timestamp_created":1609266675,"timestamp_updated":1609266691,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542483627796173096","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u5/x1/YCcYjDvgI="}
