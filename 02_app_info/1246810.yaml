    review: I waited for this DLC for like 8 months and it was totally worth it. You
      literally can't beat the price. I got like 8 hours of entertainment for a single
      dollar. This game and the base game is like $3 combined and you can get endless
      hours out of it. The puzzles are very challenging and the new mechanics are
      really fun. Definitely worth it the price if you enjoyed the original game.
