The newer tables just get better and better, the licenses are used brilliantly, and the game is just truly fun. No, it's not the most authentic pinball in the world, but authentic pinball was meant to be played on a machine, not on a computer. This takes the best elements of Pinball and pushes them in ways a physical table could never do, creating a truly unique experience.\n\nEdit: How did you find this? Well, since you did, you should know that while Pinball FX3 is an improvement in almost every way, there's a few tables that didn't make it over unfortunately. So it may be worth going back to from time to time for those tables. But otherwise, the feature set in FX3 basically makes this obsolete.","timestamp_created":1374962663,"timestamp_updated":1561794283,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ437CM0esCcKqrDA=="}
