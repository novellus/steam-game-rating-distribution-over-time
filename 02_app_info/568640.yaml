    review: "UPDATE: Game is now Free to Play. So it's a must download. Very useful\
      \ app. Thank you devs for your hard work!\n\nOriginal review below --------\n\
      \nI do recommend this app at the current sale price of $3.75.  However, I would\
      \ not recommend it at the suggested sale price of $14.99.  I know what this\
      \ app wants to be, it wants to be a useful commercial / freelancer / self-professional\
      \ marketing / advertising / UI / prototyping VR standard.  However, the app\
      \ is still too barren to recommend at full retail price.  It's just missing\
      \ too many features and it has to compete with the likes of Tilt Brush if it\
      \ wants to ask for $14.99.  \n\nHowever, there's a good core app here.  I enjoyed\
      \ playing around with it.  However, it needs more tools and more tutorials to\
      \ be useful in the way it wants to be the standard in prototyping in VR.  And\
      \ I hate to say it, but it really does need a way to listen to my music when\
      \ I'm working with this app.  Yes, even professionals will want this feature\
      \ when using a HMD.  I think the devs really need to keep in mind that many\
      \ people will buy this app, but will have no intent of ever prototyping anything\
      \ (in VR or IRL), it's just something to experiment in and have fun.  They need\
      \ to focus on not just professionals, but casuals like me.\n\nRate 6/10 needs\
      \ more seasoning, but buy on sale to support it's growth if you're into this\
      \ kind of thing"
