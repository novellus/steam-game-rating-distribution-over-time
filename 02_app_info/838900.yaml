      /><br><br>Welcome to Cereal Soup! This project started all on it's own at the
      end of 2013, and was released the next year to the public in early Alpha. The
      game was made to fill a hole in the animal gaming community, and thanks to the
      amazingly talented people of this community CS has continued to grow and improve.
      Primordial is a world where creatures reign, Gods control all, and banding together
      to form powerful tribes is only one way to survive.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/838900/extras/6.png?t=1581300986"

      -Dragonfilms<br><i><br>&quot;Simply put, this game is amazing for being so early

      be one of the best parts of the game), functional website, and good graphics
      for its stage. Perhaps, though, there is room for effects of this game's lore.
      Players don't particularly see many effects of the lore-based characters in-game,
      but perhaps this is just coming. If that is the case, then I can't wait to see
      what the developers will do with it!&quot;</i> -Lisa570<br><br><i>&quot;Cereal
