Here are my major gripes:\n\n- No move history. If you're playing a correspondence game you're better off logging the game yourself (e.g. \"1. e4 e5, 2. Nc3 Nf6...\" etc) as this game does not provide a move history. This is a baffling design decision since logging each move as it is played does not seem like an ordeal to code-in if you manage to build an otherwise functional chess variant app.\n\n- No audio controls. The game plays an embarrassingly brief sampling of classical music from the moment the app launches. There are no volume controls, nor is there a mute toggle. The only way to avoid hearing this is by disabling your sound, which is unfortunate as sometimes I'll have a correspondence game open and I would like to listen for the wooden clacks to let me know a move has been played without being required to listen to the music as well.\n\n- UI is confusing and buggy. The app sorts your active chess games by games where it's your turn, and games where it's your opponent's. Your past games are also logged separately. From time to time (typically around once per session) the game will forget some past games and put them in my \"Your Turn\" queue on the last move, prompting me to view the board position and confirm the win or loss in order to remove the game from the queue. Typically the app will forget around 10 games for me to re-confirm at a time.\n\n- The Resign button is right next to the Menu button in the corner of the screen and there's no confirmation prompt to see if you actually wanted to resign. I inadvertently forfeited a ranked match extremely early (like move 3?) this way and felt stupid because of it.
