The game starts well, with an interesting world and characters. But roughly in the last third of the game, everything felt disconnected, stats changed randomly and the descriptions of progress and relationships did not reflect what was actually happening in the story. Supposedly important achievements on the way to ascension, such as special items and revealed mysteries etc. neve have any relevance and canÂ´t be used at the critical moments you'd think they should. In essence, the last third felt random and railroaded at the same time, to a point that made me give the game a thumbs down in frustration.","timestamp_created":1586223558,"timestamp_updated":1586223558,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508620679378509521","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw19WSqfECeJTk/gE="}
