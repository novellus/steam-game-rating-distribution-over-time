Nothing. Pure blackness everywhere. Ok, let's hire a dwarf into our party... he can see now, but the other party members will still have trouble.\nOk, hire a cleric or wizard or sorcerer with LIGHT spell. Great...but the spell will wear off in few turns and back to darkness.\nCleave also works only when enemies are lined up next to each other.\nSkills, Feats and abilities must be combined with extreme effort and focus on detail. \nCompared to common PC games, this is table-top simulator, hence I had to cope with the differences first: even when outside of combat, one has to move each character individually. Luckily, the dungeons (pre-made or generated) are not huge, so what you actually get is the option of setting up your party before anticipated assault carefully, maximizing efficiency and minimizing loses. \nI was also surprise that huge enemies can use SQUEZE skill and push themselves through narrow corridors. (While I was hoping I can keep the huge dire ape away from my party and handle the minions first, I was shocked seeing the huge enemy squeezing through 5-foot corridor, just next to my sorcerer...) \nI also had to figure out what means \"move to the back\" and \"move in the front\", as soon more enemies started to overlap themselves. Huge dying dire boar did 'overlap' 2 of my still kicking enemies and I was wondering how to attack those cowards hiding under the beast's soon-to-be corpse...and then I realized what the 'move to the back' button does :) \nDespite the game being in \"early access\", one can have a lot of fun. \nAs soon it will have properly all aspects implemented, this could be nice option to many other RPG games, possibly offering multiplayer, where one is the Dungeon Master and others play as adventurers?\nBTW, if you encounter problems, like I did, visit the discord, that devs created. They respond pretty fast.","timestamp_created":1602066336,"timestamp_updated":1602066386,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581749081611633301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwxaGmgfUCeqmxpgI="}
