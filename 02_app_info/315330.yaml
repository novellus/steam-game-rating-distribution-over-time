    about_the_game: The vast horizons are full of pirates, vagabonds with no claim
      to the ground their feet tread. Amongst the bandits scattered across the oceans,
      four factions dominate the worlds main landmasses. Eutopia's conquest will be
      the force that rids the world of its calamity. Making way for a new era of prosperity,
      with all continents under one banner.<br><br>In a world where sea battles are
      the punch line of jokes uttered by historians, the generals of Eutopia focus
      their efforts on reviving the lost art of ship building to aid in the campaign
      against aerially superior foes. Hiring small bands of mercenaries to take to
      the seas and launch a global attack on all fronts from beneath the skies. Though,
      as men once again set sail, the ocean reminds why the depths were abandoned
      all those years ago.<br><br>All Guns On Deck is a strategy, real time tactics
      action rpg, naval combat game with a unique battle system and unforgiving world
      to conquer. Players find themselves in the boots of a naive young sea captain,
      eager to take to the waves in support of the war effort of his great nation.<h2

    review: 'This game is really neat.  Cool art style, interesting mechanics, and
      fun gameplay.


      Unfortunately, it is abandoned and lacking in content.  Play for 10 minutes
      and you''ve seen all there is to see.


      It is unfortunate because it has the potential to be a great game.'
