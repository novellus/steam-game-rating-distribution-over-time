A different take on controls makes the game feel different from other MMOs.\n\nGraphics: are not next gen type graphics but gets the point across and thats all that matters to me. Other than that the graphics are really good IMO.\n\nContent: A mind blowing amount of content that will keep both hardcore gamers and casual gamers busy for a good bit of time respectfully.\n\nFuture of the game: As long as it keeps a good number of gamers active, this game will have a future I would be more than happy to return to. Just looking for others that are playing to play with, basiclly looking for in game friends.\n\nCost: Can buy to play. Massive edition has all the dlc that came before it. Standard Edition is just the base game unless stated otherwise. Expansions / dlc are sold seperately from base game if you want to by them one at a time.\n\nStandard Version\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/215280/\nMassive Edition version store page has been removed!\n\nEach Version has a different page so the reviews are not shared between them.\nNote: Due to Real Life Issues and no friends to play this game with on a regular basis I have passed on playing it until I can get a good number of friends together. Regardless I still highly recommend this game!","timestamp_created":1383130132,"timestamp_updated":1449273809,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":437,"votes_funny":13,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575582385063171387","comment_count":64,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4huvct9ECc6fXHA=="}
