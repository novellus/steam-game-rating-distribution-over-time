      their skulls.</strong><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li> Tight but fair precision platforming.<br></li><li>
      Rewards exploration, with hidden secrets around every corner.<br></li><li> Tight
      and responsive combat.<br></li><li> Explore a vast interconnected world, and
      uncover the many mysteries of the alien planet.</li></ul><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1489110/extras/GAMEPLAY-export.gif?t=1607182399"
      /><br>Fast and responsive controls focused on minimising the gap between your
      brain and your controller. Everything responds instantly with absolutely zero
      horizontal inertia, and I NEVER take control away from the player. You should
      feel fully in control from the moment you launch the game to the moment you
      see the end credits. (You can even control the dancing!)<br><br>All bosses have
      predictable movesets that evolve throughout the battle, making them hard but
      fair. This creates a real sense of achievement once you slay them. Once you
      kill a boss Zapling collects the skull and can equip it to unlock new powers
      as well as the ability to tweak your current abilities by pimping it out with
      unique charms.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1489110/extras/steam_inline_2.gif?t=1607182399"

      /><br>Explore a vast interconnected world littered with secrets in every room.
      Find game-changing charms, unique collectable statues, lore, and of course-
      new dance moves.<br>The planet is as unknown to Zapling as it is to you. Explore
      the somewhat-habitable planet and fight through its various threats. Uncover
      the dark history that left the land to be a shadow of what it once was.<br><br><img

      /><br>Zapling may be one of last of his kind, an alien asylum seeker fleeing
      from his home planet that has been ravaged by war. His task is to find a new
      home for his species to grow again, and perhaps thrive. Could this planet be
      the one?<br><br><br><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://discord.gg/CqaCfzHfbt"
