Yes. Some of the mechanics are a little awkward and there's not much of an upgrade system for your kitchen or food, and what there is a little unclear. However, in a world where more polished classics like Cake Mania and Sally's Spa are either dead along with Flash or locked up behind an exorbitant subscription service, and time management games on Mobile are not just overwhelmingly, but COMPLETELY designed to be as torturous as possible unless you keep pumping in absurd \"whale\" levels of cash: am I happy to spend $14.50AUD on a game like Julie's Sweets? Also yes. And I'd do it again, too. All I want is some good, clean time management without insidious manipulation from some greedy corporate asshole. This delivers. Thank you.","timestamp_created":1602150400,"timestamp_updated":1602150400,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgODmg/UCe9/JpgI="}
