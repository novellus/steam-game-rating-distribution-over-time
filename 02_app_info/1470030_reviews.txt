It just kind of devolved into more frustration. \n\nSo to start off, the premise of the game is simple and the design is simple too, Buffy is fantastically sinister. I love the look of the game. I think there is a sensitivity modification missing with the options as I had a bit of difficulty with my sensitivity of looking around. \n\nI will also add that the sound elements of the game are pretty great, though it can be a little jarring when some sounds loop over. The cues to know where he is was super well done and you could easily work out the proximity and, for the most part, could tell whether he was above or below you. \n\nWhere I find faults with the game is the AI of Buffy, I assume after a certain amount of time, he has to leave where you are if he can't get you but this time seems to take a ridiculous length of time, at some points. I've stood for minutes waiting for him to leave. When he wouldn't I had to try and do something to push the game onward to move on leading to death, most of the time. The high places you can get on to be safe from Buffy seem to have issues sometimes with Buffy spawning into the master bedroom bed at times, either getting stuck or immediately killing you. There were a few pathfinding issues too, with the AI, from what I've noticed.\n\nFor the price, it wasn't an awful game. But would I recommend it? No, not unless it was in early ages. I did play this in a stream as I wanted to play a new horror game (Link is here for anyone interested: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/842211046).\n\nI'll look forward to seeing possible updates to improve the game!","timestamp_created":1608350024,"timestamp_updated":1608350167,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/f3IvPYCd+aruwI="}
