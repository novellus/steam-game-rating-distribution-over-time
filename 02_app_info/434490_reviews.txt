Essentially, in Otem's defiance you have to keep yourself from being killed by Ringods, retaliate with bolts you can gather in each stage and defeat the end of ring boss. Rinse and repeat. \n\nDon't get me wrong, its not bad as such, simply too repetitive. And you need really good skills to get the top score for each level, miss a shot and you can kiss it goodbye. The music suffers from the same repetitiveness, even if its nice to hear at first, the endless repetition throws concentration out of the window.\n\nGraphically, well... Its stable 3D, the ring and level designs are okay and animations are somewhat smooth. But it doesn't really shine if you get my drift. Now, if you like dodge and retaliation games, get it. Otherwise, wait for a sale.","timestamp_created":1478459031,"timestamp_updated":1478459031,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548419475555419922","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43c/BndgCfY35ZA=="}
