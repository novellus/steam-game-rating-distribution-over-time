    review: 'Minimum Viable Product: The Game


      It''s pretty clear this is all recycled content, packaged together as a Ducati
      commercial that you pay for.

      Bikes only have one paint colour/livery in most cases and all riders will be
      wearing the same gear, making single bike races look a bit silly as identical
      clones all race each other.

      The usual Milestone low effort jank is present. Expect the odd crash and regular
      framerate hitches. The AI are only just passable, that will only give you a
      slight challenge once you''ve learned the tracks and gotten the hang of the
      basic bike handling. I can only assume Milestone have posters all over their
      office with "MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT" in large black lettering all over their
      walls because that''s what all their games feel like.


      All that said, there is a nice selection of tracks and bikes that are fun to
      control with a gamepad and a basic career mode that you can play through to
      unlock all the various Ducati bikes in the game in a short amount of time.


      Grab it on sale for a couple of bucks and you won''t feel too ripped off.'
