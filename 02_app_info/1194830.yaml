    review: 'Game is coming along quite nicely. Looks great, has interesting crafting
      mechanics.

      It''s intentionally a fairly grindy game but I''ve found it satisfying so far.


      Looking forward to more crafting mechanics (and mining!), more combat, less
      "Time Chamber" grinding.'
