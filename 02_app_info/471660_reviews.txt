This review is going to be me relaying what he said. It was surprisingly well done and the spray mechanics felt real accurate. He kind of laughed at the undo mechanic because he is a true spray painter and you don't have that in real life. The controls were a bit wonky, but the button to show the controls when you couldn't remember them was a nice feature. The graphics are outstanding and the environments are very detailed. All the ambient noises really added to the experience.","timestamp_created":1609786328,"timestamp_updated":1609786328,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvMCv5/YCfdi8wAI="}
