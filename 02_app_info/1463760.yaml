    review: "So after I realized I can not play Dark Souls or Monster Hunter World\
      \ anymore with 2 little children and a full time job I figured it would be time\
      \ to try out something new. Something more casual, I guess? \n\nI am currently\
      \ playing some farming games and they are really relaxing - Exactly what I need\
      \ in my spare time. Next to that I tried the beardless wizard. I knew the game\
      \ concept from the Ipad of my kids, so I know that it is actually not such a\
      \ hard game. \n\nStill I am having a good time with the game. I enjoy helping\
      \ the people and gather stuff and try to figure out in what order I need to\
      \ collect the ressources to finish the level. I also like the variety in levels,\
      \ it's not like \"oh here is a new level, just build everything again like in\
      \ the last level\" every level has a unique twist to it - And even if you beat\
      \ the level there is an alternative version. \n\nThe mechanics are really good\
      \ imo, it kinda makes sense to me, you need to think \"should I upgrade the\
      \ buildings or rather repair that bridge?\"\n\nOkay I mean I have only played\
      \ for 1 hour yet but it was a lot of fun and I am looking forward to finish\
      \ the game. I can imagine that some people can spend a long time with the game\
      \ trying to optimise every level and get gold everywhere. MAYBE IT WILL BE ME?\
      \ I mean I am not a completionist but I could imagine myself trying to get gold\
      \ in the levels. And with my 36 years old I am slowly but steadily becoming\
      \ a grandpa in terms of gaming. \n\nOkay whatever, the only gripe I have is\
      \ that it has the same sound track in every level and even if its okay it gets\
      \ annoying really fast. So what I recommend is turning the music off and listening\
      \ to \"Trobar de Morte - The Silver Wheel (Full Album)\" instead (search on\
      \ youtube). That music fits perfectly lol.\n\nGreat game in general, I am very\
      \ happy with my purchase."
