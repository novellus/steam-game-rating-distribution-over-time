The main con for me is that it does not allow you to play in higher difficulty levels until you've cleared quite a lot of stages. Feels to me that it artificially increases the play time with that. In my first 10 missions I only had to repeat one so it seems a bit grindy to have to clear so many levels before being able to turn up the difficulty.\n\nOverall it was a positive experience.","timestamp_created":1596663670,"timestamp_updated":1596663670,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz8Sk4PMCf+jTmQI="}
