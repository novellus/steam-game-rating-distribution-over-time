But I am having issues with frame rates. No matter what resolution I choose, my frame rates are around about 2 or 3 frames a second. I have a reasonable spec laptop, intel i7 and 8GB RAM. If the frame rate issue could be improved to something playable, say even 20fps or such, it would be slick. Thanks Dev.","timestamp_created":1562520405,"timestamp_updated":1562520405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1562809957,"developer_response":"Hi Stormcloud D, I have made an update to further optimize the game performance, I also added an option in the settings interface to turn off fog effects.\n\nPlease try again, if this doesn't help, please let me know, I am always here.\n\nBest wishes,\n-仿生梦"}],"cursor":"AoJ4wKje5usCeNTizQE="}
