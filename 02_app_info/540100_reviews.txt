TOO. EASY.\nThis could be a fun way to kill an afternoon with some friends and some beer (not sure if it has 4 player local coop), but the issue is there's practically no challenge. Kill a few baddies, power up a gem, to the next level. The enemies can damage the gem. Trouble is they come so slowly and most make no attempt to even head to the crystal on purpose that after 20 minutes there's really no reason to keep playing. I played on to the third or so stage, and the art and music held up just great but it didnt increase in difficulty really at all.\nSo, it's a shame because it was a lot of wasted potential by virtue of simply not presenting a challenge.","timestamp_created":1601347875,"timestamp_updated":1601347875,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i67x6/QCeKngpAI="}
