It is ROUGH like crazy around the edges (note to dev...the high scores overlayed in the menu screen could use some polish...) but I DO recommend this game. To me this is a game developed for someone that HAS experience in VR and for those who don't. Wireless controllers not needed, but you need lots of room to move around. It will kick your butt quickly so it also feels like a game to load up when your friends are over...and in case you need more details - check out our FULL review here https://youtu.be/9kOQZaEUDvY\n\nAlso...not getting hit in the face is a good lesson to use in life as well as VR. Just putting that out there.","timestamp_created":1549743556,"timestamp_updated":1549743556,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2sD66egCcrS8ugE="}
