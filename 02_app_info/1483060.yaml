    about_the_game: <strong> Cube Paradox </strong> is a game where you have to record
      the same level several times, however, every time you record the level, it will
      become more complex and difficult. Will you be able to get through the fastest
      way and thus save precious seconds? Or will you take your time and use every
      second available? Anyway, the obstacles will be there to hinder you in the best
      possible way.<br><br>Jump through walls, dodge obstacles, dribble missiles and
      use mobile platforms to your advantage, the more you progress, the more obstacles
      you will encounter to prevent you from reaching the end of the level, will you
      succeed? It's just a level, you can do it, i believe in you.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul">

      level&quot; of the game as quickly as possible so that you can get a recording
      of it, or will the increasing obstacles prevent you from recording it?
