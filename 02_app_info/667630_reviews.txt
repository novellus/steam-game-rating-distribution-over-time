The collisions also feel cheap and unfair because you'll feel like you crash \"before you crash\".\n\nDev.. maybe try make the camera turn slower and not snapping as fast as the snake turns or zooming out some to make the camera not so disorienting and obnoxious as the player plays this game.  I feel like this \"could\" be a good, fun game with more work.  Right now it just feels cheap and unpolished.\n\nVERDICT:  30% - Definitely NOT worth $5 USD as is.  Maybe try it if you get it on sale for 49 or 99 cents.","timestamp_created":1580045452,"timestamp_updated":1580045452,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.469696968793869019","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwroiD8e8Cf+ac7gE="}
