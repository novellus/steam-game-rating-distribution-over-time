    reviews: "\u201CFor all its charm, Thomas is more than just the super-minimalist-yet-incredibly-engaging\
      \ tales of a few plucky AIs. It's the story of games. Of how they get made and\
      \ played, of the joys and frustrations they bring and of the thousands of tiny\
      \ iterative processes that go into evolving single titles and the entire medium\
      \ into their best forms.\u201D<br>\u2013 <a href=\"http://kotaku.com/5929049/thomas-was-alone-the-kotaku-review\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Evan Narcisse, Kotaku</a><br><br>\u201C\
      It proves that you don't need tens of millions of dollars and hundreds of staff\
      \ to make a game story worth telling, just a good hook, an engaging vision,\
      \ and a whole lot of heart.\u201D<br>9/10 \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.destructoid.com/review-thomas-was-alone-230948.phtml\"\

      The understated aesthetic design and unusual co-op puzzles will absorb you for\
      \ the game\u2019s duration \u2013 the wit and personality of the writing, though,\
      \ will stay with you for much longer.\u201D<br>8/10 \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/07/24/thomas-was-alone-review\"\
