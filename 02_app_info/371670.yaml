    review: 'What is Rolling Sun ?


      I would initially give this game a recommendation because its pretty much an
      inoffensive game but it just presents itself as a very thrown-together student
      project or tech demo, its very unpolished and it just feels unfinished or not
      properly developed, its a fairly simple sidescrolling platformer, done nicely
      in the cry engine which is why it looks so good, but the whole thing is just
      so short, so easy, what you do is simple: you start at an level and procceed
      to the end avoiding obstacles, nothing beyond that, no enemies to bump into,
      nothing that goes beyond simplicity, you control a ball and the controls are
      fine, but theres just 6 levels, those are short and sometimes even after finishing
      them and wanting to replay them they wouldnt even show up on the level select
      on the menu unless I restarted the game, the bonus levels were also unlocked
      for me to do at the beginning even with the game telling me I had to collect
      all the collectables to do them and every time I booted the game up it would
      always start at a 1280x920 resolution, forcing me to always config it to my
      desktop one, there was also graphical glitches and issues with checkpoints too,
      overall its a pretty simple platformer game that plays nicely and its very cheap
      to get during a sale, a short, low-stake experience which is something I enjoy
      sometimes but if it was a little more polished, developed with a little more
      care then I would have given it a recomendation but considering the way it is,
      so poorly done, so undercooked, I cant recommend this one at all.'
