It was probably TSR's twelfth adventure, and the first one to use a full-color cover, rather than the monochrome covers that had been used for the previous 11 adventures.<br> <br> <br><strong> Basic Sets.<\/strong> Like its predecessor, &quot;B1: In Search of the Unknown,&quot; this adventure was created for use with the first edition of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set (1977), created by J. Eric Holmes. Once it was printed, &quot;Keep on the Borderlands&quot; immediately replaced &quot;In Search of the Unknown&quot; in the Basic boxed set.<br> <br> However, &quot;Keep&quot; is much better known as the adventure packaged with the second edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set (1981), which was revised and updated by Tom Moldvay. It remained a part of that package throughout its life (1981-1983).<br> <br> From 1980-1983, Dungeons &amp; Dragons was seeing its most explosive growth, and the Basic Set was the prime entry point to that game. As a result, B2 ended up the most printed D&amp;D module of all time. Much later estimates suggest there might have been 1.5 million copies printed in all, between the two boxed sets and standalone sales.<br> <br> <br><strong> Introductory Ideas.<\/strong> Like B1, &quot;Keep on the Borderlands&quot; was positioned as an &quot;introductory&quot; module; it provided instructions not just on how to run the campaign contained within, but also on how to run combats and to be an effective GM. However, it varied notably from its predecessor B1 in one area: Where the previous adventure had been a bit of a toolkit - with GMs learning to create dungeons by actually filling in the monsters and treasures - this one was a complete, ready-to-run adventure.<br> <br> The Caves of Chaos themselves showed off the introductory nature of B2 in another way: They're pretty much a who's who of the humanoids you could meet in Basic D&amp;D, with separate caverns inhabited by kobolds, orcs, goblins, ogres, hobgoblins, bugbears, gnolls, and even a minotaur. Gygax later admitted that the result wasn't &quot;ecologically correct,&quot; but that wasn't really the point.<br> <br> <br><strong> Adventuring Tropes.<\/strong> &quot;Keep&quot; is also of historic note because it detailed not just dungeons to explore, like most adventures of the period, but also a home base for the players to use: the eponymous Keep, which spans about 6 pages in the adventure. PCs can interact with the various inhabitants there and thus have plenty of roleplaying opportunity before they ever strike out into the Caves of Chaos.<br> <br> This would have been a huge innovation for TSR if Gygax hadn't done the same thing just a a few months earlier in &quot;T1: The Village of Hommlet.&quot; As it was, these two modules set &quot;home base + nearby adventure point&quot; as a standard adventure design element (though towns would be more frequently used in the future).<br> <br> <br><strong> There's also a page of wilderness adventuring.<\/strong> Though pretty scant, it was an innovation for the Basic adventures.<br> <br> <br><strong> Future History.<\/strong> &quot;The Keep on the Borderlands&quot; has been revisited many times, most notably in Wizards of the Coast's Return to the Keep on the Borderlands (1999) for AD&amp;D. In more recent years, the setting made a thematic return as the Chaos Scar, which was spotlighted in D&amp;D Encounters Season 3: Keep on the Borderlands - Season of Serpents (2010-2011) and in Dungeon #171 (October 2009) through Dungeon #197 (December 2011), all for 4e.
