    review: "I'm not a fan of 'pixel art' indie RPGs (and not planning to become one).\
      \ But I've enjoyed this one. They say it's made with RPG maker software, but\
      \ it's reasonable to not waste your time on unnecessary coding when you have\
      \ a good story to tell.\nAnd this is Mahabharata, one of the best books to read,\
      \ which inspired many of your so-loved anime and games.\nThis game is best played\
      \ when you already know the story of Mahabharata, at least by tv series. Here\
      \ we have many episodes from it. Playing as Bhishma, Karna, and the Pandavas.\
      \ With Indian visual style and music. There's quite a lot of content and they\
      \ say it takes 48 hours to play it all. \nSure, there are some small inaccuracies,\
      \ but not more than in any Mahabharata movie when compared to the book."
