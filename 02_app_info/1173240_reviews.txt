However, there seem to be significant bugs. Espionage never seems to be available, all illegal activities seem to be bugged to always fail, and a lot of tool tips have removed most nuance from the game. It's almost as if this kid's game has been made even more for kids. I'm glad I could get back to this game, but I wish the adaptation was focused less away from making it a neutered experience.","timestamp_created":1585596956,"timestamp_updated":1585596956,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.659646391868591309","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1q+8lvECceO//AE="}
