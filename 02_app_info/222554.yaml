    review: "This is the first time I've written a review of a Train Sim route. This\
      \ add-on is so enchanting I thought I would share why I think it's such a good\
      \ route to drive. \n\nThe scenery - I am currently driving in winter mode on\
      \ a clear afternoon - is magical. I find myself looking around in wonder and\
      \ finding my train's speed has crept above what it should be.  The stations\
      \ are little miracles of detail, from benches to posters to warning signs, waiting\
      \ rooms and luggage trolleys, all add to an authentic 1960's feel.\n\nI am not\
      \ one for playing scenarios, much prefer to go my own way using Quick Drive\
      \ (QD). Unfortunately on some routes QD is a lonely place, no AI traffic at\
      \ all. This route, like Riviera Line in the Fifties is a joy. The yards are\
      \ full of trucks and milk tanks and chemical tanks awaiting their fate, the\
      \ line is busy with passenger trains and goods trains - a real pleasure to travel\
      \ along and adding that touch of realism that makes me so happy. A lot of work\
      \ has gone into making this route and I congratulate the people who created\
      \ it.\n\nI am at the moment making my way from Carlisle to Stranraer Harbour.\
      \ Up to Dumfries the line still exists in modern times. From Dumfries we take\
      \ the left hand branch and step back in time to a line that's been lost for\
      \ over 50 years. From Castle Douglas the line single running. There are many\
      \ up and downs requiring a lot of concentration on your speed limit. I have\
      \ reached Newton Stewart and stopped for a rest. Will continue to Stranraer\
      \ tomorrow.\n\nA nice long route, plenty to see, lots of traffic, and  relaxing\
      \ to drive. Highly recommended."
