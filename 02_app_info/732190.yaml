    review: 'The DLC expansion for Strangers of the Power. It adds one new character
      - Chandra, who the game describes as "very advanced" but is basically just a
      melee character who can actually do damage unlike the core game''s Seraphine
      - and a new dungeon level that you can access near the end of the game, right
      before going to the final level of the dungeon.


      If you''re going to be playing Strangers of the Power, I recommend this, even
      though I still don''t really recommend picking up the base game.'
