    about_the_game: '<h2 class="bb_tag">Boxed In</h2>You find yourself enclosed in
      a ''Burtonesque'' room with no exits. Colourful cubes move towards you either
      from the far wall, the ceiling or from beneath your feet. In order to avoid
      being squashed by the cubes you must clear them by creating matches. Depending
      on your chosen options, you must either create a run of three or a block of
      four. When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of
      the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long
      will you survive?<h2 class="bb_tag">Game modes</h2>You can select to play in
      ''Survival'' mode where the cubes just keep coming, faster and faster, or ''Solitaire''
      mode where the room is filled with cubes and you can take your time to clear
      them. Difficulty is determined by how many different colours of cube you choose
      to deal with. Three is the easiest and five is the hardest. To make things even
      harder, you can choose matches to be made by a line of three cubes of the same
      colour, or a square of four. You must also choose the direction the cubes will
      approach you from: the back wall, the ceiling, or the floor. In total there
      are 36 variations of play.<h2 class="bb_tag">VR Controls</h2>Using the primary
      controller you have the ability to: change the colour of an existing cube; add
      a new cube; or push a cube (if it''s close to you). The secondary controller
      allows you to teleport around the room or on to the top of boxes.<h2 class="bb_tag">Non
      VR Controls</h2>Using the keyboard &amp; mouse or a controller, you can do all
      the same things except teleport. Sadly you must move in the old-fashioned &quot;walking&quot;
      type way. You do however have the ability to jump, so there''s that. :)<h2 class="bb_tag">Scoring</h2>Your
      aim is to get the highest score you possibly can before you are either crushed
      by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove
      cubes quickly then you can earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score
      rapidly. Your current multiplier is displayed next to your primary controller
      (in VR) and on the HUD (non VR).<h2 class="bb_tag">Leaderboards</h2>What''s
      the point of playing a game if you can''t be the best in the world? Each of
      the 36 game modes has a leaderboard associated with it. Get your name up there!<h2
      class="bb_tag">Designed and developed for VR</h2>From its very conception, ''Boxed
      In'' was designed, developed and optimised for VR. During development, an option
      was added to play the game using keyboard &amp; mouse or controller. This turned
      out to be a fun way to play the game and so we decided to release the game for
      both VR and non-VR play.'

    short_description: '''Boxed In'' was designed and developed for VR and can also
      be enjoyed in the &quot;traditional&quot; way using either keyboard &amp; mouse
      or a controller. You must clear the room of coloured cubes by creating matches.
      The cubes can come from in-front, above, or below. Just make sure you don''t
      get...Boxed In!'

    review: "Not the most visually detailed, but for an indie, simple and relaxing\
      \ (if you do Solitaire mode) game, this is good to play. Amongst the three setups,\
      \ I prefer the back-to-wall and looking-down arrangements. Looking up is exciting\
      \ in survival mode, but this arrangement is awfully painful on my neck. \n\n\
      Some glitchy things you may find when teleporting on top of a block: If you\
      \ don't stand close enough to the center of the block, you end up teleporting\
      \ to the side of it and then falling down. Not a big deal breaker, but it can\
      \ throw you off-balance. In the looking-down Solitaire mode. there have been\
      \ times where I can break certain blocks downward and venture down there like\
      \ cave exploring. This is cool, but at times you can teleport into 1x1 cube\
      \ spaces and the visuals start jittering. It's as if your character teleported\
      \ too close to an object and can't figure out where it should go. Luckily you\
      \ can teleport away and that'll get you out of that eyesore.\n\nOther than that,\
      \ not bad for what you're paying."
