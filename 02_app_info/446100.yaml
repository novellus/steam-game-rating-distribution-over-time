    review: 'I am so disappointed in that game! After having it in my wishlist for
      several years, unsure, I finally bought it, hoping it would be some kind of
      great tribute to one of my favorite games, Fun Tracks / Ignition. Not only it
      is not that, but it is also a terrible game... Sorry for the devs, but that
      game is just bad: ugly UI and menus, mediocre tracks design, very poor music
      and sound design, terrible gameplay... A huge disappointment. The graphics are
      actually okay, the levels are even pretty! but the game is overall awfully repetitive
      and boring, it feels cheap and amateurish. Sadly, a forgettable game.
