Different and...\"interesting\". \n\n   And no, I don't mean that in a condescending, last-thing-an-artist-ever-wants-to-hear kinda way. It's [i]genuinely[/i] interesting, it truly is. And different. Not to an \"off-the-planet\" extent, but certainly eccentric.\n\n   It quickly \"grew\" on me, put it that way. Eerie, unsettling, and occasionally beautiful. Good stuff. Reminds me a lot of the Liars album WIXIW. Minus the lyrics. With a bit of Vangelis and Tangerine Dream thrown in for good measure.\n\n   Nice. And interesting. And most [i]definitely[/i] different.\n\n   Verdict: 9/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/​\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210​\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1561899887,"timestamp_updated":1561899887,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.579283356666564941","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mZ2f1OsCesL+xwE="}
