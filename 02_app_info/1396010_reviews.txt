Apparently this game is seriously flawed -- it is meant to be a game about logic and should NOT have to involve guessing. I'd NOT recommend this game.","timestamp_created":1606711491,"timestamp_updated":1606711491,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m/fdi/YCcbHQtQI="}
