I'm not that far in, but so far the game is excellent fun, with challenging puzzles and a good sense of humor. The parser is strong, but it's really worth reading the manual for hints to get the best out of it.","timestamp_created":1603287016,"timestamp_updated":1603287016,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566929101943969727","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpMzWpfUCdb+eqQI="}
