    reviews: "\u201CIt\u2019s got the excellent dialogue, the beautiful art, the well-acted\
      \ voice overs, and the mind-bending puzzles players have come to expect and\
      \ enjoy. If you\u2019re a fan of the series, or of adventure games in general,\
      \ this is a title you should get.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://truepcgaming.com/2013/10/28/nancy-drew-the-silent-spy-review/\"\

      All in all, Nancy Drew: The Silent Spy is another great addition to the franchise.\
      \ With this game, I applaud Her Interactive for taking the series into a more\
      \ serious and mature direction. At a minimum, the game helps to develop Nancy\
      \ as a deep and compelling character. The fun puzzles add to the enjoyment of\
      \ the game \u2013 they are just difficult enough to be challenging without crossing\
      \ over into frustration. I highly recommend this game to all fans of the series.\
      \ I also recommend this game as an introduction for gamers who have yet to try\
      \ out the series.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/index.php/site/reviews/831/\"\

      \u201CIf you\u2019ve never gotten into this series of games in the past, this\
      \ is a great place to jump in. Nancy Drew: The Silent Spy is a super fun, challenging,\
      \ and attention grabbing title that will keep you attached to your screen for\
      \ hours. I have enjoyed each and every title previously published, but I was\
      \ extra pleased with this newest addition, due in large part to the intriguing\
      \ plot, as well as the variety of puzzles and locations to explore. I\u2019\
      ve always been a Nancy Drew fan, now it\u2019s time for you to become one too.\u201D\
