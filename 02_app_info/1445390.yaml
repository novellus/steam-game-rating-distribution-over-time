      \ string orchestra (FAMES Project) and a haunting women's choir. Guzheng (Kathy\
      \ Qianqian Jin) and liuqin (Leng Yijing) ripple through Ki's life in China and\
      \ katajjaq throat singing (Nina Segalowitz) evokes her life in Alaska. The OST\
      \ also includes brand new arrangements and bonus tracks that didn't make it\
      \ into the game. The album was mixed by the incomparable Steve Kempster and\
      \ mastered by Grammy-award winner Emily Lazar."

    review: "One of my favourite game OSTs, and easily the best new one I've heard\
      \ this year.\n\nThe quality of the production is fantastic throughout, and that\
      \ consistency makes it very easy to listen to the soundtrack album as a whole,\
      \ rather than having to pick and choose a handful of 'favourite' tracks. \n\
      This of course speaks to how well the music flows during the game itself, and\
      \ I definitely recommend playing the game before listening to the OST so that\
      \ you get all those 'feels' when listening to the album again."
