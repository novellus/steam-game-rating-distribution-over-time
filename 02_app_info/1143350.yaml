    review: 'This game is a pretty fun, fast-paced platformer! Not too difficult,
      though there were a handful of levels that kicked my butt for a teeny bit. The
      music is pretty banging! Got 100% achievements in just under 7 hours in one
      sitting. The extra game modes you unlock, "Faster Than Light" (race against
      the clock) and "Not Him Again" (Boss Chase), were pretty fun and challenging
      additions to the game! I didn''t really care much for the "Square Fights Back"
      (arena) mode but others may enjoy it!


      I can''t believe I missed that first C-C-C-C-Cube though! I went through each
      level like 3 or 4 times before I found it. >_< And there''s literally NO Achievements
      Guides anywhere on the Internet nor Steam. But I did find 48/50 of them on the
      first play-through so they were pretty easy to find! :)


      Funny story: I guess because of my setup, when I was first streaming this game
      in full screen mode my square was moving in like a "Low Gravity" pace while
      the rest of the game was going normal speed so originally I was incredibly frustrated
      with the game because I got to level 52 [spoiler](out of 67)[/spoiler] and this
      level seemed impossible! I went to the Steam Store page and watched the trailer
      to see how fast the square was supposed to move and was so confused. So I went
      back into the game and just for kicks and giggles put it in windowed mode and
      sure enough my square started RACING! I was also experiencing some odd enemy
      glitches in the game but that also corrected itself in windowed mode. And then
      furthermore when I ended the stream the game ran SEAMLESS, which is crazy because
      I was literally a second away from writing a SCATHING review, but turns out
      it was my fault LOL! Nothing wrong with the game!


      Overall worth a playthrough! Can''t wait to try the Prologue and Vol. 2! I got
      the 3 game bundle on sale for $5.83 and so far definitely seems worth it!'
