    review: 'First off - I recommend the base game. My thumbs down recommendation
      is specifically for this DLC.


      You get the playing cards, but not the heroes or other card art.


      You also can''t do some other things, such as in use the Card Creator with your
      own uploaded images.


      So, how do you get the heroes and other card art (backs, mats, cosmetics), you
      can either grind gold, which only seems to be achievable by the single player
      campaign, as I''ve been unable to find a match in multiplayer for a game, or
      you drop more cash to buy what they call marbles.


      Honestly, if the game didn''t seem so... empty from a player perspective, and
      if the Card Creator wasn''t locked behind another pay wall, then I''d not regret
      this purchase. As it is, I regret it, and I''m giving my warning to others to
      heavily consider passing on this, UNLESS you don''t care about what''s not included.'
