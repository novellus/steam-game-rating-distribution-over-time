Its a hard tower defense and it has quite a low amount of turrets, so it would be fair to see it as a bit more of a puzzler than you average tower defense. The idea to have springboards that can flip enemies back in lane or to different lanes is nice, and so is the general athmosphere.\n\nWhat makes me not recommend this game is the Tower AI: Towers will, quite a lot of times actually, simply ignore the settings given and, worse, try to aim at enemies that already left their range, while ignoring others that are in range. This makes you lose a lot of lifes you would not otherwise have lost. This makes it rage inducing. Until that is fixed I will refund the game. There are simply to many working alternatives out there for free.","timestamp_created":1576616352,"timestamp_updated":1576616352,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkIvqiu8CcImD5QE="}
