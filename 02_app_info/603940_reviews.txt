Difficulty levels to suit your wants including a chill mode if you want to play more casually. I myself had great fun playing this game. The dev is very responsive and even made some changes when i mentioned that chill mode was not very chill. Continuous goals to strive for during the game. \n\nThe price is very good for the time you can get out of this game on full price even. \n\nCertainly worth picking up.","timestamp_created":1603471213,"timestamp_updated":1603471213,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nKCVq/UCf6nSqQI="}
