This is an older HOPA: like the first game, there is no widescreen option and no map.  Despite the less than stellar graphics, this is a very solid HOPA game, with plenty of HO scenes and puzzles.  The art is very nice if you can look past the lower resolution.\n\nPros:\n- nice fantasy setting and art\n- competent protagonist\n- occasional re-use of items\n- right number of HO scenes; interactive HO scenes are interesting (there are regular word lists as well)\n- variety in puzzles, some are challenging\n- areas are rarely closed off, but backtracking is reasonable\n- voice acting is infrequent, but competent\n- bonus chapter\n- nice, relaxing traditional HOPA game without bugs [running Windows 10]\n\nCons:\n- no map at all, and there is some back-tracking required\n- the music seems fine at first, but becomes noticeably repetitive especially during HO scenes\n- no achievements (for Steam or within the game)\n[Note: lack of achievements also means less stress if you decide to use a Hint or Skip!]\n\n[b]Overall:[/b]  Despite the dated feel and lack of map or achievements, I enjoyed the game and I'm looking forward to the next one in the series. Recommended, but get it on sale. There is a bundle for the series.","timestamp_created":1605988403,"timestamp_updated":1605988532,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.608163237571716309","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8oeY9vUCdqTerwI="}
