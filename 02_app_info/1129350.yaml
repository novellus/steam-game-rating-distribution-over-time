    about_the_game: '<h2 class="bb_tag">Catch and Train Murgles</h2><br><strong>Murgles
      is a short RPG about catching, training and battling Murgles.</strong> After
      starting with your first Murgle, you can go out and catch more rare and powerful
      ones in the world.  <br><br>Explore a rich medieval fantasy world, as you fight
      your way to becoming a powerful Murgle Summoner.<h2 class="bb_tag">Customize
      Your Squad</h2><br><strong>Murgles come from 5 different elements: <br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Fire<br></li><li>Hydro<br></li><li>Nature<br></li><li>Light
      <br></li><li>Darkness</li></ul></strong><br>Each element has it''s own strategic
      playstyle. Across each of the elements, you will also find Murgles that fill
      various combat roles.<br><br><strong>Each role brings unique tools to the fight:
      <br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Tanks <br></li><li>Healers<br></li><li>Damage</li></ul></strong><h2
      class="bb_tag">Progress Through Difficult Content</h2><br>Murgles is not an
      easy game. You will have to get creative with your strategy to win 1v1, 2v2,
      3v3 and 4v4 fights. As you explore the world, you will find dungeons full of
      loot and rare Murgles. These timed dungeons can be repeated in increasing difficulty,
      allowing you to push for the best rewards possible.<h2 class="bb_tag">Development
      Disclaimer:</h2><br>Please note: Murgles is only about 3-4 hours of game play,
      and the game''s full 20-30 hours vision was never completed. While fans of monster
      catching RPG''s will hopefully get an evening or two of enjoyment from this
      title, please keep the scope of this game in mind when making your purchase
      decision. As of March 2020, the solo developer of Murgles has since expanded
      Jumping Pound Games and started on a MOBA project with several new teammates.'

    review: 'I really enjoyed Murgles.  It was very short, but neat.  There were aspects
      of pokemon, but it had dps/heal/tank classes and the potential for much more
      in-depth mechanics.  With a lot more work and some polish, it could turn out
      to be pretty solid one day.  I sincerely hope the dev continues work on this,
      but either way I don''t regret supporting indie devs who put love into making
      their games.


      As a sidenote, I would put a disclaimer that the game is unfinished (regardless
      of intent to finish or not).


      As for finishing it up, depending on the level of trust for others and effort
      willing to be put in, I would recommend a kickstarter-ish program to fund additional
      development so that more people could get involved in helping to make the game.  Having
      another programmer or two can make a huge difference if you get someone competent
      and have a reasonable direction for your project.'
