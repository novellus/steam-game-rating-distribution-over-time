      /><br>An adventure game with strategy and management elements in a medieval
      fantasy setting - drawing inspiration from classics such as Warcraft 3 and The
      Settlers. Embark on quests, hunt down treasures and manage your resources as
      you build, battle, cast magic and brew potions to bring order to a world on
      the brink of disaster.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1322800/extras/divider.png?t=1589970720"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">EXPLORE</h2>Strange creatures living in different locations
      await you. Some of them will help you, others need your help, and others will
      take a liking to your head...or, rather, your fresh brains. You will visit quiet
      villages, snow-capped mountaintops, impenetrable forests, and foul-smelling
      swamps. But one thing will remain the same - adventure awaits you everywhere!<h2
      class="bb_tag">GATHER RESOURCES</h2>Collect everything that isn''t bolted to
      the floor! Dwarves don''t mind work, but they won''t lift a finger ion an empty
      stomach. You can''t build a working mill out of mud and sticks, so you''ll have
      to search for the appropriate materials. Keep food stocked and resources plentiful
      and your world will expand!<h2 class="bb_tag">BUILD</h2>Build bridges over turbulent
      rivers, build docks in the swamps, repair buildings, and build new ones! Mills
      will provide food, sawmills will provide building materials, forges will improve
      equipment - and you can always sell the surplus at the market. Many building
      styles and colors await you in the game.<h2 class="bb_tag">GO QUESTING</h2>The
      citizens of the world have always had many problems to overcome and quests to
      embark on. Try to help everyone you can, and reap the rewards of your labours.
      You can also always count on what''s most important: sincere words of gratitude*.<br><br><i>*
      Computer game characters don''t have real feelings or minds.</i><h2 class="bb_tag">FIGHT</h2>You
      can get much further with a kind word and a sword than you can with a kind word
      alone. Hire experienced soldiers, upgrade their armour and weapons, fight, and
      conquer. Whoever said the pen is mightier than the sword has never been on the
      receiving end of a Claymore!<h2 class="bb_tag">CAST SPELLS</h2>Not enough food
      or materials? Are your soldiers dying from their wounds? Did the workers decide
      to create a union? Magic items and potions will remedy the situation! Save up
      your gold, complete quests, and plunder chests. There are many ways to get magic
      items!'
