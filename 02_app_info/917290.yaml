    review: Great little precision platformer. If you enjoyed Pinkman then this will
      scratch the same itch. In fact most of the hazards will be very familiar if
      you played Pinkman. This could be Pinkman 2 if it wasn't for the new cute graphic
      style and the air dash replacing the double jump fart. I played this and Pinkman
      back to back. Both are very good games and well worth your time if you enjoy
      platformer games.
