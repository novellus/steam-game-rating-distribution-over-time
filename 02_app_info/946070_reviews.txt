It's definitely still in the early phases of coming together but it has the bones of something fun to enjoy with a group of friends.  The gunplay is pretty good and the map design has a nice bit of variation.  It needs some additional features like lobby customization and some different game modes.  But it's headed in the right direction.","timestamp_created":1561908122,"timestamp_updated":1561908122,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560776293277740479","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmdK+1OsCe5yRyAE="}
