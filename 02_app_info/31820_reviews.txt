A great story line with good selection of possible suspects. I would say that these have two of the hardest puzzles to complete in the series (the lathe and the caligrophy), so it might take some time to solve them. This is a good starter Nancy Drew game to get a feel for the puzzles and story lines.","timestamp_created":1609641842,"timestamp_updated":1609641842,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1aqI4/YCdub3vwI="}
