    review: "I honestly dont understand why this gets so much hate but I will review\
      \ it:\n\nHalf-Life: Before takes around 20-30 minutes to finish and has a bland\
      \ story, but how much story can you fit in 25 mins?!\nI didn't care much for\
      \ the story, the gameplay was good, not great, good, and the pistol and other\
      \ redone models look great in my opinion.\nThe game gets slightly harder at\
      \ the end and you gain new weapons around every new corner. I enjoyed the addition\
      \ of the cutscenes as well as the music. The boss was interesting but I felt\
      \ like it needed more.\n\nAlso, its free!\nIn short, I DO recommend that you\
      \ get this and have h\u03BBlf an hour of fun."
