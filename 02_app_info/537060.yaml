    review: 'A decent Early Access "Game". Obviously the term game is used loosely
      on Steam in these instances.


      Controls are easy to use. Has a nice tutorial to explain how to move objects
      around and style them. The interior looks nice enough and it allows a really
      good birds eye view with a press of a button. Navigating the birds eye view
      is done very well but it would be nice to be able to move objects around in
      that view also. Seems like a good start for an interesting project.'
