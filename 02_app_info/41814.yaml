    review: 'I usually love these kind of game modes, but this one is too severely
      flawed.


      You have to be online to play, if your internet drops the game crashes.


      There is no way to tell what forces are on a planet before you attack so you
      guess what to attack rather than using any tactics.


      There''s a retreat button but it''s bugged and causes your entire fleet to explode
      even if you retreat before a single shot is fired and it takes a long long time
      to rebuild.


      You can''t design or modify ships, you have to exit to the campaign to design
      a ship from the main menu, then load your gamr and load the ship (wtf).'
