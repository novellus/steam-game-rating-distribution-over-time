Also sometimes when placing the blocks in 1 wall they will jump unexpectedly, even to another wall. The level progression could be better too. The cross blocks and skulls should come in much later or have options just to disable them.\n\nSadly I don't think the dev is interested in this anymore so I'm not expecting updates\n\nBut for the price it's a bit of good fun and exercise, mixed with a good dose of nostalgia.","timestamp_created":1590010929,"timestamp_updated":1590010929,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49quCmvICc7eOiQI="}
