I bought this after enjoying another game form this developer called Control. But this game is just terrible. The live action series is decent and you are better off just watching that on YouTube but the \"game\" is just unplayable. \n\n1. All the temporal visual effects just end up causing a headache. It feels like your graphics card is failing and causing visual artifacts. Just some cheap and distracting visual effects.\n2. The movement and combat feels super laggy and unsatisfying. Because of the annoying visual effects, I  feel better off not using my time powers. \n3. There is no save system! So if you die towards the end of a chapter you have to do the whole thing again, sitting through several minutes of forced dialogue, elevator rides etc. again and again and again. \n4. There are sooo many bullet sponges and you have to empty several magazines into them (even if you aim for the head). Gunplay is just unsatisfying and you seem to be firing blanks instead of actual bullets. \n5. Its not like Control where you have fun super powers. The powers here are not very meaningful and actually a bit annoying to use.","timestamp_created":1609832525,"timestamp_updated":1609832808,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5Ofg6PYCdd3QwAI="}
