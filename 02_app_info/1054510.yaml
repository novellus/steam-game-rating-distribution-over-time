    about_the_game: 'Survivalist: Invisible Strain is an open-ended game about building
      a community after the collapse of civilization.  You can recruit survivors by
      making them like you, or respect you, or fear you.  You''ll need to keep them
      warm, keep them fed, and build a settlement to keep them safe from zombies,
      looters, and whatever else is out there.  Use stealth, weapons, or words to
      achieve your objectives.  Currently it uses a randomly generated world, with
      a story mode to follow later.<br><br>This is the sequel to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/340050/Survivalist/"

      /><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Fight with guns, bow and arrows, or melee weapons</strong></h2>You
      can target your enemies legs to slow them down, or try to hit their heads for
      greater damage.  You can dodge or block in melee combat - and so can your enemies.  Different
      characters have different skill sets and can level up to improve their Archery,

      can sneak up on enemies and assassinate them, or just knock them out cold and
      steal their stuff.  Throw bottles or chunks of meat to distract zombies.  Wear
      camouflaged clothing to boost your Stealth skill.  Rabbits and zombies both
      have a keen sense of smell, so make sure you check the wind direction!<br><br><br><img

      you recruit followers they''ll need a place to sleep, a steady food source,
      and a fire to keep warm.  Chop down trees, mine rocks, and look for other resources
      in the abandoned towns dotted around the map.  Set pit traps for zombies and
      raiders to fall in, or set rabbit traps for food.  Assign your community members
      different roles such as Farmer, Chef, Arrow Crafter, etc.  Over time you can
      build a well-defended, self-sufficient settlement that even produces its own
      bullets.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1054510/extras/Base2.gif?t=1599256812"

      notes: "- Contains violence against humans and zombies, and you can hunt animals.\r\
        \n- You can 'skin' corpses and eat the meat or use it as bait, though currently\
        \ it's not very graphic\r\n- There is a clothing system, which means characters\
        \ can be undressed down to their underwear.\r\n- Also a fair amount of swearing"

    short_description: It's ten years since the infection started. Long-established
      settlements are collapsing, one by one, for unknown reasons. Survivors are running
      to the hills to escape, hoping for safety in remote places. As another refugee,
      you're here to carve out a new life for yourself - by any means necessary.

    review: "I think, in time, this game will be a lot of fun, in time; I've put very\
      \ little time into it, and that time has been split up over months and months.\
      \ It has made solid progress, and I can only imagine it would be much more fun\
      \ with co-op.\n\nWith that in mind, let me start by saying I play mostly Solo\
      \ play, although that doesn't really cause me any problems, personally. I've\
      \ played Zomboid, and even dabbled in CDDA. I can handle an unforgiving start\
      \ in a zed game (I actually quite like the feeling of frantically trying to\
      \ keep my needs met while I establish an outpost...)\n\nThis review is mostly\
      \ going to be negative, because I hope the Dev will address these problems at\
      \ some point, but the game has been exceptionally fun, even as I'm reaching\
      \ my limit on the BS I'll soon write about, I'm enjoying the game. It's really\
      \ interesting and creative, and.. well.. fun. \n\nMy biggest complaint, honestly,\
      \ is the auto targeting. It tries to auto target for you, and there's no way\
      \ to disable this, so if three zombies are close enough to lunge at you at the\
      \ same time you lose. End game. There's no fixing it, because the auto aim will\
      \ rapidly spin you around to the one that's starting it's lunge animation, and\
      \ refuse to swing at the ones who lunge or the ones on the ground. A solid 80%\
      \ of my deaths end this way, and usually against only two or three zombies.\
      \ If there's enough spacing where multiple zombies don't enter the lung animation\
      \ too close together, so that I can actually lock onto a zombie and, yano, attack,\
      \ I can usually take 6-8 zombies down in one go.\n\n*UPDATE* I had lowered the\
      \ sensitivity down previously, and it didn't seem to do anything but on reboot\
      \ it's far more functional now, so I'll rescind that.\n\nBeyond that the AI\
      \ can be incredibly, frustratingly stupid. I was trying to build a camp fire,\
      \ and my character kept stopping in the middle of chopping logs to try and walk\
      \ to a near by base to go set by the fire.\nI had done that before going to\
      \ my base, got her Temp up to 35. Walking to my planned base-site took her between\
      \ that and 32.  Not at 32. I felt like I was fighting my own character to do\
      \ a simple task, which is just a huge drag. I get why that's important, but\
      \ if I'm actively controlling a character, maybe have it just show the need\
      \ above their head sims-style until it's an emergency? (I usually would go back\
      \ to the camp at temp 28, refill to 35, then continue with whatever I was doing)\n\
      \nHowever, in my so-far-EXTREMELY-limited experience, if their needs are generally\
      \ well met and you have supplies in camp, the AI works really well. It's just\
      \ super frustrating while you're already struggling to meet your needs, and\
      \ lay out a foundation so that you won't have to continue to struggle to meet\
      \ your needs, to fight the AI, and I had to completely stop my last game because\
      \ it simply dovetailed too far, where my character wouldn't even go to do a\
      \ need before stopping to do something else. It reminded me of two sims trying\
      \ to use the stairs at the same time in sims 2, where they end up dead in a\
      \ puddle of their own urine because they don't know what to do lol.. but, yano,\
      \ much more frustrating."
