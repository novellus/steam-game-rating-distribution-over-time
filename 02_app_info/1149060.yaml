    about_the_game: "Vivid! is a colorful 2D action-packed platformer where color\
      \ dictates your actions. You'll guide our heroic young lady, Vivid, through\
      \ the artistic world of Paper Craft and discover treasure, fight off amphibious\
      \ wizards, and uncover the truth behind her lack of color. You'll even be able\
      \ to play as her cute dog, Spirit!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is a Demo build with\
      \ a Tutorial Level and a Main level inside. If this is your first time playing,\
      \ the tutorial will be helpful with understanding some of the basics in Vivid.\
      \ Even if you're great at platformers it will be a good idea to try it just\
      \ so you know about some of mechanics in the game. Once you're ready, you can\
      \ tackle the main stage known as &quot;Azure Aqueduct&quot;. You can only play\
      \ as Vivid for now with limited equipment. But once you beat this stage, all\
      \ equipment will be unlocked along with the second character, Spirit!<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nThe demo is around 30 minutes long, but can be longer if you decide\
      \ to play around with Spirit and other weapons. Do note that the extra weapons\
      \ and Spirit are still being worked on, so they may not be as fluid or lack\
      \ sound effects. If you close out of the demo but want to play with all the\
      \ weapons and Spirit again, when on the Level Select, Hold UP and then press\
      \ the button set to ATTACK. This will treat it as if you beat the demo.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nBesides beating the demo, you can also try speed running or getting\
      \ the Platinum Rank! That is a very hard to earn rank which will require getting\
      \ 8000 points, all Hearts, and beating the demo in under 3:40 at the same time!\
      \ Good luck if you decide to attempt it."
