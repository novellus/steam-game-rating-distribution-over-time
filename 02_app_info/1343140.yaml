    review: 'So far I''m loving it, I haven''t yet made it even halfway (If the 15
      arcs are roughly the same length) but am extremely curious to see where things
      lead.

      The pros:

      Fascinating story so far

      Intricate characters that feel alive rather than just words on a screen

      Many choices makes it feel a lot more natural flowing story, so far I have only
      made 2 decisions that went back and doubled up on something I''d already read
      or stated it again in a near identical way


      The cons:

      If you''re looking for a goosebumps choose your own adventure this is not it,
      it feels like a gentle guiding wind rather than a brutal merciless storyteller

      One save slot (Unsure as of yet but it seems like reverting to a specific choice
      if you wish to see both directions will be a chore)

      Choices being in the middle of the screen means I''m often interrupted in my
      reading by an oversized cursor left behind by a choice. A minor annoyance but
      one that happens with almost every choice that spawns more than a single line
      of text


      Overall:

      Would highly recommend it if you are after an intricate and curious story 8/10
      so far'
