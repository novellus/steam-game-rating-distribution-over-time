    review: 'Alright so far it has been one heck of a ride from restart after restart
      i must say this game really has potential is quite hard at the start but once
      you get the hang of thing it can be quite fun, some parts does gets a bot boring
      but pretty sure all games has "Boring Parts", anyways if you enjoy mount and
      blade and pirates highly recommend trying also this game is not perfect ofc
      but in due time in will be amazing hopefully the Devs well kepp on working on
      this for now it took me 7h to learn the basics Lol cause it does not really
      guide you other than that not a bad game.

      ps this is my longest review cause i really wanted to let the devs know that
      if they keep on working on this it will be an amazing game.'
