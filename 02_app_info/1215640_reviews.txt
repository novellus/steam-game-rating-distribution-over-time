All towers are now available, and now I have two medals, and my opinion has not changed much so far.  I still haven't played all the way through everything, but again, it can take months to do that in this game, and I'd rather this preliminary report be available to anyone who's on the fence.]\n\nWith that out of the way, my suggestion is to read up through to the heading that most closely applies to you:\n\n[h1]\"I don't want any spoilers at all; I like discovering things on my own, and I accept the risk that I may end up not liking it.  I just want to know, did they [i]obviously[/i] put less effort into the DLC than the rest of the game?\"[/h1]\n\nIf you've already played the base game long enough that you feel comfortable saying that you will still be playing it months from now, then I don't think you're going to be disappointed by the DLC.\n\n[h1]\"I don't want spoilers on the new content, but I do have some basic expectations for what the DLC is or should be, and I just want to know if those expectations are met or not.\"[/h1]\n\nFirst off, although the new towers are available for selection as soon as you install the DLC, I wouldn't get the DLC under the expectation that you could just play them from the very beginning.  The new towers are hard, building on concepts you learn in the first twelve towers.  A couple of them put you up against rough opponents right at the start, too, and it might help you to arrive with some medals already in hand so you can give yourself some breathing room to try different options.  It's better to think of the new towers as \"end-game content\" rather than simply \"additional content\".\n\nAlso, because of this, you probably shouldn't get the DLC purely on the premise that getting extra medals will help make the first twelve towers easier.  The new towers do provide you with more options for how to progress, but getting low-tier medals in the new towers is going to be just as difficult, or maybe more difficult, than earning high-tier medals in the earlier towers.  This isn't really the kind of game that's designed to allow you to \"cheat\" your way out of coming to a deeper understanding of how the towers work; all the DLC does is provide new milestones for you to reach.\n\nAs long as you keep all this in mind, though, the DLC does feel like a natural extension of the main game.  Just like the main game, it continues to use tools introduced in earlier towers while still adding new tools of its own.  Also like the main game, each tower has a central gimmick, a specific idea it plays with that requires you to approach the game from a new angle.\n\n[h1]\"I want SOME spoilers.  Describe some of the new content to me so I can know what I'm getting into.\"[/h1]\n\nIt goes against my principles to provide [i]full[/i] spoilers, but I can give you some generalizations.  If you've been reading the developer's updates, you already know that the new towers continue to use weapons and accessories like the ones in towers 11 and 12.  You see some existing favorites making frequent returns, but they also throw in some new ideas that I think are very interesting--for example, [spoiler]weapons that [i]punish[/i] you for using them[/spoiler].  The presence of equipment greatly increases the complexity of choices you can make, sometimes changing your entire approach depending on what you pick up.\n\nI mentioned that there continues to be a central theme for each tower, so here they are, if you're curious:\n\nTower 13: The central theme here is that the DLC has new weapons and accessories, and the developers want you to know about them.  Expect to make use of equipment early and often as you progress through the tower.\n\nTower 14: [spoiler]You're probably already familiar with the fact that Life Crowns can get your HP multiplier above 100%.  However, did you know your multiplier can go LOWER than 100%?[/spoiler]\n\nTower 15: [spoiler]I think the idea behind this one is that you have access to certain powerful resources from the beginning, but you receive better rewards the longer you hold off on using them.  It's basically the marshmallow test, but with Continental Potions.[/spoiler]\n\nTower 16: [spoiler]I think this one just provides a healthy balance of all the concepts that have been introduced up to this point in time.  It feels like the most \"normal\" of the towers.[/spoiler]\n\nTower 17: [spoiler]There aren't many enemies, but the ones that do exist are extremely powerful, and you can't return to lower floors once you go upstairs.  Do you use your keys now, or hold onto them for later?[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1581995955,"timestamp_updated":1582480332,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.590375244617462158","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzrLLufACf62A8wE="}
