The second the game starts he falls on his face!!! Game doesn't even give me a chance to learn what the buttons are! Then game over............................................ game over = main menu buttons are now locked and no longer selectable. They just stop work. Also, the game crashed... okay... I go back to the steam window click the \"play\" button wait for the game to reopen and.................... \"MENU BUTTONS ARE LOCKED\" so I close the game, reopen the game \"MENU BUTTONS ARE LOCKED AGAIN\" wtf????? this game is broken............ very very broken!!! Its not playable AT ALL. Especially if I don't even have a split second (NOT EVEN A SPLIT SECOND) to learn what the damn buttons are before the dude falls on his face again its like the second the level starts I die!! WTF!? AND OMG!! I will redo my review when I get the time (AFTER I recheck the game and find these severe problems are fixed).
