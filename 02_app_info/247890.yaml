      \ was a prominent Italian Free City and played an important role in Mediterranean\
      \ trade. Their fleet was important for gaining dominance over the Mediterranean\

      \ in 1922. The Ottomans dominated land from the Balkans to the Arabian Peninsula.\
      \ In Europa Universalis IV they are a strong choice for playing a warmonger\
      \ game because of their cheaper coring costs and powerful early troops.<br><i><u>Colonization/Portugal</u></i><br>Portugal\

      \ Emperor, as it is an elective title. Keeping good relations with the electors\
      \ will greatly improve your chances of keeping the crown. Austria is a strong\
      \ choice for a diplomatic game because of their inclination towards holding\
      \ the title of Emperor.<br><br><strong>Europa Universalis IV Main Features:</strong><br>\u2022\
