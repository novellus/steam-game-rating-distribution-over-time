This angle is the career of Adéwalé, the former quartermaster on Edward Kenway's ship in Black Flag, after what happened in Assassin's Creed IV. The game is short but if you have played Black Flag before this, it is a nice continuation of the story. Map, gameplay-mechanics and functionalities are similar to Black Flag. It is a nice little additional story to Black Flag but can also be played independently, e.g. if you want to get a taste of what Black Flag feels like (although the story is not in chronological order then). Shanties, graphics etc are also there! Runs without major problems on a WIN10 1909 gaming-PC.","timestamp_created":1610010501,"timestamp_updated":1610010501,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+NOG7vYCd4KdwQI="}
