    review: "**OK, so I played for about 35 minutes, so I can't really comment on\
      \ the long-tail of the game, but I can give some notes. That also goes without\
      \ saying that maybe this suddenly changes and blossoms into an amazing game\
      \ at some point, but I don't see evidence of that and from what I've played,\
      \ I don't think it's likely. **\n\nThis looks & feels like someone's first game,\
      \ so I don't want to be too hard on anyone, I'll do my best to phrase this as\
      \ constructively as I can, but if anything comes across as mean/sarcastic, please\
      \ know it's not meant that way.\n\nIf I'd come across this on itchio for free\
      \ and saw it was the dev's first game, I'd be pleasantly surprised. The basic\
      \ mechanics work(outside a confusing cooking mini-game), there's something of\
      \ a core loop, there's a vague goal. It's all more or less passable, for a free\
      \ game. The look of things are off though, the sort of soft 3D-chibi protagonist\
      \ doesn't belong in the blocky world, and the blocky world implies the ability\
      \ to deform the terrain(since that's the entire point of building a big world\
      \ out of cubes) but I could not figure out any way to do so, and it appears\
      \ there just isn't a way to deform the world.\n\nThe game is advertised as having\
      \ sort of weather events and  tornadoes and things like that. It's possible\
      \ I didn't play long enough but outside of a sort of rumbling earthquake (I\
      \ 100% thought it was just a camera glitch) I didn't encounter anything like\
      \ significant weather. I did encounter what seem to be the titular spirits,\
      \ but the encounter was simply that I took damage if I let my torch go out.\
      \ \n\nThe actual game-play loop is dictated by your stat-meters. Eat, sleep,\
      \ drink, pretty standard stuff. It works, but unfortunately the resource collection\
      \ to keep these bars full is about as simple as it gets. Hold E to cut the tree,\
      \ tap E to gather wood, tap E to gather grass, tap E to gather apples, tap E\
      \ to gather loose stones, Hold E to mine stones from an outcrop. There's nothing\
      \ endangering you or giving you a tangible sense of progression or satisfaction.\n\
      \nMany games are saved from boring mechanics by a story or world that engages\
      \ the player, but the world here is entirely free of context, character, narrative,\
      \ or anything else to elevate the mechanics.\n\nThis is, to me at least, a good\
      \ example of where publishing as a \"Hey this is my first game, check it out!\"\
      \ on itchio or newgrounds or something would have improved the experience. However,\
      \ coming across this on Steam for $14.99 is setting up a comparison to other\
      \ games in the same price range and Genre (Terraria, Raft, The Forest, The Isle\
      \ are all within $5 of the current price) which leaves this feeling like a loss.\
      \ I feel it is absolutely not worth the asking price in it's current state.\n\
      \nI hope the dev takes something helpful away from this, and continues to make\
      \ new and better games than this."
