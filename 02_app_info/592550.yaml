    review: "I normally wait until I've finished a game before I review it, but I've\
      \ had a good 8 or more hours playing it, and I think I can give it a fair review\
      \ now.\n\nSeasteader plays like may other city sim games:  You have buildings,\
      \ citizens, and so on.  The citizens have needs, as does the city (not the least\
      \ of which is liquidity (pun intended).   You begin with a 'hub', and are required\
      \ to balance the various aspects of your 'stead as you grow it towards passing\
      \ the mission goals (or just making a humungous seaborne metropolis). \n\nThe\
      \ game allows a sandbox mode where everything's unlocked, and you can just freely\
      \ build your city, or campaign mode where you get 'missions' to achieve goals.\
      \   I think there are only about 15 campaign missions, and I've finished the\
      \ first three, which are relatively easy once you understand the game mechanics.\n\
      \nAs you can see from the graphics, the game focusses less on being pretty with\
      \ lots of animations and stuff, and primarily on the economic aspects.  In this\
      \ regard, Seasteader strikes a nice balance between clarity and functionality.\
      \  You won't get all the amazing effects of Anno2050, or the huge array of building\
      \ types of Tropico, but all the basic building types are there:  Production\
      \ chains, housing, entertainment, city upkeep, etc.   What you will get is a\
      \ game which provides you the ability to build a city much the same as any other\
      \ CitySim, but which allows to really tweak the economic and employment aspects\
      \ which most other games won't.   This can be by price gouging for exports,\
      \ making your citizens live in slums and pay huge rent, or forcing them to work\
      \ every hour god sends...\n\nFor me, one of the interesting aspects is building\
      \ a new building, and then sourcing the right people to 'staff' it.   You'll\
      \ get an influx of immigrants, all of whom have their own skills.  You can rob\
      \ the mediocre fishermen to staff your glassworks, but that'll impact your fishing\
      \ quotas.. You may, later, choose to move them back, to continue their fishermen\
      \ training as you don't need so much glassware...   Proper tweaking like this\
      \ isn't needed in the first few levels, but I can see it coming into its own\
      \ later. \n\n\nThe game is 'complete', insofar as it's not \"early access\"\
      .  However it's clear that there's a LOT of spare space in the UI and dropdowns\
      \ for more options.  Some buildings only make one resource type, but are flexibly\
      \ built to support more.  So what you see in the images above is a fraction\
      \ of what's available, and only gives a wee flavour of the game itself.\n\n\
      Because it's an indie game, it can be a little 'raw'.  Like I said, don't expect\
      \ the polish of a AAA game... There are some aspects you're just expected to\
      \ play with yourself.   If you like just tweaking sliders to see what happens,\
      \ then you'll enjoy this.  Some of the impact of changes to a few variables\
      \ aren't laid out in simple terms, so you have to tweak them and see what happens.\
      \  Sometimes the effects aren't obvious for a while.\n\nHaving a team of \"\
      0%\" skill level glassblowers will still produce you some glassware, whereas\
      \ in real life they'd just suck up cash while they trained, and then you'd get\
      \ a slowly increasing yield.. I think that realism needs to be tempered a bit\
      \ with these things, so has taken a back-seat to allow clarity and simplicity\
      \ to prevail.\n\nI'm giving it a 75% thumbs up:  It does need a little work\
      \ to be more accessible to the general gamer, and a little tweaking.  There\
      \ are a few unusual design choices which can give the learning curve a slightly\
      \ steeper slope than you'd expect, but it's a solid core with some interesting\
      \ challenge.\n\nUPDATE(Dec 2019) Unfortunately the game has been abandoned by\
      \ the developer due to some very negative personal remarks by players.  Sadly,\
      \ the game was released at full price while still under development, and a lot\
      \ of people took exception to the issues still present, and the general indie-feel\
      \ to the game, expecting something more polished.  It's a real shame because\
      \ there are many different resource types, and the focus of the game is on people,\
      \ rather than buildings, which is nice.\n\nUnfortunately, because the game has\
      \ been abandoned, the later levels aren't quite as balanced as they need to\
      \ be.    If the game is on sale for under a fiver it'd be worth it just to experiment\
      \ with the economy, but at the moment it's still over \xA310.   If the developer\
      \ ever comes back and implements all the features on the original roadmap, this'd\
      \ be a fab game."
