I would have recommanded it if the new race was not bugged. The race is playable albeit has some bugs for the player. For the AI, it simply does not do anything at all until its only planet is conquered by another player. Bugs have been reported but the game is seemingly not patched anymore.\n\nIf you really want the quality of life features, you can buy it but 10â‚¬ for a DLC with major bugs is too much to me.","timestamp_created":1604692706,"timestamp_updated":1604692706,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrfDIz/UCePLfrAI="}
