With an atmosphere that starts out feeling a bit cozy but over time turns into something a bit dark and depressing as you spend more time in the world. It´s not that long of a game but I enjoyed my time with it even though it´s not a genre I usually play a lot.\n\nCan recommend if you want a nice platformer that you can complete during an evening.","timestamp_created":1589483897,"timestamp_updated":1589483897,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ivCnivICdMTdhwI="}
