I use it both as a gaming console and a Desktop computer. I am a Linux Debian addicted therefore I have two \"machines\" in one box and even if it is not recommended I have installed on the Debian Steam OS anything I wanted without any problem. The controller/pad is another piece of art. Difficult to master at the beginning but after a while you will never go back to any other pad on the market. My sons start using the Steam machine more and more so another one is on its way :-).","timestamp_created":1487935509,"timestamp_updated":1487935509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516129016876220703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oML3t9oCeJ78cg=="}
