It's got a bit too many shortcomings for my taste. My main three issues are: 1) the wiper removes full marker strokes. 2) It also sticks to the whiteboard like a magnet so it always wipes the full area. There's no angle you can use.  This makes it impossible to wipe smaller areas in between drawings. 3) You need to hold a button in order for the marker to draw. This feels very counter intuitive.\n\nLike other said, some added tools would be very useful. Like a calculator or some sort of drawing assistant for straight lines. I did like how no-nonsense the app is and that you can add more whiteboards and re-position them. The basics are there, but its just a bit too... basic. Try anything that requires a bit more finesse or precision and you'll notice the shortcomings.\n\nI did want to like this app because there's not much nothing else around. Half Life Alyx has some pretty good drawing tech, but that comes with a whole game. Only if someone would make a half life level classroom with a big whiteboard. :)\n\n","timestamp_created":1608635853,"timestamp_updated":1608635853,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jOWKxfYCfr+TvAI="}
