    review: "First and foremost, it's realistic and it enables multiple players within\
      \ the same vehicle. It's also not hard on my system. Unfortunately, the interface\
      \ in the tank is a little clunky and the manual does not describe it well. Graphics\
      \ are not that great either. It needs patches for WIndows 10 and an easier way\
      \ to play online. \n"
