      \ app, or as a PDF available in your Steam Directory.<br><br>At a science complex\
      \ in the New Mexico desert, a teleportation experiment goes very wrong, unleashing\
      \ interdimensional chaos on an unsuspecting Earth. The aftershocks end with\
      \ the arrival of a totalitarian order called The Combine, which forces a brutal\
      \ police state on the last remnants of the occupied planet.<br><br>Now, some\
      \ years later, a mysterious cosmic tower has materialised in a hidden city \u2013\
      \ a tower that may prove to be humanity\u2019s salvation, or its doom. A team\
      \ of military commandos soon emerge from the city, sweeping across the American\
      \ wasteland kidnapping children for an unknown purpose.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/466270/extras/25.jpg?t=1608134759\"\
      \ /><br><br>In the wake of their devastation, a troubled father, an intrepid\
      \ scientist, and an ancient alien warrior are each drawn to the strange city\
      \ with the cosmic tower: New Franklin. Faced with warring clans, diabolical\
      \ experiments, portentous dreamscapes, and the growing shadow of The Combine,\
      \ they must unlock New Franklin\u2019s mysteries before it\u2019s too late \u2013\
      \ and the lives of everyone in the city hang in the balance.<br><br><i>A Place\
      \ in the West</i> weaves a compelling story with a complex cast of all-new characters,\
      \ drawing on the rich mythology of the <i>Half-Life</i> universe to create an\
      \ original adventure for the series.<br><br>The comic will run for a total of\
      \ fifteen chapters, the first of which, <i>Following Portents</i>, is available\
      \ for free to download and comes to a total of 35 pages. The remaining chapters\

      notes: 'Half-Life: A Place in the West is intended for mature audiences, containing
        occasional scenes of moderate violence, rare episodes of body horror, and
        minor nudity and sexual content, although this varies from chapter to chapter.
        The story deals with themes of political oppression, sexual assault, and sexual
        coercion.'
