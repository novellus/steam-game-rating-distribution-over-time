    review: "Snares Of Ruin 2 is a casual independent R.P.G. both developed and published\
      \ by Astronomic Games. Once again ace detective Hank Anderson and his trusty\
      \ partner Gwen head up an investigation this time in the city of Malrith to\
      \ track down a mysterious serial killer who is leaving a trail of bodies all\
      \ throughout the metropolis. The gangs all here as you will also team up with\
      \ pivotal characters from the first title. Dr. Alzyra, a brilliant vampire scientist,\
      \ Medina, a compassionate nurse and last but not least Miroslava, a strong-willed\
      \ one-woman wrecking crew. Also, two new people will join the investigation\
      \ as Hank and his team attempt to put an end to the killing spree that is terrorizing\
      \ the city. \n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]\n\nLike the first title this is a roleplaying\
      \ game with your character earning skill points for completing various objectives.\
      \ Said skill points can then be used to upgrade a skill tree consisting of Athletics\
      \ for physical feats, Charisma used to coerce or gain information from other\
      \ people and Erudition which is knowledge that can be applied to the use of\
      \ science and computers. You can use these skill points to tailor your version\
      \ of Hank Anderson as you see fit by investing all points into one ability or\
      \ spreading them out for a more balanced character...the choice is yours. Choose\
      \ carefully though as the skills that Hank possesses will allow him to handle\
      \ situations in varying ways of success or failure. Another new addition to\
      \ the series which I absolutely enjoyed is the city map which allows you to\
      \ actually drive your car to different locations around town. This really adds\
      \ to the feeling of being a detective as you move around to various crime scenes\
      \ and search for clues. \n\nThere are also sidequests available in the form\
      \ of \"Missing Persons\" whom you can choose to pursue on your off-time or while\
      \ conducting the main investigation if you decide to take on the extra work.\
      \ Locating these people, preferably alive, will net you additional skill points\
      \ and currency to spend and it will have an effect on the overall safety and\
      \ well being of the entire city. As with the original title you have the opportunity\
      \ to pursue one or more romances with a number of female friends and co-workers\
      \ over the course of the game if you should choose to do so. Exploration of\
      \ the locations that you investigate is encouraged as you'll sometimes find\
      \ useful items that can aid you in some way if you're resourceful and keep your\
      \ eyes open. \n\n[h1]VISUALS[/h1]\n\nThis is a RPGMaker title that makes terrific\
      \ use of the programs assets. The locations are wonderfully laid out, nicely\
      \ detailed and filled with bright and beautiful colors when appropriate like\
      \ in the suburbs for example and dreary tones when necessary for say...an abandoned\
      \ warehouse or the sewers beneath the city. There's alot of variety to the many\
      \ different areas that you visit over the course of the story. As opposed to\
      \ Snares Of Ruin and Snares Of Ruin Zero, this title went in a completely different\
      \ direction with some of the visuals and I for one really enjoyed the new aesthetics\
      \ very much. The environments have a similar look to the previous games but\
      \ the in-game sprites and character art used during dialogue sequences has changed\
      \ altogether. The new cutscene artwork has a grittier look to it in my opinion\
      \ and it really fits in nicely with the gumshoe narrative of this terrific game.\
      \ The characters also move their lips during dialogue which definitely helps\
      \ with immersion as you read. \n\nMoving on, once again you'll visit a myriad\
      \ of different locations throughout the city as you conduct your investigations\
      \ from the City Center to the business district and the suburbs as well as the\
      \ more affluent areas of town. You'll also get a chance to spend some leisure\
      \ time with your co-workers at a restaurant, a bowling alley, the city park\
      \ or a bar just to name a few examples. Overall, I really enjoyed the changes\
      \ made in the visual presentation between this latest title and the previous\
      \ entries.\n\n[h1]SOUND[/h1]\n\nThe aural presentation of this game is terrific\
      \ from the sounds of the user interface to various in-game sound effects such\
      \ as cell phones ringing, combat as well as many others. The soundtrack is also\
      \ fantastic and I really wish it was available for download but sadly like the\
      \ previous games it is not. Such a shame though as many of those songs are quite\
      \ memorable and have a catchy beat. \n\n[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]\n\nI enjoyed this\
      \ game so much dare I say even moreso than the original title perhaps? The story\
      \ was intriguing, the gameplay alot of fun with even some new elements introduced\
      \ and a terrific new visual style that I adored. As always you can create the\
      \ type of detective that you envision and there are a bevy of choices to make\
      \ throughout the narrative that have an impact on current events as well as\
      \ the ending. Replayability is high, again due to the decisions that you can\
      \ make and for acquiring all the achievements if that's your thing. Also if\
      \ you're fans of Astronomic Games and you pay close attention you might spot\
      \ a couple of \"easter eggs\" hidden over the course of the narrative. \n\n\
      On the technical side, I didn't have many issues but did start to suffer some\
      \ lag and a crash to desktop towards the end of the title but nothing game breaking.\
      \ As far as extra content goes, there are an abundance of Steam Achievements\
      \ to hunt down but sadly no Steam Trading Cards to collect. In summary, I loved\
      \ this next title in the franchise and really look forward to more sleuthing\
      \ adventures with detective Hank Anderson and his crew so Snares Of Ruin 2 is\
      \ HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to story-rich roleplaying gamers who also like the fact\
      \ that choice matters."
