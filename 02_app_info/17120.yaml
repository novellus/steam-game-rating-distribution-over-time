    review: "An underrated and probably unheard of city builder game. The game has\
      \ a progression curve: start off small with just farmers and common shops, later\
      \ expand the city's capabilities through craftsmen and later learned professionals\
      \ who greatly increase the capability of the city. With that said, as the city\
      \ grows so does its needs: initially the city does not need to care about things\
      \ like religion or healthcare, but those become more important as the city grows.\
      \ As such, it becomes imperative that as basileus to maintain schools to keep\
      \ the graduates flowing, and likewise gain prestige to allow the city to have\
      \ more professionals.\n\nPros: \nUndemanding yet compelling challenges: It is\
      \ covered in depth in the cons, but it keeps the player compelled enough to\
      \ plan out the city and manage it a bit, and forces the player to think about\
      \ building placements and later on, graduate management. The game starts off\
      \ with several fundamental resources and builds up on it in a nice curve: start\
      \ off managing food and wares, then bricks, then professionals, then materials\
      \ for monuments and soldiers as well as foreign actions. While the challenge\
      \ is enough to force the player not to go haywire from the beginning, the demands\
      \ are typically reasonable enough that a minor dissatisfaction does not prevent\
      \ the player from progressing.\nAvailability of a world builder: World builders\
      \ and modding capability vastly contributes to a game's life cycle (coming from\
      \ an avid Civ V modder who is 5+ years into the game), and CotN has a world\
      \ builder allowing the player to experiment and build worlds to their liking.\
      \ This is more than I can say for many other games, and I'm glad that the developer\
      \ added this feature to the game.\nCons: \nThe game is dated as heck - graphics-wise\
      \ it's understandable and frankly if you're here you probably don't mind retro\
      \ graphics. What is really a problem is its instability on the Windows 10 environment:\
      \ it crashes often, and its crashes are difficult to recover from forcing the\
      \ user to restart the computer. This is probably the biggest downside to the\
      \ game in 2020.\nDemands can be a bit hard to fulfill - Religion tends to be\
      \ a sour point because priests (who are the bread and butter of the mid-late\
      \ game) are needed to tend to the shrines but also are needed to tend to the\
      \ sick, the students and the dead: while shrines can swap to different gods\
      \ without cost, the city often has people who want to worship different gods\
      \ at the same time. As mentioned in the pros though, this alone usually isn't\
      \ problematic enough to derail gameplay, although for perfectionists it can\
      \ be a peeve to be unable to fulfill peoples' religious demands.\nSlow - Even\
      \ on maximum speed things can be a bit slow, and sometimes one wants to make\
      \ it even faster than the 2.5x speed setting for lull times."
