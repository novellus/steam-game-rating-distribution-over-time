    review: 'Well, the quotes are better this time around.  In the last puzzle pack,
      the quotes were very pretentious, on the order of "Are you reading this quote,
      or is Obsidian a number that can be divided by zero?  When a tree falls in the
      forest, does an angel get its wings?  Why is a beer can?"  And so forth.  This
      time around the quotes sound like they are directly lifted from the Cthulhu
      stories.  "Prof. Arkham was walking down the street when I saw him.  HE HAS
      AN OCTOPUS FACE!  AAAARGH!"


      That being said, I have to agree that monochromatic gaseous clouds do not make
      interesting puzzles.  Still, for two bucks, you get 18 puzzles (9  base times
      2 variations), and as usual the GUI is solid and useful.  The color of space
      is a thumbs up.'
