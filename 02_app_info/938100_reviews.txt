After winning, they discover that their opponents are actually criminals and that their old chuuni friend, Fate, is working with them for his own purposes. This conflict eventually forces the sisters to confront their grim past in Icefall, their strained relationship, and their outlook on life.\n\nFor those that played the original free version from RPGMaker.net, there's some new dungeons and story segments between the old ones, as well as a True Ending if you complete all the sidequests, which leads into future entries in the Sacred Earth series.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game uses a non-ATB turned-based system, with LP, EX, and EP as your main resources. You can't use items to quickly restore any of these resources, but the game is balanced so that you can sustain yourself with support skills, EX Heal, Focus (basically a guard command with slight recovery), and post-battle recovery. The chain attack system could be difficult to use efficiently if your reflexes are poor, but once you memorize the keys you need to press, it's still possible to pull off normal chain -> EX -> Limit. I personally find the window of opportunity for inputs to be slightly too small, so I usually cut the normal attack chain short if it means guaranteeing an EX at the end. Of course, you don't need to do the normal chain, since you're allowed to use an EX skill from the battle menu, meaning you still have a chance to win even if you have the reflexes of a snail.\n\nFor the battle UI, it's impossible to see the enemies' current buffs and debuffs, which can be annoying if the player mistakenly tries to apply a debuff that the enemy already has. Additionally, a lot of complaints about OHKOs and RNG would be mitigated if the player could see all active enemy buffs, since their offensive buffs are most likely causing them to kill everything.\n\nFor those worried about the difficulty, the game is balanced to be a bit on the hardcore side. You will need to pay attention to enemy weaknesses and utilize offensive buffs, even in normal battles, so that you can make every attack count as much as possible. Against tankier enemies and bosses, you'll need to use more defensive tactics to survive a prolonged battle against them, since their damage output is rather high. Try to have at least one character defending per turn, especially if that character is unable to target the boss's elemental weakness. YMMV may vary on this defensive gameplay, since some like that enemies can't be cheesed with offensive skill spam while others feel that this gameplay balance causes battles to be dragged out.\n\nThe dungeons feature a node system, where you can interact with combat, treasure, trap, event, and bonus nodes to unlock more of the map. There are also mini-dungeon nodes that take you to a tradtional map with enemies and puzzles. While the node system makes it convenient to avoid backtracking, the traditional maps are more aesthetically pleasing than a static background image. I personally would have preferred fewer nodes, but with mostly mini-dungeons so that there's still a clear sense of permanent progression while being able to see what the dungeon actually looks like.\n\nEXP gain is dependent on character level, which means stronger characters get less EXP while weaker characters get more EXP. This makes it easy to get the party evenly leveled, though it does make later encounters not worth the effort except on Nightmare mode. Unfortunately, it's easy to become too high-leveled before even taking out half the enemies in a dungeon, so speedrunners will have to keep a balance between fighting and spending TP to skip enemies. I'm willing to bet on Normal mode at least that even if you try to skip as much as you can, you'll probably level up enough just from whatever you can't skip.\n\nUpdate: It might be possible to get EXP from skipping enemies. I saw someone actually get EXP in their gameplay video despite skipping.\n\nThere's an equipment system, but it doesn't involve standard weapons and armor. Instead, each character can equip ether gems, which change their stats and elemental resistances, thus allowing for more customizability than a traditional equipment system. I generally went for balanced stat builds, with a slight bias for whatever offensive stat the characters are good at. Once you learn EX Limits, you can try going for glass cannon builds in an attempt to annihilate bosses in a few turns, though that could be riskier on Nightmare.\n\nThe game makes it fairly easy to find sidequests in town by giving the NPCs smiley face markers if they have one. Most sidequests need their criteria completed before fighting the current dungeon boss, but you usually can't report to the clients until after the boss, which can make it a bit nerve-wracking to confirm if you've actually completed it. I'm basically screaming \"MIR, WHY WON'T YOU TAKE MY FROST QUARTZ?! WHY DON'T YOU LOVE ME?!\" until she finally takes the quartz in the ending.","timestamp_created":1541487866,"timestamp_updated":1542058009,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.597279906272888184","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mrz0hOcCfZ6SrgE="}
