(maybe sprinkle the loot of The Division 2 multiplied by 2 over it as well...)\n\nThe basics of it is;\nGather loot, use loot to craft useable things and occasionally be forced to create an item as the story demands you have that specific item.\n\nThings I didn't like, quite minor problems:\nThe inventory could have info on \"hover-on\" - as there are \"loot boxes\" in the game - only in game currency so don't worry about it, it's from a vendor as well so they aren't really loot boxes, you'll get some random item(s) by spending 30 buttons. (the game doesn't tell you what they are, I thought the \"milk carton\" would heal and it did, would've been nice to know though...)\n\nThat you have to stop running to be able to trigger the ability to \"press X\" - I'm referring to a running puzzle, you have to use a pair of shoes to run - they are triggered by the right trigger, you'll run toward the place you need to press X - to flick the switch - the ability to press X to flick the switch isn't triggered as long as you press the right trigger.\n\nThe settings for sound, what is a VO/V0? (music, voice, effects and similar clearly stated things would be better, the amount of things are good, 4 plus master volume - at least, they're just not clearly defined so I'm nitpicking...)\n\nThings I liked:\nThe silly story, the cute and odd characters, the very relaxed state of mind you can be in while enjoying the game, it should work for old people (as I'm prrof of) as well as quite young kids.\n\nHad I been the kind of bloke that makes list of the \"game of the year-kind\", this wouldn't be on the list, it would however, much like Trials Evolution and Minecraft, be on the list of games I'd always have installed as I know I will have a good time whenever I start it up. (I do believe that's a higher praise than \"best of the current year\"...)\n\nGive it a go, you can always refund it, 2 hours of gameplay in this game should be more than enough to give you an idea of whether it's for you or not.","timestamp_created":1556466481,"timestamp_updated":1556466481,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563759505748748779","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49raosuoCf++TwAE="}
