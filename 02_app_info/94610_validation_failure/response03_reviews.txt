Due to the ineptitude of the force they call you in to either negotiate a successful hostage situation or die trying. What ends up happening is a mad dash all over the town trying to meet the demands of the terrorist.\n\nThe game is not a bad game however it is only a game for a very small niche crowd. The game is heavily laced with vulgar content (not laced but packed). Your main character (as you later on will play as your partner as well) is pretty much hated by everyone with the exception of 4 people. So, each encounter will have its degree of standoff conversations.\n\nIn fact, many of the puzzles require you to ask every question sometimes in the correct order to progress the plot or unlock new plot items. Puzzles are pretty straight forward and will not take long to complete. In fact, each chapter can be completed in roughly 4-5 hours if you are good with puzzle games.\n\nThe graphics are not state of the art. However, this is not a game that would require it and would probably be a worse game with them. They are comical and well designed. The animations in several locations are not synced and you can definitely see the jumping from one animation to the other (especially when you are in the church). The vocals are in no way synced.\n\nOverall, I would not say this is a bad game but if you are not into games that are vulgar, smut filled, with an obnoxious lead character I would stay away from this game. I own several Telltale games and this is the only one that I have not “recommended”.","timestamp_created":1608482709,"timestamp_updated":1608482709,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44MvCwPYCd9XfuwI="}
