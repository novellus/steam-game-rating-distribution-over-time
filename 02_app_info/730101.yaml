    short_description: As the team prepares for dinner, Tenten pulls out a scroll
      that contains all the ingredients for okonomiyaki. Lee is amazed at her ability
      to conjure up anything and mentions that she is &quot;convenient&quot; to have
      around. Tenten takes offense and storms off.
