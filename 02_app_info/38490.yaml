    review: "Surprisingly, The DOS Version of Earthworm Jim 2 is not bad, it seems\
      \ that the developers have learnt their lesson after the abomination that was\
      \ the DOS Version of Earthworm Jim 1, The Physics have been fixed, making them\
      \ closer to the Sega Genesis version, I have not encountered any glitches this\
      \ time, thank god, and the backgrounds & sprites from the Sega version are recreated\
      \ well here. \n\nThe only gripe I have is that one level is missing, Lorenzen's\
      \ Soil, which is featured in every other version of the game. It's a shame they\
      \ couldn't include it as it was one of my favorite levels from the Sega version.\
      \ \nAside from that, game is good, I would still recommend buying or emulating\
      \ the Playstation / Saturn version of Earthworm Jim 2. But if you don't have\
      \ enough money to order an old CD online or don't want to resort to piracy then\
      \ get this game on Steam."
