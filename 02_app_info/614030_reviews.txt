This game feels gimmicky. \n\nPros:\n+cool concept\n+background changing colors to the beat is reasonably accurate\n\nCons:\n-horrible UI for selecting music\n-level generation feels exactly the same regardless of the song or its genre.\n-no matter what difficulty you're at: the game feels like you're traveling faster than walking speed but WAYYYYY slower than running speed.\n-controls are awful\n-the follow line is either left or right, usually being right.\n-some obstacle setups only exist to end runs/drain health due to braindead placement that is impossible to navigate (Example being wallrun jumps with a glass barrier on the top right with a slide obstacle with a glass bottom left being literally 3 feet away from the previous obstacle).\n-low draw distance (worse than PS1 games somehow).\n\n\n\nI'm gonna get these easy achievements and uninstall. The game gets boring after a few songs.","timestamp_created":1589271193,"timestamp_updated":1602917204,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgvDTmvUCdsKahwI="}
