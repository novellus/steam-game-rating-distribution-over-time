While my initial recommendation  remains unchanged, I would like to see some more polish.  I am happy and thankful the dev was so quick to respond to a review for their game and look forward to seeing what future changes brings for this game.\n\nI will likely wait for quite a bit more to be added before I give it another shot.\n\n--- Response to Dev\nBeing a developer my self I of course mean no harm in my criticism.  And that is the point of the review process, if the items above were addressed I'd be happy to remove them from my critique.  Tho I no longer have the game to test my self, I'll likely wait until some more updates come out before I give it another shot and update my review with anything I find at that time.\n\n[Potentially outdated items]\n[Dev states this has been addressed]\nThe controls;  Horrible.  You have to hold D to go right, it isn't instant.  Hitting escape takes you to the pause menu, hitting it again does nothing.  Hitting escape doesn't close out in game menus either.","timestamp_created":1595282411,"timestamp_updated":1595456207,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530201971530914307","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1595370367,"developer_response":"I wanted to inform you that your review has lost its meaning: I just had to change some parameters in the code and the problems you listed, which other players had also informed me about in the DISCORD SERVER, have been solved.\nIt's no coincidence that the game is in EA, so I can collect as much feedback as possible from the players and release frequent updates in order to improve the quality of the game.\nLorien is an active fan who bought the game. As you can see he played much more than you did and appreciated it so much that he wrote a review here on steam and streamed the game on his twitch channel.\nFurthermore Lorien is Brazilian, while I am Italian and if I know him it is only because of the game. Anyway thanks for your feedback.\nEven if you could write me in the discord and I would have welcomed your criticisms much better (I also answer for future reviews)"}],"cursor":"AoJ4ibemvPMCcf7GlgI="}
