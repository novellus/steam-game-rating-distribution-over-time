I have been forced to look into Walkthrough when it comes to ornate safe puzzle, because if I really tried to solve it properly it would take me a year or more - each of the \"colors\" has so many different steps to take properly that you either must be very lucky to solve them or just try till doomsday. It kills fun. \n-I get what the creators had in mind when they allowed us to take care of all 4 characters but it's really frustrating when you click time after time on \"follow me\" multiple times when you want all group to follow you. \n\nIf you're really good at solving hard puzzles then go for it. Or if you want to have fun with really interesting story this game offers us, but you're not scared to look into Walkthrough for time to time. Otherwise it's not for you.","timestamp_created":1607000761,"timestamp_updated":1607000761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qrStlPYCeLz+tgI="}
