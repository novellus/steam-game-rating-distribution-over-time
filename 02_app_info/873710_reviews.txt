[/h1]\n\n There's no way of knowing beforehand which puzzle you're doing, so one has to click at random. Furthermore you can't save the puzzles or your progress once you complete them. The pictures themselves are fine, basic touristy photos of Paris, some are pretty but not particularly interesting or artsy. They look like stock photos. The puzzles themselves vary in length and are a decent way of occupying an hour. You also can't use the Steam screenshot feature in game, so if you want to photo your completed puzzle you'll have to Print Screen. I kind of dig how it looks like an early 2000s webpage, that's quite nostalgic.\n\nI like to wake up early before my girlfriend, when the flat is empty, and I'll drink a cup of coffee, smoke a cigarette and do a jigsaw. It's quite relaxing in that sense. Yet overall, it's a pretty weak game. It might be good for jigsaw beginner's like myself, since it's rather easy. More soothing than difficult.\n\nI got it for 40 pence on sale, so I'm not too bothered. I would NOT recommend it even at its original price of Â£1.69 as even that is too much.","timestamp_created":1606472072,"timestamp_updated":1606473961,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44unThPYCdqWzswI="}
