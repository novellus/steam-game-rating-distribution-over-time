    review: I love this game and look forward to more updates/DLC. The gameplay is
      simple but engaging. Very similar to Slime Rancher but you can advance a bit
      more quickly and this story line is more fun, in my opinion. Have to admit,
      I freaking love making friends with the bankimals and having them follow me
      around :) You can feel a lot of love and thought was put into this game and
      the fact that it's free to play is amazing, because I'd gladly pay for this
      game (and did purchase both DLCs) Well done, devs, can't wait to see more!
