    review: 'YBit is a puzzle platformer taking heavy inspiration from Super Meat
      Boy or VVVVV, with a story that reminds me of Thomas Was Alone. It is well made,
      but has its flaws.


      Pros:

      -Challenging gameplay that mixes things up

      -A story that I would like to see more of

      -XB360 Controller support


      Cons:

      -Incredible difficulty spike at level 28. I can''t get past this.

      -I really don''t like the main theme. It is a grating tune that repeats far
      too quickly and gets old really fast. Fortunately, the music changes later on
      and at least it can be turned off.

      -No windowed support or resolution support, it will launch at your desktop resolution.


      I cannot recommend this at full price, but at a sale price it is worth a try.
      Drop me a note if you can film making it past level 28, I wonder if I am missing
      something obvious.'
