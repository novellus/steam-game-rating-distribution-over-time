    about_the_game: 'In Dungeon Quest, you play as one of three main characters, in
      search of a mysterious artifact. This artifact can grant any wish and each hero
      has a reason for seeking it out. You arrive at the town of Oakdale where you
      begin your journey down. Oakdale has four buildings that each provide something.
      There''s the Inn &amp; Pub where you can rest free of charge or recruit an ally
      to help you on your quest. There''s the Magic Shop where you can buy staves
      or spell scrolls. There''s also the Equipment Shop where you can purchase weapons
      and armor. Finally, there''s the General Store, where you can buy potions and
      other items. In each dungeon floor, you fight through enemies who drop gold
      and XP upon death, and they also have a chance to drop loot! Some enemies are
      picked randomly when you encounter them so you may not face the same enemy every
      time. Some enemies don''t respawn but most do. There are also some mini-bosses
      and regular bosses to fight that will reward the player for taking on the challenge
      of defeating them.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Six Dungeon Levels: Each level
