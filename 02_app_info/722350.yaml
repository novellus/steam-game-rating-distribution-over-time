    review: "A series of short mazes with totally nonthreatening 'weeping angels'\
      \ type enemies. It is very good that they are nonthreatening, because otherwise\
      \ it would probably just be very frustrating. The flashlight simply does not\
      \ work, it puts some distracting/nauseating curves on the ground at your feet\
      \ but does not actually illuminate the environment at all. Very short (<20 minutes).\n\
      \nTerrible performance, never makes 90fps with my 980ti, i7, 16GB RAM. I would\
      \ call out the minimum/recommended specs being totally wrong, but most likely\
      \ simply nothing could actually run this. Also most likely it could be fairly\
      \ easily fixed, if the devs weren't MIA. \n\nThis is one of the few VR games\
      \ to genuinely make me sick, playing it the first time with motion smoothing\
      \ turned on. I had to turn off smoothing and just suffer with the terrible FPS\
      \ to get through it, and there wasn't anything exceptional to make it worth\
      \ the trouble. Do not buy, even at a dollar or less. Do not play if/when it\
      \ goes free, unless they fix it."
