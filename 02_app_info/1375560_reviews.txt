Top down block pusher where you control a square and you push other squares and occasionally circles; barely a step above having no graphics at all.  That being said, the gameplay, the level design and overall mechanics are pretty competent.\n\n160 'Standard' levels and a handful more 'Bonus' levels. Even the 'Simple' levels require some thought and foresight to solving them.  New mechanics and objects are introduced every few levels to keep things fresh, though none of them are particularly unique or groundbreaking.  It's worth a buck or two if you're looking for something like Chip's Challenge with a little more thinking, a little less reflex, and an equal amount of graphical fidelity.","timestamp_created":1607040691,"timestamp_updated":1607040691,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s93FlfYCfICPtwI="}
