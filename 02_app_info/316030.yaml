    review: "-to many bugs\n-cant take screen shots\n+local Co-op\n-local Co-op also\
      \ gets a - because one person controls the tiny screen well the other is stuck\
      \ following them around constantly teleporting back to them every time they\
      \ get stuck. This wasn\u2019t any fun for the other person and I ended up playing\
      \ this game alone.\n+interesting powers and abilities\nmost of the disney games\
      \ on steam are heavily flawed or waterd down, and they cost more here...."
