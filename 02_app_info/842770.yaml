    review: "This very charming oldschool game is a throwback to the era of personal\
      \ computers in the 80s, when playing videogames meant you were some kind of\
      \ masochistic autist. Indeed, Deadfall Tropics is difficult and it's whole offering\
      \ is based on difficulty.\nThe gameplay seems to be an hommage to the old Rick\
      \ Dangerous game of Atari ST/Amiga fame.\nYou will have to restart the same\
      \ jump a dozen times until you perfect it and learn the good combination. Only\
      \ then, can you proceed through the dozen other chokepoints of each level.\n\
      That said it's the good kind of difficulty, the one that you can overcome with\
      \ strategy. The last level will require a bit of perseverance because it becomes\
      \ a tad hectic and the game doesn't save enough progression at this point. But\
      \ even an average, non-hardcore player like myself I managed to complete the\
      \ game, and if you stick to it, you'll constantly amaze yourself by how you\
      \ can exploit the floaty platforming to beat the odds in the most unclean ways.\n\
      The dev managed to reach the sweet spot where you feel rewarded by yourself\
      \ for having overcome the obstacles and at the same time get the narrative reward.\n\
      \nThe old movie theme and the narrative aspect are rewarding enough to make\
      \ you want to always reach the next level and see the story. It's not a literary\
      \ masterpiece, far from it, but it's very pleasant and feel like a little bone\
      \ thrown your way.\nAll the character portraits are ripped of old actors photos\
      \ and the music too evoques some dramatic tension felt in classic movies. The\
      \ whole thing is aesthetically very pleasant.\nThe pixel graphics are very well\
      \ used and perfectly set the mood of the sun setting over a dark jungle. Only\
      \ the text could have used a less pixelled font because it's hard to read sometimes.\n\
      \nI think this game could set a new standard for competitive difficult platformer,\
      \ maybe the dev should think about implementing some sort of global scoreboard\
      \ with a way to know every player's progression.\n\nI can only recomend it,\
      \ but whatever you do, don't press the letter Q !  \n\n\n[h1](follow my curator\
      \ page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33882793/]GenXPlayers[/url]\
      \ for more retro and indie reviews)[/h1]"
