    about_the_game: "The Type 4 Class 50 \u2018Hoovers\u2019 were an express passenger\
      \ locomotive that worked on much of the UK\u2019s railway network, and is now\
      \ available for Train Simulator.<br><br>Fifty of the Class were built in the\
      \ late 1960s by English Electric at Vulcan Foundry Works and were exclusively\
      \ used on the then non-electrified West Coast Main Line between Crewe, Carlisle\
      \ and Scotland. Prior to TOPS classification, the Type 4 locomotives had a top\
      \ speed of 100mph, being re-classified to the Class 50 and purchased from English\
      \ Electric Leasing by British Rail in the early 1970s.<br><br>After electrification\
      \ of the WCML, the Class 50s were displaced and transferred to the Western Region,\
      \ working mainline passenger services from London Paddington along the Great\
      \ Western Main Line. However, the Class was beset with reliability problems\
      \ and BR made the decision to refurbish all 50 locomotives in the late 1970s.\
      \ Whilst this temporarily resolved the reliability issues, by the early 1990s,\
      \ just eight locomotives remained in service.<br><br>By 1994, the whole fleet\
      \ had been withdrawn from service, but 18 were preserved and can today be found\
      \ mainly on the UK\u2019s heritage railways with many still certified for mainline\
      \ running and used to head rail tours.<br><br>The Class 50 for Train Simulator,\
      \ developed by Meshtools, is available in a variety of BR and privatised liveries,\
      \ including BR Blue (TOPS and Pre-TOPS), Great Western Railway Green and BR\
      \ Dual Green, Network South East Blue (original and revised) and BR Large Logo.\
      \ Features of the model include independently operated screen wipers, four position\
      \ reverser, two-tone horn, opening cab windows, operating sun visors and configurable\
      \ locomotive running numbers and names.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick\

    review: "Brilliant pack, very realistic with response times from controls to brakes\
      \ etc. Exhaust effects are also pretty good for its age, and whilst the sounds\
      \ aren't the best, for \xA34.99 you can't really knock it. In short, if you\
      \ have the money and want some fun, get this. If you are after a realistic simulation\
      \ of a class 50, get the new Armstrong Powerhouse class 50 pack- more expensive\
      \ but miles better."
