Using parsec anyone using controller can be in any room or even remote and it works well.\n\nThe game is very fun and reminds me a little of mario party mini games. Would be best to come out with more modes. Great price and fun for what it is now. I recommend you get it for game night.","timestamp_created":1604272761,"timestamp_updated":1604272761,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ivWGw/UCd/bWqwI="}
