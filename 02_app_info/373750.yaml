    about_the_game: 'DinoSystem is a 2D, top-down ecosystem and survival simulation
      that allows players to either manage the ecology of an evolving island (inhabited
      by dinosaurs), or survive in it as a human, dealing with realistic survival

      character''s body adapts over time.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>An emergent, living

      rules, and nothing comes from nothing: will you hunt the last dinosaur of its

    review: Everything in this game can kill you. It's a real challenge to actually
      make it though the first winter. This game makes hunting much more dangerous,
      much more realistic and very rewarding. If you manage to hunt something down
      or even manage to scavenge off a creature killed by something else, then you
      are set for quite a while. The game actually feels like that history channel
      show "Alone" where they send 10 folks out into the wild and see who can survive
      the longest and win that $500k.
