Since its is 2015 release but its is WORSE than zero hour. So what you have the lastest weapon like Russian T14. But the graphic not good. \n\nMax player for ai is only 2. Player VS only 1 AI.  $5 may be a good price for this game.\n\nAfter so many patch, the creator has finally made alots of change. I hope more supply center, more AI, more unit Vetrancy. Getting more & more fun now. I hope the creator can do this change that i have suggested.\n\nBuy too early, this game no really good.","timestamp_created":1455604221,"timestamp_updated":1608724205,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43Onbx/YCdbaGUQ=="}
