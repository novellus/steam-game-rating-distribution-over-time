Also somewhat lacking in mountain-design.  \n \n\nI've been a fan of Snowboard games since the 90's but \"The snowboard game\" is the first one that does the sport justice. The snowboard game excels in core gameplay: the riding. The controls are spot on and with realistic bodymovement. The thumbsticks controls flip and spins sepatately enabling almost full trick-freedom e.g. flips, flatspins, corks, rodeos as well as the speed of the rotation/flip.Those little details reveals the developers apparent love for the game and maybe(?) own experience from riding. Playing the game is fun and relaxing at the same time, you get hooked on giving it just one more try to get perfect run.\n\nThe only minor complain I've got about the riding-mechanics, is the HALFpipe riding.\nStrangely enough, the QUARTERpipe (atleast the QP in the first mountain Viking pass east) has good mechanics. Ive spent hours and hours on the trick course\nfinishing off the run with the quarterpipe at the bottom, doing all kinds of tricks (backside, frontside and alley-ops spins/rodeos/corks. But the first halfpipe in the game (Viking Pass Village) the mechanics are way off, especially the timing of taking off and initiating spins/flips off the lip of the pipe-wall, and often you drift in the pipe and land in the flat bottom of the pipe, even though its more or less against the law of physics. On top of that, the landings feels strange, and doing a regular backside method takes more skill then doing a quad cork.\n\n The Snowboard games biggest flaw (and probably a dealbreaker for some) is the progression system (missions/challenges) to unlock mountains. Some/most are fairly well designed - e.g. \"get 7000 points in a single run down the mountain\". This means you can\ncombine whatever tricks you want. I have nothing against these types of missions/challenges.\n\nWhat I do have a problem with, are nit-picky missions that require you to do combination of certain tricks in one go, e.g. \"Spin 180 Bluntside, Spin 360 Nosegrind\". These typ of missions frustrates me due to the randomness involved. There are very small margins doing railslides, so its more a game of trying over and over again until you accidently get it. What makes matters worse, you have to complete all (in this case both) tricks in the same try to complete the mission. In comparison, the \"regular\" point-based missions (get 7000 point in a run) are extremely easy compared to the nit-picky missions.\n\nThe snowboard games second biggest flaw is the poor mountain design which runs hand in hand with tedious unlocking. The game starts out strong: the first part of the first mountain \"Viking Pass East\" are fun, with both trick courses and free-riding. After grinding and unlocking new parts of the mountain \"Viking Pass Backcountry\" and \"Home\" I almost gave up on the game, due to bad mountain design. Things picked up again with Viking Pass Village and Alaska so I kept on playing.\n\nSadly, efter 75 hours of gameplay, I have not unlocked 2 full mountains, and I have no idea what Im missing out on. I just cant muster the will to grind through the nit-picky missions. I rather just ride and enjoy myself.\n\nI still recommend this game because its made with love, and got the best core gameplay in the genre (except for the halfpipe-riding), that more than compensates for the\nbadly designed progression system.  \n\nThese flawes are easily corrected: change the halfpipe mechanics to the same as quarterpipes mechanics and pretty pretty please, delete those nit-picky missions so I can unlock all mountains. Hopefully the devs gets this right on the upcoming snowboard game \"Shredders\".","timestamp_created":1609357686,"timestamp_updated":1609358636,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvv7P2vYCcJbwvgI="}
