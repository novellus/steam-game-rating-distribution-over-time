    review: "You get to a point with Indigo Prophecy... maybe around the time you\
      \ get to the cutscene where main character is attacked by possessed house furniture\
      \ and he does knock-off The Matrix action moves to dodge the flying chairs and\
      \ vases, and it goes on for three minutes, and you have to play Simon Says QTEs\
      \ the whole time... where you think \"Wow, that was fucking awful.\"\n\nThen\
      \ you realise like 50% of the game is just more of that. \n\nI respect Quantic\
      \ Dream for their effort towards making a more cinematic adventure game. Sometimes,\
      \ it succeeds. You can feel the spark. For just a minute at a time, you will\
      \ care about how your performance affects the other characters. You will get\
      \ drawn into some moody location and feel curious and tense and immersed.  The\
      \ game and the film come together to make something new.\n\nUnfortunately, both\
      \ the game and the film are awful, so these moments are rare.\n\nI won't go\
      \ too much into either (like how on the game side there are constant annoying\
      \ QTE and dialogue options are indecipherably vague, or how on the story side\
      \ the dialogue is stilted and the plot goes into totally off-the-rails nonsense\
      \ in the last third), but there is one particular thing that offended me, that\
      \ made me want to write a review, which is how badly used the characters of\
      \ Carla and Tyler are by the end. \n\nThe further the game delves into the supernatural,\
      \ the less relevant two police officer characters are going to become. And it\
      \ is clear the writers had totally no idea how to handle this: instead of coming\
      \ up with some new way that Carla and Tyler can contribute to the plot, they\
      \ basically get dropped entirely. \n\nTyler literally vanishes suddenly from\
      \ the story, whereas Carla just gets shoved disrespectfully into the role of\
      \ Lucas's love-interest with no build-up, and does nothing further of note.\
      \ I'm not sure which is worse, especially considering Lucas is literally a walking\
      \ corpse at that point.\n\nI can't exaggerate just what a massive fail this\
      \ is for the story. We've spent just as much time getting to know these two\
      \ as we have with Lucas, and they are both more interesting than Lucas! When\
      \ the game decides \"Actually, these two aren't relevant\", it's not only a\
      \ waste of two good characters \u2014 and of all the considerable mocap and\
      \ voice acting and money that went into creating them \u2014 it's a waste of\
      \ your time."
