    about_the_game: 'Operate a mining rover in outer space.<br>Your domain is vast:
      each and every rock orbiting the planet can be mined, anywhere.<br><br>This

      planetoid, roughly a billion cubic feet of rock, and you can start prospecting
      where ever you want. You can even tunnel from one end to the other end of the
      planetoid, if you so desire.<h2 class="bb_tag">Procedural</h2>The planet''s
      ring is procedurally generated, with every orbiting rock unique. There is no
      telling what you will find. Hidden cavities, twisted terrains, rich veins of
      ore, it is all out there, floating in space.<br><br>The rocks are generated
      from a 64 bit seed, giving a total of 18 billion billion different rocks. That
      is an 18 with 18 zeros behind it.<h2 class="bb_tag">Rover</h2><br>The little
      mining rover has six wheels and can climb pretty much any terrain. Just try
      to keep it upright.<br><br>The rover is equipped with a laser turret to blast
      the terrain. Dig holes, create tunnels, find ore veins, so that you can collect
      those precious off-world minerals.<h2 class="bb_tag">Transport</h2><br>To hop
      from planetoid to planetoid, load your rover in the transport ship, and take
      control of the space flight. Find a good landing spot, so that your rover can

    review: Another great lil simulation game from Stolk! The physics are robust and
      the interface is intuitive. Driving around and digging through asteroids feels
      good, but at the moment this is mostly just a sandbox to play around in. I'm
      hoping more missions and things to DO will be added in the future, but even
      in its current form it's a good chill-out game for messing around in while listening
      to some music or a podcast.
