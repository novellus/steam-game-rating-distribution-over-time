Take over is a beatem up with puzzles. Not bad, but nothing new. There is a story attached and it's not bad. I like that Disney brought back some old characters and it is the easiest way to get blue sparks that are how you buy things for the Toy Box. One 30-40min play through/grind and I have 10k sparks.\n Speedway is where it's at. This is fun, the tracks are big, and the gameplay is like Cars 2 for the 360/PS3/Wii/ and a horrible PC version. So it is very fun. Most of the tracks could have used more detail, and the demo track is no where in the game. They also could have used more tracks. As if Radiator Springs wasn't  made for this. So they really should add to this, beacuse outside of the Toy Box it is the best part of the game in my option. The Candy Crush Speedway is one of if not my favorite track of any cart racer. So if you are invested in 3.0 you should pick this up.","timestamp_created":1448852331,"timestamp_updated":1448852331,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563318789005279541","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4n4OVq9ECfZD3SQ=="}
