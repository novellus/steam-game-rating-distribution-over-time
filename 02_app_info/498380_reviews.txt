The game is good nonetheless, it has a lot of weapons but is hard to remember what letter does what (what I don't like, and there is no web page with info either).\n\nI give it a 7.5 / 10.","timestamp_created":1562205824,"timestamp_updated":1562205824,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1562374374,"developer_response":"Thank you for the review and the criticism. Power-up descriptions when you get them will be added as you're not the first person to mention it. More effort will be put into the presentation. we've gotten better over the past three years at the presentation part to add more dazzle to the pixel art."}],"cursor":"AoJwwKSu3esCeYr0ywE="}
