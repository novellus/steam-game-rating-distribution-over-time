    review: "It has been said that first impressions are very important.  I bought\
      \ Super Crush KO because it made a great one, and in fact, it does so (almost)\
      \ all across the board.  Before even playing the game, promotional materials\
      \ demonstrate a cute heroine, an endearing plot about rescuing her cat, and\
      \ a surreal, saccharine, Lisa Frank-lite visual style that's so unusual for\
      \ action games that it alone might make the game stand out from the crowd. \
      \ Much of that initial impression continued as I began to play, as the game's\
      \ base mechanics are rock-solid.  As it went on, however, Super Crush KO also\
      \ demonstrated that first impressions aren't everything.  So while I'm giving\
      \ this game a thumb up, that's only because this quick binary rating is required\
      \ in reviews; read on to determine whether Super Crush KO is for you.\n\nAfter\
      \ an introductory cutscene revealing about as little plot as you'd expect of\
      \ a sidescroller about rescuing someone, the game eases you into Karen's many\
      \ moves; some of which you won't have immediately, but you still get them all\
      \ pretty early on.  She can punch enemies, for a combo of up to four hits, which\
      \ is simple but pretty effective since it's not limited by a meter, she can\
      \ shoot enemies with an assault rifle, which has limitless ammo but also a cooldown\
      \ period after shooting for a while, she has several more powerful melee attacks\
      \ that also thrust her in directions (one of which is essentially a Smash Bros\
      \ recovery move), which share an energy meter that gradually recharges, and\
      \ finally, by collecting gems she can charge up another meter that, when full,\
      \ lets her do a super beam attack.  Outside of offense, she can also double-jump\
      \ and do a dash that also negates damage for its duration. Getting familiar\
      \ with Karen's abilities, stringing them together and quickly deciding which\
      \ to use when and where, all make for a game that is constantly involving, intense,\
      \ and to many gamers, likely fun. Don't let it's cutesy, stereotypical effeminate\
      \ veneer fool you; this game is really tough. But Karen is really tough, too,\
      \ so it never really feels unfair.  She has what it takes; it's just left up\
      \ to players to master it, and once they do, they'll likely get an exciting\
      \ feeling that they actually ARE Karen, smashing up robots in style.\n\nThe\
      \ one immediately unsatisfying part of the game is the soundtrack. This is the\
      \ latest game in a trend I despise, begun by Super Mario World three decades\
      \ ago and repeated by too many Mario games since; reusing the same motif for\
      \ every or almost every song in the game, but worse, that motif is just too\
      \ depressing, slow, and understated here. It's not ugly music, nor even inappropriate\
      \ for the theme, but I still expected to be listening to more cheerful, energizing\
      \ music based on the graphics.\n\nStill, that's a pretty minor (in this case\
      \ literally) part of the game, so why all the reservations about it? Because\
      \ although it charmed at the outset, it clearly dawned that there wasn't much\
      \ more to it than what I saw then, and being so one-note made even the things\
      \ I loved at first seem like a burden. Those sugary visuals that initially impress\
      \ with their uniqueness soon lose that luster given that none of the levels\
      \ deviate a lot in design; you'll always be looking at some variation of the\
      \ oddly-colored city, and the colors don't change much. The plot, cute at first,\
      \ starts to show its stupidity more each time new dialogue is devoted to telling\
      \ its thin tale of cat rescue--and there isn't a lot of dialogue, but almost\
      \ none of what's here is particularly good. I maybe laughed once. The game doesn't\
      \ give you any insight into who Karen is beyond someone going off to rescue\
      \ her cat, nor who Ann is besides the alien who kidnapped said cat. \n\nThat\
      \ might not have mattered if gameplay made up for it, but even it can wear a\
      \ bit thin. It never feels mindless since the game is always changing up the\
      \ terrain layout, placement and combination of enemies, etc, but the entire\
      \ experience is still just invisible walls trapping you with enemies, letting\
      \ you move forward slightly when you clear them, and then repeating that process\
      \ until the level ends rather arbitrarily, since every following level, save\
      \ for bosses, is the same thing.  There are no \"breathers\". I don't mind that\
      \ the game is challenging, but it only ever really has one type of challenge,\
      \ and more could have fit in without feeling forced. For example, Karen can\
      \ double-jump, as well as using one of her special attacks as a third jump,\
      \ and her dash temporarily halts vertical movement, but there's almost no platforming\
      \ here.  Why not? Why not give at least a few segments when the level isn't\
      \ locked down, so it would be possible to explore and take in the sights? Granted;\
      \ that would require them to add some sights, but still, it would improve the\
      \ game.\n\nSuper Crush KO only has four sets of levels, but even with that short\
      \ length, I'd grown weary of it. The main reason I'm giving it a positive review\
      \ is that this game feels like the foundation of something great. I wouldn't\
      \ mind seeing more of Karen, her cat, and their weird pastel world, and trying\
      \ out her moves against more than just the same few models of robots would be\
      \ worth a return. Despite only a few things being in this game, it deserves\
      \ a good review simply because most of those few things are positive. \n\nBut\
      \ that doesn't mean it deserves an unqualified recommendation. If you're the\
      \ sort who enjoys exciting fights, rest assured this game will deliver many.\
      \ But if you're the sort who gets bored of anything when it repeats too much,\
      \ beware that this game also does that.\n\nOh, and frankly, I've seen cuter\
      \ cats."
