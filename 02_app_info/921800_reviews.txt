Save your money for that.\n\n04/16/2020 - The developer Stormtrooper has informed me that they will not make the stated 9 months but insures me and I quote, \"But we are sure that the game will be released in full release this year (2020)\"\n\n01/07/2021 - Called it.  The game did not release in 2020 like Stormtrooper (A Dev for the game) promised and no reason other than stuff happened was given.  This put the development time in the 3 to 4 year time frame I originally quoted.  The major issue here is that Stormtrooper is attacking people, who has already purchased the game or who wants to purchase the game, on the steam forum for asking legitimate questions.  At this time I think it is fair to question the honesty of the Devs when it comes to the information they put out about the state of the game.  \n\n[b]I DO NOT RECOMMEND SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPERS OR THE PURCHASE OF THIS GAME[/b]","timestamp_created":1570667379,"timestamp_updated":1610086792,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.413987278938293457","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1570704618,"developer_response":"Hi there.
