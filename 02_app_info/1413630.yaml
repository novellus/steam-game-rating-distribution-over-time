    about_the_game: Woodland Saga is a turn-based versus (online) strategy game.<br><br>In
      Woodland Saga you lead an army of woodland critters against an AI or against
      another player. Your goal is to either destroy your opponent's base camp or
      capture 3 different magical shrines.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1413630/extras/woodland_final.gif?t=1600252289"
      /><br><br>During your turn you can either play an army card from your hand which
      places a group unit onto the board, or you can assign a new command to a group
      unit that is already on the board.<br><br>Knowing when and where to place units
      and when and where to move them to will be key in winning the game as different
      biomes, height difference, towns and other components will make a meaningful
      impact on your decisions.<br><br><strong>Features</strong><br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>online
