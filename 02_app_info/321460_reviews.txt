Tried to fish at two spots, both were buggy and very irritating. First, I was stuck between the rods so couldn't move at all. The second i could walk fine however at no position could I cast. Tried for a while and just got frustrated. Wouldn't recommend Foundry Dock.","timestamp_created":1516554914,"timestamp_updated":1516554914,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.591849982738494873","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjfHtjOECeuvelgE="}
