      \ with simple mazes and some items for collection. It\u2019s a laid back excursion\
      \ into the serene and dreamlike environment where you are Sarah, a little girl\
      \ in search of all the pages to her book. She must collect all the pages on\
      \ each level to advance to the next. There are optional items to collect, including\
      \ outfits. If Sarah is lost and needs a little help, she can gather a few crystals\
      \ strewn about the level to activate the compass. It will point her to the next\
      \ objective. There are no monsters or brain teasing puzzles in this game."

    review: "In each chapter you have to  find  diary pages, you can find a garment\
      \ and a special object in each chapter. Blue compass shards help you to find\
      \ the way to all things. Game saves after each chapter. Sweet calming game,\
      \ relax and walk \u2665"
