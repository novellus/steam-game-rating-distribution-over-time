It's actually really good. The 'mixed' review score you see is primarily because, when this expansion was released, vast changes to Stellaris's gameplay were added.\n\nSee, pre-Apocalypse (or, pre-2.0 update) borders, fleet composition, resource management--quite a lot of things--were entirely different. Apocalypse formalized Stellaris as a more hard-coded strategy game where proper planning, management, and skill is necessary (whereas previously you could pool all of your minerals into building one huge ass fleet to steamroll anything in your path).\n\nApocalypse, aside from the change it brought with the corresponding 2.0 update, adds a new ship class: the Titan, with the borderline game-breaking Colossus which is overkill, but extremely well executed. I don't care if its overpowered or underpowered or expensive or cheap--having multiple planet-killing weapons (or even planet-sterilizing weapons, which is an option) is just flatly cool.\n\nAdditionally, the Unity ambitions allow for Unity (a resource that eventually becomes useless once all tradition trees have been gone through) to be useful in the late game.\n\nApocalypse isn't my favorite expansion, but it certainly isn't bad.","timestamp_created":1609564891,"timestamp_updated":1609564891,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.444444417953491211","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49+Ti4PYCdPjPvwI="}
