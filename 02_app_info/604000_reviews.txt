They are completely different experiences yet they are the kind of indie horror games that have stuck with me longer than a lot of other similar but less...otherworldly (grasping for the right word) projects have done.  \n\nIn this one you play a man looking for his missing friend.  You've tracked his whereabouts to a strange and seemingly abandoned hotel and end up getting sucked through a rabbithole of a cult ritual and its crazed babbling leader, demons, deadly traps, puzzles and much more.  It's not just a walking sim as you can die and probably will a few times trying to solve a few of the game's strange riddles to progress.  The further you dig the stranger chambers you'll uncover in the deep recesses of the hotel and well...it just gets weirder from there.  \n\nIt's not a graphical heavyweight but it's somewhat grainy and not overly detailed visuals lend an odd charm to the transition between the normal urban dwelling that you start out in and the cult's bunkered stronghold.  You'll find notes, hunt for keys, avoid traps and a small handful of enemies and even find yourself in an over the top boss fight of sorts.  I jumped more than expected playing this one in the very, very late hours with good, noise-cancelling headphones on.  You'll definitely get the most mileage out of Like Clay taking on its challenges in the dead of night while either alone or being the sole occupant still awake in your house.  \n\nThe fact that this is more of an actual video game with challenges and ways that you can fail also ups the stakes and will keep you on your toes more than a cut n' dried walking sim.  Additionally, a few of the oddball puzzles more than hit their mark and can end you if you you're not on your mental game in figuring out the rules to succeed.  It's not a hardcore experience but it requires more thought than simply, \"Run over here.  Hide in this locker.  Monster gone.  Door code on paper where monster was near.  Type code into wall panel.  Progress.\"  \n\nThis is a twisted, hallucinogen-blasted ride for sure.  Don't expect triple A production values, the tightest of the tight controls or a perfect experience (though the sound design is truly freaky and one of its strongest points).  Heck, what is perfect?  Yet Like Clay's inventiveness, fluctuation in puzzle solutions, malevolent threats and strange story really create an atmosphere that is completely its own whether you like it or not (Horns of Fear is another good one to check out if you want a completely different horror experience as well).  \n\nThough I'm not wild about this one's ending, I still find myself thinking about the overall experience from time to time with the resolution that I'm glad I picked it up and gave it a shot.  It's cheap as hell too, so what can go wrong if you don't like it?","timestamp_created":1607987231,"timestamp_updated":1607987231,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kb/gsfYCeqqgugI="}
