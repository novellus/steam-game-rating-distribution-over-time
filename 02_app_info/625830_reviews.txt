The game mechanism is fun and there are 3 characters with unique abilities. I'm OK with its graphics but its UI and game balance definitely needs more love from Dev. The monster in PvE mode is distributed like test target, and no balance patch based on player feedback. When it comes to VR multiplayer game, you want to buy a game with active developer and constant update, because the user feedback will keep it on the right track.","timestamp_created":1589162400,"timestamp_updated":1589162400,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwkLvdgPICd/76hgI="}
