It adds a new kingdom sim mechanic to the story line  that shows up in the Great Tournament games, but it is expanded on in this game. the story still has the same charm as his other games and the quality of the writing drives you to make some difficult decisions which does a good job immersing you into the story. It does lack the deep character development like his other Great Tournament games. Definitely worth the price if you're a big fan of the series. I would recommend.","timestamp_created":1595123557,"timestamp_updated":1595123557,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qLyxsvMCeN6XlgI="}
