    review: "Since purchasing this game almost two years ago I've spent over three\
      \ hours trying to remove the broken blade from the  side wall of the deep valley.,\
      \ so haven't even got into the cave system.  That three hours encompasses  countless\
      \  attempts, each one ending in frustration after perhaps 5 to 10  minutes each\
      \ time I've tried over the intervening years.    There are \xA30.79 games far\
      \ better than this monstrosity."
