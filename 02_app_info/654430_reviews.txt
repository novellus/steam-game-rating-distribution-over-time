Then suddenly the gameplay completely changes and it becomes pure arcade. Kind of like Trailblazer (1986, Gremlin Graphics) on steroids. You can actually see 3 seconds of it in the trailer, at 0:41.\nYou'll need excellent eyes to pass that. I don't have them. The game is utterly ruined for me. Of course, I feel cheated, buying a stealth/puzzle title and getting a race/obstacle course.\n\nI love the presentation though. Everything about it is excellent.\n\nDon't try this unless you've got grandchildren around whom you can coerce into passing the garbage sections for you while you play the fun ones.","timestamp_created":1594571961,"timestamp_updated":1594571961,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.535175859928131104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qqb5ofMCcYHslAI="}
