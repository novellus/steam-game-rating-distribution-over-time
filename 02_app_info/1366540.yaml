      \ are a space engineer in charge of a project launched by the space alliance\
      \ COSMO, tasked with a massive undertaking: constructing Dyson Spheres (a megastructure\
      \ that would orbit around a star, harnessing all its power and energy) to produce\
      \ the energy that humanity needs. Only a few decades ago, Dyson Spheres were\
      \ considered a hypothetical, impossible invention \u2013 but now it\u2019s in\

      \ /><br><br>Every playthrough will be unique: your universe will be procedurally\
      \ generated every time you start a new game. There will be different types and\
      \ distribution of stars, planets and resources. Will you manage to thrive and\
      \ build your Spheres, no matter what the universe throws at you?<br> <br><img\

      \ /><br>As a space engineer, you are expected to design your interstellar factory\
      \ and production lines, not to micromanage every small package going back and\

      \ interstellar transport teams that gather resources and bring them to where\
