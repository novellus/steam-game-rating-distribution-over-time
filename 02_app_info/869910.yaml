    review: "Amaze Bowl is a surprisingly nice bowling simulator. It goes beyond just\
      \ simulating the game itself, it goes beyond by adding a lobby and various maps\
      \ that spice the game up. Even the lobby is quite creative, I liked the for\
      \ example the small detail that you start up a map by throwing a dedicated bowl\
      \ for said maps into pins. Of course, this doesn\u2019t feel *exactly* like\
      \ an irl bowling, as there is (unsurprisingly) no weight in the balls you\u2019\
      re throwing, so you\u2019ll need to get used to how throw \u201Cweightless\u201D\
      \ balls, but once you get the gist of it it\u2019s a fun game.\n\nThe maps themselves\
      \ are quite nicely done - there\u2019s a jungle one where you can hit snakes\
      \ and spires that decided to stroll through the bowling lane uninvited and you\
      \ even get extra points for doing so. There\u2019s a sky jump map where you\
      \ can just relax and watch how your ball picks up extra snow and bulks up as\
      \ it rolls down the hill. There\u2019s an abandoned factory one which has a\
      \ changing environment that goes from day to night as you progress through your\
      \ game and has a horror atmosphere better than some dedicated horror vr games\
      \ I\u2019ve played. And my personal favourite, the creepy carnival map that\
      \ even has some bonus interactions as you can have a ride on a ferris wheel\
      \ or a carousel. Those maps are also surprisingly detailed, as their area is\
      \ far beyond what would be needed just for the bowling lane. This is true especially\
      \ for the jungle map where most of the map isn\u2019t even visible unless you\
      \ decide to take a walk behind the bowling lane. I commend this effort. Well,\
      \ as you might have noticed this is a bit more gimmicky bowling, so if you\u2019\
      re looking only for a serious, regular simulation of this sport this game might\
      \ not be for you.\n\nThat said, there are two main downsides. First \u2013 the\
      \ game takes way too long to load with no justifiable reason. This is the worst\
      \ for starting up the game and for starting up the first map, it\u2019s the\
      \ loading is much better for subsequent map changing. It\u2019s even worse for\
      \ the first map loading as there isn\u2019t even any loading indicator there,\
      \ so you\u2019re just kind of sitting there with no indication on how more time\
      \ it will take hoping the game didn\u2019t just crash and is in fact still loading\
      \ (as a note Amaze Bowl did not crash even once for me, but it sure felt like\
      \ it could). Second, the game seems to be abandoned and further development\
      \ or even leaving the early access mode should not be expected. There is an\
      \ item shop in the main lobby that says \u201Ccoming soon in 2018\u201D, which\
      \ as you might guess by the date of this review did not happen. The game is\
      \ playable without a problem in its current stay though, so it\u2019s not that\
      \ bad (I can\u2019t confirm that about the multiplayer mode which I haven\u2019\
      t tried).\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a nice game and for such a low price it\u2019\
      s certainly worth it. 6.7/10\n\n\n"
