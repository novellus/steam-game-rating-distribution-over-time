(VRChat, Beat Saber, mostly all SteamVR titles, etc.)<br><\/li><li> Desktop window viewing: Allows you to select a desktop window and display it above your hand, or pin it in the world around you.<br><\/li><li> Multiple desktop windows: Create multiple different windows and place them in the world around you.<br><\/li><li> Attach windows to tracked devices: You can make windows move around with either your left or right controllers, headset, or have them stationary in the world.<br><\/li><li> Curved overlays: Improves readability of large windows in VR by wrapping them around you by a configurable amount? Now you can! (Or you can make the window into a wall by curving it to the max, I don't judge!)<br><\/li><li> Window re-centering: Optionally enable window re-centering, this will make window's re-appear in front of you when you open Edit Mode. This is useful to easily pull windows to you so you can use them.<br><\/li><li> Quick selection of desktop windows: OVR Toolkit contains a configuration 'hotkey' menu that allows you to bind buttons on its UI to switch between specific windows in one click.<br><\/li><li> Intuitive desktop input: Scroll up and down on windows by dragging, make a selection by dragging, like using your finger on a phone but with a VR controller instead! (This makes a lot more sense than it sounds like it does!)<br><\/li><li> Wristwatch: An overlay displayed on your hand that displays the time, date, as well as Vive\/Index controller\/Tracker battery percentages, as well as other values such as Vive Wireless temperatures.<br><\/li><li> Saving\/Loading configurations: Like that sweet setup you've made? Well, now you can save it, and load it again next time you launch!<br><\/li><li> Advanced settings for window capture: Want that 60 FPS window capture experience? Want to make a window slightly transparent so it's less in the way? Want a window to disappear when you're not looking at it? Or when it's past a set distance from you? You can do these with our advanced settings!<br><\/li><li> Eco Mode: When enabled, performance mode will lower the capture rate of windows you are not using, this drastically increases performance and lowers CPU usage significantly!<br><\/li><li> Basic media controls: Spotify currently playing song will show on your wrist, along with a play\/pause, skip, and previous button.

All keyboard layouts are community made within Unity and documentation is provided so you can do this yourself. (Want the keys to spell out funny things like you're in high school again?
