It is a completely new experience. Otherwise, wait for a discount, because you won't last long,\n\nHave you ever tried to understand 4-th dimension? Knossos is a game that beat all the 2-D thiniking of you. Basically, it is a game where you can create 3-dimensional maze with 3 axises: 2x2x2, for example, will make you 8 rooms cube with max of 7 steps to the exit. In 5x5x5 version you should get from (1;1;1) to (5;5;5) (125 rooms total). \nWhen you replicate your 3-D cube and point rooms that have kinda portals that connect the same places in different cubes, for example, (2;1;2)[1] and (2;1;2)[2]. Which means you've just added fourth axis to your maze. You can see markers for that portals from a distance, so your goal now is to find exact portal in [n-1] cube, that bring you to correct isolated 3-d net of rooms in the [n] cube that have an exit in it.\nIf that story amazed you more than scared, this game is for you.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n[b]+[/b] Good basic 3-d maze creator\n[b]+[/b] Challenging difficulty \n[b]+[/b] Rich variety of settings\n[b]+[/b] System of clues\n[b]+[/b] Bach's music\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[b]-[/b] Terrible controls with no gravity (so if you are not accurate with axises, you will get lost in 3 dimensions)\n[b]-[/b] Bad sound of walking\n[b]-[/b] Brain-pain","timestamp_created":1559124836,"timestamp_updated":1559124836,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6p/FgesCeZqiwgE="}
