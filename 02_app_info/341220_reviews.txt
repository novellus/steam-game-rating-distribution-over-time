You get a few models from the game, such as humans or elves, and build your new monster around them. Many models, such as dragons and demons, aren't available. You can't import JPGs as creatures. Even though I liked the base game, this probably should've been released as a free update rather than separate premium content.","timestamp_created":1457406970,"timestamp_updated":1457406970,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.38721543550491333","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwibGOqtMCetLiUg=="}
