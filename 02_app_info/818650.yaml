    review: "I like this game. \nPros:\nAtmosphere, graphics, also music and sounds\
      \ fits well into this dreamy world. \nI love those cogs, various wheels, light\
      \ / darkness contrast, even catching light seeds - not quite easy at moments.\n\
      Obstacles in game are well tuned - not trivial, nor too hard to stuck for longer\
      \ time with any of them. \nPhysics is great, too, perhaps credits goes to Unity\
      \ for this one.\nScene names are poetic as well - those girl names in particular.\n\
      Level 2 \"buddy in the module\" is a nice refresher to the story. \nCons:\n\
      It takes some time to get used to the entire thing - controls, shop - it took\
      \ like first hour of gameplay for me to understand some concepts (like up /\
      \ down movements are actually speedup / slowdown, quests, shop items - what\
      \ are those items good for, etc). But i quite like puzzles and uncertain things,\
      \ so not a big deal..\nGame freezes from time to time for couple of seconds\
      \ - maybe my comp is slow ?\nAnd soon I will finish the game, and thats not\
      \ good at all ;)"
