    review: 'A decent solitaire game with an Egyptian theme.


      You complete a set, move on to the next. There are a lot of them.


      You earn money for power ups and scarabs to build your city (which is pretty
      basic) by going through the cards in each set.

      You can set a 10 sec timer on a card to add challenge.


      Simple, but enjoyable.
