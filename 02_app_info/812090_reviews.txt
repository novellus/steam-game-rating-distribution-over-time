Armed only with your trusty vidja camera, you plunge into some mysterious backwoods in an alternate dimension where it takes mere minutes to pass through all the lighting cycles of a day and night, in search of the creature and the corpses it has discarded in its wake.\n\n   Unfortunately, as anyone who's ever wasted tens of hours of their life sifting through YouTube videos looking for convincing evidence of strange phenomena knows, this is an era in which every duckhead and his dog can fake such footage with cheap CGI and/or shoddy make-up effects, invariably aided by a shaky camera and dubiously dodgy focus. So in order to present irrefutable proof of the monster's existence, you must attain [i]minutes[/i] of footage of it charging towards you before anyone will believe you. \n\n   Cheap criticisms of the \"plot\" aside, it's actually a pretty decent premise for a game, and there's no denying how suspenseful it is when you first jump in. For myself at least, it was quite some time before I encountered the creature - first as a sound, then spotted only from a distance - at which point it sensed me filming it and promptly gave chase. I valiantly maintained my cool and kept backing up and filming until it almost reached me, then wisely turned tail and fled and somehow lost it. I then hit \"TAB\" to check how much footage I had grabbed...and was flabbergasted to find that I had, like, less than 10% of the footage required to beat the level. \n\n   Undaunted, I resumed looking for Mr Monster, and when I couldn't find him, decided to try whistling multiple times to attract his attention. He didn't bite (literally or figuratively). I eventually just stumbled onto him again - he appearing out of absolutely nowhere and without a sound this time - and I had by this stage decided to try and \"stun\" him with bullets from the gun I'd found, as instructed by the game's early tutorial. Seems I may have shot him [i]too[/i] many times, though, 'cause while he did keel over momentarily, he also decided to launch up into the air and hide himself before I could pull out my camera and get even a single second of further footage. Back to the drawing board.\n\n   Third time, I decided to stand on a small island in the centre of a shallow pond, thinking maybe this was a tactically smart move: perhaps the monster didn't like water or something. Nope. Following my firing of a single bullet to attract his attention, he charged unerringly at me once more and managed to wound me rather badly. I did manage to get away and mostly heal myself with a medkit I'd found - and even managed to successfully lure him another time and get a smidgen more footage - but it wasn't long after [i]that[/i] that he found me unawares again and unceremoniously snuffed my silly butt. Game over, no save or anything. But hey: at least I got six out of eight Achievements and found all five out of five dead bodies, even if I didn't grab as much as 20% of the required footage. \n\n   Look, I appreciate that this game needed to make itself at least slightly challenging; and given that it only has three maps, and the one that I played wasn't all that large, I guess the devs didn't have much choice but to make the amount of footage required insufferably high. But honestly, after less than an hour's play, I feel like I've seen most of what the game has to offer, and can't say I feel compelled to see even this map - much less the others, one of which appears to require [i]twice[/i] as much footage (!) - through to the bitter end.\n\n   If you, on the other hand, are the kind of person who loves the challenge of rinse-repeat-rinse-repeat/don't-feck-up-once-or-it's-back-to-the-beginning gameplay, then I can most certainly recommend this game, though possibly not at the full retail price of ten bucks USD. It's certainly not bad as recent indie horror games go, and will probably appeal to those with time and patience to burn. Me? I tend to lose interest in a game as soon as I: a. expect no further surprises from it, and b. deduce that I probably won't conquer it any time soon anyway. Like I said: six out of eight \"cheevos\" ain't bad, and I can probably guess what the other two are for, but don't much feel like spending several more hours of my life attaining them.\n\n   I certainly won't diss the developers for what is, all things considered, a pretty decent first release. I'm interested to see what they do next, and y'know...maybe I'll even return to this particular product at some point when I'm feeling more Saintly in the patience department. For now, though, my curiosity has been sated.\n\n   Verdict: 7/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1534757001,"timestamp_updated":1591175130,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.624991297721862793","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwubXbvPICcaTwqAE="}
