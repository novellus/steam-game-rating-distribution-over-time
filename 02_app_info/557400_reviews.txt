It's the first thing you think of when you hear MIDAS. Well Midas Gold Plus is just that, making gold by touching ''whatever'' with your blessed hands from the gods. Everything you touch turns to gold, so start making an awesome civilization and get rich and powerful?  I think that was the plan in the original myth, but he dies or worse like any Greek tragedy... Anywho, here you do click rocks to make gold and start leveling up a little village set up, to become a major powerful kingdom. A clicker/idle game- its just profiting and reaching high gold production rates with your villages sawmill, ranger guild, barracks and such. More gold unlocks more stuff. Rinse by restarting to get more powerful and repeat. Now, this isn't just an AdVenture Capitalist where its just making money...this is where the Plus comes in. Raids, Knowledge books, Diamonds, Blue rocks, Red gems, Relics and Champions are all things you use this gold to upgrade and buy and unlock to further more earn gold and make your kingdom awesome. Whew, That's a lot of stuff huh? Well yes, but it makes the game have more micro organizing and micro managing, thus more fun. Raids and Relics and Diamonds and ALL THOSE things basically without nit picking what each does and its rewards, is just to buff or increase production to make you gold. In some way. Clicking still works on the rocks...lol. Names of champions and places to raid and such seem to all come from some form of mythology. Major Mythos, I haven't seen anything form like Celtic or Mayan, but yes Greek and Norse mythology names are thrown around a lot here. It is King Midas... SO for the inner dragon/dwarf gambler that loves gold and loves using multiple managing ways to make more gold and gold, then yes, this is your idle/clicker game.GOLD! not pyrite.","timestamp_created":1486582007,"timestamp_updated":1602895591,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.558310389518737793","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45baBmvUCdezQcQ=="}
