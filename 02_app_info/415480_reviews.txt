Its genuinely funny, there's tons of references to famous series as well as niche ones - such as [u]Opoona[/u], a Wii Exclusive realtime JRPG with motion-controlled proctile-slinging combat. That alone is probably why I am such a fan of HN:GBH. Nothing makes an RPG more worthwhile than its characters and narrative - the former of which being where the Neptunia franchise consistently succeeds at.\n\nRegarding the DLC Characters, each Character comes w/ an Easy 2-Part Mission that, upon completion, will reward you with a New Party Member and 10,000 Credits. Compa and IF are above-average whereas Sting's AoE Buff is extremely useful. Tiara, however, doubles as a CPU since she has access to HDD, can deal immense damage, and comes w/ Heal 75%. Tiara is irrefutably the best choice though HN:GBH is fair enough to prevent you from relying on her.\n\n┌ [b]DLC Characters[/b]\n┤ ► [u]Compa[/u] ( Balanced Defensive )\n┤ Abilities : Null Poison , Magic Defense Lv2\n┤ Leader Effect : SP x1.5 , HP x1.2\n┤ Notable Skill : Heal 30% for Up to 5 Allies in Cross Formation\n┤ Special Skill : Pow:208 + Sleep 30% for Up to 12 Enemies in Area Formation\n└  ► [u]IF[/u] ( Balanced Offensive )\n┤ Abilities : Null Reaper , Enemy Slash Resist Down Lv2\n┤ Leader Effect : KO 20% , Physical Resist Lv2\n┤ Notable Skill : N/A\n┤ Special Skill : Pow:227 + KO 15% for Up to 5 Enemies in Cross Formation\n└  ► [u]Sting[/u] ( Support )\n┤ Abilities : Null Stat Drops , Credits Gained Up Lv2\n┤ Leader Effect : STR +30% , Enemy Slash Resist Down Lv5\n┤ Notable Skill : STR & VIT +20% for Up to 5 Allies in Cross Formation\n┤ Special Skill : Pow:243 + STR & INT -20% for Up to 9 Foes in Cross Formation\n└  ► [u]Tiara[/u] ( JMP 3 , Has HDD w/o Float , All-Rounder )\n┤ Abilities : SP Use in HDD -20% , Magic Defense Lv2\n┤ Leader Effect : Ice Defense Lv5 , Null Virus\n┤ Notable Skill : Heal 75% for 1 Ally up to 4 Units away\n┤ Special Skill : Pow:325 , AFF:IceLv5\n└ \"That [u]Fairy Fencer F[/u] girl is OP ! \"","timestamp_created":1609805903,"timestamp_updated":1609947384,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjPGV7PYCfePGwAI="}
