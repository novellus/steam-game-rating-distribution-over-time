His words are here and he provides his own damning insights on Silver Cow's nefarious business practices.\nhttps://www.deviantart.com/mysteryguy9215/journal/Hey-Silver-Cow-855450980 ]\n\nI'm a woman who writes erotica. I'm asexual, but sex-positive. As someone who played and loved the original, this is my take.\n\nI believe that sexuality is beautiful. Sex can be cute, kinks can be great for story elements. Breast expansion is a rare fetish that I feel needs more positive portrayal. The original Time Tenshi was this. It had a great story that flaunted its sexuality while still being a good tale to follow.\n\nI don't know why Silver Cow felt the need to remove the heart from their game. Perhaps they were misguided in believing the sexual elements were holding them back... Perhaps they didn't like them in the first place and they were only added for a reason out of their control. Perhaps they felt they wanted to be more respected as game makers who didn't make sexy games. Either way, I feel they were misguided.\n\nAs someone who writes erotic stories, I like to focus on how the sexuality can be part of the story. The world isn't a children's show. Red light districts, brothels, sex shops. They exist. But what would they be like in another world? What is the potential for perversion for this power? What is a story element that might make someone feel their sexual interest isn't so shameful? What things can the character get into that is sexy, but can also be fun, cute, and a story?\n\nStories can be sexy. That's nothing to be ashamed of. I enjoy putting lewd elements in my stories to make them wider. I also enjoy making those stories and worlds deeper and heavier even though they have lewdness in them.\n\nSilver Cow removed the beautiful sex-positivity from this game. They replaced it with very little. Some slightly expanded story, romance routes, and some extra animations, but... At what cost? The game lost its heart. And what was added in doesn't actually make up for what was removed. More importantly, what was added doesn't justify the price compared to the original when the original still has its heart, even though Silver Cow crudely plastered a \"(2015)\" retroactively on the original, a crass act of defilement of their old work to show clear favoritism to the neutered remake.\n\nDoes it have some things improved? Yes. But the desecration its emotional heart wasn't worth it. The original had an amazing story with some beautiful sexuality to it. Now it's just an above-average story that was gutted in a misguided attempt to make it better or more respectable...\n\nI enjoyed Silver Cow's work. Now I can't actually support them as a game studio who I thought had true artistic integrity when they're going to spit on their older work with a poorly-priced remake that retroactively stains the title of the original and removes far more than it adds.\n\nThere's also the dodgy Kickstarter behind this and the rather sketchy lack of transparency. Nowhere does this Steam page clearly state that it removed the sexuality of the original. They're not lying, but they're clearly being misleading through withholding information. It's entirely possible they may get a few extra bucks from people going in expecting a faithful and expanded remake, rather than a shadow of its former self made through misguided vanity.\n\nI'll end this with a quote from the Kickstater campaign.\n\n\"Our goal with Time Tenshi is to create an entertaining, high-quality and well-told story-driven experience with a focus on character building, romance and a gripping plot. The focus this time will not be on breast expansion.\"\n\nNot only with this quote squirreled away at the bottom of an FAQ section, but... This proves they're either lying or just incredibly misguided. Their game WAS story focused with character building and a gripping plot. Breast expansion wasn't even the focus, and you can have a breast expansion story with character building, romance, and gripping plot. In fact, that's part of what made the original Time Tenshi great: It had ALL of that. To mutilate their game while claiming it's better in every way... I would call it despicable if it weren't so pitiable to see them do something so misguided.\n\nIt's worth noting the team made videos for the remake advertising features that weren't in the final game, like voice acting. However, these features were relegated to stretch goals which weren't met, which suggests they intentionally removed features they'd already worked on to try and paywall them, and then when the paywalls weren't meant, they kept them out. I should also note that \"Switch release\" was a stretch goal, and even though it wasn't met, it still came out on the Switch.\n\nI should also note how shady it is that Silver Cow refuses to speak to fans, not even Kickstater backers. They're an indie development studio. Transparency is their greatest tool, and they refuse to use it.\n\nI'm sorry, Silver Cow. It was fun while it lasted. I only hope that your current path is worth the cost for whatever you hope to gain from it. Goodbye.\n\n[ EDIT: Word from the author of the original game, again, may be found here.\nhttps://www.deviantart.com/mysteryguy9215/journal/Hey-Silver-Cow-855450980 ]","timestamp_created":1602729376,"timestamp_updated":1607836245,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":33,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.768787622451782227","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wMOgrfYCdPf3pwI="}
