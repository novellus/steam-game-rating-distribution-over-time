    review: 'A great inside look into the making of the game and the creation of the
      different designs for the characters. I almost never buy artbooks for games,
      but I loved the game and its story so much I couldn''t wait to buy this book
      and learn more about what went into making the game!


      [To anyone having trouble accessing it, you can get to this book and all the
      other DLCs through browing the game''s files after downloading them. Enjoy!]'
