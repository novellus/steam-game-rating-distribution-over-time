If you do buy this, I recommend that you get it when it's on sale. $6.99 is too much. \n\nThis is more of a 'Meh' rating since steam's tragically binary rating system only seems to allow for a yes or no. If you are highly sensitive to motion or film effects, stay away. I've lost count how many times I've had to bring this to a Developer's attention, but 'headbob' and 'film grain effect' NEEDS to be a toggle for f*cks sake. Headbob stopped being a novelty when the Doom engine was popular. That was almost thirty years ago. Sheesh!\n\nAs a horror game, this missed the mark for me big time. That being said: It is a very solid attempt. Add this to the pile of 8,695,468 other games that do looping hallways with subtle changes. I appreciate these games because there are some that are actually done quite artfully. <3\n\nThis particular genre is so completely overdone, that in order to be scary, they have to bring something special to the table. There wasn't anything special about this. :(\n\nFor the first 10-15 minutes I was utterly bored. Nothing was changing that I was able to notice. I couldn't see very well because of the visual style with the film grain effect. I've said this before and I'll say it again. I don't get scared if I have no idea what's going on.\n\nAfter about 30 minutes of wandering with very few spoops and an awful soundtrack, I gave up. I was nauseous and annoyed and I just didn't have anything left to give at 4AM. \n\nAll of that opinion taken with a big grain of salt-- If you are into slow burners or hallway loops, you might like this game. I couldn't find anything magical about it, but that doesn't mean that others can't enjoy it. \n\nI will keep my eyes open for other games from this Dev. There is serious potential here, again, it just missed the mark.","timestamp_created":1604837847,"timestamp_updated":1604837905,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586206912994384766","comment_count":14,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4puLy0/UCe6SQrQI="}
