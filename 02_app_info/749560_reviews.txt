More specifically, one that is good.\n\nFrom what I've seen, there is two basic control types for games like this. Use buttons/stick to turn from side to side and press a button to move forward, OR press the arrow/stick in the direction that you want to go and you turn to face that direction automatically.\n\nThe second option is by far superior. Unfortunately, the control method here is so poor and outdated that I honestly cannot play for more than half an hour before the painful gameplay pushes me to refund the game.\n\nMaybe there is a good story there, but I won't see it because of the nigh unplayable controls that suck all the fun out of the experience. No brake. Bad turning. Guns that screw with your momentum. Lack of mouse support. It feels like an unintentional rage game, and I feel that it loses out for it.","timestamp_created":1593823219,"timestamp_updated":1593823219,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472440958023071289","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ404nRi/MCe4rNkgI="}
