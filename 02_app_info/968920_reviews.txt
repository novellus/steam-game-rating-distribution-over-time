If the camera can roam freely I suggest having a recenter button. I hate zooming of into the distance and then losing my ship due to me zooming out to far. Another good thing to add is color to the resource icons; some people can not tell the difference from the steel bars and the gold bars. It would also be fantastic if there was faster fast-forward buttons (maybe up to 32). The game also needs its UI revamped, almost nobody likes to look at a screen with nothing but a few white buttons and a semi-transparent background that is also white. take this critique lightly and maybe consider the addition of the listed elements.","timestamp_created":1574541893,"timestamp_updated":1574541893,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ42NOAze4CdoGa3AE="}
