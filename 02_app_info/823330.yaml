    short_description: The greate waves destroyed everything in the city, but the
      mysterious mechanism stopped the time in the game district. For all outside
      residents, the events within the segment stopped, but for the inhabitants of
      the district the time continues to go.

    review: "So I've played this game for about 3 hours and I personally love it.\
      \ It's visually wonderful with the dadaism style of art and the funky use of\
      \ perspective. The art really fits in with the idea of a slowly collapsing society.\
      \ I spent a good 5 minutes just appreciating the map and all the detail put\
      \ in. I loved the look of the NPCs and all the textures, too. The sound design\
      \ gave off a nice creepy vibe and I loved the wide variety of sound effects.\
      \ The controls felt good and I'm very appreciative of the use of colliders on\
      \ the obstacles. I was worried that because of the perspective, I would be hit\
      \ by enemies/obstacles even if I wasn't really touching them but it was actually\
      \ really easy and fun to maneuver through. The game is pretty solid when it\
      \ comes to not having glitches/ places where you easily could get physically\
      \ stuck which was nice. \n\nThere are some problems with the game though. The\
      \ player is also a bit slow and since this game heavily relies on going back\
      \ and forth from place to place, I would've loved a run button of some sorts.\
      \ I also found myself getting stuck a few times because the objectives aren't\
      \ really clear. One example of this was when I was trying to get the pieces\
      \ of meat. There is one locked behind a door and the lady near it says that\
      \ she lost the key. Because of this, I spent a long time looking for a key which\
      \ I wasn't able to find. It turned out that I needed to use the skull and bones\
      \ on the door which if I had never looked at the walkthrough, I wouldn't have\
      \ known. I think in the Russian version they have clearer symbols, but the English\
      \ version was heavily lacking. I want to mention that the weird ways of progressing\
      \ wasn't an problem rather the lack of direction that I didn't enjoy. There\
      \ is a playthrough that helps, but I think that these issues could be easily\
      \ fixed with a few minor tweaks and additions. \n\nOverall a good game for a\
      \ good price!"
