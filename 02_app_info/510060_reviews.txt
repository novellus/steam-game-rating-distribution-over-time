It seems basic at first, but it's just so incredibly satisfying to punch these bombs! It's one of the few games that puts you in a sort of \"flow state\" that feels incredible. The haptics are really well done, everything looks nice, and there are some pretty fun customization options.\n\nI've only put a ton of time into the \"classic\" game mode.  There are 2 others in development, but one of them is in a pretty early state.  For classic mode, the scoring system is a bit unforgiving, and that can make going for high scores somewhat frustrating, but that seems like it could be fixed pretty easily.  \n\nThe developer nailed a fun gameplay loop.  Even after 6 hours of play, I still come back to try to beat my score.  I'd really recommend this game, even in its current early access state.","timestamp_created":1513365659,"timestamp_updated":1513365659,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537815093994140625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ41+vnreACfeickgE="}
