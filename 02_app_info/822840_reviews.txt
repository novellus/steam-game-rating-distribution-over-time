However, I want to point out the following occurances since my review and video were made in this image to make it all public knowledge:\nhttps://imgur.com/NVE0h0S\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnly the worst of the worst games earn a spot in my \"M.I.S.S.\" Games video series:\nhttps://youtu.be/viG1arJwq-8\n\nSeeing unfinished game projects using free assets on Steam is nothing new these days, but at least most of the developers who toss up these messes onto Steam set the price of their garbage with a one or two dollar price tag in hopes of generating a few sales.\n\nThat isn't the case with \"METAL : Iron Age\".  This developer for some crazy reason seems to believe that his buggy, unfinished, mess of a Unity game is worthy of a $25 price tag.  Don't let the price tag make you think that this game might have some redeeming value.. there is NOTHING of any value what-so-ever in this game.. err not game but rather incomplete bug infested tutorial project.\n\nThis game makes most GameGuru games and games like \"The Slaughtering Grounds\" by the infamous Digital Homicide look like masterpieces, and the asking price for this game has to be an early Aprils fools joke.  There is simply no other logical explanation for this.  There is also NO excuse for this game being on Steam, but hey.. that's a whole different subject for a different day.\n\nThis game earned my lowest score of any Steam game ever, a mind boggling -16% (yes negative 16 percent score)","timestamp_created":1522568300,"timestamp_updated":1522881522,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.736104071140289307","comment_count":6,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1522968139,"developer_response":"Hello Zaxtor !\n\nThanks for your feedback. As you may have noticed, this is an early access title, so everything is far from perfect. The game is not finished, obviously. This is why we released it as an Early Access title and not a finished version.\n\nAs for the bugs you mentioned in your video, they have all been fixed. We take your feedback very seriously. As such we would like to thank you again for your valuable input !\n\nWe are quite a small team, this is one of the reasons the game is Early Access. We are counting on people's feedback to address any issues with the game early in development.\n\nWe hope that with future updates you will be able to enjoy our game.\n\nRegards,\n\nThe S.E.E.D.
