Its strongest points are an unnverving atmosphere and refined camera angles during cutscenes. After some \"rewinds\" it becomes clear that the gameplay is based on trial and error. Performing some actions and using the few items at disposal as fast as possible is the key. Despite many misspellings and the unskippable cutscenes (they're cool but after ten times...), I really enjoyed the experience. But I'm aware it's not for everyone.","timestamp_created":1576700873,"timestamp_updated":1576700873,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ksGsje8Cfcua5QE="}
