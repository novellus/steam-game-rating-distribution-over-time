    review: 'Ponkle is a really lovely little game! What you see is pretty much what
      you get and I really appreciate that. The difficulty does ramp up slowly but
      never gets too wild, and the game is refreshingly free of any burdensome and
      unnecessary systems.


      If like me you''re looking for more quaint little games to enjoy in bite sized
      chunks I very much recommend Ponkle. I''ve been clearing 10 stages at a time
      every other evening or so and I''ll soon have cleared level 100.'
