There's 4 great tables here to sink your teeth into, all with some unique and clever designs to them. I genuinely believe this table pack to be one of the best in the Star Wars Pinball section of FX3, but also some of Zen's finest creations. Let's break down the tables one by one.\n\nEpisode IV: Ok, so this one is probably the table that most people will try out first. The original. The film that started it all deserves an amazing table that does the franchise justice. And I can vouch that this table is it! This table is absolutely incredible in the way it changes the playfield as you go. I also love how it incorporates hidden playfields and narrative all within the centre section. There are times your balls change direction around the death star, or even end up in a closing trash compactor. There's so much to see and do hidden within this table and everything has been an absolute joy to discover. Great multiball modes too!\n\nDroids: Probably the easiest table in the pack. Good for pinball newcomers. Lots of simple shots, and well laid out modes that anyone can get their head around. It has good flow and some memorable dialogue from your two favourite droids. Well worth your time.\n\nMasters of the Force: This table can seem a little daunting at first. Visually its extremely striking with it's juxtaposed colours and the snowglobe at the top, but don't let that fool you. There's a lot to do here with some extremely challenging shots, hidden playfields and high scoring multiball modes. I love this table but my only gripe is I find the left reverse scoop SUPER hard to hit, making some of the Dark Side fights difficult to complete. I think I just need to get better, though.\n\nHan Solo: In my opinion the best table in the pack. No \"mission\" hole is present, so modes are naturally chained up by just shooting ramps and playing the table. There are 11 modes in total, the vast majority of them are multiball modes. Some include different weighted plastic balls, some have you shooting in the dark. This table is incredible. The ramps feel so good to shoot. And I absolutely LOVE the way the balls lock on the Death Star. At first it might seem a little confusing but just shoot away and you will be rewarded for your time.\n\nHonestly. This pack is some of Zen's finest work. They are absolutely astonishing tables and would be tables that I'd be super proud to own if they were real. If you're new to pinball and love Star Wars, definitely check this pack out. at Â£1.75 a table, you really can't complain!","timestamp_created":1604878434,"timestamp_updated":1604878434,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522471904754638672","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7a+N1fUCc+GfrQI="}
