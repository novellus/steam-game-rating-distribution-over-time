Get it on there instead, because the devs don't seem to be intending to fix this anytime soon.\n\nOtherwise, very good soundtrack, would recommend if it weren't for that little bit of missing content.","timestamp_created":1592618742,"timestamp_updated":1592619557,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520513415336608887","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iLzh5/ICcLeGjwI="}
