    short_description: Try, die, cry, repeat. Flem is an old school hard-as-nails
      platformer about a sentient snot ball, with a nose-stalgia inducing soundtrack.

    review: Very nice little game, though the final level is very painful.  I would
      request that we have more practice given to us in an earlier stage for those
      awful 4 double spike things you have to dash through at the end.  Those kind
      of came out of nowhere and made the experience pretty frustrating for that final
      level.
