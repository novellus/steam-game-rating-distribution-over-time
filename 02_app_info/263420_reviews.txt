Wouldn't even be mad if these mechanics were in a medieval combat or survival game. Only gripe is drawing the arrow to the extreme left or right of the alignment of the bow and string doesn't seem to have much impact as long as you line up your camera with the arrow shaft. However, in my short time playing I noticed it is possible to curve arrows this way. Really fun and difficult game, would LOVE something like this but that actually replicated archery physics - to curve arrows irl you nock the arrow way above or below center for example, and alignment and smooth release along with consistency are the most important factors in archery. \n\nGreat fun.","timestamp_created":1608603337,"timestamp_updated":1608603337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kuCOxPYCdvOJvAI="}
