I even completed it (on Switch). I just bought in on PC and tried to play it. Here's my experience:\n\nRed flag 1: It uses a very annoying launcher that always prompts you to download their other games even if you check \"Skip launcher.\" \n\nRed flag 2: the last time I tried to close the game it directed me to their the \"Don't Bite Devs\" Facebook page. The game wouldn't close at that point so I had to force my computer to restart (no issues with any other games recently). Extremely annoying.\n\nSo, I went ahead and requested a refund because even for less than a dollar, I bought this game to enjoy, not to be advertised to. \n","timestamp_created":1594071556,"timestamp_updated":1594071556,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528571426868438721","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+rOEk/MCeuWwkwI="}
