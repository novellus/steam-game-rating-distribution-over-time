I know early access games are not the final product, but the problems I faced shouldn't have even made it past internal testing. I would write bug reports for this, but that would involve spending more time typing up bug reports than I have been able to spend in actual gameplay.\n\nI attempted to start up the game for the first time and was greeted with an error message with buttons saying \"Download\" and \"Quit\" without giving me any cursor to interact with the buttons. After forcing the game to close and starting it back up, I was greeted by the same error screen with a blurred background behind it. Over the top of the error screen was an option to play the tutorial.\n\nI attempted to play the tutorial and suddenly found my movement locked due to some oddity in the terrain. Unable to progress, I closed the game again. I could not find any option to restart the tutorial after that. And the error screen was back, but eventually the regular main menu loaded in. The vehicle art in the middle of the screen was blurred out until I navigated to the vehicle select menu.\n\nI decided to just start a normal game and figure it out. As it turns out, the primary weapon on the tank I picked did NOTHING except go on cooldown when fired. No visual, no damage, nothing but a cooldown.\n\nAfter getting frustrated, I restarted the game again. The error screen was back. I switched to a mech, hoping its weapons would work and started queueing up for another game only for it to crash immediately.\n\nWhat little gameplay I was able to experience wasn't particularly interesting, either.","timestamp_created":1530735523,"timestamp_updated":1551201846,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr7i1lekCdLSZpQE="}
