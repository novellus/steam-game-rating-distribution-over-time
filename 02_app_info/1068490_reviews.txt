Unfortunately, the game itself is not very good.\n\nIt's just a sub-par Mario clone, and I don't hate games on the virtue of them being Mario clones because some can actually be quite fun (Marisaland Legacy for example!) but Peanut feels more like the Mario ripoffs you find on the app store that play serviceable, but also not quite right. The level design leaves a lot to be desired, and many of the stage gimmicks, such as the movable boulders, just don't really work and feel glitchy.\n\nThe game itself just doesn't feel finished, either. Peanut boasts about it's story, but good luck experiencing it, because the text boxes don't work. Unfortunately, I do not think it will get much better, as the devs seem to think that making a retro-style game means they can get away with their games being \"less polished\". (Seriously, one of their news posts says this!)\n\nI think that the game could be decent with some polish, but right now it just feels like a cheap, cynical Mario clone looking for a few dollars. I urge Team Spikkeee to do better.","timestamp_created":1567040686,"timestamp_updated":1567040686,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.59109032154083252","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw++i57ewCfLik0QE="}
