    review: '[h1][i]Drill Arena[/i] offers short matches of action multiplayer but
      is ruined by poor net code.[/h1]


      Six robot drills. Death match - highest kills wins. Go!


      [h1]Cool base idea[/h1]


      Premise is just fine: You choose a robot (fast but weak, medium, or slow but
      tanky) and drill away to kill your frenemies.


      Drill robot goes around and damages blocks and players automatically when facing
      them. There''s just two power ups: health and super drill. Short speed bursts
      can be used with Shift.


      By the way, I played with keyboard but gamepad fully works.


      However, this starting positive note could be deceiving. There are two specific
      issues.


      [h1]First issue: Slippy controls[/h1]


      Oftentimes, the fights just become a drillfest where both drills face each other
      and the one with more health wins. Only backstabbing (possible with smaller
      but faster drills) can give you the necessary edge, as the drills are slow to
      turn.


      Unfortunately, the robot easily gets stuck into blocks. When turned, it often
      turns way too much, making it clumsy to maneuver where you want. It''s like
      the rotation just doesn''t end when you lift the button but keeps going for
      a bit longer.


      For a game where you''re supposed to outmaneuver your opponent, such twitchiness
      is unacceptable.


      As a side note, AI doesn''t seem hampered by this and can perfectly follow you
      even with elaborate evasive maneuvers with speed-ups, unless you manage to make
      them hit a rock along the way.


      [h1]Second issue: Poor netcode[/h1]


      I mostly played against the bots, but I also played a bit with other players.
      Not surprisingly, we were the only lobby and peaked the game''s player population
      to 5.


      Alas, we had numerous desyncs and crashes. Thankfully the crashes only occurred
      just before or after the match. Also, sometimes you would join the lobby but
      it would not properly connect, leaving you with a black screen.


      By desync, I mean that blocks would not get destroyed by the drill or they would
      linger there for some players after destruction.


      Also, once the game finally synchronizes, the drill will race around all those
      moves you made before the desync. It''s unconfortable for anyone with a low
      ping, and effectively rendered unplayable for the rest.


      [h1]Not recommended[/h1]


      Unless the worse issue of the net code is fixed, I cannot recommend this game,
      despite its inexpensive price. Otherwise, I''d be leaning to positive while
      still keeping the overall score neutral.


      However, achievement hunters might enjoy a short''ish perfect game (done in
      1 hour) but the Site Cleared achievement (granted for clearing the level of
      blocks in a single match) is difficult, if not impossible, to do alone so you
      might need to team up.
