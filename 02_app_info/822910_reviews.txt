It's just a matter of practicality. Too much top-notch [i]XCOM[/i] and [i]Xenonaughts[/i] content exists, and most people haven't exhausted that yet. \n\n[b]What can I say? This is a neat little project, but just needs a little more polish in most areas to be competitive.[/b] And I do mean that in nice way. I surely don't expect every indie project to have high-end assets, writing, and unique gameplay. But we do need [i]some[/i] of that.","timestamp_created":1528915819,"timestamp_updated":1528915900,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.617092549800872803","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5qaf/eMCdP7zogE="}
