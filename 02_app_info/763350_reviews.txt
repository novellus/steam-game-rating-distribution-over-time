It's like super smash bros combined with the old slime soccer games. The powers are really unique and its fun seeing how they interact with each other. If you get 2-4 people together to play this, it's a blast.\n\nThe other review mentions players clipping as a negative, but that's intended so slime's can pass through each other. Overall, if you loved the old slime games and have people to play with you should check this one out.","timestamp_created":1562752139,"timestamp_updated":1562752139,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ476fS7esCfeuDzgE="}
