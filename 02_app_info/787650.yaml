    about_the_game: <strong>NEONWALL</strong><br><br>Travel through a world of neon,
      solving puzzles and overcoming obstacles. This experience requires focus, concentration,
      and timing to let the ball rolling as fast as you can. Remember... in a world
      made of neons... you will need balls to survive.<br><br>Neonwall is an innovative
      game that mixes the genres of puzzle and action to develop an addictive and
      frenetic gameplay. You do not handle the ball, you interact with it and the
      world around it. The objective is to take the ball to the goal avoiding the
      obstacles that block the way.<br><br>The way to interact in the game is with
      two colored lasers controlled with the joystick, the lasers can break blocks,
      move them and most importantly exchange the color with the neon ball. The color
      in Neonwall is very important! The ball moves faster, opens doors on the floor
      and walls of its color. Lasers only interact with elements of the same color.
      In short you have three colors have to be exchanged between the lasers and the
      ball, if done correctly and accurately victory is a possibility.<br><br><strong>THE
      EXPERIENCE</strong><br><br>The most immersive experience is with the use of
      a virtual reality viewer, if you do not have one, Neonwall has also been optimized
      to enjoy with a joystick and your monitor.

    review: Got it on sale for $1 and its a steal for that price. Fun little game
      that will have you on your toes as you are trying to quickly change the colors
      to match your path. Gives some great retro vibes as well
