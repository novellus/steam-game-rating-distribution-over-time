      decorations of Medieval Japan.<br><br>After your Ninja clan helped The Great

      leaving blood trail behind him. Let the swords sing and ring, let the arrows
      and shurikens whistle, and let Shogan tremble in fear looking at the shadows
      darkening around him. Shadows of your brothers who he's treacherously killed,
      and a shadow of an avenger who will hide the sun above his head forever.<h2
