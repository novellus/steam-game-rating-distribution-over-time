    review: "This is a very nice sequel to MDK, which I still got on genuine CD-ROM\
      \ since the 90s. I really enjoy both games, but I find this one easier than\
      \ the original. Soundtrack and humor there are better and more present, but\
      \ gameplay here has been extended to other characters and it seems to me that\
      \ it has a bit of more serious tone (just a bit), but I still enjoyed a lot.\
      \ About issues on Steam version, the only one it gave me was on rendering main\
      \ menu, but it was solved simply by enabling OpenGL T&L on video options, then\
      \ everything else worked just fine.\n\nEsta \xE9 uma sequ\xEAncia muito boa\
      \ para o MDK, o qual ainda tenho em CD-ROM original desde os anos 90. Realmente\
      \ curto ambos jogos, mas achei este mais f\xE1cil que o original. A trilha sonora\
      \ e o humor l\xE1 s\xE3o melhores e mais presentes, mas aqui a jogabilidade\
      \ foi estendida a outros personagens e me parece que ele tem um tom um pouquinho\
      \ mais s\xE9rio (s\xF3 um pouquinho), mas ainda gostei bastante. Quanto a problemas\
      \ na vers\xE3o da Steam, o \xFAnico que ele me deu foi ao renderizar o menu\
      \ principal, mas foi resolvido simplesmente habilitando o OpenGL T&L nas op\xE7\
      \xF5es de v\xEDdeo, depois tudo funcionou normal."
