While it could use some fine tuning on the gunplay and jumping mechanics to make it more interesting/intuitive/immersive, overall this game is good. no major bugs.  there are silly things like crawlers dying on the side of buildings, sticking there, and the pistol being difficult to single fire - also there are no stats on the guns to tell which one is best (the aug seems like it), and you cant seemingly drop guns or have them on different keys - would be nice. \n\noverall, good, promising, especially for the money.\n\nedit: \n\nI am changing this review because no updates have been done in a year and i've not had any inclination to touch this game. i would not buy this for any more than 5 dollars.","timestamp_created":1499537877,"timestamp_updated":1529803134,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513001620769500732","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww+rXl+QCfd6rfw=="}
