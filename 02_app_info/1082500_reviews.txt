Even though this is quite an old game, it played well on Windows 10.  There are 35 morphs in find in the game and bonus, which in some cases were challenging to find.  Hidden object games are slightly interactive straightforward.  The mini-games ranged from easy to medium.  If you play in Hardcore Mode (which I did), Hint and Skip are turned off.  There is a diary to keep you informed with what is happening.  There are 10 achievements.   The main game and bonus took me 6 hours to play (not using the interactive map).  Comes recommended.","timestamp_created":1609188375,"timestamp_updated":1609703876,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2vz05PYCdtKcvgI="}
