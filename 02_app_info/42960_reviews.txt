It has plenty of mechanics, some are quite complex and hard to figure out, however they are extremely fun to figure out and use to their full potential. While I haven't sunk as many hours into this title as Hearts of Iron IV, the hours I have sunk into it, have been more triumphant, desperate for vengeance against a country that has stolen a colony, and more calculative, which is exactly what I think a good game is made to be. I admit, some of the mechanics are a little janky or unfair, however they don't detract from the experience. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone interested in the grand strategy genre, particularly those interested in 19th Century politics and economics.","timestamp_created":1609859860,"timestamp_updated":1609859860,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4oDI6fYCc4XdwAI="}
