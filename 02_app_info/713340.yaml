    short_description: You and your space buddy must do whatever it takes to make
      it to your destination, wherever it is... The hard part about this journey is
      that your space ship is constantly breaking! Make repairs and avoid getting
      hit by asteroids in order to survive. Rack up points by fixing broken stations
      and shooting asteroids.

    review: 'Overall Space Ship Commander has an amazing concept.  A simple game that
      intensifies as time progresses.  Space Ship Commander is still in its early
      stages and has room to improve.


      Suggestions for improvement:

      A back button in the lobby to revert to previous page

      Escape button for toggling a menu

      Modifiable keybinds

      **Single Player option

      More spaceships

      Randomization of unit placement

      Separated scoreboards for different difficulties

      Unlockable content
