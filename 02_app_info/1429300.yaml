    review: Right now the Fisher is is clearly in Alpha but I can see the potential
      this game will have as it becomes more developed. Def needs a day/night system
      with certain times that you catch certain fish depending on breed and exponentially
      larger lakes with different biomes/shaded areas that need different tackles/rods
      to catch different fish. I can for sure see the potential and the Dev seems
      to be putting out as of right now lots of updates fine tuning the fishing mechanic.
      I would hope these other things can be implemented in the future to take it
      to the next level. Also obviously animated fish/maybe fish hopping out of water
      while you fight it would ad a lot as well! For now I will recommend!
