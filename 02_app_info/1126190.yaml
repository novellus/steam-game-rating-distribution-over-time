    review: '[b]7/10 [/b] (nostalgic scoe)

      [b][i]"Real classics and a nice add-on to the movies."[/i][/b]

      Aladdin - the kinda successor of Prince of Persia and the kinda predecessor
      of Dead Cells.

      Lion King - Capcoms successor of Aladdin.


      [u]Pros:[/u]

      + great --

      + very good --

      + good nostalgic feeling

      + okay gameplay

      + save & rewind function

      + short making of "documentary"

      + different playable game versions of Aladdin(!)


      [u]Cons:[/u]

      - no button remapping

      - way too expensive if not on sale

      - no real achievements for the lion king


      [u]Verdict:[/u]

      [b]Two classics which belong in every serious game collection or in the hands
      of children.[/b]'
