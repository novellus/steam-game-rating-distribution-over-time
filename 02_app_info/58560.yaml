    review: 'Solid installment in the series! I played the first game years ago so
      I didn''t remember everything about that one, but the game lets you recap the
      previous events. What I remember from the first game this one seemed more balanced,
      mature and chill on the humor. It''s not necessarily a bad thing for a change,
      although I don''t mind all the wacky over the top craziness either.

      I was a bit doubtful at first about the new art style since it''s a complete
      shift towards 3-D, but I found out I liked it very much as the game progressed.
      It made the characters more lively and lifelike and let me fully immerse in
      the world.

      The fact that you can play as both Gina and Brian was cool and you shortly can
      understand more about the characters, their preferences what they can and want
      to do. Like Brian has no problem about digging dumpsters as Gina wouldn''t do
      that.

      There were certain points in the game where I didn''t fully understand the game
      logic or what I''m supposed to - Solutions to certain puzzles seemed strange
      when there could have been much more obvious ways to do it.

      Luckily there is an in-game hint system hotline included, if you''ll get stuck
      and want to use that.

      It could have benefited from more musical input in my opinion. The soundtrack
      is good, but there was a bit too much silent parts.

      --

      Overall I thought the game looked good and it was fun to play that. I sympathized
      and cared for the main protagonists.

      I''m about to play more Pendulo titles after this and I can only give my recommendations
      for this one.'
