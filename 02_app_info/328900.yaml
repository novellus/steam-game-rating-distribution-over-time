    reviews: "\u201CB-17 -- Flying Fortress is the most stunning combat flight simulator\
      \ I have ever seen. It's nerve racking, historically educational, deeply immersive,\
      \ graphically unbelievable, awe-inspiring and a sim that proves once again an\
      \ old axiom -- it's intense software that drives the development of intense\
      \ hardware, no the other way around.\u201D<br />\r\n90 \u2013 GameSpy<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\n\u201CI've been looking forward to this game since I first heard\
      \ about a year ago. A game that allows you the chance to jump from station to\
      \ station within a single B-17 has always been a dream of mine. And when I heard\
      \ that Microprose was making this game, I jumped all over it. Each build that\
      \ came my way received weeks of attention (which is just one of the reasons\
      \ we don't have an Animorph's preview by the way). So now, after numerous delays\
      \ and even a few cancellation rumors, the game is in stores. In short, it's\
      \ everything I thought it would be -- chaotic, confusing and a lot of fun.\u201D\
      <br />\r\n80 \u2013 IGN<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201CWhen the average gamer thinks\
      \ about flight sims, two primary styles readily come to mind. First is cruising\
      \ over mountains and oceans at blazing speeds in an F-16 while dodging missiles\
      \ and releasing chaff packets. The second is a far more technical branch of\
      \ simulators. These products take great pains to reproduce every last physical\
      \ force on the aircraft bodies, right down to vectored thrust and the effect\
      \ of directional windspeed on flight times. While the first style is geared\
      \ toward action lovers, the second has far more appeal to would-be pilots and\
      \ people who have actual licenses. Each of these styles also has its own representative\
      \ series which defines its genre based on the crucial differences. Action has\
      \ the venerable Jetfighter series while realists might prefer something along\
      \ the lines of Combat Flight Sim 2 or Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000. Past\
      \ realistic flight combat games have had one crucial historic element missing.\u201D\
      <br />\r\n80 \u2013 Adrenaline Vault<br />\r\n"
