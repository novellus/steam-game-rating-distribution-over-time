    review: "True Love \xE9 um Visual Novel bem inovador e divertido de jogar.  \n\
      Poderia fazer um text\xE3o sobre como esse jogo \xE9 excelente e divertido.\
      \ \n\nMas acabei pedindo reembolso. Por um \xFAnico motivo:\n\nIncompatibilidade\
      \ com sistema operacionais atuais! O jogo n\xE3o come\xE7a!\n\nEu diria que\
      \ tem 75% de chances do jogo n\xE3o rodar em seu PC. Essa vers\xE3o est\xE1\
      \ terrivelmente datado para nossas maquinas, pra voc\xEA ter uma ideia, as pessoas\
      \ sortudas que conseguiu solucionar:\n1) Pegou no modo de compatibilidade (Win98,\
      \ Win XP)\n2) Pegou usando uma maquina virtual \n3) Trocou pra um sistema operacional\
      \ de 32bit\n\nOlha o rol\xEA pra jogar o jogo, geralmente quando o jogo \xE9\
      \ antigo, eles utilizam um emulador ou coisa do tipo pra rodar. \nNo caso desse\
      \ True Love, \xE9 aquele arquivinho de 4 megas, pra quem jogou no passado, at\xE9\
      \ clicar no registro pra fazer o jogo rodar, tu tem que fazer.\n\nE se tu, for\
      \ um gr\xE3ozinho de neve especial, que conseguiu fazer o jogo rodar, voc\xEA\
      \ tem a possibilidade de ter outros problemas:\n1) O jogo n\xE3o salvar seu\
      \ jogo e n\xE3o liberando as galerias de imagens \n2) Demora para carregar cenas\
      \ por conta da trilha sonora ser em MIDI\n\nEnfim, em poucas palavras pra quem\
      \ n\xE3o entendeu o que estou falando, \xE9 quase como se tu tivesse um cartucho\
      \ de super nintendo e quisesse jogar ele em um switch.\n\nE pra fechar com chave\
      \ de ouro, o dev falou que a FAKKU esta tentando resolver esse problema, mas\
      \ passou 1 ano e nenhuma novidade ou sinal de vida."
