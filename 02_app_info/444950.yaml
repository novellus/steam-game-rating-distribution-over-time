    review: "Really nice cafe management game.\n\nInteresting game mechanics:\n1.\
      \ A lot of different items for sale:\n a. normal items that you can buy from\
      \ several shops, some shops are rare and available only temporarily\n b. items\
      \ that you have to farm for in different locations\n c. items that you can grow\
      \ on your own farm (like Ish-World egg that you can get if you buy some chickens\
      \ for your farm)\n d. items that you can make after you sell enough of other\
      \ items (like selling 200 of Steamed rice allows you to make Ish-World riceballs\
      \ and Rice porridge from it)\n e. items that you can make after you sell a certain\
      \ combinations of other items (like selling 50 Chileroo tofu and 50 Ish-World\
      \ clams allows you to auto-buy Chileroo miso soup)\n2. Progress in each item\n\
      \ a. at 100 items sold you become able to auto-buy this item in the morning\n\
      \ b. at 200 items sold some items allow you to use them to produce other items\n\
      \ c. at 500 items sold you become able to auto-buy this item at any time when\
      \ amount reaches 0\n d. at 999 items sold you can use some items on altar to\
      \ gain extra boosts.\n3. Different workers accumulate merits by doing their\
      \ job and become able to do other better jobs (not sure if it is possible to\
      \ upgrade workers, they seem to be stuck with the same skills forever)\n4. No\
      \ rush. You have to pay about 2k each month, but it is not hard to get that\
      \ amount and it seems it does not increase later, on the opposite you repay\
      \ the debt and payment decrease, so you can just focus on developing\n\nThere\
      \ are some problems with the game though.\n1. Translation may look confusing\
      \ so it's better to experiment with different options and ask on forum if you\
      \ are confused to see if someone else managed to understand the game better\
      \ and can explain some problem. Personally I did not find this too big a problem,\
      \ enjoyed exploring and experimenting\n2. Crashes happen often and there is\
      \ no autosave system, so you tend to lose your progress ocassionally if you\
      \ don't save often. On the other hand all crashes that I've seen are reproducable\
      \ so if you report them with exact steps on how to reproduce them there is a\
      \ chance that devs will fix them. Also because they need certain steps to be\
      \ reproduced you can just avoid those steps and walk around the crash (for example,\
      \ I had a crash when one guy was requesting a Healthy herb, I just removed the\
      \ herb from the storage and the crash disappeared. did not complete a quest\
      \ though). I got another crash that blocked my progress - it happens at the\
      \ beginning of a day when certain person comes to request an umbrella, so there\
      \ is no way to avoid it.\n\nOverall I think the game deserves positive review\
      \ due to interesting mechanics although it still requires some patches."
