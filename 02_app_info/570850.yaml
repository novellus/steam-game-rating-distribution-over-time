    review: "I've played this game for a small bit. I think its a pretty great game!\
      \ Being its .99 cents in the US. I find it a pretty nice experience! Its as\
      \ if someone thought of taking a shooting game you'd find at an arcade and make\
      \ it a VR game.\n\nIts a normal shooter. Two guns, Shotgun and an assault rifle.\
      \ I had a problem before where the rifle wouldnt reload but you'd just have\
      \ to reload the game. Its pretty fun with the bullet dodging mechanics and the\
      \ shooting. Its a challenge which I find it more than 30 minutes. I would recommend\
      \ this if you have some left over cash or steam wallet credit. Many compare\
      \ it to bullet sorrow but I had never played and saying this it must be great.\n\
      \nSome peeves are just not being able to use a controller to move, no dual wielding(or\
      \ I just couldnt do it with my HTC for some reason?), no continues, no lore\
      \ so you dont really have a role to play in this rpg, and I havent been able\
      \ to find any medkits in the start and some bullets phase through walls. \n\n\
      Some greats are the variety in enemies, barrels to shoot, the shotgun is great,\
      \ the settings you are put in challenge you to move yourself and try being active\
      \ for once, and the best thing for me is how it is just the setting. Its well\
      \ defined and it is immersive. As if everything had quite a bit of effort into\
      \ it.\n\nBut I still think that with its flaws. Its still a great game and I\
      \ would prefer it. Its not everyday you find a game with some good quality and\
      \ for such a low price.(good for me, a cheapskate.)"
