      of RTS and Action genres featuring realtime multiplayer action combat and strategic
      economic simulation. Not only can you order your units to destroy your enemies
      but also join in the fray. Basic Warfare also features a unique energy mechanic
      for units. In the event your energy depletes your units will begin to fail.
      Use this to your advantage by targeting enemy energy sources.<h2 class="bb_tag">Core
      Gameplay</h2><br>    Advancement: The game features technological advancement
      in the form of compiler ages. Starting in the &quot;Assembly Age&quot; players
      must gather resources and expand their economy to advance to the &quot;QuickBASIC&quot;
      and &quot;FreeBASIC&quot; ages all while fending off opponent''s attacks.<br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>        Assembly Age: 25% structure recycle value. Up to 2
      working hangers.<br></li><li>        QuickBASIC Age: 50% structure recycle value.
      Up to 5 working hangers.<br></li><li>        FreeBASIC Age: 75% structure recycle
      value. Up to 9 working hangers.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">The Game''s Resources</h2><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li>    Resource: This is your raw material. It is used for construction
      of buildings and units as well as advancing research. It is found scattered
      on the map and to increase your economic advantage it is best to control as
      many as possible. Note that only 8 scavengers can gather from one resource at
      a time.<br></li><li>    Energy: This is your power, sourced from your surroundings
      via nuclear, hydro or solar powers. It is used to power units while gathering
      resources, fighting or moving across the map. It is also used automatically
      to repair damaged buildings. It is important to keep this above zero to keep
      your units functional.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">The Game''s Units</h2>Utility
      Units<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>    Scavenger: An important ASM Age unit,
      Scavengers are used to gather resources on the map. It is vital strategy to
      protect them as they cannot defend themselves.<br></li><li>    Heavy Scavenger:
      A sturdier unit to replace your ASM scavenger with in late game. Offering faster
      gather rates, with them you can more effectively gather from the map''s limited
      resources.</li></ul><br>Offensive Units<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>    Patrol:
      An ASM Age unit for exploration with limited attack capabilities.<br></li><li>    Light
      Attack: Offers much better combat performance than Patrol units with very little
      cost increase.<br></li><li>    Bomber: Though somewhat slow, Bombers are capable
      of destroying enemy structures making them vital for victory over your opponent.<br></li><li>    Fast
      Attack: An expensive but sturdy and fast unit far superior to other attack units.</li></ul><h2
      class="bb_tag">The Game''s Structures</h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>    Watch
      Tower: Inexpensive assembly age building for expanding DOV. Because they are
      easily destroyed they should be replaced in later ages.<br></li><li>    Compiler:
      Your only means of obtaining offensive and defensive units. As you advance to
      later ages it will be able to compile more.<br></li><li>    Solar Power: An
      inexpensive and small structure, the Solar Power is useful in early game but
      as you advance becomes cost ineffective as well as vulnerable.<br></li><li>    Hydro
      Power: A cost effective source of energy that must be built in the water. It''s
      also fairly strong making it difficult to destroy.<br></li><li>    Research
      Center: Expensive, but the only means of advancing to BASIC ages which without
      you will find impossible to keep up with your opponent.<br></li><li>    Energy
      Cell: Increases the max amount of energy that you can have at any given moment.<br></li><li>    Small
      Resource Repository: Increases the max amount of resources that you can store
      and are necessary for obtaining more expensive items.<br></li><li>    Large
      Resource Repository: Increases the max amount of resources that you can store
      and are necessary for obtaining more expensive items.<br></li><li>    Hanger:
      Increases the max amount of units that you can build by 10. Up to 30 in ASM
      age, 60 in QB age and 100 in FB age.<br></li><li>    Repair Tower: Reverts damage
      afflicted to up to 5 units by 2 as long as they are in range of its DOV.<br></li><li>    Turret:
      Damages up to 10 enemy units by 2 in range of its DOV by targeting them with
      invisible electro-magnetic pulses.<br></li><li>    Fast Repair Tower: Reverts
      damage afflicted to up to 20 units by 5 as long as they are in range of its
      DOV.<br></li><li>    Heavy Turret: Damages up to 25 enemy units by 5 in range
      of its DOV by targeting them with invisible electro-magnetic pulses.<br></li><li>    Nuclear
      Reactor: A very cost effective source of energy. It''s somewhat large but also
      strong. An ideal energy unit for late game.</li></ul>'

    review: "Did not understand this game at all. \n- There's no tutorial \n- Lack\
      \ of (visual) feedback:I can't tell if my harvesters all all collecting resources\
      \ or not \n- I found out by accident you can press Shift to shoot, which I could\
      \ not find in the key bindings\n\nAnd then there's some other annoying things:\n\
      - The resolution is fixed to something like 800x600 for some reason\n  - And\
      \ when you open the build menu it takes up half the screen because of this\n\
      - The turning speed of the unit you control is annoyingly slow\n\nMaybe too\
      \ niche for me, but I don't get it, don't recommend."
