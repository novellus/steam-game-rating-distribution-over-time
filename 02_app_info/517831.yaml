    review: 'I got this game again recently to play zombies after over 300 hours on
      console. This game has like...one of the BEST zombies IMO, but now the game
      is flat out broken. I was fine for the first couple hours of gameplay, but then
      all of a sudden, every zombies game I booted up would:

      1. Not let me skip the intro cutscenes

      2. Would black screen and crash EVERYTIME I went through the stupid zombie cutscenes.

      And with no way to fix it really anywhere except for turning off my anti-virus
      (Which didn''t work btw) I decided to give up on this game. Activision support
      hasn''t done shit to help me so I''m tired of giving this game a chance'
