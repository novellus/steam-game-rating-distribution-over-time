    review: "This game takes me back to Indy 500 for the Atari 2600. It was so simple,\
      \ yet whenever there's competition, there's interest. The trick is to run the\
      \ race as efficiently as you can. It requires some experience, some experimentation,\
      \ and some mental toughness to do it well.\n\nI haven't played this long, but\
      \ I love that I can spend 10-15 minutes on this when I'm bored. Depending on\
      \ how tough the competition is, I might spend more, or less. It's perfect for\
      \ people who don't have a lot of time throughout the day to play a game.\n\n\
      Having users create, and vote on upcoming tracks is really clever too.\n\nUpdate:\
      \ \n\nOver 20 hours in, and I enjoy it more. I've only just realized that the\
      \ cosmetic changes available to your car, are NOT just cosmetic. They actually\
      \ offer enhancements. This makes choosing the right car for the track, a big\
      \ part of the game.\n\nNew & Improved Update:\n\n37 hours in, and I find myself\
      \ enjoying it even more. This is a game of actual skill. This isn't a case of\
      \ grinding for gold to buy the best gear, or just leveling up a character. No,\
      \ this requires skill. You're racing to shave a split second from your score,\
      \ and to do that, you need to cut those corners as tightly as possible without\
      \ crashing.\n\nThis game is asynchronous, but that doesn't mean that you don't\
      \ get to know other players. When you look at the leader boards, you'll see\
      \ familiar names over and over again. You can chat with them if you want, and\
      \ so far, it has been good natured."
