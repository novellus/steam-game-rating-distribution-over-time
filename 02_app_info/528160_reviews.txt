It's a simple top-down shooter and has a good controller setup (xbox 360 controller). The upgrade system is simple enough and the mechanics are fairly smooth. I wish I could get it to run at a higher frame rate but it's locked at 62 fps for some reason I can't figure. I also wish it was clear how much health I have before my suit fails but basically if you get caught in a corner you're toast so I tend to live/die by that rule. \n\nGot it on sale and was definitely worth it. I don't see a ton of games in this genre worth playing these days and this one was what I was looking for.","timestamp_created":1604243648,"timestamp_updated":1604243648,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4O2XwvUCcu7JqwI="}
