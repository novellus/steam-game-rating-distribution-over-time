      in a closed room and get a 30-minute escape countdown. Players need to combine

    review: "Per Oculus Quest / Virtual Desktop VR gespielt:\n\nWitziges (aber leider\
      \ auch recht kurzes) Escape Room Spiel.\nHatte die ein oder andere nette Idee\
      \ und Umsetzung, der Raum war stimmig und die Atmosph\xE4re gut.\nErster Durchlauf\
      \ hat bei mir keine 13 Minuten gedauert, was nicht bedeutet, dass der Raum schlecht\
      \ gemacht ist ;)\n\nAls VR Escape Room auf jeden Fall empfehlenswert, wenn man\
      \ das Spiel wie ich im Sale (39 Cent) erwischt."
