    review: "I love the concept of the game, there aren't alot of harry potter like\
      \ VR games so I was excited to try this one. After playing it for about 10 minutes\
      \ I was pritty dissapointed. The game completely lacks content, the only thing\
      \ you do is use the same spell (press trigger) over and over again to shoot\
      \ the same monster over and over again until you die and repeat it all.\n\n\
      This doesn't mean though that the game has no potential, if the developers add\
      \ a story mode, unlockable spells, wands, new maps it can actually be a pritty\
      \ interesting game. The graphics look fine and the spell from the wand looks\
      \ quite cool.\n\nEven though the game has potential I would definitely wait\
      \ with buying this one, as it's just not worth \u20AC8, I'd say closer to \u20AC\
      1 / \u20AC2 in it's current state. (Maybe not even worth any money as of right\
      \ now)\n\nEDIT:\nAfter checking the Unity asset store I found out that this\
      \ game is actually completely an asset flip."
