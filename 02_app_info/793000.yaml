      /><br>Welcome to the Star-Pit! This is a small, re-playable, single player arcade
      score-chaser. It''s simple: build your ship and blast everything that comes
      your way. Wrack up points as you go and keep the Graps (future space money)
      earned from everything you destroy. The more Graps you make, the better you
      can equip your next ship, and the better chance you''ll stand of lasting longer
      in the pit. The goal? Set the high score and become champion of the Star-Pit!

      through my website. I''m always looking for feedback so I can improve, so don''t

      /><br>Starships are made up of individual components called ''Star-Chips''.
      They are the guts of the ship: thrusters, laser guns, shields, etc. They can
      be placed in whatever arrangement you want. Once your ship is designed, you
      are placed in the Star-Pit to battle enemy starships and put your creation to
      the ultimate test. As chips on the ship are destroyed, the ship loses whatever
      functionality they provided. Earn points and Graps for destroying enemies starships
      chip-by-chip and spend those hard earned funds on your next starship. Enemy
      ships get increasingly more difficult the longer you last in the pit. Also there''s
      space mines. Watch out for those.<br><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/793000/extras/Features.png?t=1524410397"

    review: "It's a hoot of a game, though pretty simple. \n\nThink Asteroids, except\
      \ you can design your own ship and the\n screen edge kills any parts of your\
      \ ship it touches.\n\nDesigned for a game controller (no idea why, since I'm\
      \ old), it's\n kinda spastic for keyboard and mouse but still playable. Key\
      \ bindings\n seem almost intentionally terrible, and can't be changed.\n\nI\
      \ bought it on sale, and you should too, but definite thumbs up."
