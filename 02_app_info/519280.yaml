    about_the_game: This a 1 hour video discussing different ways I like to approach
      studying art. A lot of times as beginners, its easy to simply copy things instead
      of breaking them down and fully understanding what we are seeing. I am guilty
      of this as well. This video explains some of the things I do to study more efficiently!!

    review: 'In this lecture Kalen Chock distinguishes copying from learning. He explains
      why underestanding object''s shape as the whole is preferable to simply copying
      it from a fixed angle. Kalen demonstrates his method of studying art, where
      he answers what makes a particular scenary interesting and experiments with
      its elements to see how exactly it works. The method is easy to underestand
      and implement right way. It does not have specific rules and can be modified
      to suit one''s goals and desires. Rather than showing an exact way to study,
      Kalen encourages better underestanding of objects around through research. Overall,
      lecture provides practical advice for beginners. I am not sure how useful it
      would be for advanced artists who have figured their own way of studying, though.
      The lesson taught is not self-evident and is worth the price it asks.


      On the other hand, the preparation before recording the lecture could be better.
      Background rap music is unneccesary, annoying, and has vocals. It struck me
      as unprofessional and negligent. It set low expectations for the content to
      be presented. I wasn''t sure whenever I want to hear what Kalen has to say,
      especially with the dry, somewhat rigid, start of the video. However, as the
      lecture went, Kalen became more talkative and entranced by his craft. He was
      able to hold my attention to the very end and I was satisfied with the knowledge
      I received. For potential viewers, I recommend to bear with bumpy beginning
      of the good ride, and for Kalen Chock to reconsider his choice of background
      music to something more subtle and warm up before recording.


      A  suitable purchase for beginner artists.'
