Fight next battle. Repeat.\n\n But each round the bandits get stronger so if you don't pick the right upgrades, or put your warriors in bad starting positions, then you won't be able to keep up. So while it seems very simple, there's planning and decisions to make that cost. I played for 18 minutes and lost three times. It was fun, look forward to learning more about it.\n The translation isn't perfect but it is perfectly understandable, and what writing there is works alongside the graphics to really sell the theme. \n Posting the review now as it didn't have any. Game seems really fun at first impression.","timestamp_created":1609365128,"timestamp_updated":1609365128,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtODo2vYCd8T0vgI="}
