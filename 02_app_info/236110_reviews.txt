I'm not kidding, I played for hundreds of hours with my friends. Unfortunately, this game does little to improve upon that first game with the added kick in the teeth of a ton of micro-transactions. \n\nI bought this back when it was first released with a price tag so I was expecting gameplay that reflected that. Unfortunately, after the beta release, they went the way of mobile games and locked characters and outfits behind micro-transations instead of beating a map like they had in previous games. Thoroughly disappointed. Honestly, just go back and stick with the first game and skip this version.","timestamp_created":1609463303,"timestamp_updated":1609463303,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502883493900299072","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4taHf3fYCe6qhvwI="}
