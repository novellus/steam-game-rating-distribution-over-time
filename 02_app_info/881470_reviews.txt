Definitely worth the price.\n\nUpdate: This game is highly addictive.\n\nUpdate 2: Can't stop playing this. This game should go viral. Probably needs a better tutorial (not that it is difficult) and an online leader board, but I am not complaining. Can't see what the developer comes up with next.\n\nUpdate 3: This game is every bit as good as my all time favourite short arcade action games (i.e. Super Puzzle Platformer Deluxe, Super Crate Box and Russian Subway Dogs).\n\nUpdate 4: Still completely addicted to this game. One of my favourite games of all time. It is one of the most under rated games on Steam.","timestamp_created":1566907834,"timestamp_updated":1574070307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i9n5vu4CeqqY0QE="}
