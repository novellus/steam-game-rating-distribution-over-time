    about_the_game: "Fruit Golf lets you wield the HTC Vive controllers as a club\
      \ allowing you to swing your club just like you would in real life. If you have\
      \ ever hit something with a stick, you can play Fruit Golf. Knock fruit around\
      \ a variety of courses, like a farm house in the middle of an alien invasion,\
      \ a kitchen just in time for a smoothie, and a graveyard ready for some compost.\
      \ Fruit Golf allows four players to use one headset to play locally. Taking\
      \ turns in the headset, connect iOS and Android devices to rain terror down\
      \ on the player currently golfing by dropping obstacles and other hazards in\
      \ their way. Make sure to work together to maximise the damage! Seamlessly add\
      \ or drop players after each hole so there\u2019s no need to play all the holes\
      \ if you don\u2019t want to.  Join the premiere local VR experience and try\
      \ not to make the fruit too sad."
