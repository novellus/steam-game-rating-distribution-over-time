The only positive side of playing in human form is that the human form is the only way to transform or morph into one of the three creature forms however, once you are in animal form you need to lose a life in combat in order to become human again. So basically if you want to switch animal forms you have to lose a life in order to do so. REEEEEEEE ! ! !\nAlso it would be nice to be able to transform after rolling the dice for movement. REEEEEEEEE ! ! !\nEssentially the shaman is like being able to play three characters (4 actually but what's the point? No one wants to play in human form when you can play as Bear, Owl or Cheetah) in the game only being able to switch them up by circumstance.
