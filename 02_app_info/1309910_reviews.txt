No \"search for obscure item in screen A, have in your action bar, you will need it in a weird puzzle five screens later\". Some minigames inbetween that are actual jigsaw puzzles. Chill game, no attempt at pushing a completely idiotic story on you. There is a surrounding story of course, but it's the bare minimum to tie the various search screens together. The game even has some fitting and somewhat cute animation, like a lizard walking through a desert scene or a plane flying through the air. \n\nIf what you are looking for is a chill, no useless fluff decently looking modern version of Where is Waldo, pick this title.","timestamp_created":1602193668,"timestamp_updated":1602193668,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+uaLhfUCdpXZpgI="}
