    review: 'I picked this up out of curiosity and while I like the two new models,
      I found I couldn''t really customize their colors or alter their clothing when
      I made a new character or edited an older one I was using.


      I don''t mind pre-set characters, however it would be nice to see relevant pictures
      of the characters on this page. It was a blind buy and one I''m not even sure
      is working entirely as intended. For that reason I will not recommend this for
      now. The two new characters are nice but lack some of the base customization
      others get. You can still add extra items to them, but not change the base clothes
      or colors as you can with others.


      With more information I would recommend it, especially if the screenshots were
      relevant.'
