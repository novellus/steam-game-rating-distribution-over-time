The company is on the brink of shutting down and the only way to save it is to get some killer photos, so you head out into the city to get photos to save the magazine.\n\nThe story is incredibly simplistic and nothing incredibly special, but it does do it's job well. A lot of the moments are pretty funny, even though some of the writing is pretty bad. You know what to expect from these sort of games before you even buy them, but I was pleasantly surprised to say the least.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe art style is actually really amazing and honestly I was quite shocked by how good it is. As soon as you leave the small building where you work, you're introduced into a bright, colorful and lively world. It was actually really fun to go around and exploring, seeing the sights. There's plenty to explore ranging from beaches, woods and living areas, each area has distinct places so you know where you are at all times.\n\nThe character portraits are also really decent and I really liked the drawn art style. Overall I'm really impressed with the art design, there's plenty of effort that went into it.\n\nAudio:\n\nThe music is also really cheerful and catchy and mixed with the ambience of the ocean waves hitting the beach, cars driving around and birds flying overhead it really provides for a relaxing experience. Not to mention with the money you get from photos you can actually buy more tracks to use if you get sick of the main ones and the other tracks are also really good.\n\nThe only negative is that some of the mixing is mediocre, sometimes the ocean waves could get louder than the music, it required some tuning to be perfect, but other than that I really liked the audio.\n\nGameplay:\n\nFoto Flash is an exploration puzzle game, your initial goal is to get 10 photos from girls around the map and usually they need you to do something for them before they join you for a photoshoot. A lot of them require you to bring them something that is hidden somewhere in the map. A lot of the times you actually have interact with people to actually solve puzzles to get the item a certain girls need. \n\nThe puzzles are pretty easy, but actually kind of fun to solve. For example one girl wants you to bring a certain mushroom and there's a bunch of different ones scattered around the map and you have to bring them to a scientist to tell you if you've gotten the correct one, which was pretty cool. \n\nThere are a few negatives. One of the biggest one is that map is decently sized and a lot of the times what a certain girl needs is placed somewhere far away and it requires you to go quite a way to get that item and then go all that way back. It could get tedious to some considering some locations act like mazes. Another negative is the controls which are slightly slippery, but this one is easy to get used to since a lot of the areas are incredibly open making it easy to traverse. \n\nVerdict:\n\nFoto Flash is a pleasant surprise, it was honestly quite fun to go through the game and explore the city and solve the puzzles. It's pretty short, roughly around 2 hours, but a really fun to play. Even with it's issues like slippery controls and very minor bugs, it's actually a really decent game and something I can recommend in the sea of sexy shovelware. \n\nFinal Rating:\n7.5/10\n\nPros:\n+ Art style is really good\n+ A lot of the music is incredibly catchy\n+ Puzzles are fun to solve \n\nCons:\n- Slippery controls\n- Minor bugs\n\nIf you liked the review please consider joining https://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog and https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews\n","timestamp_created":1608044796,"timestamp_updated":1608044796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.595407068729400635","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhou8s/YCdvq6ugI="}
