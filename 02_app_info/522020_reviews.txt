I did not play this allot  because it freaks me the hell out. I decided to play this when I have visitors with we or if my family as staying a few days over. Playing this game alone would probably cause to rip off the headset in shock and fear. But it does provide what it said it would so no complaints there. That is why I kept it and not refund it. I recommend it, if you dare.","timestamp_created":1609341806,"timestamp_updated":1609341806,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2+SP2vYCdvbmvgI="}
