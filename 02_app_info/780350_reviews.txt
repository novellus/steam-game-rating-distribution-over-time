The Skull Demon in the game is designed to have 3 stages, Magic Design Studios has certainly catch such detail.\nAnother touch of the detail is about the Monkey King, MK has a lot of monkies in his tribe (猴子猴孫), and his special move is to call everyone to strike on the enemies. MK also has a Golden Cudgel which can expand or shrink at MK's will, and the dev team used this feature for various challenges.\nHowever it doesnt mean the game has no flaw.\nThe game is designed to be played in both single and coop, but the camera control is relatively unforgiving through out the game where it only focuses on one \"lead player\" and others could die from the out-of-the-screen traps or enemies.\nVarious bugs, but not game breaking one, were demonstrated as well, characters stuck below the ground after cut-scenes where you fight the boss.\nAt the end of the 2nd level in Underworld, the doorman speaks in Mandarin even English is selected, this is the only npc having the problem and I have no idea if this is intended.\nAt the final 1st stage of the Bull King, the BK would pull up which you cannot grab onto his nose ring and its tail (the ground?) disappear at the same time where leave you no room to survive and you can only fall into your death. During the cut-scene transitioning from BK stage 1 to 2, the Monk would seldom be in infinite-dashing left and right on the platform, and instantly get killed falling into the lava once you regain control of the character, there is also a chance that you are being forced dropping into the lava with other characters during the Transition. At the 2nd stage of the BK, the 5 floating platforms would kill your character occasionally when they bounce over the lava. These bugs could be very annoying when you play in hard difficulty where you have no chance of reviving any dead character.","timestamp_created":1609786876,"timestamp_updated":1609817757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41LKn6PYCcYC9wAI="}
