    review: 'A very good little series, marred only by Steam''s not-very-good player.  I
      would watch the hell out of this on YouTube or Netflix or something. Steam makes
      it a bit awkward.


      Alan Tudyk really nails this, both as a writer and a performer. It''s a great
      piece of work, and if I could hit the "recommend" button multiple times, I probably
      would.  It deserves a longer run with full length episodes.'
