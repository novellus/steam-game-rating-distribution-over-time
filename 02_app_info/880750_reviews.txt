And I don't think the actual gameplay is as bad as reviews overall make it out to be; there's what could be a decent if somewhat content-light game here, with a few interestingly non-standard features, like mining and colony priority. But...\n\n1) The bugs. Oh, the bugs. Like sometimes not being able to load my savegame, because the game just sticks on \"Loading...\" forever. Not being able to [i]save[/i] the game, because the save button is permanently grayed out. Having the End Turn button permanently break, and the key command for going to the next turn only work if I first go into the help video menu and close it again. Having help videos only play if I go into the menu, spam-click one for a while, close the menu again, wait for the video sounds to start playing even though the menu is now closed, and then re-open the menu and hope I didn't miss too much. Having the game freeze after a battle, or just randomly. Galaxy map navigation controls that sometimes don't work.\n\n2) The AI. In Astra Exodus' defense, it's hardly the only 4x to break down when faced with a peaceful strategy, but in my game as a Charismatic species, I've successfully established a long-lasting peace with everyone and am far ahead and close to victory (if I can convince it to load my save...*sigh*), with the only warship I've had to build being one I produced in the late-game for fun, just to go monster-hunting. I've only had to give one gift, even, though I did hire a +diplomacy hero to help me out. In other games, even if the AI is eventually going to fail against friendliness, it'll resist a bit more at the start, and make me have to do some more wheeling and dealing to get into a winning position. \n\n3) The messiness. Some of this is aesthetic, e.g. different graphics appearing side-by-side but having different art styles (stars and planets, for instance) and inconsistent pixel sizes, certain pieces of text distorting during zoom and scroll, empire and peculiarity icons becoming illegible when downscaled for display under planets on the galaxy map, and inconsistent fonts. But then on top of that, you have the interface, which has some weird quirks (like having to drag pops around on the planet screen by their heads because of the way the \"Board\" button is designed, or having to re-create a ship from scratch when modifying the design-- why can't it just copy over the existing stuff to a new design for me, instead of showing a pop-up message telling me to start over?) the numerous instances of poor grammar and awkward writing (which pretty much killed any interest I might have had in playing the campaign mode), the sketchy math where you're sometimes not sure whether a particular building or ship system is bugged or not because the combination of limited documentation and limited display in the UI doesn't give you enough information to know if it's doing what it's supposed to, or even [i]anything[/i], plus the definite bugs, and it all adds up in terms of the overall impression. \n\nI hope that, over time, this game continues to improve, and eventually makes it to a state where I can recommend it. As it is, there's not enough content or originality to balance out the flaws and price.","timestamp_created":1609521667,"timestamp_updated":1609521667,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544072985649108887","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u/O93/YCfcm6vwI="}
