This is a good game overall and I like to play it, the only thing I see is I would like a tactical command view and AI. I saw something with emergeNYC and they have a tactical view where you can have AI trucks drive themselves to where you tell them to go. This would really help with players like me who don't really favor the multi player experience, and it could also help in multi player to. I also would like AI firefighters that you can command, for example, I send an Engine Company from a station to a scene, and in tactical view I select the Engine and click something like \"Quick Deploy\" and all the firefighters hop out and grab their gear. Then you get a firefighter with a hose and get them into a fire. I understand this could take time (before anybody gets angry) and money, just a suggestion. Overall a really enjoyable game with updates almost every week. This is a game worth getting if you like really sim firefighting games.","timestamp_created":1610162137,"timestamp_updated":1610162137,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4+ozJ8vYCefzZwQI="}
