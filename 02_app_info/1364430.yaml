    review: 'Classic arcade shoot ''em up (shmup) with polished pixel graphics, metroidvania-lite
      depth, upgrade systems, and a clear megaman influence; rock paper scissors style
      weapon acquisition between bosses -- minus the punishing difficulty.


      It''s a breath of fresh air in an otherwise saturated roguewhatever/massive
      metroidvania market. Don''t get me wrong, I enjoy a lot of roguelite/likes and
      love metroidvanias, but sometimes you just want a burger, not a six course meal.
      The game is still challenging; you''ll probably die at least a few times even
      if you''re a bullet-hell junky (which this game also is not).


      The one minor critique I have is that the upgrade/metroid elements are a little
      on the shallow end. I''m literally complaining about the "lite" part that is
      clearly reflected in the trailer, my review, and price point, so take that with
      a grain of salt. I really just wanted "more."


      Additionally, one of the devs responded to my forum post, then reached out to
      me directly to help me out with an issue I was having. That issue being a patch
      sadly reset my progress. He was going to help me recover it, but I informed
      him that there was no need, because I already started over and played through
      it again. That says a lot about the game''s fun factor as well as the people
      that created it.


      The price point is perfect; maybe arguably a little low. Just pick it up, crack
      a beer, and enjoy. It''s worth it.'
