The handling of the vehicles seems weird at first but once you get used to the drifting and the boost recharging mechanics they control really well. Amazing visuals and fitting music all throughout the game. I really love this kind of racer, I also approve of the added hardcore mode that encourages you to go as fast as you can without dying.\nI am probably going to start speedrunning this game, it really is a gem 10/10 would recommend especially for that price.","timestamp_created":1608937414,"timestamp_updated":1608937414,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw15OJzvYCesaZvQI="}
