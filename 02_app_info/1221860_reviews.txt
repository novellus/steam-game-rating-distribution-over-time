The Revenge of Johnny Bonasera is a 4-part episodic series by independent developer Rafael Garc√≠a.  The series began in late 2016 and concluded in early 2020.  The developer has floated the possibility of doing a fifth game at some point in the future, but the series is currently finished; The four games that are out tell a complete story with no loose ends.  Each game in the series takes about two to three hours to complete, and each successive game is a bit larger and more ambitious than the previous entries.\n\nThe series follows a physically weak but terribly ruthless young boy.  In the first game, which works as a standalone title, Johnny takes revenge on some teenaged punks who ruin his sandwich.  The second, third, and forth games change course a little bit and follow a whole story arc as Johnny takes revenge on some aliens who have abducted his mother.\n\nMy overall impression of the series as a whole is positive.  Johnny is not as big or as flashy as many other games; but it doesn't feel like it is even trying to compete with those.  I am writing these reviews on Jan 2, 2020, the day after Adobe Flash officially died.  Johnny feels like exactly the kind of game that would have existed and thrived as a mega-hit on a site like Newgrounds or Kongregate had it come out 15 years earlier.  With the basic cartoonish art style, large and crudely animated sprites, vaguely adolescent humor, and simplicity of design, the series brings me a certain nostalgia for that era of gaming.[/i]\n\nThis is the final (for now) entry in the Johnny series, and is the best one.  In this final game, we finally get the payoff we have been building up to, where Johnny reaches the alien ship and takes it down.  This is the longest and most complex of the four Johnny games.\n\nIn this game, there are a staggering seven playable characters, a series first.  We also get a new switching mechanic, where we can toggle control between multiple characters to solve a single puzzle.  While we play as Johnny for most of the game, we also play as a superhero also on board the spaceship, three captives of the aliens who are trying to get free, and there is a long flashback sequence in which we play as two government agents on one of their earlier cases.\n\nI recommend playing the other three Johnny games before playing this one, but I think the payoff is worth it.  Here's hoping for a Johnny 5!\n","timestamp_created":1609637354,"timestamp_updated":1609637354,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwoZv34vYCcNr1vwI="}
