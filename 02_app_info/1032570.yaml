    review: "The game is not worth $10 in its current state. I would pay up to $5.\n\
      \nThe unpleasant: \nCutscenes are unskippable, forcing a 5-minute long exposition\
      \ backstory that seems to bug the game if you hammer on your keyboard.\ntext\
      \ cannot be sped up or skipped, \nsoft-lock bugs occurred twice in 20 minutes,\
      \ \nlimited audio and graphical options, \n\"heartbeat\" sound effect played\
      \ constantly from the first point of damage onwards, \nmoving up and to the\
      \ left played an annoying spraying sound that was absent when moving down and\
      \ to the right, \nno option to zoom out from craft leading to a limited and\
      \ cramped viewpoint, \n\nThe Pleasant:\nAesthetic\nInteresting concept, didn't\
      \ get far enough to pass the first dungeon in total (beat the first boss, but\
      \ stopped playing).\nShip variety\nGood concept for paying to access some trait\
      \ rooms, while keeping others open by default, adding a meta of storing up \"\
      points\" to afford either health or new trait rooms.\n\nI'm sure there are other\
      \ positives, but I did not play long enough to see them, the audio bugs, soft-locking,\
      \ and inconsistent controls frustrated me too much.\n\nI didn't really enjoy\
      \ how moving and shooting force your ship to orient in the indicated direction.\
      \ What I mean is that your ship will only shoot forwards, so it always rotates\
      \ to shoot. However, your ship also always tries to face the direction of movement\
      \ when you press the direction keys (no built-in strafing). The result is a\
      \ fight between aiming and movement causing the ship to weeble-wobble-rotate\
      \ every time you change direction unless you hold down the fire buttons in the\
      \ desired direction. \nIt's hard to describe, not to my taste.\n\nI appreciate\
      \ what the devs are doing, I can see the work they've put into the concept,\
      \ but I do not view this game as worth $10 in its current state. \nI would like\
      \ to see the early bugs ironed out, movement smoothed out (make the turret itself\
      \ rotatable separate from the ship, or increase the ship's rotational speed),\
      \ and slow-scrolling cutscenes made completely skippable. I'm not playing a\
      \ roguelite for the story :P\nSome more game options would be nice, especially\
      \ difficulty, enemy spawn rates, dungeon size, and weapon modding.\n\nI cannot\
      \ recommend this game today, but I would be happy to revisit after a couple\
      \ updates."
