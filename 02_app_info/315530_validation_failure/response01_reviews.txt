When I played the first game, I would never imagine that I'd end up enjoying this HOG series, especially not this much! Starting with an annoyingly dull first instalment, the series progressed to become better and better with each new game. Empress of the Deep 3: Legacy of the Phoenix marks the ending of Anna's tale with a really unexpected plot twist.\n\nEscaped from the Ark of Humanity, and faced her evil sister Pandora to reclaim the Sky Temple once and for all, Anna prevailed. \"What now?‚Äù we would wonder. Now, it is time for Anna to reclaim her people, as the rightful Empress of the Deep. In this final game, all questions unanswered are explained with the last of Anna's puzzle solving adventures taking place in this mythological setting. Now, she is to awaken the Phoenix and save her people from their recluse...\n\nThe setting is as marvelous as any other instalment before, with slightly better graphics. Usage of light, colors and flowing effects really got better by each passing game. Empress of the Deep 3: Legacy of the Phoenix is the best in display so far. About voice acting, I'm deadly annoyed by Jacob's voice so far, and it is nearly the only voice that we've been hearing in this game. So, I'll consider that the sole minus of this game.\n\nGameplaywise, HOG scenes got significantly better. Puzzles are a bit on the easy side compared to the second game, but most do just fine. By the way, we finally have a skip option for puzzles! There is also a teleportation feature for our transport within the island, thus backtracking doesn't annoy you much. One giant plus is, that the hint button describes any single item or act that you might have missed with elaborate detail, so if you are running a casual game, nothing either bores or frustrates you.\n\nAbout the ending, I have to confess that I found it to be unnecessarily cheesy. It kinda nullifies the whole dynamic of any and all conflicts you've been facing so far, but hey! \"All is well that ends well\". Story wise, I'm glad that everything is explained properly with beautiful details thrown around. For example, cats around the island carrying teleportation tokens were a really beautiful touch. In Egyptian mythology, cats are considered to be the guardians of the living, protecting them from spirits and guarding the passage from the realm of the dead to the realm of the living. Especially this episode was really well adorned with such beautiful nuances.\n\nWhen I first started playing this HOG series, I was annoyed about the first game. Yet, as I continued with each new instalment; my annoyance first turned into curiosity, then to genuine wonder. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to any HOG player. Please don't let the first game discourage you! If you do, you'll be missing an incredible trilogy.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ladystoryteller#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","timestamp_created":1444863061,"timestamp_updated":1453669886,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.724770605564117432","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg8XeutICffa9Rg=="}
