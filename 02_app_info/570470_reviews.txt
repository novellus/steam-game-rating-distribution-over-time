Basically the janky physics will make it impossible to complete Escape the Bunker.\n\nItems will randomally drop out of your hands.\nBumping anything with an item in your hand will make it bounce out of your hand.\nItems will randomally ignore collisions, falling through tables, or even the floor.\nUsing one of the many elevators in the game will make you drop objects or cause other items you arent touching to move or lose collision.\n\nI literally walked through the first generator door holding the axe, had it spaz out of my hand, rocket around the room and cause a chain reaction of physics objects to all gain incredible velocity, wrecking the first room instantly. The chaos even caused items to fly up into the first room from rooms below. This was less than five minutes into my fifth attempt to play.\n\nAfter multiple attempts I haven't been able to make it past the fifth room because the third elevator forces me to lose at least one item no matter how I try to prevent it from doing so. This third elevator literally shakes the entire map.\n\nYou can literally get stuck because your essental item falls out of your hand, flies off and then falls through the level, forcing you to restart, only to have the exact same issue happen over and over again.\n\nOn top of being almost incompletable, the rest of Escape the Bunker is of very poor quality. Now I dont expect perfection or AAA quality by any means, but entire sections of the level are clearly incomplete. Massive holes letting you see outside the levels are everywhere, shadows from moveable items are baked into the floors and walls, your ability to move is literally only forward by pressing the pad, sounds are of poor quality and very loud.\n\nEscape the Bunker could have been a fun little indie game, but as it stands now, I would not say it is complete. It's a rough buggy mess and simply setting an item on the floor can cause you to be unable to progress. I don't consider myself demanding, but this is absolutely unacceptable and I reccomend staying away from Escape the Bunker.","timestamp_created":1488602585,"timestamp_updated":1507500950,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn+CD/94CfMTOcw=="}
