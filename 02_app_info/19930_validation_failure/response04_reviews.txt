Bought it a week ago on Steam. Had to cry because it reminded me of my childhood.\n\nIt's a very good game. The graphics are wonderful for its release date (April 2008). The Settlers 5 was more like an military simulation but Settlers 6 brought back the wonderful Settler feeling, also introducing territories which make the game more complex and even better. The mechanics are nice, but the settler limit and the military limit is a little low, making it difficult to conquer enemy bases sometimes. It features 3 military units: Swordsmen, Archer and siege machines, which are divided into siege rams, siege towers and catapults, each of them featuring a special ability (Rams are effective against gates, etc...).\n\nAll in all it was a great game when it was released and is still a nice game. Performance is also great (I run it at 3000fps :D)!\n\nI would totally recommend buying this if you like the \"the settler\"-series!","timestamp_created":1476361743,"timestamp_updated":1606381007,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581749081611633301","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iZ7xgfYCfv+cYw=="}
