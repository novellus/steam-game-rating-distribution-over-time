Maybe it was my own fault for trying to play as a bard--there was just NO chance at all to build up any skills to the highest level and toward the end the skill checks were ridiculous. But even that would be tolerable if it weren't for the two very, very long parts where I had an entire army and their petty squabbles to deal with. I swear to god if I read the words \"We're running low on food!\" one more time I was going to have a fit.","timestamp_created":1589869744,"timestamp_updated":1589869744,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.516574561595916748","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+OHnlfICd6PhiAI="}
