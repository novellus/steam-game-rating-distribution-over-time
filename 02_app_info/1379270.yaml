    short_description: 'A first-person cyberpunk adventure. As a cyberjunkie, meet
      your fellows, follow the rules or rebel against the system. Get some cash, buy
      your dose, seek refuge in cyberdrugs. Confuse virtual and real worlds until
      you have only one certainty: taking part in Wild Dose is taking part in a revolution.'
