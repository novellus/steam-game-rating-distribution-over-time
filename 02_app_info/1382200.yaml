      Ananenko, Valeri Bezpalov, and Boris Baranov. These three men undertook a selfless
      mission to drain water trapped beneath the Chernobyl nuclear reactors in the
      immediate aftermath of the blast, and Liquidators is the only game that lets
      players experience how they managed to contain this catastrophe. Based on true
      events, this first-person, survival horror experience will have you traverse
      the radioactive bowels of the blast site, carefully orienting your every step
      based on the readings of your Geiger counter. Each liquidator has their own
      set of skills, from stamina to crawling in vents, that gives players a variety
      of ways to approach the hazardous challenges between them and the valves that
      will drain excess water destabilizing the reactor core. Whether they all make
      it out, or more importantly, succeed at all, is in your hands.<h2 class="bb_tag">TENSE

      project is dedicated to all the liquidators, first responders, and support units
      that responded to the Chernobyl disaster.</strong> Through interactivity, people
      have a fresh way to experience the danger and horrors of their mission firsthand,
      with this being only one of many. It is our goal to raise awareness for the
      people that contained the fallout, which is why we have decided to go uncredited
      as developers and stay anonymous. The focus of our game is squarely on them
      and the organizations that support those affected by this tragic moment in history.
      One such charity is Chernobyl Children International, who provides ongoing access
      to medical services and community support for children affected by the blast.
      <strong>We ask that players donate to this cause and others like it in lieu
      of paying for the game.</strong><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1382200/extras/LogoSccaled.png?t=1610053225"
