Nice representation of this sluggish, chugging, unreliable beast - if a tad low res compared to the very best offerings out there.  Exhaust is not very well done (but acceptable), and sounds OK.  Fine for the sale price.  \n\nIf you're like me and you love the deisels, get this while it's on sale 9-99 today.  A must have for the collection.  Add the (kindly) free test color loco and Mk1s from dpsimulations, and you have a winner.","timestamp_created":1478053329,"timestamp_updated":1478057298,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhZHFkdgCe5PKZA=="}
