There's not too much in the way of story, but the action is fun, and the leveling progression is great. Plus the hand-drawn animation is excellent.\nProbably the best part of the game is the branching level-up progression. Avoiding spoilers, in the game you get collectibles that can be traded in or destroyed for different bonuses. These bonuses are so different, that the game plays very differently depending on what you choose to do. This made the second playthrough for the achievements feel like a different game, and it never got too repetitive or stale.","timestamp_created":1610074570,"timestamp_updated":1610074570,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0Yf77/YCeam4wQI="}
