And while I can agree with those who give valid points to discredit it, I myself enjoy the game immensely. The characters are quirky with their adult humor, and the pacing of the battle, while slow yes, feels hashed out and easy to settle into once you get the hang of it. The only downside I'm not looking forward that might happen with this as it did with the other, is that I took the Minotaur girl from the old man in the well and leveled her up on my journey. We got to the lava city later in the game, and when I went to level her to 10, the game froze/crashed. It never responded. So hopefully the devs behind it here saw every possible angle, even though it's still early access. I have high hopes for its succession.","timestamp_created":1530784068,"timestamp_updated":1530784068,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmub1tOQCeYGgpQE="}
