    review: "Bin leider sehr entt\xE4uscht, denn ich hatte mir ein bisschen mehr von\
      \ dem Spiel erhofft. Der Eindruck tr\xFCgt. Zwar sind die Zeichnungen der Hintergr\xFC\
      nde ganz passabel, aber das war es auch schon. Absolut keine Herausforderung\
      \ und \"gescheiter\", wie in der Beschreibung erw\xE4hnt, wird man durch motivationsloses\
      \ anklicken ohne Problemstellung auch nicht. Selbst f\xFCr reinen Zeitvertreib\
      \ noch zu langweilig. Dazu ruckelt es stark und hat einige Bugs. Das einzig\
      \ Positive ist, dass das Puzzlegame wirklich schnell durchgespielt ist."
