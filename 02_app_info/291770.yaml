    short_description: Halloween celebrations are in full swing, in the lonely harbour
      town of Saxton. Ghost-hunter, Nigel Danvers, doesn't believe the night is any
      different. He knows that ghosts exist, so why would tonight be any different?
      Nigel and his ghost-hunting partner, Lucy Reubans, are in for a supernatural
      surprise.

    review: 'I would give this game a 2.5/5 Stars.

      It''s one of those games that I would give a neutral hand thumb, 50 50. I thought
      it was so cute and charming with the whole Halloween theme and loved being back
      in the town of Saxton with the same characters of The Lost Crown. I did enjoy
      some of it and some parts were funny but I felt like it was getting repetitive
      about half way to the ending and the story is too short. It seems like it just
      needs some fixing in technical issues and possibly has a bug as I got stuck
      in a video recorder camera scene that I couldn''t move on from where the back
      out arrow didn''t show up at all, so I ended up pressing ctrl alt delete a couple
      times over. There are 2 screen resolution options on a mini menu before the
      actual game menu starts up, both options are just bad, one cutting off the bottom
      portion of the screen and the other making the game appear in a small box so
      I had to play around and tweak some settings to match up with my pc screen.
      I noticed that the Steam overlay wasn''t working with this game and I was playing
      a few hrs but it says 7 mins, I think this is a Steam issue though and not the
      devs. I couldn''t even take screen shots and my other games work fine with the
      overlay. I''d recommend to anyone who is thinking about playing this game to
      play the The Lost Crown instead. I really wanted to love this one as much as
      the first game. I''ll continue to play Jonathan Boakes games as I find them
      charming but sadly this game fell a bit short compared to The Lost Crown and
      so I can''t really recommend this one the way it is.'
