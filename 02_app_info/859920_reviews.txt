Nothing really wrong there.\n\nBut the save system appears to be almost completely broken. Basically the only thing that saves is unlocked maps and target progress on a bar to making the next shark in line available to purchase with in-game currency. Any items and sharks you've purchased and equipped get reset along with your stats and high scores. I mean it's not so bad as you can re-purchase most if not all the sharks you did earn using the default 1500 gold that also resets upon game exit, but that's still pretty bad. On top of that, the game is seriously overpriced. Frankly, it's $50 for a game that would be worth maybe around $15 at most.\n\nI will edit my review and change it to positive if the devs fix the save system if the resetting save is in fact a bug and maybe lower the price without seriously breaking anything else in the game, but this is a bad release right now. Even Shantae Half-Genie Hero Ultimate Edition had a better release than this.","timestamp_created":1543119656,"timestamp_updated":1543124052,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":27,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.788624703884124756","comment_count":12,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgo3XpOcCfaDlsgE="}
