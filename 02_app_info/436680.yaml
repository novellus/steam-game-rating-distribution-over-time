    reviews: "\u201CMost of the visual novels I have come across have a distinct Asian\
      \ theme to them, but I have always maintained the opinion that visual novels\
      \ should break out from the stereotype that it is an exclusively Asian genre.\
      \ Outside of Asia, the potential of visual novels, to this day, remains largely\
      \ untapped. The recent success of the Kickstarter campaign of Afterthought Studios\u2019\
      \ A More Beautiful World gives me hope as it sees to combine aspects from both\
      \ sides of the prime meridian.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://haogamers.com/blog/2016/01/01/a-more-beautiful-world-the-story-of-an-everlasting-journey/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Haogamers</a><br><br>\u201CAfterthought\
      \ Studios has the beginnings of a great game in their hands and it is exciting\
      \ to see where they will move Violetta as the game moves forward, especially\
      \ when it comes to friendship or romance! If you\u2019re into complex stories\
      \ that focus on individuals but on relationships and worlds as well or if you\
      \ enjoy magical, traveling story lines like those inSpice and Wolf or Maoyuu\
      \ Maou Yuusha, please consider checking out the lovely demo!\u201D<br><a href=\"\

      s strong point is the team that\u2019s working on it.  Browse through the Kickstarter\

      \ on this.  I think that says a lot for the final product.  Though it\u2019\
      s a little outside my usual realm of games that I play (otome games are life),\
      \ I did enjoy this demo.  There were times when I felt the transitions were\
      \ somewhat abrupt, but the concept and ideas carry through.  I\u2019m interested\
      \ in seeing how things work out for the Merchant, but mostly I want to see how\

    review: "I went back and forth between how to rate this review and as much as\
      \ it pains me, I don't think I can recommend A More Beautiful World as it stands.\
      \ And that's really hard for me to type, because I wanted to love this VN. Maoyuu\
      \ Maou Yuusha is one of my favorite anime and seeing that AMBW took inspiration\
      \ immediately piqued my interest, so much that I put off buying it until most\
      \ of the game was put together so I'd have the best possible impression. While\
      \ it's not entirely done, I eventually gave in and played for it. I'll try to\
      \ keep this as spoiler-free as possible, but some overarching story details/motions\
      \ will probably be referenced.\n\nThe first thing you notice is that AMBW is\
      \ definitely a work of passion, but it's just... so rough around the edges.\
      \ The opening scene is clearly supposed to familiarize us with Violetta (our\
      \ closest thing to a main character), but the dialogue just feels stilted and\
      \ abrupt. You get used to her personality and mood swings, but one of the things\
      \ I was never able to get used to is the dialogue. AMBW clearly takes place\
      \ in a medieval setting, but there's sprinkles of more \"modern\" dialogue that\
      \ just take me out of it. Something along the lines of \"Anyways, tell His Majesty\
      \ the Emperor that I'll see him later.\" It sounds petty when I read over it,\
      \ but it stops me from being able to get fully immersed when it's constantly\
      \ happening. On a similar note, the voice acting is much appreciated for giving\
      \ the characters personalities, but it's also inconsistent. Some characters\
      \ were clearly recorded on high-quality mics and sound great, but others sound\
      \ like they were recorded on an Xbox headset and again, the difference takes\
      \ me out of the experience. There's a few slip-ups in the recording, as well\
      \ - one of the characters pronounces \"Marquis\" as \"mar-kwiss\" instead of\
      \ \"mar-key\" and when that character is in conversation with others pronouncing\
      \ it correctly, it feels a little amateur. Some of the recurring gags between\
      \ the characters feel a little ham-fisted, like the Merchant's \"Have you ever\
      \ considered becoming a...\" and the Farmer's family and their laughs. None\
      \ of these complaints are absolute deal-breakers on their own, but they lower\
      \ the quality of the experience.\n\nWith dialogue and speech out of the way,\
      \ how is the story? ...I'm mixed. On the one hand, AMBW does indeed deliver\
      \ on the similarities between itself and Spice And Wolf/Maoyuu with a political/economic\
      \ drama set in medieval times. If someone described the story writ large, I'd\
      \ be very interested, but as always, the devil is the details. Minor spoilers:\
      \ Roughly half of the story is Violetta wandering around meeting characters,\
      \ with the latter half describing those characters gradually coming together.\
      \ The direction is nice and I like the characters, but my biggest issue is Violetta\
      \ herself. Personality aside, she just feels forced. Her ability to commune\
      \ with the heavens and tell characters exactly what they need to know to progress\
      \ and nothing more, nearly constantly, is annoying. \"Do X.\" \"Why would I\
      \ do X?\" \"The Heavens told me.\" [character does X and there is a positive\
      \ outcome] \"How did you know to do X? Are you a fortune teller?\" On the contrary,\
      \ most of the scenes WITHOUT Violetta were quite enjoyable, because dialogue\
      \ and plot progression felt a lot more natural, especially towards the end.\n\
      \nIf it feels like I'm nitpicking a bit, it's because I'm saving my biggest\
      \ issue for last: the price and duration. I'm a big fan of the \"dollar per\
      \ hour\" rule as a general guideline, but I'm aware that high quality gameplay\
      \ is obviously worth more. Despite the aspects I do like, for all of the aforementioned\
      \ reasons I don't think the time I spent with AMBW was \"high quality\" enough\
      \ justify 20 dollars for an experience that I completed in under 3 hours (including\
      \ both endings, one of which only happened because certain characters acted\
      \ way against their established personalities). I'm a fast reader and the end\
      \ went by even faster as there weren't voicelines to slow me down, but even\
      \ if it took me double, I'm not sure I could recommend it with the issues it\
      \ has. There are a few early access problems (mainly regarding sprite placements)\
      \ that I'm sure can be fixed, but seeing as the price is set to increase after\
      \ leaving early access it might be more worth it to play it now if you're REALLY\
      \ looking for something to scratch that Maoyuu itch and don't care about the\
      \ complaints I already listed. \n\nI never found a place to praise it, but the\
      \ art throughout is very nice to look at and the soundtrack is fitting and well-made,\
      \ if not overly memorable.\n\n"
