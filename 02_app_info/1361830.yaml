    review: "WE WANT MORE END GAME CONTENT.  Arms race is the biggest snooze fest\
      \ of a mode iv'e ever played. If you take action skills, guardian ranks, and\
      \ our personal builds (which the game is based on) out of the equation, you're\
      \ left with a VERY slow paced and boring looter shooter.\n\n\n\n\n4th skill\
      \ tree's: Some are good, some a bad. (looking at you Fl4k) Also shouldn't of\
      \ been behind a pay wall. \n\nFinally to my first and most important point.\
      \ WE NEED MORE END GAME CONTENT. You give us a 4th new skill tree, some new\
      \ weapons and shields, then leave us to run the exact same runs we have done\
      \ over and over again. How long do you think we can keep entertained running\
      \ either Minos prime, maliwan takedown or the slaughter shaft? There needs to\
      \ be more of those type of things to actually give us a reason to build towards\
      \ a strong build, other wise what is the point?"
