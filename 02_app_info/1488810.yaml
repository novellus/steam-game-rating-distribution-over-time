      \ small rural hometown, it becomes clear to Shaun that, in the few short days\
      \ he was absent, something awful has happened. There are no longer any people\
      \ left in the town. Instead, the otherwise deserted streets are populated only\

      \ days ago, saw Shaun off with a smile. Shaun\u2019s plan is clear: get home\
