It is fun to just sit there and listen to the portable boom box (play's live internet radio from what I can gather) and paint your designs on the wall. I can see myself sinking hours in this game just to relax and have fun. I legit think the coolest part is that the world is persistent between sessions. If you exit the game and come back, all your work will still be there.\n\nA small forewarning... the controls might feel a small bit janky!  Just needs some small improvements in that regard, but the base mechanics of actually painting work wonderful!! The game literally just came out into early access, and the devs are very receptive to feedback. I have strong confidence that a ton of quality changes will come with time as the community gives feedback to improve the game. Can't wait for more to come.\n\nGame runs well with my 7700k and GTX 1080 Ti","timestamp_created":1599098868,"timestamp_updated":1599099019,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ479PuqPQCd5O6nwI="}
