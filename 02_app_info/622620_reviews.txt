I love science-fiction mixed with fantasy. Honestly, it has a little bit of all genres. What can I say other than cheers to the developers of this series? I love Kiera Vale's adventure and I would want to know the rest of her story. For understanding of the plot, you need to play Nightmare Adventures: The Witch's Prison first and then The Turning Thorn. This game comes right after the main events. So, without further ado, I will list the good list and then the bad list.\n\nPROS:\n- Intriguing plot with mystery and suspence;\n- Realistic backgrounds and outwordly worlds;\n- Journal entries;\n- Photographic clues;\n- Various puzzles with diversified difficulty modes.\n\nCONS:\n- No fast travelling map;\n- No Steam achievements;\n- No trading cards.\n\nOf course, I'm not here for the achievements or for cards. I am here for the story and this, by far, is the best story I've participated in since True Fear: Forsaken Souls Part 2.
