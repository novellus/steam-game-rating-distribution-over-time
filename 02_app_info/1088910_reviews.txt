It saddens me to see that this game has no fan base or anything. I feel that the developers behind this game didn't give it the hype it needed. Hopefully they start working on it again. I just want to make it clear that the only reason i refunded the game is because i believe the game was abandoned. If that changes ill buy it again","timestamp_created":1602689681,"timestamp_updated":1602692629,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1606695064,"developer_response":"Thank you for your positive feedback. I am very happy you enjoyed playing DestructoPod. Rest assured the game has not been abandoned. As a solo developer, development moves as slow as molasses. Currently I'm working on more elaborate destructible structures and adding new robot attack crabs. I’m hoping these new additions will catch player’s eyes and maybe the game will take off. Thanks again."}],"cursor":"AoJ4oJj7k/UCdZLrpwI="}
