Or at least, I wish there was a way to make it more obvious. \n\nAlso, I wish the game had better explanations that can be reviewed. Finally, there should be an \"undo\" or \"rewind\" function so you don't play a long game only for it to be for nothing.\n\nAgain, a fun game, but these were a few problems I had with it.","timestamp_created":1487264092,"timestamp_updated":1487264092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9qH2o9oCcoOocg=="}
