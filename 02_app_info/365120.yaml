    review: 'I think this game changed controlls. I remember it was worse and more
      jerky, and I installed it recently and was surprised. Character surely controlls
      better. Anyway I don''t like graphics and gameplay much.

      Edit: yeah it''s still a frustrating garbadge. The main part of frustration
      comes from this game''s slow pacing (even old good mario is faster paced game)
      and precise mechanics of jumping. Because of this I end up locking myself from
      reaching platforms several times because I throught some object on the highter
      platform. Or you could just throught away enemy which important to proceed to
      the next puzzle. This game should be called Curse of the Thousand Softlocks
      DX.'
