    review: 'Honestly when i realised this game was a mystery game disguised as a
      forklift simulator, i was very intrigued.

      What at first seemed like just a fun and relaxing game to play quickly became
      much more.


      This is truly a rare gem that I was feel fortunate for giving a go. If you desire
      a few hours of relaxing and fun game play, fun characters and mystery I recommend
      Forklift Load!'
