      The games I played nearly always saw a slugfest until one side broke en masse\
      \ and the slaughter began. This is what the tabletop game tended to portray\
      \ and I am told, how it was for most of the ancient military era. When this\
      \ sort of realism is fused with all of the above, this makes FOG2 a must buy\u201D\

    review: I picked up FOG2 and some DLC for it in the Steam sale. It was one of
      those games that I wasn't sure if id like it or not but I took a chance and
      im so glad I did. After watching a few YouTube videos and learning how to play
      it  I absolutely love this game. Im a Total war series veteran but this is where
      the real war gaming is. There is great satisfaction in getting your strategy
      right and winning battles. The Ai is really good and im finding it a real challenge.
      I played with toy soldiers when I was a boy ,those Airfix ones and this is like
      a huge tabletop toy soldiers battle. The units look fantastic and there are
      so many factions to play with. Just a fantastic game I highly recommend it.
