I had to draw the entire map and take dozens of screenshots and then slowly piece them together in photoshop in order to figure out how to get through.\n\nIt was waaaay too much effort for almost no reward.\n\nApart from the awful blue cave maze I enjoyed the experience.\n\nEDIT - SCRATCH THAT- after I finally got out of the cave I accidently hit F12, and the game immediately closed and I lost 3 hours of progress in that damn maze.\n\nThis game could really use a guide, try as I might I couldnt figure out how to gather more than 3 Fodder, 4 Water and 3 Food for the shelter.","timestamp_created":1561514241,"timestamp_updated":1561569561,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mpGzyusCcLSkxAE="}
