Totally okay to miss this and not feel bad about it. The whole game is a pretty dry and static grey haze of basic top-down shooter mechanics.\n\nOn top of that, they didn't honor my refund within Steam's parameters.\n\n2/10 - it's a working game, good for you!","timestamp_created":1609641045,"timestamp_updated":1609641045,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609649207,"developer_response":"The game is in Early Access and has changed a lot during that time thanks to feedback from our community. We have no control over Steam's refund policy, so don't get angry with us. We think Mr. Miyagi would have some wise advice that the Early Access game is changing and it is worth giving it a shot before a sentence is passed.\nWe are only an independent game developer, but we try very hard to make the game as good as possible ãƒ„"}],"cursor":"AoJ4wKWF4/YCf7n3vwI="}
