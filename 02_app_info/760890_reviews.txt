As in the previous episodes, you experience this strange and sometimes horrific world she inhabits through her unfailingly joyous eyes, though things are different this time around. One thing that’ll stand out is the increased amount of graphic imagery, which is just one of the ways that this game is more intense than the previous I suppose. Like its predecessors, it has a some puzzles thrown in to spice things up, they’ll make you think but aren’t too difficult or illogical. \n\nAs usual, the star here is the engaging, symbolism-laden story and the characters it’s told through. The game also has a wealth of nice art, making it nice to look in both pleasant and unpleasant times. It also has nice music.\n\nA very interesting experience that still left me even more confused than its predecessors, I would highly recommend it! \n","timestamp_created":1610029826,"timestamp_updated":1610029826,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547218620777130127","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/a/Q7vYCccakwQI="}
