Nothing is explained and some of the puzzles are rather obtuse, but that's kind of the point: you just play around with these strange devices until you figure something out. There is a complete solution guide available but I only needed it for one of the puzzles; the rest I was able to crack on my own. Overall, a decent little puzzle game that can be 100% completed in just a couple of hours.","timestamp_created":1609536644,"timestamp_updated":1609536644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuoT33/YCdt3CvwI="}
