    about_the_game: Black Rose is a first-person survival horror game in which you
      assume the role of Linda, an average girl who heard rumors about an old abandoned
      funeral home being haunted. No one knows what happened to many of the people
      who used to work there, but legend says they were murdered. By who? Linda wants
      to find this out for herself, so she goes to the secluded funeral home. But
      not long after entering, things go horribly wrong.<h2 class="bb_tag">SCORE</h2><br>Your
      score will be based on 'Close Calls'. Close Calls are achieved by getting close
      to the enemy without letting them catch you. When your score starts increasing,
      the enemy is dangerously close. Try to get as many Close Calls as possible to
      bring up your score, but be aware that you should not let your Close Calls with
      the first enemy last for too long. This enemy is particularly volatile, and
      will quickly catch you if you are close for too long.

    short_description: Equipped with a flashlight, investigate an abandoned funeral
      home that's said to be haunted. Find out what really happened to the people
      who once worked there, and hope that this dark, eerie building doesn't become
      your final resting place.
