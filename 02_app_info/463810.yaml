    review: 'Ain''t nothing wrong with additional playtime.

      It''s always nice to see DLC''s with good value.

      You can purchase this for a simply low price.

      In return you receive a brand new campaign.

      This campaign with trains feels very polished.

      It really increased my playtime by quite a lot.

      And therefore it''s definitely worth trying out.

      If you like the base game, you will enjoy this.

      Eighteen brand new levels, that''s really nice.

      It takes around three hours to finish ''em all.

      Maybe even more if you wanna perfect ''em.

      Overall: I simply enjoyed this DLC quite a lot.

      And I really have to give it a positive review.'
