The only way for upgrading is through your weapon and 3 items.\nThose 4 can be upgraded with found or bought items like leather, whool or spikes.\nThey have slots you can permanently insert the items. At the end of the 1st part they can have up to 4 slots and\nthe items raise your stats 2 points.....so no they are not superheroes.\nYour journey is divided in chapters, each around 10 screens wide.\nSome have enemies, others are just for stretching the playtime. Healing is done with items, one of the healing trees\nin each chapter or you just walk around in circles till they are at full health again.\nEach chapter has a vendor and a map *good these maps show you the secret room most chapter has*.\nItems and gold are rare...so you must choose wisely what you buy and use for upgrading.\nForget about hope for anything close to science.....you still use a bow and staff, wield magic and\noh yes you can use some bombs.....in most parts your only hope to survive the enemies.\nThe game also offers an arena mode pitting you against rounds of enemies.....good luck there.\n\nFinishing this game has take me just over 3 hours.\nRecommend this game I can not.\nIt's just not enough game for me.","timestamp_created":1574518469,"timestamp_updated":1574518469,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546181082725524902","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mKanzO4CfueO3AE="}
