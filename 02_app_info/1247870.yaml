      /><br><br>The last game on the <i>Pretendo GameMan</i>, <strong>Spectrum is
      a short puzzle platformer about sparks of color in a dull world. </strong> With
      over 100+ levels and too many secrets to count, Spectrum features an engaging
      categoric split between tight platforming and rapid, on-the-fly puzzle solving.<br><br>Puzzles
      in Spectrum are challenges to utilize all of your colors effectively. Evade
      a missile by enabling a wall in front of it, or avoid a dangerous spike by disabling
      its color. Your active color can be swapped at any time to accomplish all sorts
      of tasks. This core mechanic is the founding principle for Spectrum. All other
      factors, levels, secrets, and interactions are designed around proper and creative
      use of your colors.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1247870/extras/storegif1.gif?t=1607356202"
      /><br><br>Platforming in Spectrum is crafted to be precise and intuitive. It's
      necessary to keep momentum and make narrow, intentional jumps. Spectrum has
      systems in place to help make fluid movement easier, but still intricate and
      satisfying. Mis-inputs and buggy movement are a thing of the past; the only
      skill cap in Spectrum is the player's ability. Many other mechanics are thrown
      into the mix to make the base movement fresh and interesting as progression
      and mastery continues.<br><br>Furthermore, Spectrum features:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>115+
      hand crafted levels to conquer and explore<br></li><li>5 main colors to unlock<br></li><li>10
      sectors of 'campaign' levels<br></li><li>5 hidden sectors with levels featuring
      exclusive mechanics<br></li><li>A multitude of secrets hidden all over the place<br></li><li>A
