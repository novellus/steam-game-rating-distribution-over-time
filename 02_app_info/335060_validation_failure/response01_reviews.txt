Not fun, theres only 1 ramp to start the game going, and if you cant hit it, you just get to rack up tiny point increments of 100, for like half an hour, maybe starting a new mode every once in a while, but then losing your last ball immedietly.\n\nIt's like this game wants to eat all your quarters.","timestamp_created":1456699532,"timestamp_updated":1456699613,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47449105978012085","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49IOEldMCd62TUg=="}
