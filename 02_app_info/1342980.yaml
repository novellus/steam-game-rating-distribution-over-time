      \ Vinci 2. Dark yet intriguing ambient music, which takes you straight back\
      \ to Italian Renaissance.<br><br>Our goal was to musically help properly narrate\
      \ the story and create emotional connection for the player. The real challenge\
      \ was to create music that feels authentic, doesn't draw too much attention\
      \ to the player, but can stand on its own. <br> <br><strong>Note from the creator,\
      \ Tomas Zivor:</strong><br><br>I believe I composed music that feels ambient,\
      \ yet distinct. I\u2019ve merged contemporary elements, such as pads and synths\
      \ together with the musical instruments of the Renaissance period (Viola da\
      \ Gamba, Renaissance Flute etc.). <br><br>I wanted to use the interactive elements\
      \ of the music for this follow up of successful first game. I\u2019ve created\
      \ musical layers that became more complex and full, with the advance of the\
      \ game, creating a musical reward for the player and it also helped to break\
      \ the repetition of the same music in case the player got &quot;stuck&quot;\
      \ in the part of the game.<br><br>For the Main Theme, I\u2019ve composed an\
      \ eerie soundtrack, accompanied by a solo female vocal and solo violin, creating\
      \ an emotional arc for the whole game."
