The only choice you have is to cancel the mission. The road is FAR too small for the bus which makes it hard to turn around the corner which is worsened when you have a bus stop right beside traffic lights and you need to turn right. The game also glitches with the traffic lights if you back end in still in when its amber it fines you and says you have run a red light. Its hard to go faster around the corners right beside the lights due to narrow. I have also had it when I have pulled up at a red light. It says I cut the light but was no where near. Another bad thing is the camera, urk! when you pull up to a stop if flips around so now you see the bus from the side, this is so you can see the passengers go in (will explain glitch on this too) problem is once you have shut the doors the camera spins but not at correct angle. If you move the camera yourself so you can drive off straight it spins again side to side as if the game doesn't understand you have moved it. Both versions if you leave it or correct it will make you hit property and again be fined. The camera has also got a tendency to flip so you are looking at and angled side and you cannot drive straight and again hit things. Passengers glitch, when they go inside they stand but you can hear a cash kaching noise when they have paid. This sort of indicates that the NPC has now finished it action and you can close the doors. How WRONG! I have killed three people and I'm currently hiding behind my sofa waiting for the po po to break down my door and have me on murder charges. I have even waiting after the noise to see if they move or sit and they do not and still they die (my story I am sticking to it lol). The game seems to have a lot of spacial recognition problems. This tends to fine, break, kill or glitch with stuck car spawns the game, it does the same with the stops, they're a white border which glows (like a seven shape) you fit in this by lining up you nose with the line. Doesn't work well, sometimes you will be over or under or miles away. You do know your route, if you press M you will get a map up which has a highlighted green path for you and dots which show your stops the next stop ahead is red. The game is a good concept and I won't deny I'm a bit let down as I was looking forward to playing this and having some fun but its really ropy for me and the glitch (mostly the car, made me think is it two transformers getting it on the way they are stuck together) drives me crazy. My advice, I'd avoid and look for another version .","timestamp_created":1609622224,"timestamp_updated":1609622224,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyL+94vYCdNjtvwI="}
