It's almost like a walking simulator with light puzzles, except with very little actual walking. You basically just teleport from scene to scene. I found most of the puzzles to be pretty easy to solve, except for the last room. You can finish the game in anywhere from 15-25 minutes.\n\nDespite the mostly easy puzzles, I did enjoy the game. You're basically confused the whole time wondering where you are and what's going on. Except a lot of creepy stuff happens around you. Unfortunately, the game ends suddenly and on the worst puzzle element. You have to guide this square tool around some wire setup with balls for corners. It took me several tries before I was finally able to execute it properly ... then it just ends with no explanation.\n\nTeleportation is the only locomotion and there is no smooth or snap turning. A room-scale setup is also recommended. I actually got this game on sale for $1.19 USD and think it's a good deal for the content at that price.\n\n[b]Rate 6.5/10.[/b]","timestamp_created":1554876822,"timestamp_updated":1554876822,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.567774474620819092","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwn674guoCdb36vgE="}
