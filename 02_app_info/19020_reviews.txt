They are more Tetris than Match-3, and a few battles were actually quite exciting (and I had to manage my equipment to better handle them).\n\nThe biggest annoyance was the world navigating. While it takes only a few seconds for the character to walk form A to B, the actual walking is completely pointless, and there is lots of walking from A to B. It is even more irritating because the game shows you were you have to go by having a sparkling effect walking from A to B... So often you have to wait for the \"effect\" to go, and then immediately after you spend the same amount of time \"going\" there yourself. Maybe I missed a key which would skip all this walking?\n\nAnother annoyance: loading times are a lot worse than they should.\n\nBut again, mostly, an enjoyable experience, and actually less grindy (near the end) than Puzzle Quest. I would say 78/100.","timestamp_created":1600019100,"timestamp_updated":1600020296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlIapxPQCdqLOoQI="}
