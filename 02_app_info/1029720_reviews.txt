Each new map seems to get worse and worse. I love the idea of this map, but the aircraft pathing and hold short is way off. the aircraft get so confused when you give them orders to move to runway 08L or 26R. Aircraft also cross runways without any approvals. \n\nI love this game as it is one of the best out there for ATC sim's. sadly this map is just lacking in quality.","timestamp_created":1561929248,"timestamp_updated":1561929248,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.576346993446350098","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0J2P1esCdsTZyAE="}
