A visit to your best friend is interrupted by the appearance of an ice castle and rampaging ice giants.  Your friend's new husband happens to be a seven foot Viking-type dude who turns out to have some unusual abilities - and he recognizes the ice giants.  Ultimately, you have save both of them, and yourself, with the help of a warrior ice princess.\n\nPros:\n- good story and world-building\n- engaging secondary characters\n- good voice acting\n- nice art and music (repetitive, but not irritating)\n- variety in puzzles and HO scenes\n- choice of difficulty level\n- interactive map\n- bonus chapter is moderately interesting\n- in game achievements and two kinds of collectable items (25 bunnies, 6 statuettes)\n\nCons:\n- feels slightly short ~ very enjoyable, but the ending felt rushed (many of these HOPA fail to add a short final scene, so that you go straight from saving the world to the credits)\n- the HO scenes were okay, but I would have preferred more objects and fewer runes; also would have liked a bit more challenge or detail\n\n[b]Overall:[/b] I liked the game and recommend adding it to your HOPA library.  It's not the best out there, but it's fun, and it has a good story (as these things go).  I would (and will) buy it for the HOPA fans in my family.  Buy it on sale and check out the bundle.  Note: The games in the series are independent stories.","timestamp_created":1606369436,"timestamp_updated":1606369436,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.574844956398010254","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlozFgfYCcbTZsQI="}
