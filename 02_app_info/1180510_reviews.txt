All DLC card packs are a must-have, for a number of reasons, but particularly for the increased playing options. Some more cards you can unlock for a really nice price. Take note you still have to buy them from the packs, this just unlocks the pack in the shop and makes them available too you.","timestamp_created":1608066699,"timestamp_updated":1608066699,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ479GPtPYCdJnFugI="}
