Great for muting and listening to some podcast or audiobook; I cherish these kinds of games. The progression can be totally finished within- I did it in 5-ish hours- really no time at all, which does take the steam out of jumping a little bit. But, once you get used to not making any extrinsic progress, and accept that most of your time with the game will be jumping for jumping's sake, it is more than serviceable as a distraction for your hands.","timestamp_created":1609171677,"timestamp_updated":1609171677,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49OWG1fYCe72SvgI="}
