Worst aspect of all though is that the game will NOT play in full screen mode, only in a small window making it difficult to impossible to find the items required. \nHaving only managed to put up with this child's game for and increasingly boring 10 minutes I can't comment on any hidden object games - if there are any. So far the only searches have shown thumbnails of the items to find or just a number for a specific object i.e. 5 brushes, 12 origami birds etc. \nIt is so boringly simple with no requirement for any kind of skill just amazing eyesight - although by going into the menu it is possible to look at a larger screen then return it to it's windowed format to play. Nah, don't think so. 0/5","timestamp_created":1578843935,"timestamp_updated":1578843935,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kdKbze8CePLH6wE="}
