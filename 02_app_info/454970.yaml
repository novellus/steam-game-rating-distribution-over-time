    review: "Pixel Art: 3/5\nImmersion: 3/5\nGameplay: 4/5 (Great concept) \nControls:\
      \ 3.5/5 (Tough but fair)\nValue: 4/5 (Lots of game play)\nDifficulty: 4.5/5\n\
      --------------\nOverall 3.5 (Difficulty always excluded)\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31208751/]Please\
      \ follow my Pixel Art Curation for other great games...[/url]\n\n\nThis is a\
      \ more fully developed VVVVVV x4....You can switch gravity in 4 directions,\
      \ moving your one eyed avatar, avoiding dangers, collecting keys and stars!\n\
      \nIf you like VVVVVV you will most likely love this one.  If you didn't like\
      \ VVVVVV, you still might like this one, because you are less constrained in\
      \ your controls.  There is much more depth to its art design as well.\n\nThe\
      \ Pixelated art design is great!  It is a very colorful, up beat approach to\
      \ the dungeon aesthetic and the the music is quick tempo, helping to drive you\
      \ towards your goal.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS:  No time trials here (which makes me very\
      \ happy) and achievements are dished out mainly based on regular playthrough."
