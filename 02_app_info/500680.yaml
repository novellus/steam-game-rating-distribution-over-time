    review: 'An enjoyable arcade game which is as much about choosing which horse
      to ride as it is about the riding.  The controls are simple, graphics reasonable
      and the presentation is fairly bare bones,   But so far I am enjoying it though
      I m not sure whether it will have much long term appeal, there is a level system
      where you get experience for finishing in the position the owner expected or
      better (and losing it if you don''t meet expectations).  But you don''t really
      get anything for levelling up  other than a better rating.


      There is no management side to this game , you don''t breed, buy/sell or train
      horses - it is purely an arcade game about riding which is exactly what I wanted.'
