      /><br>Aries puts you in the head of a mighty space empire in a dark galaxy!
      Lead your empire through the campaign map and take command of your armies and
      fleets in the battle maps. With three planned factions at launch each having
      unique abilities, troops, and tech Aries will keep you engaged through many
      playthroughs.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1080200/extras/campaign.png?t=1603110394"
      /><br>Here you will make war and peace, direct your armies movements, and manage
      the solar systems you command. Through careful planning and shrewd diplomacy,
      you will be able to paint the heavens with your colours. Aries features an extensive
      tech tree that will allow you to develop your technological, military, and civil
      might.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1080200/extras/landbattle.png?t=1603110394"
      /><br>Once you arrive at a system bringing it to compliance is no small feat,
      you will need all of your skills as a commander to conquer this new territory.
      You will be presented with an option of missions you can launch against a system
      to increase your control of the system if you are victorious.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1080200/extras/DugIn.gif?t=1603110394"
      /><br><br>Beware the garrisons of systems as they will not be easily removed
      from their homes! During the defenders turn they can launch missions to try
      and weaken the invader's grip on the system and even throw them back into the
      dark depths of space!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1080200/extras/space.png?t=1603110394"
      /><br>When moving your armies to conquer or defend systems, your army might
      be engaged by enemy forces in the depths of space. In space, you must trust
      in your mighty warships. During the space battles, you will need to outmanoeuvre
      and out firepower your enemies to conquer the void.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1080200/extras/Carrier.gif?t=1603110394"
      /><br><br>Space battles are deadly, and if you have focused on your ground troops
      to much, you might be better retreating and attempting to find a way to outmanoeuvre
      the enemy forces. If you have a great and powerful space fleet, then use this
      to deny your enemies an opportunity to land their troops and strangle the life
      out of their empire!
