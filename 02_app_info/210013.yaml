    about_the_game: 3 new missions. The culmination of  the Spec Ops mission to find
      the truth behind the Raccoon City outbreak. The elite Spec Ops are closing in
      on Umbrella and the Umbrella Security Service squad, but new threats and challenges
      cause them to side track as they help other survivors including Claire Redfield
      and Sherry Birkin.  As well as the ever present danger posed by the USS, zombies,
      Tyrants and Super Parasite Tyrants threaten to overwhelm you as Raccoon City
      descends into Hell. Missions locations include the secret Umbrella facility
      lab; the city hospital, the dead factory and finally a desperate fight for safe
      extraction from the city via rescue helicopter.
