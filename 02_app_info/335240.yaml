      \ this stupidly fun &quot;free to win&quot; game with hats, will you survive\
      \ the cheese quest? Will the Shaman help or ruin everything? Join the 55 million\
      \ people who already tried!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Mouse Simulator You've Been\
      \ Waiting For</h2><br>You are a little mouse looking to bring back the cheese;\
      \ each successfully taken back unlocks more content and levels up your Shaman\
      \ skills... But will you be able to make it? Things often go disastrously wrong\

      \ is the almighty Shaman who can use his skills to help his fellow mice get\
      \ safely to the cheese... or ruin everything? The more mice you save, the faster\
      \ you will level up in the Shaman's skill trees to build amazing contraptions!\

      \ get you to the cheese? Or ruin it all? Will the cannon balls let you?  With\
      \ seven official game modes, 200 official maps, dozens of extra player-made\
      \ gamemodes and more than 5 million player-made maps, almost endless possibilities\
      \ await you. Not even counting what you will make thanks to the level editor\
      \ and LUA modules.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Join For the Fun, Stay For the Friends</h2>\
      \ Gather with your friends to play, chat, troll and laugh together. Participate\

      \ your \u201Cfirsts\u201D! You'll be challenged by dozens if not hundreds of\
      \ other mice to be the best.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Ethical Free to Play Business\
      \ Model</h2>Transformice is -literally- free to play. HATS! All the items you\
      \ can buy are and will always be cosmetic: you will never see a gameplay item!\
      \ Also, 100% of the buyable items are unlockable ingame: that's right, only\
      \ with your skill you can have them all! Good luck though, some &quot;master\
      \ achievements&quot; items are very difficult to get. Every cheese you bring\
      \ back is added to your wallet: the more cheese you have, the more content you\
