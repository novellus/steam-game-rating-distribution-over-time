The goal is simple to achieve, and there's nothing too risky about matching two identical tiles- unless you're pressured to do it quickly when you have less time. The \"Medieval Fantasy\" style kinda adds in more detail to the game, especially if someone is an RPG fan or an anime fan. All in to say, it is a simple/casual game anyone who would want to relieve their stress.","timestamp_created":1603767955,"timestamp_updated":1603767955,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4452BtPUCfLevqgI="}
