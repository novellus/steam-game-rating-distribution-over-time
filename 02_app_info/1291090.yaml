      /><br>A story about a small village where it is forbidden to go to the other
      side of the bridge. It is where the dead live. Everyone should respect their
      home. But there is one curious girl who doesn't listen to the leaders of the
      village...<br><br><br>Story 2:<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1291090/extras/story2_logo.png?t=1589654465"

      /><br>Are you satisfied with your life? Satisfied with what you have right now?
      Is it enough for you just being a regular fork? On one boring morning Ferine
      the fork had enough thinking that there is more in life than just the everyday
      repetitive sticking. This is where its journey begins.

    review: "I\u2019d probably go with a mixed review if I could. There\u2019s not\
      \ a lot of content, but it doesn\u2019t cost much. This game is a mixture of\
      \ sudoku and short stories. Your reward for solving a puzzle is being able to\
      \ read another page. There are better sudoku games out there, but I thought\
      \ the stories were told well. I\u2019ll go with a thumbs up because you can\
      \ read a story straight through after you solve all the puzzles. You don\u2019\
      t have to solve them again. (You do have to save your progress manually in order\
      \ to just read a story later on, but there is a clear warning that there is\
      \ no autosave feature.)"
