    review: 'A fascinating world is created here, and I enjoyed my time experiencing
      this story. The cast of characters were interesting and varied, and there were
      some nice story surprises along the way as well. I really appreciated all the
      lore and world building details that were provided throughout the experience,
      and a lot of imagination and creativity has melded here with some more traditional
      or realistic aspects, and it makes for an interesting alternate reality sort
      of universe.


      I really appreciated the background art and the costumes for the characters
      as well. There was a lot of appeal to everything in general for me, and I had
      a fun time learning more about this world and its inhabitants. At the time of
      writing this, another story in this same universe has just been released called
      Lily''s Handmaid, and while both of these titles are strandalone experiences,
      there is a common link between them that is explained in Lily''s Handmaid that
      I appreciated a good bit, and they do both take place within the same fantastical
      imaginative world, and unless I am mistaken, during very close time periods
      as well.


      That said, I would advise starting the series here with Twin Blue Moons, because
      it lays more of the groundwork and foundation of a lot of the world''s peculiarities
      and charms. While not necessarily a prequel/sequel sort of situation, Twin Blue
      Moons is the better starting point in my opinion.'
