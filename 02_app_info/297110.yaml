    review: "Cosmic DJ is a very weird game where you create music to bring back the\
      \ harmony in the galaxy.\n\nStory:\n\nYou play as an unnamed person (let's pretend\
      \ it's yourself). You're a cosmic DJ and STEVE3 the cosmic conductor of the\
      \ universe asks for you help to repair jamtennas so you can restore the harmony\
      \ of the universe. \n\nThe story is very light, it might as well not even exist,\
      \ but what writing is there is really decent and quite charming. It's a very\
      \ bizarre storyline, but it works well enough considering the very trippy nature\
      \ of the game, so don't expect anything deep going in and you should be good.\n\
      \nGraphics:\n\nBest way to describe the art style of Cosmic DJ is imagine the\
      \ most trippy music videos you've seen and imagine the backgrounds as the set\
      \ up for the levels of this game. I will say that there's a lot of bright shining\
      \ lights which could cause seizures so be careful.\n\nOverall the style is decent.\
      \ I liked the trippy imagery throughout the levels and the overall simplistic\
      \ design of the game. It's very pleasing to the eye, but like I said it might\
      \ be too much for certain people, so look up so live gameplay to see if you\
      \ can handle it.\n\nAudio:\n\nSince this is a music based game, audio has to\
      \ be top notch and it definitely is. Most of the beats are preset for you, you\
      \ can just layer on top of them and you can honestly make some truly catchy\
      \ tunes. The main beats are decent and allow you to truly play around on your\
      \ music creation skills.\n\nThe voice acting is decent and the actor for STEVE3\
      \ does a decent job, but there's not much of it. But overall the audio design\
      \ is great. The only negative is that there's not more beats to mess around\
      \ with, which could have been really cool. \n\nGameplay:\n\nCosmic DJ is not\
      \ much of a game, but more or less a music software disguised as a game. It\
      \ has a game like structure, where you go through levels by creating music,\
      \ but you can barely call it a game. Each track you create no matter how simple\
      \ will still advance you forward in the game, so it's more or less a very simplistic\
      \ software for you to tinker around in.\n\nThe tools themselves are simple,\
      \ you can mess around with the tempo, add instruments or beeps and other things\
      \ and it's really easy to use and quickly you can make some truly catchy beats.\
      \ It's honestly quite fun to mess around with and I had a blast with this one,\
      \ even going back and redoing a track from the beginning because I wasn't satisfied\
      \ with the first attempt of mine. You can also create album covers and export\
      \ your music to share, which was a really cool little feature. \n\nVerdict:\n\
      \nCosmic DJ is a great experimental \"game\". If you like music and want to\
      \ mess around a software without having to learn FL Studio, then you should\
      \ definitely get Cosmic DJ. It's cheap, fun and really charming so I highly\
      \ suggest checking it out. \n\nFinal Rating:\n8/10\n \nPros:\n+ Charming presentation\n\
      + Really easy to use\n+ You can make some beats insanely catchy\n\nCons:\n-\
      \ Not really a game\n- Not many beats to mess around with\n\nIf you liked this\
      \ review please consider joining https://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog\
      \ and https://steamcommunity.com/groups/ImperialReviews\n\n"
