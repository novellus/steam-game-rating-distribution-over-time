    review: "Condemned Criminal Origins es un juego de terror en primera persona,\
      \ donde manej\xE1s al agente de FBI Ethan Thomas, que tiene que investigar a\
      \ un asesino en serie llamado \"El Casamentero\". La jugabilidad es buena, hay\
      \ momentos de investigaci\xF3n policial donde vas a utilizar tecnolog\xEDa avanzada\
      \ para desvelar situaciones, eso le da un toque muy bueno. El combate me cost\xF3\
      \ un poco agarrarle la mano, pero es bastante divertido, las armas de fuego\
      \ escasean bastante, oblig\xE1ndote a usar armas melee, tales como tuber\xED\
      as, conductos, tablones, etc. Por el lado del terror, me he llevado alg\xFA\
      n que otro susto con los enemigos. Es un juego entretenido, lo recomiendo."
