      \ power plant rated it 3,500-horsepower, the GP40X was visibly different than\
      \ a standard GP40-2 (or the subsequent GP50) as it sported flared radiator panels\
      \ at the rear (much like the famed SD45) and, in the case of the Union Pacific\
      \ and Southern Pacific units, rode atop newly designed two-axle EMD HT-B high-adhesion\
      \ trucks.<br><br>From December 1977 through June 1978, a total of 23 GP40X units\
      \ were constructed by EMD for the four railroads participating in the testing\

      \ type, which now is available for Train Simulator service!<br><br>With four\

      \ such as priority intermodal service although, like all EMD \u201CGeeps,\u201D\
      \ it was versatile and could be employed in virtually any duty. Dressed in Union\
      \ Pacific\u2019s classic yellow and gray livery, the GP40Xs served the UP from\
      \ 1978 through 2001 when the last members of the GP40X class were retired. For\

    review: "I purchased this addition to the TS 2020 UP roster not long after it\
      \ was released, and I've had some time to put it through it's paces on a variety\
      \ of routes and uses, much as UP did when it got 6 of them from EMD from December\
      \ 1977 to March of 1978.\n\nTravel by Train captured the look of the locomotive\
      \ very well, including the distinctive HT-B trucks, but isn't without some small\
      \ but noticeable niggling problems. The engine sounds are satisfying when going\
      \ up through the power band, but at Run 8, things get un-naturally quiet--as\
      \ it sounds like it switches to a completely different recording. It doesn't\
      \ help that, like almost all the US TS diesel locomotives being offered, the\
      \ stacks produce anemic puffs of smoke even at full power.\n\nThe technical\
      \ specifications indicate UP 9000-9002 and UP 9003-9005 were delivered with\
      \ differing traction motor types and gear ratios, but all were rated for 80\
      \ MPH operation. I was not able to achieve those speeds with a single unit on\
      \ straight and level track. \n\nAll in all this unit is a solid entry from the\
      \ developer.  It handles well whether used in multiple on mainline freights,\
      \ or singularly in switching duties, and I can recommend it to anyone who wishes\
      \ to add it to their collection."
