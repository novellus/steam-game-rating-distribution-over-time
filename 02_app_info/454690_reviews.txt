I don't remember many specifics of the story but the mood it put me in is still very vivid. Amazing where a lo-fi collage of stock material can take you, it really put strong images of places in my head with just super pixelated material. The broken english just added one more layer of strangeness that personally I found added to the experience. \n\nA lot of people may be turned off by it, understandably, but everything here is right up my alley and I wish there were more art games like this. \n\nI tried to see what else the creator has done, but couldn't find anything at the time. Anyway, if you like to explore strange places and can let yourself go not knowing exactly what's going on, definitely try it out!","timestamp_created":1607816410,"timestamp_updated":1607816410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwue7UrPYCcsPTuQI="}
