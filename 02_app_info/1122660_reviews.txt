I bought this after learning the custom dlc version, before an official version  was available.  Also for disclosure I have played only the lead guitar option, not rhythm or bass, so this review is not of those options.  This version has some odd fingerings where they stray out of the six-string scale pattern to favor staying on the same strings.  Just a stylistic difference in method, but I liked how it challenged my \"normal\" way of doing things.  The tones are good, but what I really like is they merged the distorted lead guitar solo with the clean solo into one path (the CDLC has them as two different parts).  This version has some more accurate sections and arguably better dynamic difficulty, making this absolutely worth purchasing even if you obtained a copy of the previously free (but now removed) community content.","timestamp_created":1597508047,"timestamp_updated":1597508047,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4icq5+fMCcenSmwI="}
