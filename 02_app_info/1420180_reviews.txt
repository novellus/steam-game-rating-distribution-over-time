The only erotic part of the game is ability to \"use x-ray\" to see the woman without clothes. That's it. So, if you're looking for an erotic/adult game, don't buy this, it's garbage in this aspect.\nIf you look at this game from pure gameplay perspective, it's... bad. 5 levels, on each level you'll have to compare 7 documents. If you find at least one mistake - reject, else - approve. What's the point of this when you have \"Papers, Please\"? Don't know. But if you want such gameplay - go play \"Papers, Please\", it's much better. If you want adult version of \"Papers, Please\" - google the game called \"The Imperial Gatekeeper\" from \"Tengsten\" (it's not on Steam). Oh, and it's a hentai, btw.\nMusic is bad, ill-fitting and was inserted \"just to be here\".\nStory? Don't know much. Started skipping after few minutes of game because with this shitty engine you can't speed up text animations (or make them instant like I always do) which is a dealbraker for me.","timestamp_created":1607289300,"timestamp_updated":1607289300,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.635353386402130127","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwoz6nPYCeJHstwI="}
