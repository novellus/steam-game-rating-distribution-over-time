    review: 'Terrible idea making a horror platformer.


      Game doesn''t even have a pause button (escape''ll exit the level) or death
      sounds for enemies.

      You''ll often have to go up but the camera always stays stuck to your characters
      height so you won''t see oncoming danger until you''ve already hit it.

      Also there''s a timer that doesn''t actually do anything to you and there''s
      no game over screen you just lose all items and restart from the last checkpoint.
