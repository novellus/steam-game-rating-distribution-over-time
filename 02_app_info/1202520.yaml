    review: '2 things make the game better if you have this.


      1)  The infinite junkbox

      2) The second camp/ surival tent


      The rest is gravy.  Those 2 things make the game a different experience though.  Some
      people complain but it just depends if you play the game a lot or not.  Don''t
      leave the subscription running if you get bored of the game, otherwise you are
      rewarding them for hard work making the game.'
