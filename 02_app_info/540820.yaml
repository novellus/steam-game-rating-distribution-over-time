    review: 'Starts off with small things like a couple Pzr II''s and infantry, a
      couple heavy artillery batteries are at your disposial, later on you start getting
      heavier things such as medium panzers and the Soviets start getting their feared
      KV-1s, being the early war these KV-1s are a bitch to deal with and its better
      to find ways to get around them or mobility kill them.


      It''s a good DLC for people who like smaller combat scenarios, but people who
      like the larger combat might find it a little too fast, and people who like
      to have really quick battle might find it too slow, because in this battle 99%
      of it is going to be spent trying to find creative positions to flank and make
      a breakthrough.


      I haven''t played as the Soviets yet so I''ll update my review at some point.'
