    review: 'This program got my hopes up but didn''t deliver.  I''m guessing the
      reason for the incredible price drop is that Persp3ctive''s site is no longer
      there which makes the extra Hub program (that was not included with the purchased
      download) inaccessible.  Tried to ask for support on their Facebook page (which
      is still up) but of course have had not reply after about a week.


      Basically all I got for my $20 was a very basic demo.  Can''t move forward with
      setup without the Hub program.  Very frustrating!'
