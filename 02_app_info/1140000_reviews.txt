You dont need Consumer Goods. You dont need Food. You end up with an abundance of Minerals, which can perpetually be snowballed with the vast amount of +Mineral % empire modifiers the game allows.\n\nWith no need for Food and Consumer Goods, you gain a significant advantage over normal empires by having more slots for strategic resources, and to focus your districts solely on energy and mineral production.\nMuch like Droids/AI, Rocks have no habitability. Theres no wasting time cherry picking worlds and even terraforming. Colonize everything.\n\nThrow in Hive Mind empire into the mix, and this furthers your advantages. No more miserable unstable pops, no more need for unity generating planets (as unity is generated automatically by hive mind drones). Just spread far, wide, and turtle your choke points, then slowly absorb the galaxy.\n\nAside from all of this, it adds a breath of fresh content to the game. Aesthetics, new play styles, new origin. Its not quite the Synthetic DLC, but its close.","timestamp_created":1609707102,"timestamp_updated":1609707102,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw86OB5fYCebiYwAI="}
