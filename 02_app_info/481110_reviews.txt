In it you play as John, portrayed by Adam Brown, who was born and raised in the titular Fallout Bunker and after the death of his mother must survive as the systems designed to keep him alive begin to fail. Gameplay is rather simple with a cursor and highlighted points, a la Telltale adventure games, with the occasional multi-click or drag button to interact with. \n\nMy 1 run through took me a little over 2 hours, which I don't think is necessarily a bad thing, at least if your like me and purchased it on sale. The plays more like a interactive movie than a game and it was nice to play something that didn't require a huge time commitment from me. Overall I would recommend this game, just don't expect to be playing it over and over again.","timestamp_created":1610065635,"timestamp_updated":1610065635,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46/zY7/YCfY61wQI="}
