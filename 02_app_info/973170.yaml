      /><br><br>RoboBall is a game in which you control a ball-shaped robot and solve
      physics- and logic-based puzzles. Your goal is to control various mechanisms
      in order to reach the end of the level, where you will find a teleporter that
      will take you to the next level.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/973170/extras/switch.gif?t=1607364865"
      /><br><br>Puzzles<br><br>On every stage you will find a large number of different
      mechanisms, buttons, laser switches, and doors. To open a door, start an elevator,
      or simply activate a certain mechanism, you will need to activate a button.
      Sometimes you can''t do it by yourself and will need some help from metal balls,
      barrels, or crates. But don''t forget that they might also need your help to
      perform certain actions.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/973170/extras/help_ball.gif?t=1607364865"
      /><br><br>Workshop<br>RoboBall has a level editor that is very flexible and
      packed with functionality. All of the levels in the game were created using
      this editor. Place static objects such as zones, paths, glass tubes, and metal
      tracks. Active objects perform various functions. These include doors, elevators,
      and machines that create metal balls, crates, or barrels. Buttons deserve special
      attention. You can use them to open or close doors, activate elevators, or deactivate
      turbines that are preventing you or any other physical object from advancing.
      There are two different kinds of buttons in the game: switches, which activate
      the objects they are linked to and then turn them off again when pressed a second
      time, and triggers, which activate objects as long as you or another physical
      object remains on top of them. When the object leaves the trigger, the objects
      linked to the button are deactivated.<br>Once you''ve created a level you can
      publish it in the workshop. You can also play other players'' levels.'

    review: 'The game is very uninformed, it literally isn''t well developed and hasn''t
      taken much time to consider instructions. you pretty much have to work everything
      out yourself. The Menu''s look budget and tacky. Some people may enjoy it once
      you''ve taken hours to figure out what to do with random objects and the robotic
      noises become quite irritating (personally) and terrible repetitive soundtrack
      :(  Summary: Not recommended'
