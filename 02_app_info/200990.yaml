    review: "Before playing G3 I heard it being criticized a lot. Now I will answer\
      \ this criticism. \nYes, we once again start as a shaper in training. Yes, once\
      \ again, a new Geneforge is under construction and there's the rebellion. Frakons\
      \ survived the ending of G2 and now wage war on the mainland with help from\
      \ free serviles and traitorous Shapers. But, the game takes place on remote\
      \ Ashen Isles. We travel from one to another, getting closer and closer to the\
      \ new Geneforge and its creator. Some fans disliked that and I get where they\
      \ are coming from. In previous games we had one big map, while G3 has small,\
      \ separate island each with problems of its own (rebelling commoners, full enemy\
      \ control, traitors and spies etc.). But, I think this only helped diversify\
      \ the plot. We are constantly on the move meeting new characters and facing\
      \ new challenges, almost like a road movie. It is also no shorten then G1 taking\
      \ me 45.1 hours on first walkthrough. Another ctiticism of the game is it having\
      \ only two sides to choose from: loyalists and rebels. But, I was OK with that.\
      \ I'd rather have to best faction in the saga, then some 4 or 5 average ones.\
      \ The gameplay didn't change much but there are new features like crafting and\
      \ human companions. \nOverall, Geneforge 3 is a great addition to the franchise\
      \ and I don't get why so many people dislike it."
