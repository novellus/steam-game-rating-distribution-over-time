Title for game is:The Poor students against the Rich Kids Bullies.\n\nThe game lasts for about 7 hrs to unlock all endings(plenty of save points in story). The game is suitable for both female and male to play. You can see the game as a Diary. No running need, no blood(the game developer got returned back the game after steam saying they do not want death in all endings), no puzzles(maybe 1). Just enjoy the animated story and make your decisions. \n\nThere is a total of 2 characters that the male character has to save. The story is about a boy who have lost his parents and is only able to afford bread for meals, gets bullied/used in school and encountered a girl who was going to jump too. They started to help each other out against the rich kids. Then, the male character encounters a female nerd, who doesn't have money to go to Uni even with 1st place. So she made a deal with a rich kid to swap exam sheets to let him go to college, so that she and her father, whose work position depends on the rich kid's father too) can be freed from his bullying. \n\nThe beginning days were slow to pass by, nothing much happen in the school/life. Then player starts to need saving the game as the game throws you 2 options, followed by each of them splitting into more routes. There is a total of 7 Endings. \n\nI think it is worth for the developer to make an ENG version. The game tells people that, even when you are bullied,you can still find people to be your friend.\n\nWith the truth end showing, ''Dedicating this story to people who battle for their life in the darkness. Game can be reloaded, but life cannot be undone/restart.''\n\np.s. Thanks for teaching me that it is better to tie a band to the knife that I am going use to kill people.","timestamp_created":1610096782,"timestamp_updated":1610097163,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4r5/R8PYCcoe/wQI="}
