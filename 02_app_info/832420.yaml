    short_description: The protagonist goes winter fishing on a lake and is caught
      in a snowstorm. He decides to wait it out in a tent and falls asleep. When the
      cold wakes him up, he finds his burner empty, his tent cold, and the ice outside
      broken, leaving him with no way back to the shore.

    review: 'The game runs at 30fps which is absolutely horrible to play with in a
      VR headset, I looked for a way to unlock the framerate but there doesn''t seem
      to be an Ability to do that.


      Otherwise the would be a lovely experience.'
