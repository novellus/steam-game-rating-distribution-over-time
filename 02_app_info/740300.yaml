    review: '[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers[/h1]


      Game is dead. There''s nothing to do if you don''t have another person to play
      online with. There are two areas under construction ... apparently since December
      23, 2017. There have been no updates since that time (just a little over a month
      after game was released on Steam). From the lobby area, I can say there''s clipping
      and hiding in a chest or barrel feels dumb and the climbing is very bad and
      you can fall under the map.


      This game should go free to play. I regret spending $2.49 for this game during
      the Steam Lunar New Year 2018 sale. Wish I could get a refund.
