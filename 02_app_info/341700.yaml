    review: "Cahors sunset is a short text-based Tamagotchi, the difference being\
      \ your goal is to help a 65-year-old guy named Valentin Puget living in Cahors\
      \ France to live as long as possible. You do this by selecting from a multiple\
      \ choice of 3 events each month, each with an already prescribed plus and minus\
      \ values attributed to 6 different attributes. If any of these attributes fall\
      \ under score 25 then Valentin has a chance of dying. After you have a made\
      \ a choice, the game then automatically prescribes an additional event which\
      \ has a further minus or positive value connected to it. After several years\
      \ when Valentin turns 68 a combination of more vexing and taxing algorithms\
      \ are added making a complete chore to keep the 6 attributes evenly spread.\
      \ \n\nYour then presented with the question if longevity is really worth the\
      \ aim, especially now that the quality of life has diminished. Your starting\
      \ goal of wanting to keep him alive, will soon be replaced by the lack on new\
      \ experiences, instead constantly reliving negative already experienced events.\
      \ The earlier reminiscent and cherished memories of your wife pulling you through\
      \ troubled times, your parents setting up the man you are today and your sense\
      \ of accomplishment as you come to your relatives aid, has now completely vanished\
      \ to loneliness, to sorrow, to abandonment. An originally priced $2.00 game\
      \ that banquets the longevity vs quality euthanasia issue to you.\n\nHowever\
      \ thoughtful Brazilian developer Locomotivah thought he was, his propaganda\
      \ seems extremely one-sided. I went to a party once in real life and was surprised\
      \ that amongst the middle age was a 99-year-old there. On the table, drinking\
      \ 'Peach Schnapps', entertaining us with jovial tales of the war. Even when\
      \ she turned 100, she was still adventurous enough to travel in a hot air balloon.\
      \ Discussing with her at that party she told me her motto to life. She never\
      \ focused on the things that she could not control like that negative algorithm\
      \ of ageing, or the negative events of her life that she could not control.\
      \ Instead she focused on the things she COULD control, that is, 'the way she\
      \ viewed things,\u2019 choosing to embrace everything as new experiences. Regardless\
      \ if it was something mundane like Vegemite on toast or a new song she could\
      \ hum to and carry with her outside.  It was the new experiences she herself\
      \ kept creating that made longevity a noble pursuit. On the flip side with this\
      \ game having very few events attached, unfortunately that noble inspirational\
      \ message is missed with this very thinned somewhat pessimistic view.\n\nBelow\
      \ full game from me...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BQCxJ4Air-g\n\nIf you enjoyed reading\
      \ this review feel free to subscribe to my curator page. Thanks...\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/6843548/"
