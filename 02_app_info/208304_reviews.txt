I drove it this week for the first time in maybe 7 or 8 years and was surprised how much I enjoyed it, and how well it has stood the test of time.  The included trains are of course very old but I replaced them with more modern train releases in the scenarios.  I also use this route for testing mods that I make to trains.  It's super stable and gives fantastic frames.  You probably already own it as it comes with most versions of TS, but if not, it's definitely worth 6 quid!","timestamp_created":1600026326,"timestamp_updated":1600026326,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv4bAxPQCe/rQoQI="}
