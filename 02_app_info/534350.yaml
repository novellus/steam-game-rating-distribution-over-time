    review: First of all one of the main reasons why I bought this game is because
      Im a really big fan of the Caesar series. This is not as awesome as the third
      or fourth one of those in particular but nonetheless. Its still worth buying
      for the low price if you really love that memorabilia as opposed to this one
      being Ancient Rome and its second instalment and that being with an exception
      thats if that is the case if but apart from that its accurately speaking probably
      not worth the amount of 8 dollars unless of course the price has been reduced
      over time in which case it should be ok. Far out stuff totally.
