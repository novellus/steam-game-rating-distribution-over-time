Try this until it works, lowering the resolution each time.\n\nIf you however do not care for bugs and just want to have a fun time, or play with friends with multiple controllers or by streaming your keyboard, then go ahead and buy it. \nI personally would recommend waiting for discounts.\nThis is a very subjective review, do not abide by this.","timestamp_created":1609933113,"timestamp_updated":1609933310,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg5ng6/YCfvP8wAI="}
