    review: 'In its current state it''s a very throwaway, overpriced attempt at a
      rogue-lite. Feels like it has a great base to it that could be moulded into
      something cool but at the moment it''s not there.


      There''s no real opening exposition or establishment of atmosphere, the game
      rushes players in very quickly. The writing is trying to be thematic but it
      still has a very undeveloped tone. Not much character depth, like there''s some
      tone and personality to the character dialogue but it feels superficial. Minimal
      establishment of the world and why you''re here doing what you''re doing. Why
      is the butler even helping you. Absolutely nothing is established.


      The combat is extremely weak. Basically, move in circles to avoid orange balls
      while aiming your flashlight at the enemy to drain its health to death. There''s
      no actual physical interaction or any form of interaction with enemies, you
      just aim the light at them to drain their health. Extremely unengaging and unsatisfying,
      it''s barely passable as a combat system when all you do is hold a hitbox in
      the direction of an enemy so their health ticks down. You don''t shoot or swing
      or smash or anything, literally all you do is look in the direction of the enemy
      until they die. It''s really difficult to even tell what you''re taking damage
      to most of the time, area effects that aren''t telegraphed or visibly obvious
      are the main danger.


      The overall atmosphere is also very weak. If this game was much, much darker
      in terms of lighting it would look so much better as an old mansion. The bedsheet
      ghosts that spit orange balls, the hooded ghosts with grabby hands, imps and
      lady hooded ghosts look terrible. Goofy Halloween props, they don''t actually
      look like ghosts at all and the noises they make are equally silly. But it''s
      not silly in a way that is appealing, it''s just silly as in not immersive or
      thematically consistent. Really confusing how the upgrade area the fountain
      leads to is literally the front of the house but its some kind of alternate
      dimension that isn''t the front of the house. Even something so simple as the
      fact that players collect crystals as upgrade materials. Generic unexplained
      crystals that you find as drops or growing on scenery are just not a very thematic
      or fitting element to have in an old mansion.


      The actual house itself looks nice yet at the same time is very visually chaotic
      with all the different patterns and whatever, not much consistency with the
      interior decorating. The red banners and carpets don''t fit the theme of the
      spooky haunted house, rich crimson is just such an aggressive active colour
      for what''s meant to be a decrepit ghostly place.


      It certainly feels like the idea of this game and the very very basic foundation
      of it has the potential to be something cool. But even ignoring the developers
      shaky history; the shallow combat, lack of exposition or worldbuilding, awkwardly
      silly enemies and visual inconsistencies in the environment, passable but still
      uninspiring dialogue. There''s just so much here that is just misguided and
      not on point for a rogue-lite or for a pseudo-macabre haunted mansion styled
      world, I don''t have the confidence that the developer could overhaul all of
      this. If they got this far with the game in its current state, then it means
      they aren''t looking to really change what''s already here and instead are just
      planning to add more of this type of content to the game.


      Only had to play one floor to encounter repeated rooms, charging twenty dollars
      from this out of the gate is yet again very misguided and generally discouraging.
      I don''t have enough confidence with the idea of this game being overhauled
      to trust the developer with twenty dollars I could spend on anything else.'
