During the first section I thought it would just be a horror game where you have to constantly run from the enemy, and not much past that. But I really enjoyed the story, I usually don't care about story when its presented in this way but this was actually cool. And the art direction/aesthetic was super cool too!","timestamp_created":1600207381,"timestamp_updated":1600207381,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oNzyyfQCeIiJogI="}
