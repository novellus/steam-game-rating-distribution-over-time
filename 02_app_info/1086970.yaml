    review: "[b]What this game does better than the first:[/b]\n\nLiza has more animations\
      \ and sprites in general, which I very much enjoy given I think the art style\
      \ is one of the strong points of these games.\n\nThe health system is better\
      \ than the first, you have pretty forgiving iframes when being hit a lot and\
      \ gain back temp health, and eventually permanent hp by killing. (fuck the stunning\
      \ btw) This health system is especially useful when later in the game you're\
      \ guaranteed to get hit and the only thing thats conductive to survival is KILLING\
      \ THE FUCK OUT OF EVERYTHING AROUND YOU 24/7.\n\nI like the look of a lot of\
      \ the enemies in this one more, as well as it actually having unique bosses\
      \ which are pretty fun fights and with cool designs. More enemy types as well.\n\
      \nNo more ammo, your primary is pretty much just free to fire constantly. Your\
      \ secondary generally has a cooldown and can only be used a couple times before\
      \ waiting for more charges. But this way makes the combat in-game a lot better\
      \ imo even if I find the weapons in this one lacking. Additionally weapons are\
      \ now unlockable and chosen prior to levels which go on until the very end without\
      \ shopping in-between waves.\n\nI think the soundtrack in this one is better,\
      \ personally that is. They both have great sound tracks though just very repetitive\
      \ as the levels drag on.\n\n[b]What the first game does better than this one:[/b]\n\
      \nI would like to personally speak with the dev and have an insight into what\
      \ the FUCK crack rocks he was smoking while developing this. Im sorry but genuinely\
      \ some of the most blaring, lazy, and just BAD game design ruins a pretty core\
      \ part of the game. \n\nWhats that you ask? The fucking slot machines, whats\
      \ money even used for in this game? IDK at the end of levels you have to watch\
      \ a WAY WAY too long animation of a stock unity store truck asset sucking money\
      \ out of you while you're replaying the last animations you had the whole time\
      \ (including firing weapons). You can hold m1 to speed it up, but its still\
      \ an easy like 30 god damn seconds at the end of each level for MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT.\n\
      \nThe ONLY way to unlock weapons in this one is via these slot machines, and\
      \ you have to get lucky and roll all 3 of the same symbol. These are literally\
      \ the most disgusting slot machine models ive ever seen holy shit why couldnt\
      \ you have just drawn and animated something yourself. But this means that you\
      \ can go fucking forever without having any new weapons, theres probably still\
      \ weapons I havent found yet but I cant be bothered. On top of these random\
      \ weapons, literally like half the ones I tried are dumpster fire trash. The\
      \ only good ones are the ak/flamethrower with the big laser zap microwave gun\
      \ thing. Everything else sucks MASSIVELY and is just unfun to use. Seriously\
      \ go fuck yourself I see why you didnt model Lizas weapons on her BECAUSE YOU\
      \ DIDNT EXPECT THE PLAYER TO EVER FUCKING GET THEM OR ACTUALLY USE THEM BECAUSE\
      \ THEY ARE SO GARBAGE.\n\nOh yeah 99% of the time from those slot machines?\
      \ You get a random, colorless, low poly unity store asset. Collect all 71 to\
      \ 100% the game. Not only that but you can get the same ones multiple times,\
      \ AND for SOME reason they put these as physics objects in the helicopter area\
      \ you select missions. I wonder if its possible to lag the fuck out and perma\
      \ crash a save with all the physics shit spazzing out if you sell your soul\
      \ to this game long enough. The dev literally put more effort into the achievement\
      \ descriptions than this entire system. Actual garbage and kind of ruins everything\
      \ outside the actual core gameplay but even then your weapon choices are at\
      \ the mercy of RNG. \n\nAdditionally, this game is bugged as fuck. DONT hold\
      \ down fire for either weapon while doing melee dashes (which suck shit) or\
      \ your gun gets stuck perma firing in the last direction you had it until you\
      \ spam click it unstuck. ESPECIALLY annoying with secondaries.\n\nYeah the melee\
      \ dashes suck ass too, its some literal dark souls 1 directional rolling mechanics.\
      \ You dash in the direction you move, which is harder to do in a sea of enemies\
      \ rather than just flicking your mouse really quick. Theres like no stamina\
      \ bar or indicator on when you can dash, you just can do it sometimes and sometimes\
      \ you'll end up dashing like 2 or 3 times back to back which is weird as hell.\
      \ On top of having a distinct lack of iframes at the end of dashes with the\
      \ inability to tell when/how many dashes you have often ends up getting you\
      \ stuck in enemies. But once again, hp is easier to get in this one.\n\nMy last\
      \ complaint is probably the way this game tries to prevent you getting surrounded\
      \ and 1 shot with no hope, basically when your hp is low enough it seems getting\
      \ hit will knock you in the air, usually iframes cover you until you land and\
      \ can quickly kill enemies to heal. BUT, and ESPECIALLY in the later levels\
      \ where you have next to no breathing room. You'll get bounced up in the air,\
      \ only to land back in the middle of enemies who then get 100% free hits on\
      \ you as you're stuck in a stupid animation meant to save you. My only deaths\
      \ in this game came from this happening because as long as you can shoot stuff,\
      \ you wont die. IT IS HELPFUL sometimes and is preferable to just being 1 shot\
      \ by getting surrounded since you spend 99% of the game surrounded. Just this\
      \ is the most frustrating and out of your control way to die is when this system\
      \ breaks.\n\nI am not kidding dev, you are an absolute god damn bonafide clown\
      \ and I want you to make a third of these games with just the good bits and\
      \ not the bad. I will buy. im sorry no h8.\n\n10/10 I love it and you."
