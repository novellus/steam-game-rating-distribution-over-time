    review: "Going from punching an enemy in the nuts to throwing another guy off\
      \ a rooftop seeing them spin a billion times like a ninja star is what I love\
      \ about Watchmen: The End is Nigh. Sure combat is easy, but it's fun and can\
      \ be brutal, it just comes together to make a simplistic yet awesome feeling\
      \ combat system, only downside is counters, while everything else is pretty\
      \ easy to do the counters were hard for me to actually get working, seemed random.\
      \ \n\nI'd recommend this game, but it is short and can be repetitive as combat\
      \ is what you'll mostly be doing. If you can get passed this and like Watchmen\
      \ and even beat 'em ups I'd for sure recommend this, but mainly as a time killer\
      \ or a \"in between\" sorta game. Try to find it on sale."
