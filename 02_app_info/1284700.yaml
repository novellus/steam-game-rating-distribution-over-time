    review: "It's one of those games that are way more frustrating than fun.  It starts\
      \ out nicely enough, but by stage 3 and onward, it becomes just repeating frustration\
      \ of trial and error.  \n\nThe \"observation\" mini-game is okay at first, then\
      \ it starts to sprinkle random crap to make it confusing.  Luckily, there are\
      \ power-ups to skip this.  Then comes the worst part: the level design.  These\
      \ are some of the most irritating level designs I've seen.  And once I've started\
      \ to feel like I am getting used to it, the game throws in more stupid obstacles\
      \ that makes it even more frustrating.  As a matter of fact, \"frustration\"\
      \ is the word that keeps popping into my head while playing this.  Any semblance\
      \ of fun that could be had in this game is overwhelmed by repeated frustration.\n\
      \nBut you know what's worse than a bad game?  A bad game that is needlessly\
      \ long.  By stage 6, I just wanted to beat this game and move on.  But it kept\
      \ going.  I knock out one frustrating level, and then there was another one,\
      \ and another one, and another until I am completely fed up with it.  I tend\
      \ to forgive a lot of things for anime tiddies, but even that has limits.\n\n\
      tl;dr There's no fun here, just frustration."
