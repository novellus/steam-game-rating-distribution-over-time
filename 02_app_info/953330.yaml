    about_the_game: "Thyrian Defenders is a vertical shooter with a modern progression\
      \ structure and tons of satisfying upgrades. To advance you must do more than\
      \ survive.<br />\r\nEach level has four specific objectives that require different\
      \ strategies to complete, which makes repeated playthroughs a joy. As the hotshot\
      \ space pilot Taz, you\u2019ll take control of the Titan, a small star fighter\
      \ with surprising firepower.<br />\r\nBut if you want to unlock its full potential\
      \ you\u2019ll have to collect Gold Parts and purchase hundreds of incremental\
      \ upgrades in order to improve 8 different ship components. You\u2019re going\
      \ to need that firepower in order to liberate the Thyrian galaxy from mysterious\
      \ invaders called the Exodon.<br />\r\nLuckily you\u2019ll make friends along\
      \ the way who aide your fight with the unique wingman feature."
