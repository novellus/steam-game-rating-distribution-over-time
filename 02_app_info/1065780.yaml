      notes: "Run Gun Die is a shooter that includes levels comprised of cartoon violence.\
        \  \r\n\r\nAll characters and enemies can be set on fire, explode in cartoon\
        \ bones, ragdoll or show only lower torso at death. \r\n\r\nEnemies will attack\
        \ with varying weapons from swords, guns, magic spells, fire, ice, lava and\
        \ acid. There are also traps set that will spring spears, saws, lava and acid.\
        \ \r\n\r\nOther than the \"death\" where the lower torso is left there is\
        \ no visual representation of impalement, gun shot wounds or burns.\r\n\r\n\
        There is no nudity and there are no depictions of sex, drug or alcohol use."
