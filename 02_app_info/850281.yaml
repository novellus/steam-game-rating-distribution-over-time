    review: 'This is actually 56 minutes long and it''s good. Some of the tracks evoke
      the atmosphere of the game pretty nicely, which is what I bought this for. The
      highlights are "The Town," "Main Theme," "Jotunn Theme," "Into The Night," "A
      Second Midday Shopping Spree." The rest is a very nice bonus. I recommend listening
      to this with headphones.


      About the game: Shoppe Keep 2 is a casual relaxing game along the lines of Farm
      Together. The gameplay is completely different, but the feel is the same. You
      do what you want, when you want it. You are not pressed for time, you pick your
      own objectives, etc in an amusing, non-intrusive game world.'
