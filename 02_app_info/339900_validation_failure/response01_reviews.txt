This is still a dog's breakfast of a game, in fact it is one of the worst violations of programming I have ever seen on Steam.\n\nThe developer is a single teenage looking Russian who seems to be largely google translator dependant. His customer skills are hardly praiseworthy. He continues to argue with me that this game is close to perfect and that there is nothing wrong with it. I assure everyone reading this that my computer easily surpasses the game's system minimum requirements and that all my drivers are up to date and so is my window system. Regardless of this, the developer informs me that he has loaded this game on 5 separate computers and that all the levels worked after several tries. Keynote here 'Several tries'. For me to gain access to level 4 which use to be level 5 I have had to reload it 35 times!!!\n\nYou can kill yourself still by walking into several desks. You can get yourself trapped in corners. You can jump onto a table and onto a monitor and stick your head through the roof. You can still get yourself stuck in several doorways and on level 4 every door will take you ten minutes to twenty minutes to open because of rage inducing pick lock game it has running. The 'impossible game' is much easier and fun than this.\n\nWhile the developer has fixed a LOT of bugs there are still countless many more, but he will have no hear of it because the game is PERFECT! In truth it should be stated to be in early access but the developer believes he is finished with it. If the game was to have those error signs and purple patchwork symbols you get in gmod, this game would be so littered with them it would be a garbage dump. \n\n\nThe story! Youâ€™re in an office block with the infamous Zodiac killer who looks like a zombie carrying a knife. The office block use to be in space, but the developer seems to be closing up those references, maybe because that was the surprise ending? Or maybe because the Zodiac killer no longer lives in the Zodiac? I'm not sure, I have never got past level 4 and don't think I have the patience too with all those ridiculous door locks. Plus the game crashes at level 4 when you try to enter doors so you cannot progress anyway. You run around collecting pills or you will fall asleep. You solve puzzles by reading the codes which are laid out next to the things you need to put the codes into. No thought needed to get through this game. The real enemies to the game are still the bugs and crashes and not the psychopath running around. \n\nGmod is not free - but is still more value for money than this game. I have also played better hassle free maps on there than what this game offers you. Any game is better than this game. 4pm is better than this game and I hated 4pm.\n\nDeveloper needs to fire himself from making any more games and go back to delivering pizza's or whatever he was doing before making games... \n\nhttp://youtu.be/Cug4jrUPl00\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please subscribe to my curator page.
