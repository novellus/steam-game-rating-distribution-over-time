I got it for the cute girls tbh, and I'm disappointed.  \n\nYou think they would try to put a somewhat decent story in here but it's just a vapid excuse to have a couple of JPGS of the cutely drawn girls.\n\nThis is legit worse than Sakura Spirit.  At least stuff actually happened in that game.  here, it's dull, boring, and awful.\n\nIf I had paid full price for this, my head would have exploded. Getting the trading cards for this game and then never turning it on again.\n\nAvoid this game like the plague.","timestamp_created":1606027018,"timestamp_updated":1606027018,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.530549347400665283","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8e+q9/UCepXprwI="}
