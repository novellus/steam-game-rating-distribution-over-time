    review: 'So, this is designed for 3-4 players, level 3. Some of the monsters in
      the encounter IMO aren''t... balanced for small parties. Unless you have A LOT
      of spellcasters.

      Trying not to be TOO SPOILERY but this dungeon is definitely designed for parties
      made heavily of Spellcasters, and the group I DM''d it for didn''t know that,
      so we had an ineffective fighter, and rogue for the whole dungeon and it was
      pretty un-fun. :/ Just my 2c. But eh, at least it was only 3 dollars spent,
      and lesson learned.'
