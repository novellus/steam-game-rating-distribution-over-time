    review: "If you like creative, weird, or experimental games, give this a try.\
      \ If you manage to last past the first boss, you'll find a wildly creative game\
      \ with a lot of unique ideas and charm. Be warned though, if you require polish\
      \ and consistency in your games you probably won't enjoy Blessed Surface. But\
      \ if you can bear a little jank, there's a lot of fun to be had here.\n\nThis\
      \ game is really weird and really janky. Almost everything in the game is confusing\
      \ when you first encounter it, and it's even kind of hard to figure out how\
      \ to get out of the very first room in the game. For me, a big part of my enjoyment\
      \ with the game is encountering new and strange things and experimenting with\
      \ them to try and understand them. I've found food that turns all your projectiles\
      \ into ghost monkeys, a monster heart that gives me wings and spawns homing\
      \ crystal barriers, centipede monsters that you can ride on to get around quickly,\
      \ and a lot more. There's so much here, and every time I launch the game I find\
      \ something new, even in previously explored areas.\n\nThe combat seems awkward\
      \ and simple at first, but after you get used to it and make a good build it\
      \ becomes very enjoyable. It's still awkward and janky, but the variety of enemy\
      \ and weapon behaviours combine with the heart system and environments to create\
      \ some really engaging and unique fights. \n\nThe world is expansive and strange,\
      \ with weird creatures and items scattered around many distinct areas. Very\
      \ little is locked away in the traditional metroidvania sense (asides from literal\
      \ locks that can be opened with common generic keys dropped by enemies) and\
      \ you can go almost anywhere as long as you can figure out how to get there\
      \ without dying to the local wildlife.\n\nIn short, Blessed Surface is a strange\
      \ and confusing gem. It's got a really rough start which I think contributes\
      \ to its relatively low review score, but for all its roughness it has a lot\
      \ of great qualities. I think it's a shame that this game which obviously has\
      \ had so much love put into it has been so overlooked and so poorly rated by\
      \ the few that did notice it. If you like weirdness and don't mind jank, give\
      \ it a shot. You might play it for an hour and decide it's not for you, or,\
      \ as in my case, you might find the most memorable game you've played in a while.\n\
      \n\nAs a side note, there seems to be a decent amount of content in the game\
      \ as well. As of writing this review I've played 6.9 hours, and have only beaten\
      \ 2 out of the 10 bosses. EDIT: I just \"finished\" the game (in that I got\
      \ the ending, there's still quite a lot of unfinished business and unanswered\
      \ questions which I am definitely going to spend a lot more time on) and wanted\
      \ to edit my review slightly. I played the game in a weird order, where I explored\
      \ as much as possible before beating bosses. This meant that I could beat the\
      \ remaining 8 bosses in a pretty short time. I just wanted to add that so my\
      \ review isn't misleading about how long it takes to get the ending. Even though\
      \ I've gotten the ending, I plan to continue playing for a while. There are\
      \ a lot of things I still don't understand about the game, and there are some\
      \ puzzles I and to solve and side quests I want to complete. Overall, really\
      \ great game. It doesn't deserve its current steam rating at all."
