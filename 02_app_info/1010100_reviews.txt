But the amount of content in this game is so small that it is more like a tech-demo, not a proper game. Let's describe issues in detail.\n\n1. The gameplay and controls\nWhile the controls and flying mechanic feels mostly OK (played on Vive) there are many things which could be done better. The combat area is big and empty and most of the time you close the distance. Stationary enemies always spawns too far, while the moving ones are always on your tail no matter how fast you where flying. Fast in-game movement is cancelled out by the distances.\nThere are static obstacles floating around but they don't participate in a gameplay. It is not feasible to hide behind them and there is no challenge to navigate through them like through some asteroid belt. They don't work as decorations as well: all obstacles looks the same - providing no distinct memorable points on a level.\nThe shooting doesn't feel rewarding: the sound and visual effects are not \"crunchy\". The boosted shot sound is quieter than a regular shot - why?!\nSights feel useless especially when boosted mode is active and that floating magical rune on a muzzle obstructing the view. The tracer effects of regular shots are white making them hard to see against the background. The overall short length of pistols makes it even harder to aim.\nTypical engage distances feels too far for the weapons: you always forced to fly closer before shooting and new enemies are always spawned all across the combat area. The enemies either small or fast making it hard to hit without \"spray and pray\". At least that feels inline with useless sights...\n\n2. The content\nCan't decide what to name first. The game is lacking content on every single aspect: there is not many types of enemies, very few weapons, no singleplayer campaign nor story, the levels are empty with no memorable landmarks or decorations. Game feels engaging first 3 minutes and then it becomes repetitive and boring. No matter how many enemies you killed - the area remains filled with foes providing no sense of progress. And then it suddenly says \"level X completed\" when you killed some predefined number of enemies. The game offers you to replay the same level again and again with gradually increasing difficulty and that's it. No interesting locations, no story, no meta-game with upgrades and loot.\n\nTL;DR\nThe price is way to high for what game offers. With so little content it is a glorified tech demo at most, not a proper game. Going to ask a refund.\n","timestamp_created":1608429617,"timestamp_updated":1608429617,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49of4vvYCcfrKuwI="}
