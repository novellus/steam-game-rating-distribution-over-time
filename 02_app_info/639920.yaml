    review: 'The puzzles in this game are ok. Not amazing but not bad either. Unfortunately
      the game really doesn''t feel very polished and it is a little buggy. Objects
      sometimes float in midair when you release them and other times they drop to
      the floor. Of particular annoyance, I tried the larger rooms since teleport
      was added to the game, but I reached one room and the teleport stopped working
      properly so I couldn''t progress any further.


      If the bugs were removed and the game polished up a bit, I would recommend this
      game to someone who is really into escape/puzzle room games, but if you''re
      not fussed either way, this isn''t a particularly special VR game and you''re
      not missing out.


      Would I recommend this game to a friend? No. But if they really felt the urge
      to try it, I wouldn''t warn them against it either.'
