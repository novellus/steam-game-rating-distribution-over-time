      \ A Glass Room by Pol Clarissou (France) showcases pictures and animated sequences\
      \ from Pol Clarissou\u2019s own life. The flickering photographs projected on\

      \ device. <br><br>[Game 5] The Worm Room by Everest Pipkin (USA) is a first-person\
      \ exploration game which exists as a series of endless glass greenhouses that\
      \ the player may wander through for the same reasons one visits a physical botanical\
      \ garden; to walk, to take in beauty, to learn."
