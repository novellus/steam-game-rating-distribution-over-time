    review: "[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers[/h1]\n\nYou\
      \ can watch my review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/VQWYp-W-4JM\n\nThis\
      \ game is now free to play. I actually paid $3.74 USD back in the Steam Spring\
      \ Sale 2018 and it originally retailed for $14.99 USD, which is difficult for\
      \ me to believe because this game is not good at all. In fact, the more that\
      \ I played this game, the more that I grew to dislike this game. After one hour,\
      \ I don't ever want to play this game and I'm going to uninstall it.\n\nIt's\
      \ not the worst game. So you may want to check it out regardless if you have\
      \ time to waste. However, I should warn you that this  game is subpar as far\
      \ as racket games in VR go. I would recommend Racket NX or Holoball over this\
      \ effort, even though they are not free to play.\n\nThe physics on this is just\
      \ not realistic or satisfying. The rackets almost feel like they bend when you\
      \ swing them to hit the ball as if they are made out of papier-m\xE2ch\xE9.\
      \ It just feels clunky and weird playing this game. There are several mini-games\
      \ to play, but most of them feel like exactly the same game. In any event, I\
      \ didn't find any of them fun. Also, most of the action happens behind you (at\
      \ least on the Oculus Rift).\n\nThere is also a voiced-narrator in this game\
      \ that tells what seems like a joke a minute. However, most of the jokes just\
      \ fall flat. And several lines are repeated. After an hour, you'll probably\
      \ want to strangle the narrator.\n\n[b]Rate 4.5/10. On one hand, I feel sorry\
      \ for the devs because they obviously made this game free to play because not\
      \ many people bought it and thus didn't make enough of a return on their investment\
      \ of time and labor. On the other hand, it's kind of crappy that they didn't\
      \ keep their promises on updating this game.[/b]"
