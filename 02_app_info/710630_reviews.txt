What this game does is drop two players into a playground for a chaotic mess of hilarity with light hearted throwing dynamite at one another, exploring together to find an elusive unicorn, or just partaking in the ancient alchemy of converting coal into gold using slot machines.  This game really is about doing whatever you want with a loosely defined structure.\n\nI did notice there to be a high sensitivity issue with the keyboard controls, so using a controller is a far superior experience.  Tutorialization isn't completely obvious so first time players, make sure to turn the settings on.  If the game appears to be lagging, try setting the graphics setting lower.  This will not sacrifice graphics quality all that much while still delivering a fun experience.\n\nAs it stands, you will get about an hours worth of content playing by yourself, but this game is meant for emergent play with a friend where you can play as much and as long as you want.  If you don't often have a friend around or prefer playing alone, the price point may be steep (get it during the sale!), but if you want to have a fun time with a friend, this game will definitely deliver an amusing experience.","timestamp_created":1509237696,"timestamp_updated":1509237696,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4PTkst8Cf6rYiQE="}
