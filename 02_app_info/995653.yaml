    review: "Greetings!  Today we will be looking at the cosmetic DLC \u201CServo\
      \ Commissar-Skull\u201D a little flying skull with a Commissar Hat and a \u201C\
      Cigar\u201D in the mouth.  Cosmetic pets are no stranger to ARPGs but is this\
      \ one worth the $2?  Let\u2019s find out.\n\nSummary Execution:  The little\
      \ skull does exactly what the other ones do, flies around and sometimes circles\
      \ other NPCs without really doing anything but having them look at him.  There\
      \ are no voice lines, no buffs or really even any lighting effects.  Really\
      \ I find such a potentially flavorful pet to be a bit disappointing.\n\nOverall,\
      \ I\u2019d skip this unless you are just a completionist and much have all the\
      \ DLC.  If that is the case then wait for a sale or grab it in a bundle.  Such\
      \ as shame I\u2019d love a mechanical voice Commissar yelling at me constantly.\
      \  Enjoy!\n"
