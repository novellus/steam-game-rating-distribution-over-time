There are wacky physics situations so there will be plenty of minute controlling otherwise the ball will get launched.  However, its easier to \"feel\" the direction and weight and the end goals do have a very very small gravity pull so it's not rage inducing.  If you're looking for a short puzzler, this works, especially for the price tag.","timestamp_created":1608434544,"timestamp_updated":1608434544,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2O2Kv/YCcvjMuwI="}
