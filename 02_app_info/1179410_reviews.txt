I feel like I gave it an honest try. But in the end it's just not an enjoyable enough experience to continue playing. The developer is great. He responds to feedback and frequently updates the game. But at it's core it doesn't make me want to play more of it.\n\nPros: \nThe controls and combat feel great\n\nCons:\nThe levels are basically the same thing over and over and they only way they scale is through more hp and more damage for the monsters.\n The loot does not scale accordingly, nor is there enough of it to truly call it lootcraft. There is a potion that increases rarity of item drops by 4% for 6 minutes. But I can easily go 10-15 minutes without finding any weapons or armor to take advantage of that benefit.\n\nThe bosses are just scaled up versions of the monsters in the normal levels. The only technique to beating them is wearing down their enormous amounts of health.\n\nLevel ups don't really make you any stronger or give you more attack power.\n\nMany of the monsters heal each other, and when combined with already high health they can take forever to kill. This wouldn't be so bad but there is a hidden timer that causes a poison cloud to come in and start killing you if you take too long on the levels. \n\nOverall, I had enough fun personally to spend $8 but I might not have made the purchase if I knew I wouldn't finish the game out of frustration.","timestamp_created":1576368939,"timestamp_updated":1576368939,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/6O6g+8CcYOx5AE="}
