I also understand that is not possible. I purchased the leaderboard DLC as well and BOTH of these applications worked on 2 different computers.\n\nOne has an i9-9900k with a 2080 ti\nthe other has a ryzen 7 3800x and a 2070 super.\n\nNo issues on either. I am recommending it because it's free (duh) and the leaderboard was nice to see where I am. I noticed others had the same issue of bottlenecking as me.","timestamp_created":1593360925,"timestamp_updated":1593361647,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42ajw/fICfbCJkQI="}
