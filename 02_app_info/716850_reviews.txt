Comparing with the images on the shop page, I realize that I don't get the \"completed\" screen once I finish a level, there's just an abrupt jump to the start of the following level. That must be the point where also the saving process should be taking place. Pretty uninteresting to play the first level over and over again, each time I restart the game. :(","timestamp_created":1543012780,"timestamp_updated":1543013005,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586766839027404785","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47L6voecCeceIsgE="}
