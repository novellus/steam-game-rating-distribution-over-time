Your ship shoots automatically and you move by using the mouse only, I should also mention there is no controller support.  There are also barely to no settings except music. sound, and preset visual quality.\n\nThe concept is there, I like how theree is online co-op, not too many shumps nowawdays with online capabilities.  Too many \"if only...\"'s with this game...\"if only\" this where fleshed out more and were turned into an actually shump, with proper controls and more variety in everything, this game would be really great.  \n\nI hate saying this, but I honestly feel you shouldn't purchase this game.  It falls short in many areas and does not justify the current price tag.  If you really want the game, get it at 75% off or something, not at 50%, 40%, 30%, etc...not worth it.","timestamp_created":1455969519,"timestamp_updated":1455969519,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.650926709175109863","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42fii/9ICcoezUQ=="}
