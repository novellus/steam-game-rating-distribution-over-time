    short_description: Battle it out on the proving grounds and get ready for Future
      Wars. Similar to classic titles such as Advance Wars and Battle Isle, the game
      takes strategy gaming away from the micro-management overkill that it has become
      and using simple, proven rock-paper-scissors principles, reopens the genre to
      everyone.
