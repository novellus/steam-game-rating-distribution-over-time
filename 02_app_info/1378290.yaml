    short_description: The Citadel is a brutal first person shooter, and a love letter
      to classic games such as Marathon, Doom and Wolfenstein 3d. Descend into the
      depths of a dark citadel, and fight through 6 Episodes and 30 levels of action
      packed with 6 challenging bosses. Go forth, Martyr.
