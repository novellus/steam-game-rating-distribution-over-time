This movie was critically acclaimed, people went wild for it, but I was hesitant to purchase it for a long time due to my thinking that this may be some ultra-weebish slice of life flick (it's not). So I was waiting for the winter sale, hoping it would be on sale, but it wasnt. I caved in and purchased it anyway, and I am glad that I finally did.\n\nThis movie just hits so many marks - The characters are great, believable, and real. The art work is astounding. The story is well paced and suitable for the narrative. The storyline, the writing, comes together brilliantly - unfortunately I do not want to say more than that for risk of any spoilers. But the feels are real. The soundtrack is pleasant. etc. etc. etc. I feel as though I could list pro' after pro while not being able to think of any con to the movie. \n\nIt is really a must have for anyone who enjoys anime, good movies, good stories, etc.\n","timestamp_created":1514861791,"timestamp_updated":1514861791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.567913949489593506","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48ZCz2uACeYTPlAE="}
