    developer_response: I'm sorry you had problems launching the DLC, I'm presently
      working on an update which will be posted soon. For now, if you right click
      on the app and choose 'properties' then go to the DLC tab, make sure the DLC
      is checked. Then when you launch it from Steam you can choose the free version
      or the DLC version.
