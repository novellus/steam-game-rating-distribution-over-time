Use your reflexes, dexterity and boss skills to conquer 81 levels of circle zapping madness.<br><br>Your task is to steer the spinning circles using various control methods, such as halting, reversing and skipping forward, in order to find a clear path to fire at the plasma ball hiding at the center of the circles. Hit the plasma ball enough times before the time runs out to win the level. Failure to do so results in your cannon being instantly blown up in retaliation. <br><br>Depending on how quickly and cleanly you finished the job, you are awarded one, two or three stars upon completion of each level.<br><br>The full version of the game spans nine worlds, each world containing nine levels and its own theme song to set the mood. <br><br>SpinZap starts off very easy, but grows harder for every world you conquer. In the end, you will need nerves of steel, perfect control and excellent timing to get the highest possible score.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Single-player vs co-op mode<\/h2>SpinZap was originally designed as a single-player game, but has turned out to be a lot of fun to play in local co-op mode.
