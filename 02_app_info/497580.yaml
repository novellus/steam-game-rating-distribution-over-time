    review: "This was definitely a very interesting game, and not what I had initially\
      \ though it was.  Just from looking at the title, I had assumed that the game\
      \ was about a secret agent going around in modern times to try and solve a mystery,\
      \ but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this took place during WWII.\
      \  \n\nThe game follows Agent Walker as she goes around trying to find a particular\
      \ magical item that could change the course of the war.  Of course the Axis\
      \ is there, trying to get the Spear from you at every turn in the game, but\
      \ then again, if they weren't there, there would be no opposing force to get\
      \ it from you.\n\nI really enjoyed how the setting took place during this time\
      \ period, and how each of the settings were incorporated into each other, like\
      \ the magical cave in the beginning was hidden away near a mineshaft.  All the\
      \ artwork and the designs were done beautifully and it is easy to tell a lot\
      \ of time went into making them.  The environments and settings were broken\
      \ up into different sections, and there would be sections to the game where\
      \ you can't back track.  It would make it much easier to focus on just a few\
      \ different areas instead of a plethora of places you can backtrack to and keep\
      \ track of. \n\nOf course that meant that you had to be vigilant about the collectibles\
      \ in the game since there would be parts you couldn't return to, but it made\
      \ it all the more worthwhile to get them all.  I really enjoyed how there were\
      \ figurines, items like the boats and the airplanes you could collect, and you\
      \ could find different pieces to the actual uniforms.  That made it very unique,\
      \ and I actually really enjoyed getting to see what each uniform looked like\
      \ when they were completed.  \n\nThe actual Hidden Object games also had variations\
      \ as well.  Like in the beginning, the first Hidden Object game had you click\
      \ items to gather crystals to get the Spear, but sometimes it would have you\
      \ collect pieces of a puzzle or something similar.  The variation definitely\
      \ helped to make things seem less monotonous, and added a bit more to the plot\
      \ and the difference in setting.  \n\nThe ending to the game was definitely\
      \ surprising.  Everything went well and the mission was completed, but this\
      \ is the first time I have ever come across a game where the main character's\
      \ safety wasn't guaranteed, and it is implied that she had given her life to\
      \ destroy this item.  Given the time period, it is very likely to have happened,\
      \ and made this much more different than other games since most games end on\
      \ a happy note with all the characters surviving.\n\nOverall, it is a very good\
      \ game and I would recommend playing it.  Well worth the price you pay for it."
