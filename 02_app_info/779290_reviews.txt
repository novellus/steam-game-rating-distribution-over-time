Charming art style and uncompromising gameplay make this a fun, albeit short experience. While the game has it quirks and an occasional bug it's not a deal-braker. The RPG elements are great. Turn based combat fits perfectly. It is not for today's ADHD generation that can't handle getting bashed if they make a bad move or lousy decision. But old school gamers will enjoy this. It has that rewarding feeling that most modern games lack.","timestamp_created":1609803606,"timestamp_updated":1609803606,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/7Tx5/YCdN/FwAI="}
