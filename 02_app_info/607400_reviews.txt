For keyboard all you have to rely on is arrow keys, thats it. There are abilities you can unlock in the game that will help you progress. Whole point of this game is simply, get out of there. Theres puzzles you have to solve with challenging obstacles which can be frustrating. Thats pretty much it, gameplay is short but it'll be hard to get by. I suppose that varies how much you progress, to me it wasnt easy. Still, feels good when you finish it.","timestamp_created":1604781696,"timestamp_updated":1604781696,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwKyc0vUCd+z+rAI="}
