The trailer gives a very good indication of gameplay. It's pretty straightforward. Nothing epic, not bad for an afternoon.\n\n34 levels, first playthrough will probably take >1h but <2h. Then there's some more abstract/tedious hidden stuff to keep you going for another 1h or so if you have the patience: there are actually 2 ways to \"beat\" each level, there's an alternate ending, and you'll have to scour the post-apocalyptic cult narrative-text to find some hidden info. The main challenge on a level is that most slidey/rotatey bits are locked until you manage to get light onto them. So you start with one light, need to shine it onto the next control-point to activate that, then need to reconsider the level now that you have more control over it, etc. And you can't see what's going on in the dark, of course.\n\nBacking out of a level resets it, functioning as an \"Undo\" though it isn't really necessary. Click-and-drag controls are sensible, but there's some weirdness, like when you have a note or the settings screen up, clicks can still register [i]behind[/i] them on the non-visible gameplay screen. Standard fare for small Unity devs, not too frustrating here.
