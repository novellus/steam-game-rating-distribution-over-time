There is no saving or level select, which wouldn't be an issue if the game did not crash or loaded the next level correctly.\n\nThe game is about twenty minutes long, but everyone reviewing it has 2 hours played, because it is impossible to avoid restarting the game from the beginning because of a soft-lock. Oh the crystal fell out of the map? Better restart from the beginning.\n\nThe demo released a year ago is just as buggy but missing a few connecting scenes. The game ends abruptly before it really even begins.\n\nHalf of the cutscenes do not trigger correctly. I had to play through the first stage several times and only got the enemies to spawn ONE time.\n\nI cannot recommend this game, unless you are a masochist or want a good laugh at what five years of someone's life looks like.\n\nAlso Hideo Kojima is credited in the game's introduction, but as far as I can tell he had no involvement.\n\n(There is another reviewer here who gave this a positive review, with one game in his library and has been a steam member for 19 hours. Real suspicious)","timestamp_created":1606759935,"timestamp_updated":1606760145,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517207026481628418","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1606764497,"developer_response":"Hey, thanks for the feedback. It’s super helpful on improving the overall experience.\n\nI could reassure you the scenes in the Launch trailer are all included within the early access version of the game. Please, let me know if there’s anything I missed and I’ll try my best to correct any issues. \n\nGame usually runs 2 to 3 hours if it’s your first play-through. As a reminder this is Episode I of a larger experience on the way. Thanks for your patience with any frustration in encountering bugs or glitches due to it being early access.\n\nThe demo released a year ago is a completely different experience. I can promise you that there have been many additional levels added and experiences that were never included in the demo. I hope to continue in expanding what we currently have in Early Access.\n\nI’m truly honored and humbled by your feedback and it has made the five year experience worth it all. Thank you. It helps me grow. \n\nAs a reminder Hideo Kojima is mentioned in the “special thanks” section of the credits. He has no involvement in the game development, but has been an inspiration."}],"cursor":"AoJ4hsSXjfYCf+X8tQI="}
