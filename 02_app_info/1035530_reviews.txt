It becomes complete mayhem with several dangerous items appearing or about to appear as you try to guide or bark the sheep away from danger!  The different play modes are fun, the visuals are bright and appealing, the music suitably frenetic and some cheesy voice acting is a nice addition.\n\nAlthough I recommend the game, it would certainly be better with improved controller support - it works fine for one person but doesn't recognise a second controller, and I didn't find the \"share controller\" feature worked very well.  Two players on the keyboard is sort of okay, depending on the keyboard and how many simultaneous key depressions it can handle.  Overall the controls do sometimes feel slightly sluggish, but not enough to seriously detract from the game.\n\nIn short if you have a few people in the house who want to play a game together, especially if some of them are young children, this is a great choice.","timestamp_created":1608751094,"timestamp_updated":1608751094,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj7PCyPYCd9DHvAI="}
