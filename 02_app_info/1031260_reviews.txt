I will not write as long and carefully constructed review as for the first one as I have a feeling, that this game do not deserve it.\nPros: Story - even though it is simple and predicable, it is fun and serve as motive enough to continue. I know, that there is not much of it, but it is far more than what is usual for JERPG\nHeroine - This time there are only two heroines, but each have its own character.\nMazes and secrets - Even more confusing than the last time and definitely more fun (this is a game after all)\n\nCons:\nAtmosfere - Previous game was a heroic quest with naive virgin (at least she act like one) heroine, who try her best to help the people, but even in bad predicaments she keep her dignity (mostly) and act like a heroine most of the time. This game is a heroic quest with a whore heroine who is either a submisive rugmat or nymphomaniac. What I like on the previous game was, that it was different from most of the game of this type by its lighthearthet tone with just a little of naughty fun. This time we get a standart erotic RPG. But it did not even going out full throthle (no pictures and full descirptions), so it even did not follow its promise of a lewd game. I do believe, that by this split personality will dissapoint everybody.\nCompanions - Definitely far less charismatic and fun than the last time. Last time the one, who was the \"bad guy\" of the group was just a mischievous prankster. This time it is just a cruel and vile old man with no redempting personality traits.\nFetish - Let´s say, that when I found walk of shame, I was disgusted. Some of the fetishes in the game are just over the top and I do not like it. But I do agree, that this is a personal preference\n\nResume:\nNaked and Funny - I like this group of games, because they are not disgusting (ok, serie blood and bikini is on the border of a knife, but...) and even though they handle their girls in very inappropriate way, they mostly keep it funny. But this one avoid it. Naked? Yes. Funny? Not much. All in all 4/10 game. As a game it is average (5 or 6/10), but atmosfere and lack of fun (and fun was most important part of previous game) push it down.","timestamp_created":1606376796,"timestamp_updated":1606376887,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rcLhgfYCeK7ssQI="}
