    reviews: "\u201CFor the price Abduction Bit is a fun little title that takes us\
      \ back to the arcade era of the 80s and does its uttermost best to ensure a\
      \ most authentic and historical correct experience. Next to the rather retro-looking\
      \ 8-bit graphics, the available sound effects will surely help you get that\
      \ feeling. The game comes with free DLC and the various map modes gives a lengthy\
      \ playtime or a nice short break time waster.\u201D<br>8.0 \u2013 <a href=\"\
