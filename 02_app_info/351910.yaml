      honorable death. You earned your place in the halls of Valhalla. <br>But when
      you knocked on its gates to receive your final reward, none answered. Odin has
      turned his back on your people. He underestimates the Viking spirit. He underestimates
      you.<br><br>Force their hand as you lead your people past the dangers waiting
      on Valhalla Hills and fight to prove your honor, your strength, your worthiness.
      Look after your Vikings, gathering food, chopping wood, and mastering the complex
      economics of wilderness survival. <br>Reach the portal at the top of each mountain,
      and shout your battle cry loud enough for the gods to hear.<br><br> If they
      will not give your people the reward you all deserve, then by your axe, you
      will take it from them.<br> <br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/351910/extras/Shop_features_v2.png?t=1578501348"

    review: "This game seemed lined up and ready for me to love it with its cute graphics\
      \ and strategy/builder genre. As someone who never minds a grind and enjoys\
      \ the simplicity of slowly building your own empire or gradually meeting a scenario's\
      \ requirements, I thought only time could stand in my way of eventually being\
      \ addicted. \n\nI was right. But instead of being faced with a learning curve,\
      \ I was disappointed to find that it just lacked basic gameplay structure. I\
      \ usually get annoyed at a tutorial for explaining the obvious and can't wait\
      \ to just learn by playing, but more clarification is needed in this game. It\
      \ tells you how to build X, but not how it will affect Y or Z. I spent way,\
      \ way too much time trying to figure out why my defenseless warrior wouldn't\
      \ pick up a weapon after having made a dozen, or why no one would deliver one\
      \ to him. Instead of being challenged I just became more frustrated. If this\
      \ was the only annoyance that would be one thing, but that frustration is shared\
      \ toward all aspects of the game as I began to realize I somehow understood\
      \ less than when I started.\n\nWhat it comes down to is Valhalla Hills being\
      \ a chore. You have to invest a good deal of time before *maybe* even liking\
      \ the game, which defeats the purpose of getting it in the first place. I got\
      \ this on sale for basically nothing, and still feel like I overpaid."
