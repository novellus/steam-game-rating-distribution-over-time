    short_description: "Entschuldigung (which means \u2018sorry\u2019 in German) is\
      \ a bleak horror story, told by a lost young man who longs to find a place in\
      \ which he can feel safe. Set in pre-war Berlin, the story is driven by an insatiable\
      \ curiosity that leads our protagonist down a very dark path into the murky\
      \ depths of his soul."

    developer_response: Hi there! Thank you for leaving a review, but I'm sorry to
      hear you were disappointed. I have just opened a discussion about the ending
      and would be very interested to hear more of your thoughts on it if you'd like
      to share them :)

    review: This game started out promising.  Though the screen is dark through much
      of the game, the soundtrack and writing kept me going.  Add some more visuals
      and the game would have been on my list of top stories until I reached the end.  The
      ending was awful.  I don't know what the devs were thinking having this as an
      ending.  There were so many directions they could have taken that would have
      been great.
