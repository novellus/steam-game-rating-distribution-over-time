    review: "This is an adaptation of an older business tycoon game called MAD TV\
      \ where you run a TV station and must achieve various goals to proceed through\
      \ the campaign game (or you can just do sandbox play if you want).   Instead\
      \ of being presented with a god-view and a bunch of menus, you have to walk\
      \ between rooms and then click on a tiny smartphone as your only real interface.\
      \ \n\nThe game concept isn't bad but the gameplay here is needlessly convoluted.\
      \   Having the game menus appear on tiny little smartphone devices (as you can\
      \ see in the screenshots) is painful, especially if you have a high resolution\
      \ monitor.  These guys did not learn about UI scaling when they were in community\
      \ college. \n\nGiven the game is a full 10 years old now and still riddled with\
      \ bugs and an unwieldy and unfun interface, there's no excuse for them to charge\
      \ $10 USD for this one.  I'd give this one a miss, plenty of other tycoon games\
      \ on Steam represent much better value for money."
