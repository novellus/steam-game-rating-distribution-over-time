    review: 'Great soundtrack, I love this kind of music. My favourite song very quickly
      became "Neverending Song - Violette''s Theme" thanks to her battle being timed
      to the track to incorporate rhythm elements to the combat.


      I found this game as the composer of three of the tracks is Garoad (see his
      other work in "VA-11 Hall-A" and "Yuppie Psycho"), and his music fits right
      in with STEEL_PLUS'' style. So I think I found another composer to follow in
      STEEL_PLUS.


      Only gripe is that the audio files are not tagged properly. I had to add track
      numbering and album art to the files myself, and the album art is not properly
      included with the files (i had to grab it from the store page)'
