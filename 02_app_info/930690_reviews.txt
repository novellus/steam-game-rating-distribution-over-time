I would have trouble recommending this game at the full price of $4.99 USD basically because of the limited content & quality of content. Don't get me wrong, this is a nice game for what it is, but it's just that ... nice.\n\nWhat is this game? It's honestly hard to describe. I hate to say it but a trial challenge is the best way to describe it, even though that's kind of vague. Maybe it's best to describe it as a challenge puzzle game. Meaning, the puzzles are not difficult to solve, but you have to learn the trick to beat the levels. Most of the challenging levels just come from having the correct reflexes, which means having the correct anticipation which usually means trial and error.\n\nYou have a wand in each hand and you teleport around the challenges and that's actually part of the challenge. You have to have certain spells ready as soon as you teleport. There's even gesture based spells. However, the main spell is the fire spell and you have to physically throw the fireball and you do have to throw it very hard to throw it any kind of long distance. Your arm will get tired .... BTW, are you ambidextrous?\n\nI did enjoy the challenge. Most of the levels are well-designed, but a few just felt like they went on a little bit too long. The water named level took me many attempts before I finally got it. The graphics were okay, the voices were subpar, and the game ran fine for me. Ultimately, I'm not really motivated to finish the game though. I think I would have enjoyed it more with full locomotion and smooth turning with a better throwing mechanic.\n\n[b]Rating 5.5/10.[/b]","timestamp_created":1544517311,"timestamp_updated":1544518199,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53271031379699707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47aydzucCeZmEtQE="}
