Based on my income it made sense to find a walk in place solution while gaming in VR chat, Rec Room, Pavlov, Alyx and Skryim. My first search led me to Kat Loco and while the price wasn't too steep, the system was out of stock. This led to a recommendation of Natural Locomotion and the intriguing possibility of walk in place via joy cons and an android smartphone. I picked up ankle straps for the joy cons and a little pouch for the andriod phone off of Amazon. I strapped everything in, calibrated the devices and it simply did not work the way I wanted it to. The hand movement option was great but walk in place was unusable. That's when i did some deeper digging and found VRocker. The hope I had in terms of movement in game was perfectly met. I sent back my straps and pouch to amazon and ended up spending far less that i anticipated to have my ideal experience.\n\nThe Good: Once calibrated, everything feels intuitive. The ui for settings is basic but easy to navigate. The demo/tutorial is fantastic. It's nice to have presets for popular games. I picked up a bhaptic vest and they pair flawlessly while both running. It's worth every penny of asking price.\n\nHope of Future: A way to navigate calibration settings in VR would be cool/ an automatic calibration  based on how you individually walk and run would set things over the edge. As of now there isn't an option to have your head turned one way while your feet continue in a different direction, some way to do this would be the cherry on the sundae.","timestamp_created":1608451723,"timestamp_updated":1608451723,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ477HMv/YCfIbTuwI="}
