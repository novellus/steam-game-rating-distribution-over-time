    review: 'Exceptional story telling through heavy use of layers and symbolism.
      The story isn''t shallow, don''t be fooled by the supernatural premise, it''s
      mature and delves into human psychology, behaviourism and mental illness. Beautiful
      portray of life in essence, where we''re often misunderstood, hurt, haunted
      by experiences from the past, unable to reciprocate love and communicate to
      one another.


      Very pleasant to look at art style, I usually don''t capture so many screenshots
      to look at them later and admire the work authors put into these drawings. Good
      soundtrack with fitting ambient atmosphere, although you could feel the limited
      budget here - please use more sound effects / background music in the future.


      I wholeheartedly recommend this one.


      edit: So few reviews, game not even rated. What a shame, such a unique experience.'
