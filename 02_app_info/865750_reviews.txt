The most notable feature of the game is its class system that makes each character unique and very versatile. Each character has five unique classes for each one, that is, there are a total of twenty classes, and each class has unique abilities that make you have a wide variety of play styles at all times. Also the classes level up with the character, and you get all the classes almost at the beginning of the game, so you don't need to grind like crazy because you want to play with a class but it has very little level, nor do you have to wait until more than half of the game to unlock a certain class, everything is in your power of decision and how you want to play from the beginning. You can change classes at any time outside of battle. There is also an option, in case the game is very difficult or very easy, to adjust the level of difficulty that can be modified at any time.\n\nWHAT WOULD IMPROVE\n\nRandom encounters with visible monsters. Improve the English translation.","timestamp_created":1589660980,"timestamp_updated":1589660980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508041620254516602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1591440288,"developer_response":"Dear Nefer,\n\nThank you for your review and your suggestion!
