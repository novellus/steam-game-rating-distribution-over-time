Repeat[/i] bears a spartan veneer, but there are some cleverly constructed puzzles lurking under the chassis.  The aptly named robot Q.T. is undergoing testing and needs your assistance in dispatching scores of frowning guard bots.  Through the use of its repeat function, Q.T. can overcome these sour-faced sentinels and extinguish the negativity in each chamber.  The repeat function dictates the number of tiles that Q.T. will travel past during each move; while maneuverability is generally best when the repeat count is low, a repeat value equal to or greater than a guard bot's assigned value must be maintained if Q.T. is to emerge victorious in battle.  Junction blocks located throughout most of the chambers can be used to increase or decrease Q.T.'s repeat value as required.  Deducing the proper sequences can be slightly daunting, but all potential movement options are nicely highlighted.  If you're experiencing difficulties along the way, a maximum of three levels can be skipped and revisited later.\n\nA novel variation on the familiar ice-sliding puzzle.","timestamp_created":1597005395,"timestamp_updated":1597005395,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4w4686vMCfpi8mgI="}
