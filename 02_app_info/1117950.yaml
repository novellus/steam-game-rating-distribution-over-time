    review: "Good DLC, but not as good as the other DLC.\n\nThe great thing about\
      \ the \"Rivals\" DLC is that, not only the characters play completely differently\
      \ from those of the base game (Kurona and Ray's playstyles are close combat\
      \ heavy, and Copen offers a lot of new shot customization) but also that it\
      \ changed enemy encounters as well level gimmicks quite a lot, offering an almost\
      \ completely new experience.\n\nIn comparison, the characters in this DLC feel\
      \ way too close to Gunvolt and Beck, being projectile based and offering a lot\
      \ of the same upgrades. On top of this, only Tenzou offers re-vamped enemies/gimmicks\
      \ layouts, while Call and Joule share the same scenario with the original game.\n\
      \nThis being said, while out of the 2 DLCs I'd recommend the other one more,\
      \ this one was still fun and totally worth it if you can't get enough of this\
      \ game. \n\nAbout each character:\n\nCall:\nHer main gimmick is the helping\
      \ robots she can use. There are 3 different types, but they're very samey, and\
      \ only one of them guarantees a burst combo, so I'd tend to either only use\
      \ that one type, or disable them altogether outside of boss battles.\n\nJoule:\n\
      Her special power allows her to equip for a brief moment of time any and all\
      \ upgrades no matter the CP cost, and this, without infering on your score.\
      \ It is a tons of fun to equip literally everything and kill bosses in 3 seconds.\n\
      \nTenzou:\nHe can crouch and slide, as well as slowly fly around (though that\
      \ will cost you 500 CP, which is a lot more than any other character's \"aerial\
      \ action\"), and his special power can lock-on to any enemy on the screen and\
      \ guarantee a burst combo. \nThe experience is very Mega Man-y, and since he's\
      \ the only one with new and different enemy/gimmick layouts, he's definitely\
      \ the highlight of this DLC."
