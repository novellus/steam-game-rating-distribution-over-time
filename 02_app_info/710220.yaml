      \ /><br><br>A retro mix of a shoot 'em up gameplay with RPG elements, <i><strong>DreadStar:\
      \ The Quest for Revenge</strong></i> is inspired by the likes of Tyrian, Raiden\
      \ and Donpachi. Fast-paced with a primary focus on gunplay rather than bullet\
      \ hell, DreadStar gives you incremental ways of not only pushing through content,\
      \ but also improving your ship and its loadout (such as experience, leveling\
      \ and skill points). <br><br>If you\u2019re struggling with a sector, you can\
      \ warp over to Redbeard\u2019s Burrow to spend credits, upgrade your ship and\
      \ return to where you failed. From Gauss Cannons to Lazer Beams, Hadron Exploders\
      \ to weapon cooling - ship improvements are key to not only choosing your playstyle\
      \ but progressing through harder difficulties. <br><br>With its 4:3 display\
      \ and CRT mode, to its multiple difficulty settings that offer replayability\
      \ across its 6 sectors, DreadStar provides an authentic retro experience.<br><br><img\

    review: 'Dreadstar is an RPG+shmup hybrid. Isolated from each other, both the
      shmup and RPG gameplay are a bit on the simpler side when you compare it to
      the more focused games in both genres. However, as a combination of the two
      Dreadstar ends up nailing the formula. There are plenty of RPG shmups out there,
      and nearly all of them absolutely suck, and after playing through Dreadstar
      I''m honestly amazed so many RPG shmups suck because Dreadstar makes the marriage
      of these two genres feel so natural.


      The shooting gameplay is basically what you''d expect from the Genesis/Turbo-grafx
      era of shmups. Less about littering the screens with bullet hell and more about
      twitch reaction dodges. The RPG side of the gameplay has two elements to it:
      XP and equipment. Even if you fail to complete a level, you''re always gaining
      XP which can help ease the frustration often present when learning the patterns
      in a new shmup. If you do manage to complete a level, you get a huge reward
      of gems which you can use to buy equipment for your ship. Nearly every aspect
      is customizable: weapons, shields, specials, ship size, speed, etc. Most of
      the replay value comes from experimenting with different builds, and while I''ve
      only cleared the game on normal I''m already positive that you''ll need a variety
      of builds at your disposal to handle the variety in levels as you play on harder
      difficulties.


      Overall, the most dedicated shmup enthusiasts might not care for this game.
      But that''s not who it''s made for. This is a game for players who could never
      really get into the abstract sort of scoring gameplay that shmups have evolved
      into over the years. It''s a game more for the strategic-minded players who
      appreciate the fundamentals of shmup gameplay.'
