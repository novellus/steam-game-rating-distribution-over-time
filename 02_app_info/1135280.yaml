      \ /><br><br><i><strong>Stranger Things</strong></i> is a brand-new Chapter for\
      \ Dead by Daylight. The Stranger Things Chapter includes a new map, the Underground\
      \ Complex, located below the Hawkins National Laboratory. A Demogorgon is the\
      \ new untamable Killer. Against the Demogorgon stands not one, but two new Survivors:\
      \ Nancy Wheeler, a tough aspiring journalist, and Steve Harrington, a former\
      \ high school jock with a knack for finding trouble. The Stranger Things Chapter\
      \ also features two exclusive cosmetic items: Steve\u2019s Scuffed Rolled Sleeves\
      \ and Nancy\u2019s Torn Sweatshirt.<br><br>It was the early 1980s, a time of\
      \ cold war experiments and naive fascination, a time of stranger things. In\
      \ the small town of Hawkins, Indiana, covert experiments were being conducted.\
      \ When an inter-dimensional gate was accidentally opened at the Hawkins National\
      \ Laboratory, an army of creatures with long, curved claws and gaping faces\
      \ that bloom like horrific flowers was unleashed. These creatures were labeled\
      \ \u201CDemogorgons\u201D by a group of local kids who encountered them. <br><br>Nancy\
      \ Wheeler\u2019s knack for investigative journalism first emerged when she brought\
      \ down a secret government organization in Hawkins following the disappearance\
      \ of her closest friend, Barb. Her being fired from the Hawkins Post during\
      \ the summer of 1985 has not dissuaded Nancy from chasing leads...<br><br>Formerly\
      \ a popular jock, Steve Harrington, is struggling to find his place in Hawkins\
      \ now that high school is over, and his old friends moved away to college. Since\
      \ then, he\u2019s spent his time scooping ice cream at the mall, flirting with\
      \ girls, and cracking secret Russian codes. With the help of his friends Dustin\
      \ and Robin, Steve is carving out a new identity for himself and learning what\
      \ true friendship really means. It\u2019s this newfound loyalty to his friends\
      \ that compels Steve to come to the aid of his ex-girlfriend, Nancy when he\
      \ suspects she might be in terrible danger...<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1135280/extras/StrangerThings_Killer_header.png?t=1585947527\"\
      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> The Demogorgon</h2>A blooming mouth full of needle-like\
      \ teeth for a face, large, curved, razor-sharp claws, and powerful legs to pounce\
      \ on victims, make the Demogorgon a frightening monster to face in any dimension.\
      \ It is a nightmare of unrestrained, feral rage as it hunts down its prey and\
      \ rips it to pieces, devouring every last morsel of flesh and gore, leaving\
      \ nothing for scavengers. The creature is untouched by any sense of compassion\
      \ or restraint. Looming over its victim, it shows no doubt or mercy, just the\
      \ pure instinct of its insatiable bloodlust as it delivers the deathblow. A\
      \ perfect hunter, the Demogorgon is a macabre testament to the horrors lurking\
      \ in the Upside Down and why it was choice pickings for The Entity.<br><br><strong>The\
      \ Demogorgon\u2019s Power: Of the Abyss</strong><br>The Demogorgon impacts the\
      \ environment close to generators, affects nearby Survivors, and uses Portals\
      \ to travel quickly. The Demogorgon starts with a limited number of Portals\
      \ that can spawn on any flat floor or ground.  <br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1135280/extras/StrangerThings_Killer_Perks_header.png?t=1585947527\"\

      \ /><br><br>Studious and rebellious, Nancy Wheeler is a stubborn investigator\
      \ with an instinct for a good story. When her closest friend, Barb went missing,\

      \ journalist, she chases stories and follows leads despite the inequality and\
      \ chauvinism she encounters at the workplace. Pursuing a lead one evening, she\
      \ fearlessly approaches the Hawkins National Laboratory before suddenly losing\
      \ consciousness. A moment later she awakens in a strange misty realm with the\
      \ sound of a familiar roar echoing through the air.<br><br>Nancy Wheeler comes\
      \ with <strong>3 new perks.</strong><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Better Together </h2>You\
      \ seek justice and uncover the truth no matter what obstacle stands in your\
      \ way. The aura of the generator being repaired is revealed to other Survivors\

      notes: 'Dead by Daylight is an action-horror game in which players engage in
        multiplayer matches as either a killer or one of four survivors. Survivors
        emit splashes of blood when attacked and leave pools of blood on the ground
        when injured. As the killer, players must find the survivors, from a first-person
        perspective, before they escape each level. Killers can use various weapons
        (e.g., chainsaws, cattle hammers, bone saws) and/or hang survivors on meat
        hooks to kill them. Killers can also perform various finishing attacks (e.g.,
        throat ripping, disemboweling, chainsaw impalement) to kill wounded survivors;
        in rare instances, red chunks of flesh are depicted during death animations. '
