O. W. \nI set my expectations pretty low for this game  (I am happy to say this game blew my expectations out of the water). The reviews looked fun, but the game seemed bland and basic. I bought the game to have on while I am in a zoom class or something of the sorts, yet it took me by surprise when I first played. The games UI is simple and easy to learn, the games tutorial is really engaging, and the themes of the game are great. The tactics are not as simple as they seem, be prepared to adapt to different enemy types. I also really like the High, Medium, Low, Surface, and Undersea zones of engagement.\nSeeing Tomcats whiz by some B-52s as they approach Russian vessels is a sight to see! I rarely comment on games that I play, and the ones I do are usually negative. However I felt compelled to encourage people to support this game in its current state. I am VERY eager to see the growth of this game, and I do hope that the devs keep it alive.","timestamp_created":1602210378,"timestamp_updated":1602210378,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwkcbLhfUCfsHdpgI="}
