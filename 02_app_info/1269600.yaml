      assets and music from other popular game, mostly music. It is an old game that
      i refreshed and published on steam for you to enjoy for free, that is why the
      game is free (F2P) and will remain free forever. Hope you will enjoy the game
      for what it is and not for what assets it use! The DLC are 100% none vital to
      the game. The game can be finished entirely without those... These dlc are only
      there to support me if you like the game!<br><br>English is not my first language
      and back then i decided to make the game in English even if i was not good so
      that more people would understand it and play it around the world... Please
      don't be mean, it is a free game... As of version 3.0.0.0 the game text as been
      changed a little to help the player understand the story and the lore a little
      more...<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1269600/extras/BANNER_DESC_01.jpg?t=1588695262"
