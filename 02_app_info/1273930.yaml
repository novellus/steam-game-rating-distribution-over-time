    developer_response: 'Hello, thanks to review and I''m sorry if the game didn''t
      meet your expectations.


      I''m working, even at this moment when I write the review to make some improvements
      to the game, such as:

      - New complete songs for the player to choose.

      - Option for the player to change the controllers.

      - Different types of balls, with different physics.

      - Improvements to existing tables.

      - New tables.


      If you have something you find interesting to add or change, feel free to suggest.'

    review: 'PLEASE NOTE: This game is still being developed! So this is more or less
      an early access review.


      Hard Rock Pinball as the name implies is a pinball game with a hard rock music
      theme.  Each of the present 3 tables are themed accordingly and the developer
      is actively working on this title.  The game itself plays okay and some of the
      recent additions make the game more palatable as his work continues, however,
      at this point the game is playable and may be enjoyable to some, but without
      rule sheets and achievements (which don''t appear to be working), it may be
      a little hard for some to take. The music in the game can get a little grating
      for long game players. Color scheme is still feels to old school for me, but
      everyone has a preference. I personally say give it a try, for the current price
      it is very reasonable, but who knows if you will like it, maybe you wont.'
