    reviews: "\u201CSatire about millennials and the tech start-up culture is well-worn\
      \ territory for comedy in 2020. But there\u2019s something about indie game\
      \ \u201CGoing Under\u201D that feels personal.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/reviews/going-under-review/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Washington Post</a><br><br>\u201C\
      It\u2019s one of the most honest investigations of existential digitisation\
      \ and corporate greed ever made in videogame form. It addresses the farce of\
      \ employment with creativity and humour, two things no malignant narcissist\
      \ with a modest cash injection could ever take from us. It also has one of the\
      \ most anarchic, diverse combat systems of any roguelike, which rewards experimentation\
      \ yet almost never thrusts you into runs that feel unfair due to bad weapon\
      \ drops.\u201D<br>9/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.indiegamewebsite.com/2020/09/22/going-under-review/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Indie Game Website</a><br><br>\u201C\
      In all, Going Under is the type of game to go above and beyond in its quirky\
      \ mannerisms, being unafraid to poke fun at both the real world it parodies\
      \ and even itself. This is a game I highly recommend if any gamer has an appreciation\
      \ for dungeon crawling, bright colors, or humor in sheer parody fashion.\u201D\

      \ city of Neo-Cascadia, you\u2019ll wield office junk as weaponry as you make\
      \ your way through the offbeat procedural dungeons beneath your company campus."

    review: 'I wish they skipped the "story" part and focused on gameplay only on
      this one.

      Also if you''re going the roguelite way with randomly generated dungeons why
      are they so short and with the same boss all the time? I beat the game, the
      memories I''ll keep of this one aren''t strong.'
