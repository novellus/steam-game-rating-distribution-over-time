So to be honest it feels like it may be worth 1 Euro, it´s fun for a few minutes for sure. But seeing the normal price of nearly 11 Euros just makes me sad. This should always be around that 1 Euro!\nDevs, please adjust that price!\nBesides the pricing it´s a small Wave Shooter. You shoot tomatoes at Barrels coming towards you. Nothing special. Feels weird sometimes. Graphically nothing spectacular. Have seen better Wave Shooters of similar style with more variety in Weaponry, Levels, Enemies etc. They may be worth 5-10 Euros, but this is not.","timestamp_created":1545484881,"timestamp_updated":1545484881,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xvmE6+cCf9T+tQE="}
