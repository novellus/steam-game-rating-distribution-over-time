    review: 'Like I mentioned in Demon Tamer, if you enjoy the artstyle this might
      be good for you.


      At first it was a bit annoying since some information here and there might be
      missing but at some point I figured out how the game worked.


      It feels at least a bit, like it would have more content or stuff going on than
      in Demon Tamer one of his previous game.  Still there are moments where not
      much is happening and I felt as if I got stuck in some loop first.


      Since it felt more solid this time and I can''t say I noticed any other bug,
      I  will be fair and give this an upvote.'
