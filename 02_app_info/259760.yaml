      \ It\u2019s a slow burn that\u2019s going to take a long time for you to fully\
      \ digest, but if you like game soundtracks, I\u2019d be hard pressed to offer\
      \ you a better one. Full of original content, and drawing from the most memorable\
      \ games of previous generations, it will give other composers something to aim\
      \ for when they score their companies next title.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://kbmod.com/2013/09/review-two-brothers-soundtrack/\"\

    review: This game was very good.  Its also kind of short.  It has a couple of
      anoying jokes (the laughing at you kind) and bugs that turn an good game into
      a meh game.  The music is good though.
