    review: 'yeah i''m getting myself into a rabbit hole aren''t i


      alright. don''t buy this game. the only time i died was by softlocking by clipping
      into walls, you have to restart the game every time you die because trying to
      start a new game will cause the game to forget to spawn your character, and
      the answer to the question of "It is not known how far the end of these caves
      is, or if there is any," is that there isn''t, because in trying to find more
      mechanics than "fly" and "shoot," i discovered that the N key teleports you
      to the next level, and that you can mash that button for a real long time without
      getting anywhere.


      and, well... yeah. that''s sort of expected. this isn''t a game.


      this is a hard reupload of the Cave Exploration Starter Kit by "that games guy"
      on the unity asset store. look, you can get it here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/tutorials/cave-exploration-starter-kit-37158.
      it''s literally free, plus you can modify this version to give it some gameplay.
      it''s barebones because originally it''s meant to be the baseline for a 2d roguelite
      game, for a developer to expand upon.


      the marked publisher of this game, INFINITY BRIDGE, seems to do this a lot.
      of their listed games:


      -"something strange in the woods," developed by moenen, is a hard reupload of
      the free template "Santa Claus Is Coming To Town" from the unity asset store.
      this one isn''t even meant to be a game, just a simple showcase of all the 3d
      models! you can find that here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/santa-claus-is-coming-to-town-63497


      -"space abyss," developed by #NVJOB, is a hard reupload of the free template
      "Infinity Square/Space" from the unity asset store. this one looks really neat
      actually. get it from the real dev, not these freeloaders. https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/packs/infinity-square-space-procedurally-generated-space-with-a-destru-149923


      -the other "upcoming games" - one of which was meant to release 5 days ago,
      lol - also seem to be extremely simple baseline games. i''d expect that they''re
      also ripped straight from the asset store too, but their developer names are
      simply set to INFINITY BRIDGE this time, making it impossible to find their
      originals. they may actually be original, though. use your own judgement on
      that one.


      most interestingly of all, though, is their seemingly flagship game, TRAPPED
      GUYS. it has actual marketing images, a listed publisher page, an announcement,
      and other such features you''d expect from a "real" indie game. i can''t say
      much about the game itself - it looks high quality, seems to have some gameplay,
      but without buying it for real and uTinyRipper-ing it apart, i can''t see if
      it''s yoinked from the asset store or not.


      but let''s get back to that announcement. it has a twitter link attached - twitter.com/INFINITYBRIDGE,
      with an insane amount of followers, given that they have one tweet with 6 likes,
      7 retweets. almost all of them are empty accounts, named something like Tristan0008267,
      who have participated in giveaways from one website - giveaway.su. never heard
      of them myself, but it seems like some follower farming using giveaways has
      been done there.


      also in that announcement is a youtube link. one video with a gameplay trailer
      for trapped guys. as expected, right? however, they also have a TRAILERS playlist.
      a trailers playlist with 2 videos - the other video is privated - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqHEWiRrVbM&list=PLoGtYtwZ_Y5D3q9jfmQ73VxagdjGcXBV7.


      luckily by typing the video link into something like google (or in my case,
      duckduckgo), we can see the cached version that those search engines last crawled
      for - the privated video was called FRENZY PLATNS - TRAILER - https://i.imgur.com/fqIzPnr.png.
      searching for "frenzy platns game" returns a link to a completely different
      game, apparently by a different company named MADSKILLZGAME, that released a
      single game called FRENZY PLANTS late 2019, then never released another game
      again.


      https://store.steampowered.com/app/1118930/FRENZY_PLANTS/


      i have legitimately no idea what the reasoning behind changing developer and
      publisher name like this would be, but operating under multiple names isn''t
      unheard of for shovelware companies on steam, and i''d say this company certainly
      passes my benchmark for one.


      so yeah. don''t buy this game. don''t buy any of the infinity bridge asset flips.
      probably don''t buy frenzy plants either!! the reputability of this company
      is hilariously slim, and i''d really recommend you stay away for fear of getting
      scammed.


      anyway, i''m done researching dumb crap now. i''m gonna go refund this game.

      update (2020-12-28): confirmed "beat the moles" (listed as simply being developed
      by INFINITY BRIDGE) is a very minor modification of Whack a Mole by tasonco
      on the unity asset store, found here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/whack-a-mole-82155


      it appears as though the only changes are to the name, lighting, and text position
      on screen.


      confirmed "hover ship" (listed as developed by INFINITY BRIDGE) is at best a
      minor modification of Hovershift by SgLib Games on the unity asset store, found
      here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/packs/hovershift-107789


      the only difference i can see between the two is two coloured bars in the top
      left during gameplay, although the screenshots on the unity page may be taken
      in some sort of developer mode.


      the newly added game marked as coming soon, "Asteroids Belt: Try to Survive!",
      listed as being developed by INFINITY BRIDGE, is actually... "Asteroids Belt:
      Try to Survive!" by Allebi. https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/packs/asteroid-belt-project-2062


      i guess they really gave up on that one, didn''t even change the name lol. yet
      again lighting and resolution seems changed, but the original is intended to
      be a mobile game, so these changes aren''t too surprising.


      i still can''t find any extra info on frenzy plants or trapped guys, so they''re
      probably custom-developed.'
