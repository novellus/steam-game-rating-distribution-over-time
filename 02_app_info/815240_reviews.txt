Like most of the others games I have played thus far this feels more like a demo or a prototype than an actual game, which is unfortunate because it would have great potential if fully fleshed out into an arcade-like simulator game with aspects of business management. It is one of the cheaper games in the bundle, but I still cannot recommend it at its current full price.\n\nThe handful of missions require you to chop down and cut up a number of trees within a certain time limit. It's essentially rinse and repeat, and more along the lines of an arcade type of simulator. The game does add another level of play to it in that you can unlock several buildings in your \"business\" which increases the yield of logs you harvest and allows you to turn them into furniture and such. However, each mission only allows a set number of logs to enter into your inventory, regardless of the number of trees that you harvest (you need to harvest more with each mission), so it's better just to farm the first couple of missions which only take a minute or two to maximize your production inventory.\n\nOnce again, this is just another game that is fun for the hour or two it takes to beat the missions, but has no replay value or long term play value after that, so is only worth the price when included in the bundle during the big steam sales. It's unfortunate that this is another game that starts with a great concept, but the execution simply isn't followed through to the end to unlock that potential and bring something new and different to the simulator genre.","timestamp_created":1568083153,"timestamp_updated":1568083153,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hsLCjO0CdOX70QE="}
