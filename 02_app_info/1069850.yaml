      Knockers is an exciting puzzle/action hybrid. Blocks enter the play field, and

      their position and prepare them for shipment. Good news: this reveals part of
      a sexy image! Bad news: your workspace just got a little bit tighter! Avoid
      the enemies, or smash them between blocks. Aim carefully to boost your score,

      we say Block Knockers is a thrill to play? We do! But if you''d like to solve
      puzzles without distraction, you can turn off enemies, and if you solve enough
      puzzles perfectly, you can even skip boss battles entirely. (But please fight
      the bosses! We worked hard on ''em!) Control the adult content yourself with

      notes: 'Gameplay revolves around revealing illustrations of partially or fully
        nude adult women in suggestive poses, including depictions of breasts, nipples,
        and butts. Players may opt to partially or completely obscure these images
        via in-game options. Images appear in sequence to suggest a burlesque or strip

    review: "This is an arcade action/puzzle hybrid game with mild nudity. Take note\
      \ that there is only minor topless nudity in this game and zero sexual content.\
      \ If low resolution pixelized nipples count as sexual content to you, I highly\
      \ advise you to turn off the PC, go outside and interact with some real life\
      \ girls.\n\nThe goal of each stage is to kick or pull colored blocks around\
      \ a field to create matches of 3 or more, thus locking them in place and revealing\
      \ a little bit of the picture underneath. As you start matching more and more\
      \ blocks, the playing area on the field will gradually become smaller and it\
      \ becomes harder to maneuver blocks around the field. At the same time, blocks\
      \ will constantly spawn randomly around the field to further complicate matters.\
      \ And if that wasn't annoying enough, monsters will also spawn frequently to\
      \ hinder your progress. You only have a limited number of lives each stage and\
      \ if you touch a monster or one of their projectiles, you lose a live and it's\
      \ game over once you run out of lives. Thankfully, monsters can be toggled off\
      \ with no penalty at the main menu and it is highly encouraged to do so as the\
      \ game is already frustrating enough even without monsters.\n\nWhile the concept\
      \ of the game is innovative and sounds exciting in theory, in reality the gameplay\
      \ isn't as fun due to a number of issues. The controls feel extremely cumbersome\
      \ and unintuitive because due to the lack of a push ability. You can only pull\
      \ blocks (moving them one space at a time towards you) or kick blocks which\
      \ sends them flying in the opposite direction until they hit a wall or another\
      \ block. If you wanna manipulate blocks precisely into place, you'll have to\
      \ constantly move around blocks until you're in the position to pull them one\
      \ space at a time. This also leads to situations where you find yourself with\
      \ no viable moves and there's no way to clear the stage without restarting.\
      \ Even though technically there is no timer to contend with, blocks constantly\
      \ spawn randomly and the smaller the playing field gets due to the matches you\
      \ make, the harder it is to navigate and it is very easy to run out of moves\
      \ if blocks inconveniently spawn at the wrong places to hinder your progress.\
      \ This causes a sense of panic and most of the time you'll end up not having\
      \ any time to think about creating matches strategically.\n\nTo unlock the sexy\
      \ pictures in the gallery, you have to fully reveal the picture in the stages\
      \ by making matches on the silhouette. This is very frustrating to do once you\
      \ get past the early stages due to the constantly random spawning blocks not\
      \ giving you time to maneuver your blocks into place. Finishing stages by fully\
      \ revealing the picture also awards you stars which you can use to skip boss\
      \ battles. \n\nBoss battles are extremely annoying due to the aforementioned\
      \ terrible controls, even more so when trying to reveal the picture in boss\
      \ stages. You can accumulate lives before challenging a boss stage by replaying\
      \ old stages but this just ends up being boring and repetitive very quickly.\
      \ Furthermore, there is no ability to save in the game so you could stockpile\
      \ 50 lives and still end up not beating the boss, thus wasting all those hours\
      \ you spent grinding old stages to prepare for the boss.\n\nThe \"sexy content\"\
      \ in this game is extremely tame; only nipples are shown and there is absolutely\
      \ zero female genitalia. \uFF08\u256F \u0361 \u0360\xB0 \u035F\u0644\u035C \u0361\
      \xB0\uFF09\u256F\uFE35 \u253B\u2501\u253B The artwork is retro style graphics,\
      \ so the girls aren't really viable research material unless you've literally\
      \ never seen a girl's naked breasts before. In fact, lingerie catalogs would\
      \ probably be way more stimulating than anything you'll see in this game. The\
      \ girls do have decent breasts, but their nipples are colored weird (blue nipples?\
      \ \u2510( \u0361\u0CA0 \u0296\u032F \u0361\u0CA0)\u250C ) instead of being realistic.\n\
      \nThere are a total of 9 girls in the game, each with 3 stages containing pictures\
      \ that become more revealing, but sadly only goes so far as topless nudity.\
      \ There are a total of 4 bosses each with an additional picture, but good luck\
      \ trying to clear the boss stages let alone unlocking the boss stage pictures.\n\
      \nFully revealed pictures are unlocked in the gallery but unfortunately there\
      \ is no option to hide the UI.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot recommend this game\
      \ as the lack of decent sexual content is not worth the price nor the frustrating\
      \ gameplay. If you accidentally bought the game or are still interested in trying\
      \ the game, I recommend just getting the 100% save file from f95zone if you\
      \ wanna see the sexy pictures."
