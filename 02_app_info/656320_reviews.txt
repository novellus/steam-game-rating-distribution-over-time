Controls are excellent, and the different enemies pose a variety of challenges, while still being exceedingly satisfying to eliminate. This is a polished game that avoids all the pitfalls of Early Access. More content is coming, but you don't need to wait to get your hands on a great VR game.","timestamp_created":1508302378,"timestamp_updated":1508302378,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwwfr0lt8Ce+PNiAE="}
