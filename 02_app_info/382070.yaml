    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">About the game</h2>Neoncube is a 2D platformer
      based around a neon world. The goal in the 50 included levels is as simple as
      opening a door and entering the next level. This seems easy at the beginning,
      but as your level progress increases, you might find yourself in a tricky situation.
      Especially the 5 bosses every 10 levels may increase the probability of ending
      up as a pile of neon shards.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features in the game</h2><ul
