    about_the_game: Explore a mysterious island of Trials with nothing but a spear,
      grit and determination.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1326250/extras/pokey_boing2.gif?t=1592327224"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Expressive control</h2>Cling to and bounce from ceiling
      to wall to cliff face. Full, 360-degree spear aim makes PokeyPoke a uniquely
      expressive, satisfying and difficult to master platformer that handles like
      no other.<h2 class="bb_tag">Just a girl and a spear</h2>No powerups, no artificial
      gates, no monsters, no skill trees. Just you, your spear and your environment.
      The trials are a test of what you have learned and mastered, nothing more.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Choose your own path</h2>Collect optional hidden gems by climbing,
      swinging and bouncing across an intricately hand-crafted island. Challenges
      lie temptingly around every corner, and then around the corner from that. Tackle
      the trials at your own pace and carve your own journey through the island.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Climb on</h2>The Trials are tough, but they reward courage and
      perseverance. When you fail you're quickly thrown straight back into the action
      with instant respawns, armed with one more attempt's worth of knowledge and
      practice.
