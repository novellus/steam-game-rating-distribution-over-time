So I would think the playthrough for the average player will be a lot less than the 7 hours it took me.\n\nIt has the same kind of a torch system as Shadowgate, although if I recall correctly in Shadowgate the burning of the torches was based on moves taken whereas here it's purely time based. According to the developer it takes about 12 seconds for 1% of a torch to burn. This brings kind of a sense of urgency at first but it's not really that bad. I had several torches left when I finished the game, but then again I often reloaded the game after I had found new places or items after walking around burning the torch, so then I could redo what I did and have plenty of more torch time left. An interesting feature is that the screen becomes darker the less you have fire in the torch. Anyway, I recommend the players to take their time investigating stuff and if they are sure about what to do next, reload the game and proceed, and save the game after you are done.\n\nGreat game! Recommended for any Shadowgate fan out there.","timestamp_created":1580135510,"timestamp_updated":1580135510,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.572039961814880371","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/83a8+8Ce5a97gE="}
