    about_the_game: "As many of you are wondering how the game works, here's a brief\
      \ explanation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou have four views of the puzzle so that\
      \ you can see the totality of available blocks to match. You can swap one block\
      \ vertically or rotate an entire horizontal row of blocks so that you can make\
      \ several matches at once if available.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can also shuffle\
      \ blocks which may result in several matches at once and help you to reach the\
      \ goal faster.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe smallest number of blocks you can match\
      \ is 3 which will give you 1 atom and for each additional matched block you\
      \ get twice more atoms (e.g. 4 block matches gives you 2 atoms, 5 block matches\
      \ gives you 4 atoms and so on).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can see those atoms in\
      \ the counter on your screen. You can match any number of blocks in any shape\
      \ (with a minimum of 3 blocks, as stated previously).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo\
      \ advance in the game you must reach the goal indicated on your screen. For\
      \ example to make water (H\u2082O), you need either two 3 block matches or one\
      \ 4 block match of H (hydrogen) to get 2 atoms of H (hydrogen) and also one\
      \ 3 block match of O (oxygen) to get 1 atom of O (oxygen).<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nOn the top of the screen you have total score, last match/combo score and\
      \ the best match/combo score. It's more advantageous to make combos as the total\
      \ score is the sum of all atoms multiplied by the match count. Let's say you've\
      \ got 5 matches at once with the score of 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, then the total score\
      \ would translate like this: (1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 4) \xD7 5 = 60.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nWhen the goal is achieved, a new goal will be set and the elements will be\
      \ replaced accordingly. For example, all carbon blocks will be replaced with\
      \ uranium, all sulfur blocks replaced with potassium and so on, so that you\
      \ don't lose any previously available match/combo."
