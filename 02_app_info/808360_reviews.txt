I think it still needs more guidance in regards to how far along you are, since there is no plot and no achievements, although there is an overview of the available/completed levels. In my personal opinion everything in the game feels a bit too inconsequential when there's no clear sign of progress. Other than that, the graphics are alright and the music suits the game. All in all, the simplest of simple puzzle games, which could be enjoyable if that's what you're into.","timestamp_created":1530640145,"timestamp_updated":1530640145,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.462724953889846802","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4puPQsOQCfP2KpQE="}
