So without further ado, let's get the party started.\n\nOne small step for man, one giant leap for the golfing man. Fun game that had a lot of potential, but sadly, even more missed opportunities. The elephants in the room are lack of HDR and 3-click swing.\n\nDoes HB Studios care? Not really, and if they do, they don't show it very well. Every iteration of this game creates an outcry for these features, but every time HB Studios clearly sees it as another opportunity to disappoint. It's rather unfortunate because this game is a good entry into the golf video game hall of fame... but it could have been great.\n\nI'll give it a thumbs up because as a first entry into the franchise, it's a commendable effort. I just wish that HDR and 3-click swing would be implemented in the 2019 and 2020 iterations. It has been six long years since TGC launched this game, and not much has changed - I suggest you read the Steam discussion areas of the recent iterations before you buy.\n\nThat said, I remain positive and hopeful, it's the least I can do in the wake of COVID-19. Perhaps these features are planned for PGA 2030. Sounds about right in terms of the next time HB Studios will get my money.\n\nTGC is a solid 7/10 game based on it being the first entry in the franchise and doing a good job at that.\n\nFor context, here is the rating scale I use for all games:\n\n10 = Must play\n9 = Excellent\n8 = Great\n[b]7 = Good[/b]\n6 = Above average\n5 = Average\n4 = Below average\n3 = Rubbish\n2 = Anthem\n1 = FO76\n0 = Marvel Avengers","timestamp_created":1598396450,"timestamp_updated":1609626441,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40srN4vYCfO3inQI="}
