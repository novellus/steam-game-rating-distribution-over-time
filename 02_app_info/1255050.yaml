    about_the_game: "Craft in Abyss allows players to design their own mechanical\
      \ fortress, gather resources and continuously strengthen the fortress facilities\
      \ within a sci-fi world. It is a rogue-lite base building game at heart.<br><br>The\
      \ player will need to keep upgrading and expanding the fortress to strengthen\
      \ themselves during their journey to gather more companions and fight enemies\
      \ for resources.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Core Gameplay 1: Facilities</h2><br>In\
      \ order to construct additional facilities on the fortress, the player will\
      \ first have to construct a baseplate, which naturally must be connected to\
      \ the fortress itself. Do note that more baseplates aren\u2019t always better,\
      \ since additional baseplates increase the size of the fortress, making it easier\
      \ for enemies to land their attacks as it will be more difficult to dodge the\
      \ projectiles.<br><br>After designing the shape of the moving fortress, the\
      \ players will then be able to construct facilities on them, then set off to\
      \ battle.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1255050/extras/building.gif?t=1606724769\"\

      \ as well as the auto-defence facilities to defeat enemies.<br>After defeating\
      \ enemies, the player will game resources, which can be used to strengthen the\

      \ the player will be able to randomly gain a digital totem, which will come\
      \ with skills, from the ruins. The player must make good use of the digital\
