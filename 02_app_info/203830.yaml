    about_the_game: 'Face your Destiny!<br><br>In Andergast, whose inhabitants are
      considered to be notoriously superstitious, King Efferdan awaits a state visit
      from high-ranking dignitaries. For centuries the kingdom has been at odds with
      neighboring Nostria, but now first steps are being undertaken toward a lasting
      peace. But a plague of crows troubles the king, for the birds are acting with
      unusual aggressiveness, even attacking humans. Moreover, there are those among
      the citizens of Andergast who swear that the crows are bringing them dark nightmares.
      As the belligerent creatures infiltrate even the castle itself, the king seeks
      a skilled bird catcher - an opportunity for young Geron to prove that the reputation
      for ill luck that has followed him since childhood is undeserved. Following
      an audience with the king, the prestigious task is assigned to him. However,
      not only does his task prove unexpectedly difficult, but it also turns out to
      be the first step of the greatest adventure of his life, which will lead him
