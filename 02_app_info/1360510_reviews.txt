Likely you saw and it stopped because you like anything to do with outer space. The list of awesome starts with, \"Driving around on the moon.\" The game is certainly peaceful, serene, and relaxing. Driving without racing, or shooting anything - very well done. You may learn a few things along the way, too. Oh, and you get to drive around on the moon!\n\nArtwork and environment are beautiful, physics are seemingly reasonable (not sure, never been there!). The game doesn't punish us for bad driving, even when we intentionally do so. This is a hassle-free simulation experience.\n\nVery easy to control, tried with a keyboard and with a gamepad. no trouble. With just a little effort and was able to make an old Logitech steering wheel play nicely. Fun for anyone, and especially if you have a wheel and pedals, don't pass this up.\n\nAwesome game! Looking forward to future releases. Until then, I'll be on the moon, driving around.","timestamp_created":1599635741,"timestamp_updated":1599635839,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557046949863433838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gbvuuPQCcPvboAI="}
