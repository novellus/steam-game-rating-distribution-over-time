    about_the_game: "This is a game I wrote so that I could have a bit of a distraction\
      \ at work. The idea is simple, you click to mine a resource, hire workers to\
      \ do the mining for you, upgrade them, unlock new levels and worker types, gain\
      \ prestige levels and start over. I used to switch to it about every hour or\
      \ so, distribute the gold and return back to work.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt some\
      \ point a few of my coworkers noticed and asked to play too. They seemed to\
      \ really enjoy it, requested new features and reported bugs. Before I knew it,\
      \ a dozen people in the office were playing. (You might be tempted to tell my\
      \ boss, but he was playing too and even wrote a cheat.) This was a bit unexpected,\
      \ but made me realize that people outside of work might enjoy this game as well.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter a bit of searching I collaborated with an artist\
      \ and a composer to help me make the game more presentable. Working on this\
      \ project was fun and all of us learned a lot. What you see is the result of\
      \ our efforts and we hope you enjoy it despite its flaws. Thank you!"
