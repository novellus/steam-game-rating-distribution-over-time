I do not understand why Steam is selling this substandard DLC. It looks like it has been copied from a model railway BR24 from MÃ¤rklin or Fleischmann or so. The cab is a joke, 2D apparently from MSTS vintage with what looks like photos of the firebox doors and some other cab-details. Most of all the sounds are terrible and chuff sounds are virtually non existant. There is very heavy/overdone/too loud rail rumble from loco and rolling stock that is very disturbing and partly blanks out the other sounds. This DLC even at the reduced sale price is a ripp-off.","timestamp_created":1606940109,"timestamp_updated":1606945718,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw77fbkvYCfLHrtgI="}
