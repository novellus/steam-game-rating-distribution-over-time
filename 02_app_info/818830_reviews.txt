I did build this to learn more about game dev and to show that I can complete a project. I did know that it will be small game... and therefore low price... and therefore very likely no financial success. But I tried to make it worth the money to the few buyers it can get. Reading your comment and seeing that you spent over 20 hours with my game makes me so happy! I would love to advance the story with more stages or a sequel (I actually have a concept and did some work on that), but for now I'm working on an isometric, rougelike action RPG, which has a better chance of beeing a popular game (because I need to eat and stuff). But thanks again for your positive vibes!"}],"cursor":"AoJwhZWIyfECdq/5gQI="}
