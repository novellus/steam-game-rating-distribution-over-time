For example turning the vehicle at a high rate of speed doesn't sway the vehicle and what do I mean by that? Look at games like Grand Theft Auto 4 or 5, or the Driver Series of games. Sure these were made by vastly bigger studios, but they should give you an example of what the vehicle physics should be like. No, I don't mean that you \"need\" destruction physics, that is not what I am getting at, when a vehicle turns at a high rate of speed the vehicle should react to this momentum. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. When you turn left at high speed the vehicle's suspension on the right side should be compressed while the left side should decompress.\n- Next up is the camera controls and the overall experience with the game cameras:\n * The players \"body cam\" meaning the third person camera that the player uses to see the player character through (also is the camera that is used when the player is walking/running/on foot) isn't that bad. I feel it's a little close for me, but it gets the job done.\n * The third person camera for the cars aren't that bad either. The default view is stationary and stays behind the vehicle facing forward all the time. The second view for the vehicles is a free-look camera which allows you to freely look around the vehicle without much restriction, this view even allows you to zoom in or out.\n- The AI in the game aren't always the brightest bunch, sometimes they get stuck behind obstacles.\n- You should be able to go to the Police Station and Go On Duty. Although, in-game you can only go off duty at the police station.\n- The game doesn't tell you how to respond to calls, should I respond Code 2 or Code 3?\n- Your only form of Police Backup is a Police Transport, who only transports suspects you arrest.\n- Sometimes AI Vehicles will despawn in font of you near the Police Station. This is probably do to some game logic at the end of the AI's waypoint telling it to despawn to increase performance. Which is a good thing, but it takes away from the realism.\n- There isn't a penalty for the player when they run a red light. If you speed through a red light without reason (only acceptable reasons I can see are if you're responding to a call code 3) you aren't penalized for it.\n- Graphics aren't amazing, but it's good enough for me.\n- Sometimes AI Vehicles turn around at intersection which causes a traffic jam. It's nothing too bad, just letting you developers know in case you don't know about this.\n- The default price of 19.99 US Dollars is a little too much. I think at most $8 to $10 bucks are good.\n- Scale seems off, but it could just be me though.\n- The Taxi Price is $20 (in-game currency) no matter what. I feel it should change depending on your distance from the destination.\n- The green highlighting boxes aren't need, just have an invisible trigger setup that tells the player to press 'E' or whatever to interact with something.\n- The cars seem a little too metallic either that or reflective.\n- You can only ram suspect vehicles to get them to stop, you should be able to order them to stop the vehicle through a PA system to stop the vehicle.\n- You should be able to order a suspect to stop running while in a foot pursuit.\n\nNow time for the Pros:\n- It is exactly what it is advertised to be, a simple police simulator.\n- It is great if want to pass time irl.\n- You can chase some vehicles, have foot pursuits, ticket people, catch speeders, among other things.\n- You can \"hang out\" with your character's family and friends in game.\n- You can upgrade your police vehicle or get a better one.\n- You can buy a civilian vehicle in-game to help go around and do stuff in-town.\n- You can call a taxi to transport you around if you don't have an off-duty vehicle.\n- You have a choice between two characters a male officer and a female officer.\n- You have to keep an eye on vehicle maintenance and fuel which adds to the realism since the game doesn't currently have vehicle destruction.\n- A working options menu, thank God for that.\n- The interface is nice. In my opinion.\n\n\nI might have missed a few things, but this is what I have noticed so far. I hope the Developers continue working on this, it has potential, but needs some work done.  Overall if you're just looking for a simple Policing Simulator this is a good start although personally I will only give it a 3/5 stars.","timestamp_created":1549673347,"timestamp_updated":1609722387,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o8u75fYCcf+wugE="}
