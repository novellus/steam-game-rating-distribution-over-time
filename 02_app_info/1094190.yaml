    review: "Let me just begin by saying that I can clearly tell this is a very personal\
      \ game, and the idea of a game inspired by someone's dream(s) fascinated me\
      \ (I keep a dream journal & I'm a fan of Yume Nikki). I went into this game\
      \ optimistically, and this game has some good things going for it. I like the\
      \ atmosphere of the festival taking place, and I thought the use of a computer\
      \ interface was an interesting change of pace. Sadly, there were too many flaws\
      \ to make this a satisfying experience (at least for a game sold on Steam).\
      \ The control scheme is cumbersome (arrow keys to move and WASD to adjust the\
      \ camera), I don't understand how this game is 3.4 GB when the art assets are\
      \ so low quality, and the game ends abruptly. In terms of walking-simulators\
      \ based off dreams, I think that [url=lsddev.itch.io/21-the-world]#21: The World[/url]\
      \ achieves greater success. While I sadly found \u6545\u90F7\u3092\u3055\u304C\
      \u3059\u4E09\u59C9\u59B9 to be disappointing, I think Yorunoatochi shows great\
      \ potential, and I'd like to see what they make next."
