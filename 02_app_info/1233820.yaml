    review: This was pretty wild to me when I played it back in the day on Viveport.
      I think it had a different name. It has a unique art style with very high contrast
      and funky pixelation and color grading. I don't know what those words mean.
      I don't really understand the theme, something about game development. [b]Wolfenstein
      3d is name dropped once, and is likely the most memorable part of the experience.[/b]
      I liked the last scene on the beach where the gummy bears down by the water
      look at you. You might also notice a certain review blurb down on the steam
      store page. That's me! What happened was I uploaded the viveport video, and
      the developer was like 'hey can you please remove it', and I demurred. Now I
      understand that I was in the wrong, and should have complied with their polite
      request. Other VR developers (3-4 at least) have clipped my youtube videos and
      I've gotten strikes just because I had the temerity to say that their game sucks,
      or sometimes that the game is good! [spoiler]To that end, fuck Yur.fit, fuck
      Claude Monet, The Water Lily Obsession, fuck Djinni and Thaco 35 dollar endless
      tutorial experience, Fuck Trauma Simulator, etc. It's like Quantum phsics where
      certain VR experiences dissappear when byteframe looks at them.[/spoiler] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVdBevEpJ-c
