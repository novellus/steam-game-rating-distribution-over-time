    short_description: Glide through futuristic courses at breakneck speeds and eliminate
      those who stand in your way. BallisticNG is an action packed anti-gravity racer
      and the ultimate AG modding sandbox, developed as a love letter to the original
      Wipeout trilogy with the authentic physics to match.

    review: A very good WipEout style game. With a bit of modding it can look, sound
      and feel just like WipEout. I only wish there was an option for a more modern
      graphical style, akin to WipEout HD/Pulse graphics, without the angular models
      and retro shaders.
