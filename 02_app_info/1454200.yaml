    short_description: Ragozin on Moon-2D platformer with a side view of an astronaut
      forgotten on the moon. Control your jetpack to fly from site to site, all the
      way to the base, but be careful! In addition to fuel, which is constantly running
      out, you will be hindered by fast meteors and deadly black holes!
