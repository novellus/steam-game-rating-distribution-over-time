I wish there was a better ending or perhaps a continuation game going into their college life rather than just zooming in on either Chiyoko or Arisa's face. The main character was a bit too much of a weeb for my tastes and is a bit of a cliche, however this game provided many interesting facts about Japanese culture and I learned a lot from it. Would love to see more of this game.","timestamp_created":1609207991,"timestamp_updated":1609207991,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ramR1vYCevSmvgI="}
