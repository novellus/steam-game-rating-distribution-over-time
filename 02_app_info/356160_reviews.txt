I have no interest in horror themes, jump scares, etc. so it was never going to impress in that way. I also have to agree with other reviewers that this is very repetitive, making you search through the same areas over and over, albeit extending the rooms progressively, and doesn't ever get beyond that. Some of the puzzles are OK but also very frustrating. I didn't find much to recommend it, I'm afraid. Finally, it's not a HOG in any way that players of the usual HOGs would understand the term so don't get it assuming that that's what you're getting, which is what I assume I did, It's a very repetitive room escape game with endless searching.","timestamp_created":1575496921,"timestamp_updated":1575496921,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+uW76e4Cctf/4QE="}
