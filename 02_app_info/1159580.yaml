    review: 'A few things I have to say about this:


      1. The songs themselves and how they work with the player


      The player isn''t the best, but it definitely has everything you''d want (repeat,
      shuffle, etc.) The songs are pretty interesting and ambient, just the soundtrack
      songs. The come in .wav, that odd file type that opens iTunes, and .flac, as
      well as natively playing in steam player when launched.


      2. The wallpapers, covers, and ringtones.


      If you care about them, the stuff is pretty cool. The ringtones are from Confined
      Opponent, Eternal Fight Lost Realms, and New Adventures. They are okay, I suppose.
      Not the best but certainly not the worst ringtones ever. The wallpapers for
      PC are 4k and FHD, and there are two different types of wallpapers. One kind
      of looks like the cover but less text. The mobile wallpapers are the same style
      as the other PC wallpapers. My only complaint would be that there is a generally
      small yet very noticeable watermark saying "Moonlighter Between Dimensions"
      and under it it says "moonlighterthegame.com". I know this is a small game and
      credit is deserved for these wallpapers, which are actually good, but it is
      kind of annoying that their website is plastered on and near the middle of my
      phone when I just enjoy the game. Not a big deal, but if this is changed it
      would make me a bit more confident in my purchase.


      Final thoughts: If you''ve played the DLC and want the soundtrack, get this.
      It''s exactly as advertised, and if you dont mind watermarks you will love it.'
