    review: "[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift[/h1]\n\nYou can view my review & gameplay\
      \ here: https://youtu.be/DdhtkKnJ-bc\n\nKunFu Town VR is a poor imitation of\
      \ Paint The Town Red. It has limited content, basic gameplay, and is unpolished\
      \ overall. I honestly thought it was an Early Access game and had to look over\
      \ the store page to verify that indeed it wasn't in Early Access. It has not\
      \ received any updates in a long while. \n\nThis game is running on the Unity\
      \ Engine. It ran fine on my 1060 GTX, running at a relatively steady 90 frames\
      \ per second. The visuals lead you to believe there will be fun, voxel physics\
      \ like there is in Paint The Town Red, but there just isn't. You beat an opponent\
      \ with a bat or sword, it makes no difference. The physics are nearly the same.\
      \ You still usually have to give them a good couple of wacks before they keel\
      \ over. Meanwhile, they just slowly turn red. Like you're painting. \n\nGory\
      \ physics? Well, you can decapitate heads sometimes. However, that seems to\
      \ happen haphazardly. There is no other kind of dismemberment. It just doesn't\
      \ have the gory physics that you see in other VR titles. It's more like paint\
      \ dripping red than anything else. It's a sad state of affairs really. Yes there\
      \ are different weapons you can use and you can even shoot some or throw some\
      \ ... they just don't make that much of a difference in the end. It's more fun\
      \ to just punch actually.\n\nSo the gameplay loop isn't interesting, but it\
      \ also has limited content. There are 2 full maps, which you can beat in like\
      \ 10 minutes each. There's also an arena mode and a developer torture mode,\
      \ which is more exciting than it sounds. You'll want to torture the developers\
      \ after playing this game, it just isn't fun actually playing the torture developer\
      \ mode in this game.\n\nHave I mentioned the poor teleportation? Yeah, it's\
      \ pretty bad here and I'm not even talking about the stamina system with the\
      \ teleport. I mean the teleportation is badly implemented. You don't have full\
      \ locomotion either. Oddly, you do have smooth turning, but it's way too slow\
      \ so it's next to useless. Lastly, you can grab almost any item and use it as\
      \ a weapon. There's several items you can grab. There's also several items you\
      \ can't grab. I have no idea why that is. \n\nI got bored of this game after\
      \ about 30 minutes. Every minute after that I just started hating the game more.\
      \ So I didn't finish the arena mode (I did complete the office and the supermarket).\
      \ I'm happy to uninstall this game and never touch it again. \n\n[b]Rate 4/10.\
      \ Just play Paint The Town Red in 3D in VR using HelixVision. It's a much better\
      \ experience, even without motion controls.[/b]\n\n[quote]If you enjoyed my\
