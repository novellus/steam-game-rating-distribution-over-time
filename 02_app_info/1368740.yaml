    review: 'Kevin Penkin is the Moses of music: parting the seas of drab and drivel
      pop songs to inject some godly beats straight into your jugular. All of this
      with the help of Jeremy Lim, which is topped with the sweet, sweet sounds of
      Soft Science''s "Nothing." I cannot praise this OST enough. If it says anything,
      this is the first OST I''ve bought of the 220 something games I have on Steam.
      If I could buy it twice, heck, even three times, I would.'
