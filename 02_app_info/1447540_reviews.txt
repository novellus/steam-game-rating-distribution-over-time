Travelling through this bizar world might even learn Jonathan a few things about himself. I liked this short game... there was something intruiging about these sureal locations and bizar encounters. For an indie game by one person it was a very polished product. Nice graphics, music and sounds. Puzzles were also interesting and well integrated in the story.  recommended!\n","timestamp_created":1606986664,"timestamp_updated":1606986664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529553651809692383","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhNH3k/YCftj5tgI="}
