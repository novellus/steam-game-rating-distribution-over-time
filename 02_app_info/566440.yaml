    review: "Greetings!  Today we\u2019ll be reviewing \u201CNecromunda: Underhive\
      \ Wars\u201D a frankly disappointing take on the miniature game.  The game is\
      \ a tactical squad based game with a heavy amount of verticality.  I\u2019ve\
      \ always loved this genre and even more so the source material so why am I so\
      \ disappointed?  Let\u2019s discuss.\n\nGreen Juuve:  The game starts out amazing,\
      \ the campaign story is exactly what you\u2019d expect from Necromunda and I\u2019\
      m even able to forgive that.  Though I continue to be annoyed at writers being\
      \ forced to shift their stories to fit the game which makes the stories predictable\
      \ at best, boring at worst but the game does make it clear the campaign is more\
      \ of a tutorial than stand alone, so that\u2019s done well\u2026right?  Nope,\
      \ the tutorials are just little text boxes in the corner that pop up and disappear\
      \ randomly, in the \u2018current year\u2019 this really should be audio, with\
      \ visuals or at least pop-ups you have to dismiss.  As best I can tell you don\u2019\
      t even have access to an encyclopedia of any kind of tutorials, this would have\
      \ been at least okay.  \n\nDouble Tap: So beyond the tutorial the campaign is\
      \ great right?  Well, kind of.  The campaign has you taking control of 3 random\
      \ gangs throughout the campaign and you never really get to know the gangers\
      \ abilities and they feel like they are constantly changing (which they are)\
      \ but most importantly you are left with a feeling of meaningless as there is\
      \ no management of any kind during the campaign.  You heard me, the biggest\
      \ side-attraction of any tactical game, managing your gang, is completely absent\
      \ during the campaign.  I love taking a brand new fighter and turning them into\
      \ a hive champion but nope, you got to wait for the \u2018real game\u2019. \
      \ But without that you have little to no attachment and you are left with a\
      \ disappointing campaign that couldn\u2019t even properly teach the mechanics.\n\
      \nRecycled Air:  So, positives\u2026okay, positives.  The game feels 40k through\
      \ and through, from the way they talk to the graphics, everything.  It\u2019\
      s amazing, the guns feel right (sans the melta gun) the world looks great everything!\
      \  So yes! The bones are amazing, could be great if some of the above (and below)\
      \ issues were resolved.  The verticality is amazing too, jumping down and climbing\
      \ up is something only a few games have tried in this genre.  Once you are done\
      \ with the campaign and start the \u2018real\u2019 game of building and leading\
      \ your gang the game does improve significantly.  Most of this is faithful to\
      \ the setting and miniature game but that\u2019s the rub though, the moment\
      \ you start a gang of your own a ray of light comes from the upper spires and\
      \ you see what the game was meant to be.  It feels like this was created first\
      \ and the campaigns \u2018tutorial\u2019 was created not to compliment it but\
      \ because one was needed.  The games doesn\u2019t explain so much that becomes\
      \ easily obvious the moment you start your own gang.\n\nCover your mouth:  I\
      \ kept hearing how unbelievably awful the AI is on this game, I ignored it thinking\
      \ \u2018sure many games have bad AI and I enjoy them\u2019 but I was not prepared.\
      \  The single greatest breaking point of this game is the beyond awful and completely\
      \ unplayable AI.  Most matches the AI would run around jumping up and down the\
      \ terrain MAYBE debuffing me or overwatching but most of their turns would hold\
      \ zero effect.  The AI doesn\u2019t even seem to be able to go after objectives.\
      \  I had one mission where one of the AI picked up an objected, so I spent a\
      \ few turns watching it and it didn\u2019t even try to extract.  The unplayable\
      \ nature of the AI is what breaks this game, so much of the game's issues can\
      \ be forgiven once you get into the real game (after the campaign) if only the\
      \ AI functioned at a modicum of intelligence.  Oh, and a fast forward option\
      \ would be amazing while the AI acts.\n\nNo Servitors Allowed:  I want to take\
      \ a moment to say that if you are going to be playing this with other people\
      \ (or lizard men) then an overwhelming amount of issues I have with this game\
      \ is null and void as the game at its core is great.  The AI is beyond terrible\
      \ and I could see a lot of fun starting an operation with your friends, though\
      \ I would have liked to see a bit more of a \u2018campaign mode\u2019 option\
      \ that is more faithful to the table-top.  The game is in dire need of smoothing\
      \ out beyond the AI but at least getting them to behave enough to down one of\
      \ my gangers would be appreciated.\n\nUltimately, I want to love this game,\
      \ it has everything someone like me could want: heavy management aspects, the\
      \ tactical gameplay and 40k aesthetic but the game is just drowned in a mediocre\
      \ front loaded campaign that couldn\u2019t even base itself as a decent tutorial\
      \ and an incompetent AI that doesn\u2019t even have the decency to attack every\
      \ once in a while.  This game could have been vastly improved by just one person\
      \ going through the campaign and smoothing out some of the tutorial non-sense.\
      \  Although, I hope for an update to fix this I just don\u2019t see those Spire-Born\
      \ fixing this anytime soon.  Enjoy!"
