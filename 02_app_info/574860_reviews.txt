However, there is No hentai content in the current Steam version but a few not really hot bikini pictures. I've tried to look for the \"original\", but it seems to be unavailable at the current moment.\n\nSo, now it is a short wanna-be survival horror game: you basically landed in some mystic mansion, filled with monsters and closed doors. You need to check for some hidden boxes, find the keys to unlock the doors and solve some puzzles, fight some melee monsters with the pistol or the old-school knife, and eventually get away from the mansion. To speed up the player, a satiety scale is introduced into the game, which basically acts as a timer counting down the time until the end of the game. The average gameplay time is about 1-2 hours (and most of that time you'll be figuring the locks and keys).\n\nThe visuals ain't all bad, the looped music track (or there were two?) and sounds ain't all bad either. However, it is all not good enough for the 5$ tag. The only reason to buy the game is the usual two bad things combination: easy \"complete\" with achievements, and steam cards, which seems to be overvalued at the market at moment. All that shady overpricing about profile backgrounds with the girl in underwear... Sex sells, right?\n\nWell, I can't recommend the game for being that low and miserable. Even if I actually like some of the arts and parts of gameplay there, I'd rather bought some book with my dollar. My mark for \"PMC\" is 4.5/10. If you're not into shady steam market deals with over-evaluated cards, don't bother.","timestamp_created":1549473994,"timestamp_updated":1549493270,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.739128708839416504","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw396/4ugCfY6WugE="}
