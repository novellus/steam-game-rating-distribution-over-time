However, what the game does wrong may require your patience and goodwill more often than not. Therefore, its appeal is a bit more narrow than other titles, even from that period.\n\nOn the upside, first things first: it’s Infogrames, it’s Cthulhu. That alone could take you through. This version contains decent voice acting. Nothing extraordinary, but still giving a serviceable personality and flavor to almost all characters. The overall plot is charming, par for the course for Cthulhu lovers. Art direction is stylish, especially the scenery and building design.\n\nOther than that, you’ll probably find out for yourself that Shadow of the Comet’s best quality is a certain ‘je ne sais quoi’, a mysterious style that guarantees its place in the gaming cosmos.\n\nOn the downside, I’d start with sound design. I always chuckle when reading the official line about this: “Bone chilling sound effects that hurtle you into the depths of chaos!”. Uh… no. Sound effects are lacking when compared to similar titles from its time (even other Infogrames’ titles), sometimes just plain weird and funny and also very sparse. Many a scene will feel bland precisely because of this shortcoming of “silent” events.\n\nSome puzzles hinder the game’s progression, locking your progress if you make “wrong” choices. Save, save and save, my friend. Dialogue choice structure is linear and also blemished by the 'game-over mechanic' problem.\n\nPlot progression felt weird and sometimes nonsensical, tarnishing the story. Not the plot itself, which I quite enjoyed it, but the transitions between the main scenes (the diary helps to bring rythm to the story, but not as much as one would think).\n\nIn the end, I'd still recommend Shadow of the Comet without hesitation. It’s very didactic of its time if nothing else. Game history par excellence.","timestamp_created":1609228757,"timestamp_updated":1609228757,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gMXg1vYCddevvgI="}
