    review: 'You just weren''t that good. I felt like you were going to be more of
      an economy and travel focused game with a merchant focus. You weren''t really
      that. I''m not sure what you were. I''ve had better random side quests and side
      mechanics in other games that do the same thing you do, but better. The fact
      you tried to make a game centered around something, and then didn''t centre
      it around that, and in fact centred it around seemingly nothing, is impressive.
      But you don''t get points for bad game design. Sorry lads. 3/10.
