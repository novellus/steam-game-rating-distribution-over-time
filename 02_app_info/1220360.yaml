    review: 'More of the same near-zero-effort trash made by the same Chinese developer
      as "Survive In A Little Bit" which made my M.I.S.S. #53, "Block bat invasion"
      which made M.I.S.S. #54 and "Hippo Eating Banana" which made M.I.S.S. #56.  All
      three of my previous M.I.S.S. coverage of these developer came in May of 2019
      and all three of those games were obviously made by the same person, but listed
      under different developer names here on Steam.

      This is just more of the same corrupt nonsense and just one more reason that
      Steam should be ashamed of what they allow on the Steam platform.  THIS is the
      kind of trash that gives both Steam and indie developers a bad image and reputation.


      Zero score.  NOT RECOMMENDED.  This trash isn''t even worth a nickel, much less
      $16 USD.'
