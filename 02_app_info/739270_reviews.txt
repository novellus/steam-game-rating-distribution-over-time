The atmosphere and the story are very grim dark which i love. It has a few issues as it is right now, such as grip detection, being killed through doors, and the view doing wonky things when I look up or down to far. But overall, in my short time, I've enjoyed it. I'm looking forward to what this game could become in the future.","timestamp_created":1603340983,"timestamp_updated":1603340983,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546424806118011475","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4rbukp/UCeNGuqQI="}
