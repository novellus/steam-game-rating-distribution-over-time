    review: "This game used to be good before the new devs took over\n\nthey would\
      \ like to have us believe they are working hard which\_is clearly not true,\
      \ all we see so far is a \n\n1. Basic UI\n2. Horrible Character Animations \n\
      3. Boring Level Design \n4. Some of the worst combat I've seen \n5. A Basic\
      \ Building system which is just so bland, the old buildings had doors and storage\
      \ capability and could be destroyed I hit for long enough\n6. The New\_Character\_\
      are\_so Ugly\n\nthey have 100% taken everything good out of VooDoo and shit\
      \ on it and put it all back in\n\_\nits a shame to say this\_but don't\_bother\
      \ buying this is in current states its a Dead game with Dead servers and a Dev\
      \ team that have clearly given up"
