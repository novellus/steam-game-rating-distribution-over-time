      Info</h2>The EGA/VGA graphics are colorful and stunning, with fast scrolling

      computers. You will need to slow them down to play).'

    review: 'This is pretty much a relic of its time.


      The game doesn''t take too much time to beat, but most of that time will be
      spent constantly saving and reloading your save due to the over abundance of
      cheap tricks the game throws at you. I don''t mind cheap tricks in a video game,
      but due to the limitations at the time, avoiding the enemies and pits throughout
      the experience is more of a hassle than fun. It also doesn''t help that the
      health you have at the end of one level carries over to the next level, meaning
      the challenge is increased to further tedium.


      Overall, I can''t complain too much about the game since it''s free these days,
      but I can''t let these problems go unnoticed.


      I''ll set my review as a recommendation based on it being free and a relic of
      its time. You shouldn''t expect to have a wonderful experience from this title
      unless you had fond memories of it at the time.'
