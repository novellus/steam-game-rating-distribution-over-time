    review: "When I think of a fun racing game, I think of games like Burnout 3 and\
      \ Blur; These games are exciting, and offer more to do than traditional lap-style\
      \ racing. \n\nBurnout has fantastic crash physics (for it's time and even today\
      \ still is really cool), blistering speeds, and you can perform Takedowns on\
      \ other drivers by making them crash with hard-hitting slams and shunts. There\n\
      so many technics you can learn to perform takedowns too. The boost is satiystfing\
      \ as HELL to use, and the game has a rocking soundtrack.\n\nBlur is a racing\
      \ game that is more slippery than Burnout 3, but the mario kard inspired powerups\
      \ pick the game right up. Every powerup serves a different purpose, and although\
      \ it may not be as tight and responsive as Burnout, there certainly is so much\
      \ to work with, with the track layouts in conjunction with the different power\
      \ ups. Also, 4 Player split screen! Holy crap that's awesome!\n\nWhat does this\
      \ game offer? None of that. The cars and the driving physics are very likely\
      \ to be pre-purchased assets. Now, if they were used in a fun, creative manner,\
      \ simular to games like the ones I mentioned before, then perhaps I wouldn't\
      \ be so harsh on this garbage. But, in the end, what can you do in this game?\
      \ Pretty much nothing. Pick a car, drive in a time trial because nobody else\
      \ is playing online. There are no computer drivers because most likely the developer\
      \ doesn't know how to program them. This could've been worked around by making\
      \ the time trials at least somewhat exciting with bizzare obstacles and speed\
      \ pickups, or just anything to make it more than just... whatever this is supposed\
      \ to be."
