    detailed_description: "<h1>Our Media Friends!</h1><p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ever\
      \ since our Greenlighting, we've received so much love from everyone and we\
      \ are humbled!</h2><br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.otakuaniverse.com/index.php/visual-novels/506-forgotten-not-lost-review\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Otaku Aniverse</a> - Forgotten, Not Lost\
      \ has two of the most important qualities needed to make a visual novel great.\
      \ The most important part of any visual novel is a strong and thought provoking\
      \ story that draws out emotions in the reader. This visual novel has a solid\
      \ story that conveys an important message and puts you in the shoes of the main\
      \ character. Another important feature that should be present in any visual\
      \ novel is art that compliments the story and emotions. The art in this visual\
      \ novel is simple but helps to set the mood as it was intended. I highly recommend\
      \ this to visual novel fans who enjoy emotional stories and simple yet beautiful\
      \ art.<br><br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://subalterngaming.wordpress.com/2016/04/09/forgotten-not-lost-2016/\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >SUBALTERN GAMING</a> - Forgotten, Not\
      \ Lost is a great accomplishment for effectively instilling varying emotions\
      \ into the writing and overall package of the game and successfully conveying\
      \ this to the player. While the topic of dementia is sad in itself, it is handled\
      \ well here and not overly pandering. The author of the story, Darren Kwok,\
      \ based it off actual experiences caring for someone with dementia. Afterthought\
      \ Studios\u2019 in concert with the motto of Touching Hearts Through Words,\
      \ created this short kinetic novel. It is a mature title backed by a mature\u2013\
      in professionalism at least\u2013company. It\u2019s short and inexpensive, and\
      \ a great example of an indie title matching big-budget talent.<br><br><a href=\"\

      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Fuwanovel </a>- It does what few VNs\

      \ very real, and relatable way.<br><br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://hayurika.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/forgotten-not-lost-review/#more-1314\"\
      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Hayurika</a> - ... the story does leave\
      \ the player with a deep feeling for the farmer and his illness, hopefully helping\
      \ raise more awareness about dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s in the long run.<br><br><a\

      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >VNVortex</a> - The art of the game is\
      \ quite simplistic, but it fits the sorrowful theme very nicely \u2013 same\

      \ I liked a lot), character sprites, and backgrounds are quite simple and subdued,\
      \ but fittingly so, given the themes and setting, and they work together with\
      \ the words to evoke a bittersweet atmosphere that veers between joyful and\
