Nice enemy variations and attack patterns.  Just the right level of difficulty as well (at least for me).  This is another Steam hidden gem that deserves more attention.  \n  \nIf I could recommend a few things to the dev: \n\nFirst would be that the pause button on the controller needs to bring up the same game menu as the escape key does on the keyboard.  Second, the game needs an online leaderboard. Just for funs sake.  Lastly, after you input your initials and get the Game Over screen you should immediately be shown the scoreboard.  Not sent back out to the main menu.","timestamp_created":1610078233,"timestamp_updated":1610083892,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwss+e8PYCfMW5wQI="}
