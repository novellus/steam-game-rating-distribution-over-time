    about_the_game: <strong>Story<strong></strong></strong><br><br>Your name is Mambo
      - You are part of the Spanish Special Forces and you dedicated your life for
      over 20 years to serve and protect your beloved country - You were thinking
      of retiring from this hard life as a soldier but prior to that you received
      a mission from your commander and friend Alvarez - Eliminate all the dangers
      that plague your dear country! For that task you will be asigned to the Bripac
      paratrooper divison where you will get transported in a helicopter to hostile
      places in order to eliminate any trace of danger for your country.<br><br><br><strong>Gameplay</strong><br><br>Fight
      your way through the enemy territory in this awesome 2D platformer with unique
      mechanics and an outstanding soundtrack!<br><br>After your deployment behind
      enemy lines, you face hostile traps and sentry guns right from the start - How
      will you beat them? Shoot them directly or blow up the ground below them, but
      the last option comes at the cost of sacrificing your own ground to walk on
      which might make it harder to not fall to your death! <br><br>Shooting the enemies
      directly comes with a reward too since they can drop useful items like health
      refills, grenades or one out of 4 playable guns that bring their own benefits
      with them like the powerful one shot bazooka, the reliable and strong AK-47
      or the rapid firing MAC-10.<br><br>The game contains 20 levels with a gradually
      increasing difficulty and an infinite game mode.<h2 class="bb_tag">Welcome,

    review: Cool little 2d platformer. I like nice retro style graphics. Also there
      are several levels which are enough challenging to beat. Also there is achievements
      which make game more enjoyable. And of course the price is good for retro game.
      Would recommend
