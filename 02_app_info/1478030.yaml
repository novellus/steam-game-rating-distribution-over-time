      - You are part of the Spanish Special Forces and you dedicated your life for
      over 20 years to serve and protect your beloved country - You were thinking
      of retiring from this hard life as a soldier but prior to that you received
      a mission from your commander and friend Alvarez - Eliminate all the dangers
      that plague your dear country! For that task you will be asigned to the Bripac
      paratrooper divison where you will get transported in a helicopter to hostile
      places in order to eliminate any trace of danger for your country.<br><br><br><strong>Gameplay</strong><br><br>Fight
      your way through the enemy territory in this awesome 2D platformer with unique
      mechanics and an outstanding soundtrack!<br><br>After your deployment behind
      enemy lines, you face hostile traps and sentry guns right from the start - How
      will you beat them? Shoot them directly or blow up the ground below them, but

      or the rapid firing MAC-10.<br><br>The game contains 20 levels with a gradually
      increasing difficulty and an infinite game mode.<h2 class="bb_tag">Welcome,
