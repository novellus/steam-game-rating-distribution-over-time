    review: 'I recommend this game, but only with reservations. Be aware that the
      interface can be quite touchy - in an early scene, you need to use a bucket
      of water to put out a fire, and it took several attempts for me to find just
      the right spot to click in order for it to register. This issue occurred in
      multiple games.


      One other quibble (and it is a minor one): when a puzzle requires multiple similar
      items to solve (e.g. scraps of paper), there is no way of knowing if you have
      all of them other than going to the puzzle, putting in the pieces you have,
      and then checking if it will let you play. So, it can get frustrating running
      back and forth to the puzzle to see if you finally have all of the bits.


      On the plus side, the artwork is quite nice, and the mystery story is engaging,
      which made me want to keep pushing through to see how it all turned out.'
