    review: 'The writing has a annoying pretentious quality of some one who believes
      they are an expert, unfortunately they only think that and often have a fundamental
      misunderstanding about the subject matter they are writing.


      The story is exposition heavy and wordy, it focuses more on telling you everything
      instead of showing (something that can happen even in a book). And overall it
      tries to cram to many subject matters into one story without any real direction.'
