As it turns out the game was reasonably fun and some of the levels quite challenging.  Some people might find it a bit repetitive and grinding but I feel that is true of most of these types of games.  If you don't like time management games then why are you even looking at this one?  Anyway I do recommend it for people who enjoy this time of game.","timestamp_created":1568326279,"timestamp_updated":1568326279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526795864105224609","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49fvhk+0Ce8+P0gE="}
