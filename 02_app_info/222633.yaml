    about_the_game: "As part of British Rail\u2019s popular Sprinter family of diesel\
      \ multiple units, Class 159s were a popular sight on south west services from\
      \ the UK\u2019s capital to the west of England, and is now available for Train\
      \ Simulator. <br><br>Built between 1989 and 1992 as Class 158 units, the Class\
      \ 159 units were converted in the early 1990s to meet a demand on south west\
      \ services to replace ageing Class 50 loco-hauled services. The Class 50 trains\
      \ were not suited to the short distances between stops and suffered reliability\
      \ issues.<br><br>In all, 22 units were converted into Class 159 units, incorporating\
      \ modifications such as the addition of a First Class passenger section and\
      \ cab modifications. The most notable improvement was a more powerful 400hp\
      \ diesel engine that allowed the units to tackle some of the more challenging\
      \ gradients with ease.<br><br>Class 159 DMUs are formed of a leading Driving\
      \ Motor Composite vehicle, incorporating the first class section, a Motor Second\
      \ trailer vehicle and a reversed Driving Motor Second vehicle. These three-car\
      \ sets were often coupled in units of six vehicles, allowing them to carry some\
      \ 424 passengers.<br><br>The BR Class 159 for Train Simulator is available in\
      \ late Network SouthEast and South West Trains liveries, and reproduces the\
      \ three-car DMU as it operated for Network SouthEast following inception in\
      \ 1993 and before refurbishment in 2000, as well as in its modern South West\
      \ Trains guise. Also included is an InterCity Swallow liveried High Speed Train.<br><br>The\
      \ locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible, giving you the freedom to drive\
      \ the Class 159 on any Quick Drive enabled route for Train Simulator, such as\
