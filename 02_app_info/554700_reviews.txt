But I liked it anyway.\nIt's a pretty decent escape room game for the low price it is now (0,99 euro's, I think I paid even less).\nOnly gripe I have, why didn't the developer use the regular trigger instead of the awful handle triggers.\n\nHope to see some more from this developer.","timestamp_created":1580512643,"timestamp_updated":1580512643,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+6D5/u8Cd+a07wE="}
