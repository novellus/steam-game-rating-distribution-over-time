    about_the_game: 'As our hero sits in a prison cell in the depths of the Kind Queen''s
      deadly dungeon, Death is about to carry out her duty and cross the hero off
      her list. When suddenly her hourglass stops working. Since her hourglass determines
      the time every humanoid being has to fork over its soul to the realm of Death,
      naturally this constitutes an existential crisis for Death. So, counter-intuitively,
      Death herself spared our hero''s life - for now. Well, she rips out the soul,
      converts it into a ghostly wraith, and commands the hero to search for the cause
      of the time freeze.<br><br><u>ADVENTURE INTO A TIMELESS WORLD</u><br>With this
      new quest at hand, our hero has no choice but to explore this altered world
      in this new form. But, generous as Death inherently is, the hero gets one unique
      ability for this unusual quest: Possession of any living or once-living being.
      And with that comes the ability to use the special skills, that the possessed
      has or once had.<br><br>So join our ghostly hero and venture through this idle
      world in search of answers for Death and maybe, just maybe, a way to avoid the
      dire consequences of standing at the head of Death''s list.'
