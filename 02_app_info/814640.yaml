    about_the_game: "Lee is having a restless night, sure he's fast asleep, but that\
      \ won't stop him taking on of his nocturnal journeys! Fortunately, our sleepwalker\
      \ has a courageous canine companion who will try his utmost to protect his master\
      \ from coming to any harm; Lee's faithful mutt, Ralph.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLee's\
      \ four legged friend is zapped, bashed, clobbered, pummeled singed and squashed,\
      \ but nothing will stop him from performing his dedicated duty, (although the\
      \ odd fire hydrant may distract him)... it's all par for the course of a night\
      \ errand.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese midnight meanderings take him to the most\
      \ hazardous of places...the creepy graveyard, the gooky zoo, precarious construction\
      \ sites and the traffic strewn city streets, but Lee's loyal rover steadfastly\
      \ guards his master from all impending dangers, with painful consequences! <br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nFeaturing sound effects and speech created by Lenny Henry,\
      \ and superb cartoon style animation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game centres on\
      \ a boy called Lee and his faithful dog Ralph. We're introduced to Lee from\
      \ the dog's perspective after waking up to find his owner sleepwalking through\
      \ his bedroom window. Ralph leaps after him and the player then takes control\
      \ of what happens next.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThroughout the game Lee will relentlessly\
      \ walk in the direction he is facing, the problem is there are objects and pitfalls\
      \ in his path that can ultimately wake him up or even kill him. The player can\
      \ monitor Lee's sleep level with a bar at the top of the screen. If the bar\
      \ reaches zero, Lee wakes up and the player loses a life. If this happens three\
      \ (or five depending on settings) times the game is lost.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      The player controls Ralph the dog in order to manipulate either Lee, or the\
      \ objects he is likely to walk into, to see him safely to the end of a level.\
      \ The frequency of these pitfalls increases as each level progresses and, as\
      \ it does, the player has to spend more time strategically neutralising threats,\
      \ far in advance of Lee's actual position in the level.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      Although it is possible for Lee to die, resulting in a loss of life and restart\
      \ of the level for the player, Ralph is invincible, surviving otherwise fatal\
      \ incidents with comedic effect.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf all the levels are successfully\
      \ completed Lee finally returns to his bed and crawls back in."
