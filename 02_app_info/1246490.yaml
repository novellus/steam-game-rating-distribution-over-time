    review: "This could be a fun game but needs more work, copy paste, multiple selection,\
      \ resolution fixes, domino glitches, corners.\n\nIn it's current state the game\
      \ is fun (if I turn everything down to low), but I experienced so many bugs\
      \ that I quickly realised I was not going to be able to create anything like\
      \ the contraptions I found in the workshop. Most of which did not work without\
      \ a few resets.\n\nThe developer(s) seem quite active in the forum so kudos\
      \ for that, and if you have a decent PC that can run this then I think it could\
      \ be a fun little simulator. \n\nBut I can not recommend it in it's current\
      \ state, based on my experience. But I will be keeping an eye on this for the\
      \ future\n"
