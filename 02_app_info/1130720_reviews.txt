I was hoping for this to be one of those old-school tower defense games, but it's not. \nThis game has 30 levels, which all look the same. \nIt's a very active game, where you need to spam your mouse buttons all the time. The defending of your tower/castle only happens by you, spamming those buttons. There are a couple of things you can upgrade, but they actually don't help you that much. Unfortunatly this game lacks variation, which makes you want to quit it after probably 5-10 levels.\n\nPro's:\n+ Certain amount of difficulty, which makes you need to play the same level twice sometimes\n\nCons:\n- Not enough possible upgrades\n- Too active (you need to be clicking ALL THE TIME)\n- Not enough variaton\n\nWorth grinding for the achievements?:\nYes, it's a quick 100%, so go for it! I do warn you that it's boring...\n\nPrice: â‚¬0.39 (Sales)\nWorth it's money?: No\nOverall: 5/10","timestamp_created":1599571879,"timestamp_updated":1599571879,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xbz6tvQCePjIoAI="}
