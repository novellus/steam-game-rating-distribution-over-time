    review: "My first play and impressions of this game were streaming live and can\
      \ be watched HERE:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D66REJ0NPhU\n\nAt the time\
      \ of this review (and livestream I recorded above), there are NO other current\
      \ reviews for this game, and no feedback at all.. so I feel HONEST feedback\
      \ is important for the developer(s)...\n\nThis game shows promise.  It could\
      \ be a fun little game with some more work.  But it definitely needs a lot of\
      \ work and love because as it is now, it only scored about a 4 out of 10 from\
      \ me.\n\nWhat's broken:  \n\nCollisions:  You character will fall down when\
      \ just walking into any object what-so-ever.  It's quite funny the first few\
      \ times, but quickly gets frustrating.  Maybe make it so you fall down only\
      \ if running over an object, but not when walking.  And make the mice never\
      \ make you fall down because that is just goofy as hell.\n\nFighting:  The fighting\
      \ is complety broken and just not fun.  All you need to do us spam your left\
      \ mouse button and hope for the best.  Make the fighting interesting.  Gave\
      \ the player some way to dodge swings by enemies (besides holding up a shield)\
      \ and make the player weapon collisions better with enemies.  It just needs\
      \ work because as it is today it just looks and feels stupid silly.\n\nDoor\
      \ Buttons:  Way to hard to find and see.  Make the buttons more obvious as they\
      \ are sometimes just way to hard to find as they blend into the wall too much\n\
      \nFix these issues and give the game a little more TLC and you might have a\
      \ game I can give a recommended score to.  I'll check back on this one in a\
      \ few months, especially if I come back and see some updates have been done\
      \ to fix some of these issues I've described above.\n\nAt launch this game is\
      \ funny, but it's a mess.  It needs work and I cannot recommend it in its current\
      \ state.   4 out of 10."
