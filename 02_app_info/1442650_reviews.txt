Was the VR social application, VRChat! Installing a Mod where you use a special bHaptic Avatar.  Others simply touch your Avatar Vest and you'll feel it on the Tactsuit your wearing.   100% of those VRChat video's are how it freaks people out.  When they are touched wearing bHaptics in VRChat.  So, what I'm getting at is this.  WHY NOT USE TOUCH IN A VR HORROR GAME?  Try something NEW other than Controller Feedback and Jump Scares add triggered  haptics from your game mechanics.\n\nAudio-to Haptics could be implemented for feedback. Thunder Clap, Window Rattles, TV Comes On all those could send a slight or intense wave across the *Tactsuit at the moment they happen.\n\n*Tactal aka Face Cover (with 6 vibartion points).  Activate it when the Ghost Girl is upside down is seemingly clinging to your Head. Or another when the 4 ceramic masks come flying at you from the wall.  THUNK them in the *Tactal. \n\n*Tactsuit has 40 vibration points 20 front/20 back (another model has 16 or 8 front/8 back). Your falling Busts, have it THUNK the *Tactal and then streak downwards on the *Tactsuit.  As if it just got hit during it's fall to the floor or could be a mild glanced feedback as in just missed you!\n\nOh, by the way bHaptics is based in Korea.  I hope you'll consider Haptics if not for this game, possibly the next VR Horror you make!  I think adding in body Haptics Face, Torso, Arms in VR is the Future. I'm excited for Game DEVs to explore what you can do with the Tech to enhance the VR Horror Genre Even More!","timestamp_created":1609718060,"timestamp_updated":1609854800,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiNq06fYCfJuewAI="}
