FIrst off, it would be a stretch to call this a puzzle game as its trailer claims, there is nothing to puzzle over.  It provides a series of almost identical looking rooms where you are tasked with awkwardly throwing hammers at glass balls.  The throwing mechanic does not even feel accurate or satisfying.  \n\nIt makes almost every design mistake that it is possible to make.  Crouching can break the game, making you freakishly tall if you die and respawn.  The teleport range is uncomfortablt shory and slow.  Infinite hammer spanners litter every level instead of letting the player spawn the hammers directly, or even giving you a single hammer that returns to your hand.  The game over-tutorializes leaving you waiting around listening to incredibly simple mechanics described to you as though they were rocket science.  The story is really simple and stupid, but characters talk about it CONSTANTLY and repetitively.  DIalogue clips take longer to play than it takes to reach the next dialogue trigger, leaving the game interrupting itself constantly.  Boss battle (I only played one, I couldn't bear to continue) was frustrating instead of interesting or even challenging.  Cheesy cutscene PLAYS ON A LOOP that barely starts its second loop before dialogue ends and scene transitions.  Voice acting is terrible (forgivable) and there is A LOT OF IT (unforgivable).  Game has an inconsistent and ugly visual aesthetic.\n\nThe game's most intesting sequences are elevator rides, which it seems to put at the end of level strings as though it were some kind of reward to the player.  If you have ever played literally any other game in VR that included an elevator ride and the ability to throw an object with shitty physics, this game has nothing to offer you.  Not even worth it on a steep sale.","timestamp_created":1494043084,"timestamp_updated":1494043084,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.433144629001617432","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzoj67dsCcZq4eA=="}
