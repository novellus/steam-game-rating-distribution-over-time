The screen is fuzzy, the colors run together making most of the difficulty of the puzzle trying to discern if you are looking at a 7, 8 or a 9. You can't pencil in options, so once you have figured out what numbers are there you are just gonna have to remember.\n\nAlso if you click on an empty space it automatically puts a 1 there. Clicking brings the number up, Right clicking down. Bonus, sometimes when you click off to a different square the old square Also goes up a number. Congrats on teaching me that nothing is sacred in this world, and you can in fact screw up something as simple as Sudoku.","timestamp_created":1608923826,"timestamp_updated":1608923826,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9ajVzfYCcpOSvQI="}
