    review: "I loved loved the first Adventure Boy. It was a surprise stream for me,\
      \ and chat and I loved it. A surprise hit. This one, not so much. It follows\
      \ a similar pattern but the writing just isn't as funny or creative as the first.\
      \ We encountered a couple of glitches where the character was in the gully height\
      \ when above it, and vice versa but a quick world reset by going in and out\
      \ of nearest door fixed that.   The game is also very short compared to the\
      \ first one, and the final fight is copy paste same style as AB Cheapskate.\
      \ \n\nWas disappointed with this, but it's not like they are asking for a huge\
      \ amount of money. If you haven't played the first Adventure Boy, go play that.\
      \ But this one. maybe stay clear."
