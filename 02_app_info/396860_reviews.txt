Oh and also, the soundtrack is amazing.","timestamp_created":1608341398,"timestamp_updated":1608341398,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwn8SnvPYCfpepuwI="}
