It is a nice word search game that makes you play on a grid filled with letters.  You select the words on the grid, and if you word is right, it will appear below in the word list while removing its components from the grid.  Each level will increase the complexity of the search, and you will be navigating from one topic to another.  While the original Wordle took me less than 5 hours to complete, Wordle 2 took a couple hours more to finish.  Wordle 2 is actually more challenging than the original Wordle, mainly because of the choice of topics...  The \"Fish\" topic was a nightmare...  I felt my brain bubbling in its tank while trying to solve its 10 grids.  If you are allergic to fish, avoid this one at all cost.  If you're not, be prepared to have your vocabulary stretched by a number of fish names.","timestamp_created":1609779818,"timestamp_updated":1609779818,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4dWW5/YCe4O5wAI="}
