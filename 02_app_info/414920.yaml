      \ best part by far are the huge bosses you and your team will defeat. Screen-sized\

      \ very smooth and well produced. The game has a very vast and varied cast of\

    short_description: Corgi Warlock is a 1-4 player side-scrolling fantasy action
      game, where one brave Corgi will take on the Skeleton Bunny King's army! Against
      the power of Narwhals, Fencing Bears, and Crazed Unicorns, it takes more than
      your average Corgi to survive the King's onslaught... it takes a CORGI WARLOCK.

    review: "Incr\xEDvel como um joguinho t\xE3o simples (graficamente e na jogabilidade)\
      \ consegue ser t\xE3o divertido e desafiador!! Nele vc\xEA controla um cachorrinho\
      \ cm poderes m\xE1gicos e precisa avan\xE7ar fase a frente derrotando todos\
      \ os inimigos qe surgem pelo caminho cm feiti\xE7os de fogo, raio e at\xE9 laser\
      \ qe v\xE3o sendo desbloqueados no decorrer da campanha. O mais legal de tudo\
      \ \xE9 qe d\xE1 pra jogar coop (local ou online atrav\xE9s do Remote Play) e\
      \ isso com toda certeza deixa a aventura bem melhor, pois querendo ou n\xE3\
      o o jogo \xE9 bastante repetitivo cm o tempo, e acaba perdendo a gra\xE7a por\
      \ se tornar enjoativo, o qe mais prende msmo \xE9 ter uma companhia e vencer\
      \ os Bosses jntos, mas de todo modo vale o pre\xE7o em promo\xE7\xE3o ao meu\
