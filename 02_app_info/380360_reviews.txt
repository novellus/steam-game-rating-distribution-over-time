Just like any other clicker/idle game, you click monsters and baddies off of themed map backgrounds. Hire the bosses you defeat to fight for you, upping your dps  to help defeat more baddies to help move to higher levels and so on and so forth. Pretty generic, but the graphics and characters are nice and cartoony with fun humorous names and abilities, OH and after hiring a boss to fight for you, you level and give them abilities. These help your clicker or your dps, do this by using the gold you get for killing baddies and monsters. There are infinity tokens you get for restarting the game and beating up to so many level(s) bosses, that help you get better and better with dps or clicker or gold income upgrades. Nice, but you have to restart. They're given to you by 4 infinity gods that'll give you the tokens and want you to find out why baddies are baddies, that weren't always baddies. A STORY LINE? play and find out.! tap tap tap...","timestamp_created":1485833751,"timestamp_updated":1602896843,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j5qGmvUCcv3zcA=="}
