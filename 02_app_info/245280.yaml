    review: 'Great post-apocalyptic hack n slash.


      The combat is fun, intense, well done. I loved the story, characters, the scenery.
      It looks very nice despite being 10 years old.


      The platforming is like streamlined, you can''t really fall or die in most of
      the sections, that''s odd but it doesn''t really make it bad, just simplified.


      The camera is sometimes annoying, like I don''t get why would they choose some
      camera angles really. Is just a minor detail that won''t suck the enjoyment
      out of the game but its worth mentioning.


      Pigsy''s Perfect 10 was hilarious, an example of DLC done well. Recommended,
      nice game.'
