Mainly due to the extreme difficulty, as it`s literally impossible to achieve certain things unless you are REALLY patient or, should I put it, lacks anything better to do. And in some cases, that`s not enough. You HAVE TO be directly hinted by the authors themselves before you end up wondering whether the game is designed to be beatable.\n\nBut that`s also to say, the rest of the game is GREAT. If you take it more as an artbook than a mere game, you`ll be surely fascinated. The authors are, so far as I`ve seen, one of the best artists, aesthetically speaking. So long as you`re not in a hurry to \"beat\" the game, instead just view it as an amazing sightseeing into the world they created, it`s not only great. It`s FANTSATIC.\n\nMy first hearing of the game was at some shabby online minigame site around 10 years ago. I played its incorrectly named demo, and immediately got fascinated. At that time online payment was way undeveloped, and I had to send an international bill to purchase, so I did. That`s how I first got the game. The time I spent on this game should be able to match that of a 3A work like Witcher III, and I`ve satisfyingly achieved all 60 endings. That`s really a painful grind, but also a nice and wonderful view into this world the authors created.\n\nThis time, I`d like to once more support the authors via Steam. Thank you for the game, and hopefully, just make more and better games!","timestamp_created":1530721980,"timestamp_updated":1530721980,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5vmIs+QCcJmXpQE="}
