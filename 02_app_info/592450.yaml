    review: "I thought I would take a look using an Oculus Rift, and can report that\
      \ it works fine, using the joystick for teleportation movement.\nAs an experience,\
      \ its similar to viewing an area captured by photogrammetry. Its not a large\
      \ area, but it is fully modelled which gives you much more detailed objects\
      \ than photogrammetry would do. \nI was particularly impressed with the TV screen\
      \ - it looked 'real'. I thought it was the best use of an 'in game' screen Ive\
      \ seen. I hope you add audio controls in the future. Likewise, the rest of the\
      \ environment was well designed. I can imagine that the real life area looks\
      \ just like this.\nI hope you get to expand on this. I can imagine that such\
      \ a virtual landscape would be a useful aid to schools and univeristies in the\
      \ future. \n"
