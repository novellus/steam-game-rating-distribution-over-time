I have only made a couple of reviews but I had to make one on this piece of garbage. It does nothing but crash. It almost deepfries your computer chip and ram. It has worse graphics than halflife alyx and boneworks but those run 144hz with no frame drops just fine for me but this game dosent even let you finish a cutscene without crashing. This game is a waste of time. I hate this game with a burning passion. It had so much potential but Respawn and EA just had to ruin it.","timestamp_created":1610035058,"timestamp_updated":1610035058,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1ark7vYCcYCnwQI="}
