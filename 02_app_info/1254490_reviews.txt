Tried to change the game quality twice (it crashed each time) So thought I would just play it on whatever settings i was given. So..... I started the game.... and thats as far as i got before i closed the game and proceeded to ask for a refund. it took so long to start up even to the first cut scene and then was so jumpy and laggy i just couldnt play it. \nIm disappointed because i thought this game would be loads of fun, turns out its not very well optimised at all.","timestamp_created":1584383350,"timestamp_updated":1584383350,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528009533882141113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz+qm8vACcurJ+AE="}
