    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Pipe Push Paradise is a difficult open world
      puzzle game about plumbing.</h2><br><br>You've arrived on a lonely island faced
      with a hero's calling. The island's plumber has been out of commission for a
      while and the residents are counting on you to get the water running again.
      They could all really use a shower. <br><br>In order to help, you'll need to
      push, flip and roll pipes all across the island in some of the most challenging
      puzzles out there! The minimalist tile-based gameplay is super simple but the
      puzzles are anything but, each offering a unique idea and problem to solve,
      and filled with surprises and new mechanics. <br><br>With an art style that
      wouldn't look out of place in a dusty old travel guide to Puerto Rico and a
      relaxing bossa nova guitar soundtrack, Pipe Push Paradise is bound to satisfy
      any serious puzzle lover. <br><br>Rise to the occasion (push pipes around) and

    review: 'only just got past the pressure plates but this game has a lovely style
      and charm.


      my only complaint is that with other sokoban style games it often feels very
      simple to envision how the pieces move, and in this one it''s often very complex.
      I really struggle with elbow pieces, and imagining how they move. it often feels
      like the only way to find a solution is to exhaust movement options, because
      trying to "see ahead" logically is incredibly difficult.


      still very good, and a very interesting, if agonizing puzzle game.'
