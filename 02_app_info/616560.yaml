    about_the_game: "The Game:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere is a sandbox like no other.\
      \ Create massive battles with absolutely no limits. Want to see 10,000 chickens\
      \ fight an army of Romans?? Sure, why not. Want to see a company of WW2 U.S\
      \ soldiers fight 11,000 Medieval soldiers?? There are simply no limits to the\
      \ carnage you can achieve in Epic Battle Simulator. Mess around with a massive\
      \ variety of units. Everything from, Roman Centurions, Medieval soldiers, Knights,\
      \ Orcs, Trolls, and yes, chickens! The main focus in this game is giving the\
      \ player no restrictions to what he can do. That is why we decided not to limit\
      \ the amount of units in battle. Want to see what a battle of 100,000 units\
      \ looks like? We don't recommend going past 10,000 for most machines but its\
      \ your CPU, do what you want! On top of that, you can play as any one of the\
      \ units in the game, getting up close and personal to help change the tides\
      \ of a massive battle, while rallying teammates and giving them orders!<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nThe Technology:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnfortunately there really aren't\
      \ many engines that you can chuck 10,000 characters in and expect good performance.\
      \ This is why I worked months on end to create the most powerful crowd rendering\
      \ system ever conceived in Unity engine. The detail of each character has little\
      \ effect on performance while each individual acts independently, but is working\
      \ towards a greater good for his team.  Each individual decides his own path\
      \ and navigates complex environments. But I didn't stop there! With the large\
      \ open environments, I needed a more dynamic lighting solution than the one\
      \ built in to Unity engine. So I built my own dynamic global illumination lighting\
      \ engine. This enables bounce light completely in real time. What does that\
      \ mean? That means every piece of shiny armor is reflecting it's true surroundings,\
      \ every bright surfaces illuminates it's surroundings and effects the overall\
      \ lighting. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYes I worked hard to bring this game to life,\
      \ may you all inflict carnage upon it!"
