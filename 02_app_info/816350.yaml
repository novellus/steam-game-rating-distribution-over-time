      developed this game alone during a course of 3-4 months. Whole project started
      when I was experimenting with environment design and it has slowly transformed
      into this short metaphorcial journey which I decided to share with you. Working
      on this project was a very interesting and rewarding experience that has taught
      me a lot and pushed my limits. <br><br><br>I understand that this game is quite
      unusual and it may not fit everyone's style but hopefuly there are some of you
      who will enjoy this journey and find themselves in it.<br><br>Enjoy! <br>- Ondrej
