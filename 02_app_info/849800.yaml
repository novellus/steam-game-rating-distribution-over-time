    review: 'For a story based on the premise "what if the Titanic was actually sunk
      by mermaids?" I expected this VN to be weirder, but it''s oddly low-key. There''s
      some funny moments and a few random puzzles, but if you''re expecting something
      more along the lines of [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/734890/The_Francy_Droo__Friends_Collection/]Francy
      Droo,[/url] you''ll be disappointed.


      Apparently the dev made [i]Mermaid Mission: Titanic[/i] because his kids wanted
      a mermaid game, and it definitely shows; it''s cute, sincere, and kid-friendly.
      I wouldn''t recommend it to a general audience -- the premise and design are
      unusual, and that''s interesting, but the "developer art" and meandering story
      make it a hard sell when the end result isn''t particularly memorable -- but
      if you''re gaming with children, it''s maybe worth checking out.'
