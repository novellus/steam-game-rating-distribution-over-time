    review: "With its laser-tag/Tron aesthetics & gun-play it seemed like an easy\
      \ buy & I wanted to like it. However the project seems a little abandoned. What\
      \ I mean is, there is one level with a single bossfight, you press continue\
      \ & you're warped back to the homescreen. \n\n I've seen other content displayed\
      \ in this game than what I have experienced through reviewers & through mild-investigation\
      \ I found there was a beta build of this game, and perhaps that is where those\
      \ other levels come from, not entirely sure. \n\nThe game in its current state\
      \ & no hope for further development makes this game a hard recommend for $11.99.\
      \ Especially when I beat the game twice & I've only clocked in about a half\
      \ hour.  I should have heeded the red flag of this game being in early access\
      \ since 2017. Steer clear of this game."
