    review: You can buy this game if you don't mind losing, The AI feels quite rigged,
      it's so ridiculous. I don't understand the designers mindset. The resolution
      of the game is bad as well, can't even recognize my own flowers. Bought this
      game in order to practice, but it's only a waste of time. It's so sad.
