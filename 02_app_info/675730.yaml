    review: "This game is a kind of Stanley Parable walking sim with a couple of puzzles\
      \ and about 5 endings.  Its an easy 100% cheevo game that took me about 2 hours\
      \ to get through it all.  It gets the thumbs up because it doesn't deserve a\
      \ thumbs down but to be honest it doesn't really deserve a thumbs up either.\n\
      \n_______________\n\n[h1] PROS [/h1]\n\n+  quick and easy exploration game.\
      \  It doesn't overstay its welcome and I was in the mood for something short\
      \ and simple.\n\n+  some fun little vignettes.  Each 'level' has a little goal\
      \ and some of them were quite funny.  Others were a political statement.   Some\
      \ were almost like self-help LPT's.  It borders on preachy but didn't go far\
      \ enough to make me cringe.\n\n+  multiple endings.\n\n_____________\n\n[h1]\
      \ CONS [/h1]\n\n-  sound.  There are very few sound effects or music tracks\
      \ in the game.  There are no footsteps for walking.  Everything is too minimal\
      \ for me on the sound side.  \n\n-  quite pricey.  I didn't pick this up at\
      \ full price that's for sure.  5 bucks for the playtime and content is a bit\
      \ steep.  Get it on a sale for sure.\n\n____________\n\nShort review for a short\
      \ game.  It is in the same vein as The Beginner's Guide and The Stanley Parable\
      \ but it is nowhere near the level of quality of those titles.  I do think that\
      \ for the right price it will scratch that itch and to be frank I really enjoy\
      \ these kinds of games and can't find enough of them here on Steam."
