    review: "The product is good if you're JUST learning how to type, but if you're\
      \ already decent or good at typing it doesn't help at all. Along with the fact\
      \ that while you play sometimes it just doesn't record that you pressed a button,\
      \ or will say that you pressed the wrong one. This error gets even worse the\
      \ faster you start to type. I did complete everything it has to offer, and exceed\
      \ its expectations... but then after that there is nothing else to do. No more\
      \ challenges, nothing. \n\nIn short, if you want to learn to type and are just\
      \ starting or aren't very fast. This will be good for you to try, especially\
      \ if you're okay with some errors every now and then in the software. \n\nIf\
      \ you actually want a software that will continue to challenge you, and will\
      \ continue to progress, then this is not the software for you. Especially if\
      \ you can already type decently and don't do well with the software errors."
