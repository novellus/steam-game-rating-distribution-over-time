    about_the_game: "Kukui 2 is about a seventeen-year-old boy that has gone through\
      \ brain trauma and split personalities when he was younger. The boy had a stepsister\
      \ that was his age but he accidentally killed her 10 years ago while he was\
      \ portraying another person. The split personality drove Kyle to hurt others\
      \ and himself. Seven years later, the boy's split personality has not gotten\
      \ any better and he has managed to fabricate many other characters. In this\
      \ chapter of his life, we get to learn how Kyle meets a girl that has similar\
      \ traits as his sister did, and tries to protect her from any harm that might\
      \ come her way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCore Features<br />\r\n<br />\r\
