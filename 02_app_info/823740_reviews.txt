Tetris has a better storyline than this. This would have been considered a poor game in the 80's. They had a fun idea (lead a revolution) and then they could not come up with any more ideas than let's make it like pac-man... Whatever you pay for this, it is to much. They should ban the makers of this game for ever realeasing another one.","timestamp_created":1590875267,"timestamp_updated":1590875267,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+8Pjs/ICeL+jiwI="}
