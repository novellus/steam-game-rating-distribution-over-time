The starting screen/tutorial is god awful; the instructions pop up in front of you and flash in and out of visibility, making it hard to read. It was also obviously written by someone who doesn't know English very well. Not that figuring out how to play is hard anyway, considering all the cool wall running and jumping you see in this game's trailer is automated and done for you. Also, after I died once, the game started running at a very poor frame rate and I had to quit. Needless to say, I didn't start it back up again.","timestamp_created":1567971627,"timestamp_updated":1604869761,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523771584033966064","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/qTs1PUCepfz0QE="}
