It throws you in right away with only a manual for help and you're left to your own intuition to figure out how things work or what things mean and how to fix them.  However the manual basically just lists what things are and what functions they have and what error codes mean, and not how to fix or prevent any of said errors.  Might make some people bounce off it if it's not clear what even is going wrong.  Also, and this is just my opinion, it would be great in VR especially since it uses a two hands holding things system, but that'd just be an extra.","timestamp_created":1609788321,"timestamp_updated":1609788321,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4zo235/YCd+e9wAI="}
