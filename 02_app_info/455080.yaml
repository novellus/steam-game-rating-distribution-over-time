    review: "The final game of the main [i]Awakening[/i] series' story that focuses\
      \ on Sophia. Like the other games, it has lovely artwork, soft music, and light\
      \ puzzles. \n\nI found the story to be pretty decent and a good conclusion.\
      \ The bonus chapter, which takes place years afterward, was a bit long and tedious.\
      \ It also had an issue with the final mini game where the rules changed on the\
      \ final wave.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed this game and recommend it for fans of this\
      \ series or fans of hidden object games in general."
