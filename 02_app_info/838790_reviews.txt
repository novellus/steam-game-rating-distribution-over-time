The controls are slow, the enemies are dumb, the re-spawning back to zero  every time is annoying and even if you save a game, you return to zero when you load it.\nPressing 'E@ to interact does nothing at all, the ammo boxes all look the same and the life boxes are few and far between. No controller settings, no map or help or hints.  The worst game I have ever played, and I've been playing games on computers since 1981. It's a shame as they have gone to the trouble of rendering the landscapes but forgotten to put any game-play into the game.","timestamp_created":1597520634,"timestamp_updated":1597520634,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiczp+fMCdr3XmwI="}
