You are not defending anything valuable. You are torturing sinners who are continually marching, one by one in a long streak, trying to evade their punishment.

Falling into a spike trap popping out suddenly from the ground, the good old ballista with its deadly massive arrow, or a modern Tesla coil delivering instant electric shots to anyone close enough?
