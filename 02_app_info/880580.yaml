      /><h2 class="bb_tag">About YORG.io</h2>YORG.io is a fun game about supply chains
      and zombies. Your goal is to survive as long as possible and endure as many
      enemy waves as you can.<h2 class="bb_tag">How to Play YORG.io</h2>The game is
      divided into day and night. During the day you will be safe, so use this time
      wisely to prepare and fortify your base.<br>Start by building your base and
      placing crystal mines which are your main source of income. If your mines are
      not connected to your base, place a transporter. To defend your base and survive
      the night, you will need defensive towers; since those require ammunition, you
      will have to build factories to produce them; these factories require resources,
      you will have to build mines to extract them. Did we mention the importance
      of supply lines?<br>At night, zombies will spawn and attack your buildings.
      Every day the zombies steadily get stronger, and every 10 waves a zombie boss
      will spawn. The game is lost when your Base is destroyed.<h2 class="bb_tag">Highly
      Replayable</h2>Each game starts with a new configuration of available resources.
      This configuration must be carefully considered when placing your base and will
      change your strategy from game to game.<h2 class="bb_tag">Unique towers</h2>Each
      tower has strengths and weaknesses. Place them carefully to make sure you are
      using them to their full potential and always make sure they have plenty of
      ammo.<h2 class="bb_tag">Enemy Abilities</h2>As the day turn into night the waves
      of Zombies become harder. Zombies will evolve various abilities that will challenge
      even the most titanic defenses.<h2 class="bb_tag">Big Boss</h2>The Dread Overlord
      shows up every 10 waves. This boss will require all your might to defeat it.
      Do not underestimate it!  <br><br>There is no limit to the game, so the longer
      you stay alive the higher your name goes in the leaderboard. Now go ahead and
      show your friends who is the ultimate defender!
