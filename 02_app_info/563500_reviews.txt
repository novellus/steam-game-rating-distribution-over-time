But then a woman started to scream and it never stopped, couldn't focus, got annoyed and quit.\n\nSo the light is your friend, the moment you step into darkness, your sanity drops and you die when the meter is gone. Seems legit. Little puzzles to solve in order to progress, cheap jumpscares, not too bad atmosphere, little obstacles... But this game needs a lot, I mean A LOT of polishing. \nMaybe a different engine might do the trick? Makes the game more fluent, control wise responsive... Add more colors, more variants of visual effects, shades, mist, etc... Like the game uses a filter to simulate the mist, but I think you are able to simulate it as animated mist inside the game, instead of a filter that turns with you when you move.\n\nAnyways, if the DEV has not abandoned the game yet and willing to update it, I might give it a try again. The best thing about the game is the sanity thing, that is really cool. For now, I am sadly not recommending it, but if updated and with the improvements, I will rewrite my verdict. Might still be not recommended, but it might just be recommended.\n\n@Dev\nA bad review should not kick you out of the field, it's like feedback to work with. Where you can improve. By improving, you learn more about the programming, helps you out, when you build another game or expand with this game.\n\nSo the things I would like to see improved:\n- Controls\n- More colors, shading, mist, particles (mist to walk into, instead of a filter)\n- Windows (where does that light come from)\n- More setup options\n\nLet's see from there after the update (if there is any)\n","timestamp_created":1584040865,"timestamp_updated":1584040865,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52731090784072876","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zq2M6PACcPTW9wE="}
