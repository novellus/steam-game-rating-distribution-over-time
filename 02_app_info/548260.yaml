    review: "Great retro style game with full (Xbox One USB) controller support. The\
      \ soundtrack inparticular is quite good. The enemies are varied and their death\
      \ animations are violent including being blown to smithereens by grenades you\
      \ launch or their chest being torn open after you blast them with a mech you've\
      \ jumped into. The gameplay is nothing revolutionary and more an homage to old-school/retro\
      \ shooters, but if you're a fan of that era of game then you will probably enjoy\
      \ this as well. I especially like the character and enemy designs as they have\
      \ a realistic portrayal and anatomy that is often missing from these kinds of\
      \ shooters, which instead often opt for more cartoony or chibi-like features.\
      \ \n\nThere are a few technical issues with the game including a game-breaking\
      \ problem I encountered in one area with how the levels progress at times, let's\
      \ say you were supposed to take a corridor on the right, and instead walked\
      \ \"too far ahead\" (or up) to obstruct your view of the corridor your were\
      \ supposed to go right on... now you have no way of going back \"down\" the\
      \ level toward the corridor again, and the game instead locked me ahead as the\
      \ view was no longer available. I have only run into this problem in this one\
      \ area but I could see the player possibly wandering off of the beaten path\
      \ and because of the way the game renders possibly not being able to backtrack\
      \ and go down a proper path.\n\nAlso this is a minor complaint but your character\
      \ when hit by an enemy bullet or attack pauses, blinks, and just stands there\
      \ incapacitated for a few seconds. This is kind of akin to retro effects, in\
      \ that you're disabled for a few seconds and unable to move but it has lead\
      \ to a few annoying deaths for me where the timing of the enemies' bullets to\
      \ my character recovering and being able to move again has lead to some \"cheap\
      \ deaths\" where because I couldn't move out of the way and when the next wave\
      \ of bullets was already coming in lead to one hit equaling three or more /\
      \ death.   \n\nThat aside for the game's very cheap asking price you get a full,\
      \ arcade-y, retro experience with some cool art and a good soundtrack."
