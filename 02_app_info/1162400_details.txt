The game combines the adventure and play of the journey north with visual novel elements.","supported_languages":"English","reviews":"“An amazing remake of The Oregon Trail. Where the original did not mince its words &quot;Your daughter died of dysentery&quot;, this game did not get any less harsh. It feels like in a time when modern games are all about popping bubbles or crushing candy, this game can feel a little jarring, a little bit like a pinch in the face with reality, or at least one possible future reality. But that's the point of this game. It is still a great way to have fun and fiddle away some time!”<br \/>\r\n5\/5 – Android User<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n“I think this is awesome. Kudos to you for making a simple and clean game. This was full of great information and humor; I loved the Rideshare bit. I hope someday that I can make a game as good as this one. Thank you for putting the time into this and letting us give it a try.”<br \/>\r\n5\/5 – Windows User<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n“I played for about 15 minutes and died of starvation on easy. 10\/10 would recommend people play this game.”<br \/>\r\n5\/5 – Windows User<br
