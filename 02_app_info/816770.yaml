    review: This game encompasses 50 puzzles all based on the Four Color Map Theorem
      from mathematics (planar maps to be more specific). It is a good challenge for
      those who enjoy real game applications of fun math concepts, but the poor user
      interfacing makes this a harder sell. You cannot save while in the middle of
      one of the levels (as far as I tried) and the menu to select a level is slow
      to scroll through. I do not have a problem with the simple visuals of the interface,
      but the control over it is lackluster and the game could use some quality of
      life improvements, but the core puzzle solving is worth the asking price, or
      wait for a sale.
