I don't even have epilepsy and I want to get through this game but it's making me feel sick enough that I have to stop playing. \n\nAll of the colors' hues on screen rapidly invert when you die.\n\nThis game is a hazard. I got this game in a bundle so I didn't see the trailer on this game's store page that shows that this flashing happens whenever the player dies. I tried closing my eyes whenever the flashing happens, but the colors are bright enough that it shines through eyelids so it didn't help much. \n\nI would report this game, but I want to finish it first. Game Developer, please patch out the flashing ASAP.","timestamp_created":1606802756,"timestamp_updated":1606802756,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmoq6jvYCd4SftgI="}
