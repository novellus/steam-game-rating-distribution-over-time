It's buggy, confusing and generally not fun. It may only be $1.99 but this isn't something that is in a state where it should be charged for yet. \n\nIt doesn't even feel like a lot of effort was put into it. I can overlook some issues if it seems like the dev/devs cared about the game. This just feels slapped together and tossed out to make a buck.\n\nVR Gameplay 2/10 (swing your arm in front of you and hope it activates your attack)\nVR Graphics 8/10 (It was pretty, kinda reminded me of Kojimas Death Stranded trailer)\nAudio 6/10 (Out of place music and repetitive sound effects that sometimes randomly went off for seemingly no reason)\n\nLocomotion 1/10\nWeird pull the trigger then step to the side to hop platform to platform. It was buggy and kept popping me up in the air. If I was prone to motion sickness I have a feeling this game would have set it off pretty badly.","timestamp_created":1474348768,"timestamp_updated":1474348768,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568245112895965576","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsJuCo9cCeqjTYQ=="}
