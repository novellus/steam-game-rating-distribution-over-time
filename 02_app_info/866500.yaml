      /><br><br>Space Toads Mayhem is an arcade-style, topdown shooter paying homage
      to classics from the 1980s - some say it tastes like arcade-flavoured ice cream
      with laser blast sprinkles :)<br><br>It's a challenging, reflex-based game,
      rewarding a player who enjoys fast-paced action and can utilise enemy behaviour
      to his / her advantage.<h2 class="bb_tag">Select Features</h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Dodge
      'em up style gameplay:</strong> constant, skillful player movement is required
      in order to survive at later stages. Anticipation and skill are key as the player's
      spaceship is often not fast enough to twitch out of trouble at the very last
      moment.<br></li><li><strong>Enemies with a bit of personality:</strong> simple
      emotional states are implemented which affect how enemies behave. For example,
      each of the enemies chooses to attack the player at a different point in time
      since being spawned.<br></li><li><strong>Epic Powerups:</strong> Mega Death
      Sun and Vicious Red Hole are among those making easy work of the incoming hordes.<br></li><li><strong>Chance
      for a good drop mechanic:</strong> as the player progresses through the level
      and the difficulty increases, good powerups are harder to find and nasty traps
      start to appear.<br></li><li><strong>Arcade-style, challenging action:</strong>
      Due to a degree of unpredictability in enemy behaviour and randomised gameplay
      elements, it is not possible to truly learn any levels by heart - therefore
      the player needs to stay focused all the way through every single time.</li></ul>

    review: 'I too saw this game being demo''d at a couple of Play Expo shows and
      eagerly awaited the public release. Does what it says on its tin! Excellent
      1980s arcade shooter style. Yes, I was a teenager back then and frequented videogame
      arcades - never enough money - good times! Now, 30 years later I get to go old
      school for free! Well apart from the price of the game itself! :D If you like
      this genre, then BUY SPACE TOADS: MAYHEM now! Recommended.'
