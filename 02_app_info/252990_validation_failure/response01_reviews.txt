Buying Platinum straight out for $10 only nets you 170p; but 250p, 50k Creds, some mods, and boosters all for the same price? WAY worth it. $20 is a BIT of a stretch, but you're supporting the devs of this amazing game as well. So either way, I definitely recommend it. I've logged over 100 hours into the game already, I had no problem dropping $10 or $20 on a DLC pack.","timestamp_created":1420850256,"timestamp_updated":1420850256,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwiMvR6MoCc6uLNQ=="}
