      \ pedidos que precisam ser feitos para que ent\xE3o possam receber as cartas.\
      \ O jogo possui um visual muito lindo e torna-se ainda mais imersivo com a m\xFA\
      sica. Os pequenos pedidos s\xE3o puzzles que deixam a aventura da criatura ocular(voc\xEA\
      ) ainda mais proveitosa."
