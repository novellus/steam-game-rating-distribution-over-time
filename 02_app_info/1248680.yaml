    review: 'It''s good if its 2 dollars

      easily the 2 most annoying things about this game are the fact that boards can
      (and will) start you off with a 1 closed off entirely. In a game trying to support
      and encourage speed this is almost nonsensical. the second thing is that the
      leader boards just arent accurate. they will always say you''re 6th or 8th or
      whatever number you get no matter where you move until you are actually in the
      top 10 when it cant possibly mess it up.


      Also turning animations off either didnt turn them off entirely or doesn''t
      work at all. really hard to focus and move at speed when theres a flash going
      across the whole screen so i cant even see what the board looks like. Audio
      also just doesnt work for me and im not sure why? probably something on my end
      but still frustrating.


      But overall its a good game that really just needs to fix those few problems
      to become great. If what i said turns you off from this game in any way and
      it isnt on sale i wouldnt recommend. but if you just want a good looking minesweeper
      experience its absolutely worth it.'
