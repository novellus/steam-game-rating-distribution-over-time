The gameplay was unappealing; the story was interesting but left too much unspoken about the past, future, and overall state of the world.\n\nTechnical details - presentation: nothing special going on. It's a VN. Runs at a normal fullscreen, which I'm appreciating after trying to play a bunch of old adventure games with exclusive fullscreen at 360p. The art style is the teensiest bit interesting, but nothing too eye-catching.\n\nOne thing I found incredibly annoying was the time delay after pressing buttons. It usually takes a full second or more for a new screen to appear after you've clicked a button, exacerbated by things like the quicksave button bringing up a dialogue box that says \"saved\"  with an additional button to click. Not a deal breaker but still very annoying.\n\nGameplay: If you're on the store page you've see it already, but this VN has match-3 gameplay: you have a grid with a bunch of symbols and if you match at least three in a row, they go away and you get points. The context here is that the main character is using this to  dominate the other person's mind to get them to reveal information they wouldn't normally. This is a Japanese otaku game, however, which means that there's a sprite of their character next to the game, and when you score points the character moans like they're getting penetrated, and as you pass certain thresholds they say something and then some of their clothing is removed, culminating with an orgasmic squeal when you get enough points. This is in effect a \"mind break\" scenario. This happens with mostly women, but there is one guy.\n\nIt's really just awkward, not erotic, because you're focusing on the puzzle, trying to get these matches as fast as possible, while the character is squealing and squirming. It's just a distraction.\n\nAnyway, there's that. If you fail you get kicked back to the main menu. And some of the later ones are somewhat difficult.\n\nThere's also a fake Twitter where characters say things related to the plot. Minor spoiler: there is ONE point in the game where you must read through this (properly tagging the posts as \"read\") to get the correct ending for the chapter.\n\nRelated to the above, there are moments where you can choose where your character goes (cafeteria, music room, rooftop, etc.). Most of the time this doesn't really matter, but there's at least once instance where you have to do things in a specific order.\n\nApart from this there are also dialogue choices, initially just one for most moments, but later on it expands to two.\n\nStory:\nAs the store page: you're a new student at a school with 7 mysteries. You join the occult research club and begin exploring these mysteries.\n\nAnd that's about as much as can be said without spoilers. There's a lot, [i]lot[/i] more going on here. The lines on the store page \"beneath the surface lie dark and sinister secrets\" and \"repeated playthroughs will yield new facts\" can be taken as hints, but there's still a lot of other stuff going on here that you won't experience until 5 or 10 hours into the experience. The majority of the game is focused on things not indicated on the store page.\n\nAs a result, it's hard to review without serious spoilers, but there are a few broad statements which can be made.\n\nThis game feels like as though it's the second in a trilogy. There's a wealth of lore here that just goes completely unexplained, along with references to past events and foreboding comments about the future. In a general sense this is mostly good, but be prepared for (a lot of) stuff that doesn't resolve.\n\nThis story is darker than it appears. Not quite edgy dark fantasy dark, but I was surprised a few times at where they took things.\n\nCertain events will likely prompt you to use a walkthrough. Hold off as long as you can, but if you play through the whole thing and can't figure out how to proceed, use a walkthrough. I got most of the way through, but at the very end there were a couple things I just missed.\n\nThings like author intent and allegories are always dicey to work around, but one of the big reveals near the end of the game is really, really sketchy if viewed within the context of an allegory. It's implying something that I've heard from Christian fundamentalists, so it's a little weird.\n\n\nAll in all it's very, very difficult to appropriately discuss this game without getting into spoilers that would affect the experience. If you like anime stuff, slice of life, and (very, very) slight fantasy and noir elements, give this a shot.","timestamp_created":1596924266,"timestamp_updated":1596924440,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3KWH6PMCc4OjmgI="}
