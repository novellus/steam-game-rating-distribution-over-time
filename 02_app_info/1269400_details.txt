Imagine something like Twitch Plays Pokemon but everyone can control a character and it's absolute chaos.  And if you need to step away, AFK Mode will give your channel something to stay engaged with during the downtime.<br><br>Current games included in the pack are:<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Happy Tanksgiving<\/h2><br>In this free-for all game, everyone controls a tank on a battlefield and it's everyone versus 100. You'll be commanding a large tank with heavy armor that can be controlled in real-time. And each of your viewers can command their own hovertank by using tile-based controls. They can kill you, or kill each other, but either way that last tank standing is the victor. A quick demo of a streamer playing it can be found below!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Minesweeper 100<\/h2><br>Why are we always minesweeping from the comfort of our computer? Why aren't we <strong>actually there on the minefield<\/strong> with 100 of our friends, living or dying together, as a team? With Minefield of Dreams, everyone is a minesweeper on an active minefield, frantically trying to work together to clear it without tripping mines. But beware! A single mistake will cost you your life, and the lives of those next to you. Oh, and this area is really prone to earthquakes, so watch out for random mines exploding. Get moving and clear that field fast!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Bombertown<\/h2><br>The ultimate in 100-Player bomb-planting action! Control your bomber and be the last one standing, all the while collecting powerups and tightening the noose (made of bombs) around your enemies.","about_the_game":"Welcome to the 100-Player Twitch Chat Party Pack, a set of games that let you play in real-time with or against your viewers, while they control their characters with Twitch Chat commands.
