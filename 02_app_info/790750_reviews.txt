I am changing my review from negative to positive. Hopefully now that that it's free, more players will play it. \n\nYou can view my updated review & gameplay here: https://youtu.be/J5fr2tyscaU\n\n*** Original Review BELOW ***\n\n[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers [/h1]\n\nThis game currently has 26 reviews (I'm 27th) and only 1 of those is a negative review. However, of the 26 current reviews, only 7 of them are from Steam purchase reviewers. There's nothing wrong with that, but it can leave a very wrong impression of this game. In reality, this game has 7 reviewers from Steam purchasers and 1 of those is negative. And now it will have 8 reviews from Steam purchases and 2 of those will be negative.\n\nIs this a bad game? No! In fact, I hope that more people buy this game so that there is a nice-sized playerbase. The game is actually pretty fun. But the game has two very big negatives that I just can't ignore, which makes it a game that I can't recommend to others. So while I'm giving a negative review, I would be happy to change my review if at least one of those negatives can be changed. For now, it is a slightly negative / neutral recommendation.\n\nBut first, let me talk about the good as briefly as I can. This game has several customization options. From movement options, to comfort options, to game visuals. You can do private or public matches. You can play with or without bots. You can play capture the flag or bomb mode. You change sides and best 2 out of 3 wins the match. This game has 3 classes. An assault class, a tank class, and a scout class. You can pick any class and you will still have fun with this game because they all have the same core ability (shooting a bow fast), but different special abilities (tank and scout share fast movement ability). I really liked the bomb mode. The game currently only has 3 maps. There's verticality to each map. None of the maps are especially large, but that's good given the range of the weapons and the locomotion speed.\n\nSo I think the game needs more maps and needs a TDM or FFA, but the game is currently in EA so that's not really my main gripe. Plus since they lowered the price to $9.99, it's priced correctly. However, the two big flaws that I can't ignore are these: \n\n1) No playerbase - does anybody play this game? Obviously, this is not the dev's fault. The VR playerbase is small and most PvP games /MP games fail, especially in VR. This game has bots so at least it has value regardless. But still, this game is probably only fun if you have friends with VR. Players will probably not come at this point in this game's cycle, no matter how much we wish it.\n\n2) Bow mechanic. This is probably the fatal flaw that I just can't look past. It just doesn't feel great shooting this thing. It feels too much like arcade, it needs to feel more realistic. There's so many VR bow & arrow games and this game's bow & arrow just don't feel great, it feels average. Seems like you can't really aim. This developer should take a cue from how the bow & arrow feels like in the best bow & arrow VR titles such as: In Death, Holopoint, The Lab, QuiVR, or Marksman VR. This game should just copy the bow from Holopoint, it would fit this game style perfectly!\n\nMy other mini-gripe is the bow-hand shield. Since you can move freely, the arm shield makes little sense. If you teleported only, the shield would make great sense. However, I can't think of many situations where I wouldn't just move to avoid an arrow versus using my shield. You can keep your bow & arrow ready to shoot and move out of the way > using shield.\n\nRate 4.5/10. If you build it, they will come? I'm not asking for a refund & I hope I can change my review to positive in the near future.","timestamp_created":1526442220,"timestamp_updated":1555227347,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546385705471038818","comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g8GxjeoCfL25oAE="}
