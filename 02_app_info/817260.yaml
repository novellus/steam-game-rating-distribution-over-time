    review: "An extremely moody and tasteful orchestral-style score (with lashings\
      \ of piano and some deliciously synth-y strings). An absolute steal at the price\
      \ they're asking for seventeen tracks.\n\n   Red Limb Studio continues to impress\
      \ me with both the quality of their games and the intelligence of their business\
      \ practices. Indie done right, methinks.\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed\
      \ this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\n\
