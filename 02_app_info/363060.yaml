    short_description: The Farm captures all the fun, energy and excitement of a real
      working farm. Kids can visit the big red barn and watch a cow being milked.
      Take a peek inside the chicken coop and find out where eggs come from. Help
      harvest the corn and feed the pigs. Don't miss the pond- there's a beaver dam
      to explore. And that's only the beginning.
