    review: "[h1] This was a very frustrating and agitating experience. Sometimes\
      \ your characters do what you want them to do and sometimes there is no control\
      \ over them. You just watch them die. Game over, try again.\n\nGamestyle reminds\
      \ me of FTL but this game surely fooled me. Like at least in FTL you KNOW why\
      \ things are not working or why your characters are unable to follow your instructions.\
      \ [/h1]\n\nHealing for example, one of the characters is about to die, I send\
      \ him to the first aid box (I drag him to it, why is that? Why not just click\
      \ the guy and then click on whatever he needs to interact with?), he only heals\
      \ himself a small portion and then starts walking around, so I need to put him\
      \ back to his station but he got injured again, so I wanted to drag him back\
      \ to the first aid box but he didn't wanted to be dragged. So I just watched\
      \ him die. Fun fun fun...\n\nSo the first encounter was an enemy train, I put\
      \ the characters at their stations; shield, power and gun control. Put the three\
      \ weapons on specific target, enable auto-fire (like in FTL) and just watch.\
      \ All three weapons started to shoot, no idea what type of weapon it is, but\
      \ hey, if the game doesn't want to tell, then we don't need to know right? -_-\
      \ \nWe beaten the armored train, went to a trainstation, there you can get some\
      \ jobs and assignments, buy in resources for along the way and move on.\nThe\
      \ map is nice to show you where you want to go, where obstacles could be and\
      \ such. I upgraded some modules on the ship, like shield and power, because\
      \ I saw that going down too rapidly in the first battle.\nSecond encounter,\
      \ wanted to do the same deal, putting the characters on their stations and locking\
      \ the weapons on their targets. Now suddenly I had only one weapon (which didn't\
      \ fired, at all), one guy was about the die but didn't wanted to go to the first\
      \ aid box and the other one was standing between two fires frying his fingers\
      \ as sausages (at least it looked that way), I had no control over anybody,\
      \ except the one who was controlling the shield but he died, because he also\
      \ didn't wanted to go to the first aid box. No control over anything! \n\nThird\
      \ encounter, I was getting good hopes, the characters did what I told them to\
      \ do for now. We did some errands, upgraded our train, untill one of the A-holes\
      \ didn't wanted to do what I told him to do and so followed the rest. One of\
      \ the guys identified himself as a sausage and was just standing still in the\
      \ fire! Plus, found a bug with the repair button, you can keep smashing it and\
      \ that makes your train invulnerable. But utterly useless, when your crew isn't\
      \ responding to your calls.\n\nAfter three times, three restarts of the game,\
      \ I had enough of this BS.\n\nThe game has good intentions and if executed in\
      \ a well manner, this game would be a good game. The setting is good, also reminds\
      \ me of the game \"The Last Train\" - just because of the setting.. But the\
      \ controls... Aaarrrghh!!! Drives me nuts! This game need a lot of work!\n\n\
      [h1] Therefor, I do NOT recommend this game. [/h1]"
