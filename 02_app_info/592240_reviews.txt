[/h1] \n\nFun little game with acceptable price (current full price is 2,40â‚¬). Several stages with number of waves of enemies in them, and your mission is to kill them all. Different enemies, different weapons, shield to protect yourself, and main boss at the end of the game :) Music is nice, powerful enough to keep your adrenaline level high. Visuals are pretty enough regarding space, but mixed with \"retro\" style of enemies. But again, for that price, not much to complain about. There isn't any story (just basic premise about you getting shot and being stranded on a planet, shooting aliens). There's still some kind of replayability there, you know, just to relax after work, as shooting aliens is sometimes thing you have to do :)\nBig plus for achievements also.\n\n[i] PS: you should always support small local developer!
