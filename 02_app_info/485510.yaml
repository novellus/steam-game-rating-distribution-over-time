    review: "+ Fun combat system, with fancy combos that you can do and a wide variety\
      \ of weapons and builds you can try. \n\n- Dogshit bosses that oneshot you with\
      \ attacks you can barely react to\n- Every mob in the game twoshots you\n- The\
      \ skill trees are unnecessarily complex and tedious\n- Shallow enemy pool, LOTS\
      \ of repeats compared to Dark Souls. \n- Absolute garbage level design where\
      \ everything looks the same.\n- Grindy as shit if you want purple gear.\n- Disgustingly\
      \ tedious runbacks to boss fights. \n\nThis game is not well made, i'd recommend\
      \ you not to play it. There's better games out there. This game does not respect\
      \ your time or your money. This comes from a person that enjoys Dark Souls 3\
      \ and Sekiro. Go play those instead."
