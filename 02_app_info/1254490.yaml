    review: "Bought the game as the idea of the initial game seemed brilliant after\
      \ opening the game and it taking forever to do so i didnt have much faith. Tried\
      \ to change the game quality twice (it crashed each time) So thought I would\
      \ just play it on whatever settings i was given. So..... I started the game....\
      \ and thats as far as i got before i closed the game and proceeded to ask for\
      \ a refund. it took so long to start up even to the first cut scene and then\
      \ was so jumpy and laggy i just couldnt play it. \nIm disappointed because i\
      \ thought this game would be loads of fun, turns out its not very well optimised\
      \ at all."
