    review: 'Simply put, if you like strategy games, this game is awesome! A perfect
      example of the elegance of simplicity.



      You have a mere 5 things you can do, with a suprising amount of strategic depth
      in how you utilize those 5 things: Energy, which is your life''s blood in more
      ways than one; not only is it your economy, but lose all of these and you lose
      the game. Turrets, which are your basic form of attack, good to spam lots of
      them. Black holes, which are your sole means of defense, as they deflect incoming
      shots, but enough focus fire can overcome them. Sentinels, which ''claim'' territory
      on the map, which is good because the enemy cannot build things in your territory.
      Also work in a pinch to draw enemy fire, and will instantly destroy any enemy
      units caught in their influence. And lastly Missiles, which are costly, slow
      to charge, but if they go off, can wipe out enemy forces in a wide area.


      The key is positioning; your forces and theirs will fire upon the closest target
      to them. So depending on where you build things, you can protect other things,
      and the same with them. You can fly anywhere on the map, which is a giant ball
      of strands, and each vies for optimal positioning to take out the other, by
      whatever means they deem necessary.


      Truly, this is a unique and innovative title; the only con I have is sometimes
      it can be akward to precisly position yourself exactly where you want to be,
      as when you stop flying you will automatically gravitate towards the nearest
      strand. Also, there doesn''t seem to be a way to destroy a unit once youve already
      built it, which can sometimes be problematic with black holes, as they can affect
      YOUR turrets shots as well; depending on what they are firing at they might
      choose to fire through the black hole, which of course doesn''t work very well....


      Also the multiplayer is dead, so it is a good thing to have some friends to
      play with, unless you just want to skirmish with the AI.


      All in all I would highly recommend this title!'
