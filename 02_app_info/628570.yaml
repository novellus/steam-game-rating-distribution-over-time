    review: Bought this when it was on sale for $1.49. It was great game for that
      price, theres not much offered in it, I believe we only played 2 games of the
      local multiplayer and it was already repeating questions. It does have a couple
      othere gamemodes like, "Which country does this flag belong to?", I personally
      believe those should be added into the regular trivia game and not be their
      own seperate gamemode. Another little thing that should be added would be sounds
      for answering the question right and wrong, as well as sounds for if time is
      running out, you didn't answer, etc. Needs alot of work. Overall the content
      is just not there yet, I'm glad I only spent what I did on this.
