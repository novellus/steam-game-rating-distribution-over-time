Early on, it can be hard to understand, but everything start making sense as you read through and, by the end, it makes for a nice story in a complex world.\nArt and music is great, though the main menu UI looks \"odd\" compared to the rest of the VN's UI.\n\nWould love to see the story continue.","timestamp_created":1605842824,"timestamp_updated":1605842824,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtJ3s8fUCe5e0rwI="}
