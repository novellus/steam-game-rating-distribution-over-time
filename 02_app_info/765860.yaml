    review: "Larry Laffer is suffering...Not just from hair loss, but also AMNESIA!!\n\
      Leisure Suit Larry's next outing (the fourth, actually -- but Al Lowe doesn't\
      \ believe in 4-play) finds our hero starting his day at work for the local Porn\
      \ Prod Corp.  His workplace is secretly a front for the Mob and Larry finds\
      \ himself on a talent scouting assignment and tries to get lucky on the side.\
      \  \nMeanwhile, his estranged and forgotten lover Passionate Patti is recruited\
      \ by the government to infiltrate the Mafioso crime ring and bring them down\
      \ any way she can.\nWill our star-crossed lovers reunite?  Will Larry regain\
      \ his memory and his true love??\n\n--\n\nA ScummVm port like the rest, the\
      \ game's golden and easily accessible. Text-Only VGA graphics for this title\
      \ carry on the animated tradition/style set up in the 'Land of the Lounge Lizards'\
      \ VGA version, and are still cheeky and fun."
