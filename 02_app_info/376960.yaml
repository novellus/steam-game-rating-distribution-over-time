    about_the_game: "Take control of the iconic DB BR 112.1 in this Pro Range addition\
      \ for Train Simulator.<br><br>In the wake of the 1973 Oil Crisis, Deutsche Reichsbahn\
      \ were looking to reinstate their electrification of East Germany. Many of DR\u2019\
      s locomotives were ex-Russian models, that when combined with the cheap fuel\
      \ offered by them also, made for a hefty fleet of reliable diesels. DR were\
      \ looking to replace these Russian diesels with modern, electrically-equipped\
      \ motive power. The trusted LEW Hennigsdorf developed upon the successful DR\
      \ BR 250 design to make a new electric locomotive a reality. This new model\
      \ would be more passenger-focused whereas the DR 250 was primarily for freight\
      \ haulage.<br><br>By 1982, the first prototype, numbered 212 001, made its public\
      \ debut in Leipzig. After a public display, extensive testing was performed\
      \ and it was initially decided to mass-produce a locomotive which featured a\
      \ lower than designed top speed, simply because of the limiting infrastructure\
      \ of the time. This re-geared locomotive would go on to become the DB BR 143.<br><br>The\
      \ reunification of Germany sparked an era of modernisation for the country\u2019\
      s railways. Many routes were being configured for 120+ km/h running, and due\
      \ to the 143\u2019s restrictive 120 km/h cap, DR and BR were now in need of\
      \ a new batch of locomotives. They turned to LEW Hennigsdorf\u2019s successor,\
      \ AEG, to re-introduce the original, 160 km/h capable, 212 001 prototype as\
      \ a production locomotive. Introduced as the BR 212, this new locomotive was\
      \ the first to be jointly operated by both Deutsche Reichsbahn and Deutsche\
      \ Bundesbahn, and as a result quickly became a motive symbol of German reunification.<br><br>Being\
      \ a \u2018Universal\u2019 locomotive, construction methods and specific details\
      \ were on par with previous designs. The main difference to the previous DB\
      \ BR 155 was the removal of two axles, leaving behind a more passenger-suited\
      \ Bo-Bo configuration. Despite their rather box-like design, these locomotives\u2019\
      \ journeys were kept smooth due to reliable suspension in the chassis.<br><br>After\
      \ the success of the DB BR 112, both DB and DR went onto order 45 improved variations,\
      \ the DB BR 112.1; these two locos were very similar in external design, perhaps\
      \ the only obvious difference being the revised headlight cluster on the newer\
      \ model. The other major difference was inclusion of LZB from the outset. The\
      \ DB BR 112.1\u2019s were built by LEW Hennigsdorfs\u2019 successor, AEG and\
      \ after a few teething problems were set to operate InterRegio services.<br><br>In\
      \ recent years, the DB BR 112 fleet has been split in two. The 112.1\u2019s\
      \ frequently take power at the helm of DB Regio services, while the original\
      \ 112.0\u2019s were reclassified as the DB BR 114.0, purely owing to their dedication\
      \ to Berlin-based operations. With all the reclassification, including within\
      \ the original DB BR 143 fleet, it is considered that there are too many numbers\
      \ for so few differences.<br><br>There is no denying, the Universal locomotives\
      \ of LEW Hennigsdorf helped shape the railway services that are still seen to\
      \ this day. Reliable locomotives such as the DB BR 112.1 have served at the\
      \ helm for many years, and is now available for Train Simulator, courtesy of\

    review: "A very nice high detailed loc made by virtualRailroads. If you want to\
      \ add realism these locs from this company are very good. \nYou have the option\
      \ to choose between cold and dark startup or automatic. There are also faults\
      \ included when you ignore procedures. \n\nNote: You have to be carefull when\
      \ you buy a loc from the pro series on Steam. Some locs are downgraded from\
      \ the original. Check details to be sure.\n"
