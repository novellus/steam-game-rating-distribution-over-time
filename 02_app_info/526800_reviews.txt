Its a hardcore puzzle game based on the ever-popular artstyle of old video game consoles, and when I say hardcore, don't take that word lightly. These puzzles range from fast-paced clickathons to more thought-provoking levels. The campaign is 100 levels long and is accompanied by a short-but-sweet 80s style soundtrack, and obscure to not-so-obscure pop culture references. From approximately level 70 onwards, Cubotrox will become your worst enemy, testing your limits and pushing your patience to periods previously unfathomable by man. If you're a skilled gamer that maybe fiddled around with FPSes, and used the WASD keys a lot and the mouse, get this game.","timestamp_created":1479290553,"timestamp_updated":1608239240,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.416178226470947266","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtOqhufYCfOHJZQ=="}
