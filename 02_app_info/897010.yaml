    review: Another decent HoG in the Surface series. I must say I preferred the first
      (Pantheon); this has a slightly more generic, forgettable story line and characters.
      It's also pretty forgettable. I only played it through yesterday, and already
      I can't separate it out from most of the other HoGs I've played. I do remember
      it was time spent in an enjoyable way, though, and that once again the variety
      of the minigames/HoPs was unusually diverse.
