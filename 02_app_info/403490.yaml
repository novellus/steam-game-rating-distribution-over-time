    review: "I really love this game!  There is a lot to do, sometimes it feels like\
      \ too much. As well as the general main quest progression with associated side\
      \ quests you have challenge areas and player dungeons, most of which dynamically\
      \ match the player\u2019s level. Combat and quests are relatively simple. Combat\
      \ is turn based and quests usually follow along the lines of kill x monsters\
      \ or get y drops from monsters. There is a good crafting system in place and\
      \ various standard to decent loot drops from mobs. You are able to spend skill\
      \ points to not only learn new active powers but also new base skills \u2013\
      \ these new skills are available to anyone no matter what class you pick to\
      \ start out. \nThe thing that most people seem to not like about this game is\
      \ the in app purchases/micro transactions. Thing is they are not really necessary\
      \ to make. Yes some of them can be of use, especially in the early game, but\
      \ most of the really good stuff I have has come through game play not purchases.\
      \ \nThis game is well supported by a very dedicated Dev how always seems to\
      \ be around, unlike many bigger, more expensive titles. Yes there are issues\
      \ such as limited customisation regarding you look etc, but for a game that\
      \ costs less than \xA32 I don\u2019t see that as an issue!\n"
