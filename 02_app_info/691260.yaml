    review: I would give this game a 3.5 out of 5 stars because the concept is good
      and the game is good but I don't like some of the mechanics of the game such
      as a cross hair in the middle of your screen and how it has no support for the
      index controller. I have to grip hard in order to pick up and hold a weapon
      and it hurts my hand after a while. I also don't really like the reloading mechanics
      they seem a little easy but other then that this is a good thought out game
      and I would recommend.
