    review: 'A clever game concept left to wither and die by its developer. "Step
      1: What Ancients Begat" was meant to be the first in a game series about dynasties
      throughout history, but the developer disappeared after launch.


      The gameplay is initially entertaining, as you learn how to invest your time
      and resources into your family, work, and social standing. Over time, the RNG
      and repetitiveness inflicts countless arbitrary losses and weakens any sense
      of reward. It could have used significantly more balance testing. Getting far
      in this game requires a equal levels of masochism and patience.'
