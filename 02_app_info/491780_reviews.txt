If your looking for models to use in a project this is a good start! I only wish it had a few things like people trees and animals but those are much more complicated to make and I wouldnt doubt more 3D models will be released.\n\nI wonder if game guru models are allowed to be used in AGK2? hmmmm either way I recomend this product.","timestamp_created":1473802739,"timestamp_updated":1473802739,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.737891077995300293","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ406PfktcCd7mjYQ=="}
