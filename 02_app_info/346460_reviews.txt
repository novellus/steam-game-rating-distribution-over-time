I'd have bought two if it worked better on the 3770k and rx580, but the two lowest graphics settings look ugly as shit (some diamond-esque mesh all over the place) and it isn't smooth enough. I could make Elite Dangerous run smoother than this actually.\n\nI expected it to run a lot better than it does. Open a beta branch where I can choose my own graphics settings and not a stupid slider that shits all over the place.\n \nIt works fine on the ryzen rig, but not my type of racer, I either buy those twice or not at all. Feel free to contact me if there is any optimization update.","timestamp_created":1605837374,"timestamp_updated":1605837507,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m/nX8fUCdP+yrwI="}
