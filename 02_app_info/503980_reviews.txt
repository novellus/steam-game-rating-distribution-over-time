It's nothing spectacular but is written well and has good music. There are supposedly four different plots but they are largely the same, albeit with different culprits. It's entertaining but not very challenging. It's a good game to play if you just want to zone out and relax.","timestamp_created":1599184279,"timestamp_updated":1599184279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43fKzq/QCe7PRnwI="}
