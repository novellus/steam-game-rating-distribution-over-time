      notes: "This game may not be appropriate for all ages. The main character sometimes\
        \ uses sharp objects to self-harm, takes drugs to enter illusionary realms,\
        \ and depending on the player\u2019s actions there may be a non-graphic depiction\
        \ of suicide. There is violence and blood in cut-scenes and gameplay, including\
        \ the use of sharp objects. There is strong language in dialogue and written\
        \ text.\r\n"

    review: "[code]Curator page here-->[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/37670120/]\
      \ DaRevieweD 56 [/url]<-- [i]New review every Sunday[/i][/code]\n\n[b]Genius\
      \ Slackers[/b] debut is loosely based off a real-life tragedy where a neighbor\
      \ of game director Arash, took his own life. The incident left family and friends\
      \ lost for words as everything seemed fine with the victim. And to think I only\
      \ got knee deep in research because [i]curator connect[/i] offered it to me-\
      \ otherwise I wouldn't even realize I already possessed it from a previous sale\
      \ XD. Granted, themes dealing with mental health are more widespread in video\
      \ games. Though they tend to revolve around fictional premises (up for debate)\
      \ such as in [b]Town of Light, The Missing or Detention[/b].\n\nUsually handled\
      \ with respect and educate us on lesser known intricacies of mental disorders\
      \ but others exploit or phone it in by slapping them with \"psychological horror.\"\
      \ [b]What Happened (WH)[/b] is smack dab in the middle of that spectrum. It\
      \ began with great intentions except it didn't stick the landing after all the\
      \ huffin' and puffin', believe me it's a lot~\n\n[h1]\"Enjoy It- While It Lasts...\"\
      [/h1]\n\n[u]The Gist:[/u]\nStiles is your everyday angst-filled and depressed\
      \ teen trying to survive going through the motions in high school. For the past\
      \ year however, things have been escalating and on one fateful day- he spirals.\
      \ A dear old companion, cheerleader and devil's advocate emerges and together\
      \ they go on a trip of deja vu.\n\n[spoiler] ! Be mindful of your actions! [/spoiler]\n\
      \n[h1][+] PROS;[/h1]\n\n[b](a) Your Mind on Drugs![/b]\nNot much in way of gameplay\
      \ and so it's fair to call it a [/i]drug simulation[/i]. Your alter ego being\
      \ your guide on what to do, judging you and taunting you- the bumbling introvert.\
      \ There are venting journal entries to be found too, shedding light on his struggles.\
      \ Pretty soon, he descends into incoherence and tasked with locating light bulbs\
      \ while getting lost in the maze that is the drug-addled mind.\n\nThere aren't\
      \ a lot of ways to die but when you do, you enter multiple versions of \"Limbo\"\
      \ and you have to seek the way out. Ultimately, the endings are the incentives\
      \ to continue playing and they can actually be achieved in one go, provided\
      \ you inspect carefully! Fortunately for me, I managed to uncover the alternate\
      \ \"bad endings\" and then I simply 'continued' from the main menu.\n\n[b](b)\
      \ Take It All In[/b]\nNow, the sheer amount of time, hard work that went in\
      \ to the design of the school is obvious. Be it the variety of posters plastered\
      \ throughout or props that cater to different classrooms! All wonderfully detailed\
      \ and I must've spent the first hour admiring them. It's a living, breathing\
      \ school so kudos!! The creative input is just nothing short of endless, creating\
      \ almost unique set pieces to throw at you that you can't help but stop and\
      \ stare. Since Stiles' school acts as his anchor, it only makes sense to revisit\
      \ it a lot and it's spruced up each time to convey a different state of mind.\
      \ \n\nAnother gorgeous illustration of its visuals go into the [b]Layers of\
      \ Fear[/b] manipulation of \"reality\" where once you reach a dead end, you\
      \ turn around and something's changed! This is done a lot and I couldn't keep\
      \ up. It's sure to leave you satisfied!! The mirrored effects of drugs kicking\
      \ in start off slow and psychedelic-like but amp up in intensity. So just take\
      \ a break every now and then~\n\n[b](c) Don't Feel- Just. Do. It.[/b]\nIn keeping\
      \ with the theme of the game, I'll let you find out WH for yourself! Instead,\
      \ I'll go into what I liked a.k.a. what I found scary~ Firstly, the idea of\
      \ a darker version of yourself is very much a nightmare. It knows everything\
      \ about you, it ridicules, second guesses and clouds your thoughts. Technically\
      \ it's still you in control but we all have our fair share of the bad, don't\
      \ we?\n\nSecondly, I have to point out a character that I just loved; whose\
      \ performance was natural and sweet. It's Rose! I absolutely fell head over\
      \ heels because of what she and the flower represents. You'll see single roses\
      \ throughout the ugly tripping and it's somehow reassuring. The phrase 'every\
      \ rose has its thorn' couldn't be more true because like[spoiler]Stiles, or\
      \ rather you[/spoiler] just don't appreciate what you do have. \n\nThirdly,\
      \ I liked how it was on the nose about the people's tendency to overreact and\
      \ replay that same moment of regret. It's tough to see someone going through\
      \ it but what about those who keep it hidden? Makes you wonder... Finally the\
      \ title, \"WH\" depending on the intonation or punctuation can imply many nuances.\
      \ Is it out curiosity, a blaming tone or just explanatory?\n\n\n[h1][-] CONS;[/h1]\n\
      \n[b](i) A Bad Trip[/b] \nDisorienting is an understatement for that initial\
      \ gimmick of colors grows into unbearable and nausea-inducing the further you\
      \ go. It's like they wanted to see how many filters and novel ways to rotate\
      \ the camera could be fit in until people hurl. Then the angle suddenly zooms\
      \ and jerks all shaky cam to direct your attention. Oh and head bob can't be\
      \ toggled off so rest up every hour.\n\n[b](ii) Out of Stile[/b]\nStiles is\
      \ the protagonist but he's...bland and reserved. I liked the \"Mind\" / alter\
      \ ego but he's just dying to be edgy and dark, comes off as a try hard. Other\
      \ characters were standard teenage drama fodder, who we don't learn enough of\
      \ to actually see them favorably... Also, the depiction of self-harm got so\
      \ gratuitous. I'd rather not be shown any and just told (on second thought,\
      \ talked my ears off too). Moderation, that was missing!!\n\n[b](iii) [i]'High[/i]'\
      \ School!? Dude...[/b]\nAlter Stiles is like a preacher- that is if they were\
      \ the ones telling you to give in to [spoiler]the dark urges[/spoiler]. What\
      \ we are treated to, is preachy, beating that dead horse over. Kid you not,\
      \ by the end- I questioned what was the point of everything?! The game was better\
      \ off cutting its price and runtime by half, which I think would have conveyed\
      \ its message just as fine.\n\n[b](iv) Good Luck Unseeing That[/b]\nSome nitpicks\
      \ are the notes which are somehow randomly generated? Because every time I locate\
      \ one, I make a habit to leave that drawer open. But next time I came back,\
      \ it was moved to a different drawer!? Plus, an achievement bug, where it said\
      \ I \"collected all notes\" but then being the rebel I am- I found more!\n\n\
      The amount of phasing objects were off-putting. A note standing on its own protruding\
      \ out the cabinet or grass and other foliage coming through drawers. The game\
      \ may question reality but that's just sloppy. Even some objects are placed\
      \ too close to another and when you open the drawer, it goes into the other\
      \ object. Little things like these can be damning!\n\n\n[h1]\"More Like, What\
      \ COULD'VE Happened....\"[/h1]\n\nPrognosis? WH came from a wholesome, noble\
      \ place by not victimizing those who have considered suicide. Bringing that\
      \ vision to life proves arduous- ending up mundane, overstretched for the most\
      \ part though it has its moments of clarity. I am an immense advocate for mental\
      \ health so I can appreciate the sentiment and was really hoping it'd be something\
      \ special (which it is, just not all the way). What it did exceptionally is\
      \ in its breathtaking visuals of a life-like school setting and unpredictability\
      \ of Stiles' being under the influence. \n\nHowever, such a momentous stride\
      \ to mental health awareness calls for impeccable execution and a certain degree\
      \ of sensitivity that was just not present. And with a dull and one-dimensional\
      \ cast, it's challenging to like let alone care for them... The same goes for\
      \ the at first alluring transitions that became obnoxious and induced in me\
      \ enough motion sickness for my lifetime. Though I \"don't recommend it\", I'd\
      \ advise picking it up when its price is slashed as it's still fairly enjoyable\
      \ and an innovative piece of entertainment- I guess that's why it hurt even\
      \ more~\n\n[h1]5.8/10[/h1]\n\n[b]WH churned my stomach for all the wrong reasons,\
      \ but I can't wait for what follows![/b]"
