Cults and Daggers is a rare example of this sort of game being designed well, where it is actually engaging, fun to play, and true to the themes it involves. There are not many games of this genre of \"Cult Simulation\" around. I can only think of one other, called \"Evil Cult\" which is a free browser game that is also very fun and well designed, but much simpler than this. I highly recommend this game, especially if you ever wanted a good strategy game that simulates cult management and the religious, occult and supernatural themes involved. Along with this, the Classical Age setting and aesthetics, as well as the art design are marvellous.\n\nI really like this game and it has great potential to be expanded upon. I hope with future updates, the game mechanics are made more complex and fine-tuned. I also would love to see an expansion with a campaign setting in contemporary times.\n\nI finished the game recently. I saw from this that the game needs further development. Regardless, this programme is the kernel of a great game that needs more development for the game to properly flourish.","timestamp_created":1595050717,"timestamp_updated":1595770948,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.565217375755310059","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmonXxfMCcP+AlgI="}
