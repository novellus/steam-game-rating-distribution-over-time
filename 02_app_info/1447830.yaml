    about_the_game: <strong>battleMETAL</strong> is a successor to the 90's mech simulators
      of old. A delightful modernization of commanding giant robots bristling with
      firepower. Players choose and customize their war machines known as METALS,
      and then drop into the blighted world of Geiserath. Players will be tasked with
      completing a variety of mission types and they must choose the best mechs and
      weapons to complete their objectives. The initial campaign  offers 12 missions
      and 4 difficulty settings. For equipment, the player can choose between 3 distinct
      mechs to pilot and 21 weapons/upgrades. <br><br><strong>battleMETAL</strong>
      runs on the tried-and-true Quake engine via the Darkplaces source-port. Game
      features dynamic lighting, immersive HUDs, robust mech customization, and outdoor
      terrain.<br><br>Once you've conquered the 12-mission campaign, you can test
      your skills in multiplayer. Players can host their own private games (using
      port forwarding) and  browse for matches. The game offers Deathmatch, Team Deathmach,
      and Co-op on customizable servers.<br><br>Lastly, the game is mod-friendly!
      Map Editor is available online, and the source code can be edited too! <br><br>Lock
      in and power up, DEAD_HAND.

    review: "Do you like Mechwarrior 2? The developer of this does too and it shows!\
      \ It feels great, plays great and I just love it! Super easy mod support as\
      \ well! I have modded in the MW2 soundtrack and now it feels even better! <3\n\
      \nIt is one of those games I just got an instant crush on, exactly why that\
      \ is is hard to explain but I will try to give some pros and cons on why.\n\n\
      \nPros:\n+ A very present Mechwarrior 2/Mech sim retro feel, but with modern\
      \ fps controls (similar to Mechwarrior Online)\n+ Lots of options for loadouts\
      \ for the mechs with 3 Chassis available, lots of weapons and weapon group settings.\n\
      + You can target specific parts of the enemy mechs and blow the off! \n+ Great\
      \ mod support!\n+ Engine is open source!\n+ More content is coming!\n+ Multiplayer!\
      \ Coop and deathmatch!\n+ Friendly developer (discord link in the steam forum)\n\
      \nCons:\n- Feels a little bare bones, but the developer promises more content\
      \ in time!\n- HUD can sometimes feel a bit cluttered\n\n\nThe developer has\
      \ also said that the game can be used as plattform for anyone who wants to use\
      \ it to make more content. Mechwarrior 2 total conversion when? ;)"
