    review: "This game is ABSURDLY expensive at this price ($16.) \nThe game is not\
      \ too bad, but it certainly doesn't have much polish. The audio is missing in\
      \ a lot of\nareas and the game lacks useful audio cues, such as indicators when\
      \ damage is being dealt. \n\nThe game is much more linear and straightforward\
      \ than most Resident Evil games as well. \n\nThe game shares many visual aspects\
      \ with RE7 and is clearly a fan game. However, it misses many of the fundamentals\
      \ of\nwhat makes Resident Evil games as good as they are."
