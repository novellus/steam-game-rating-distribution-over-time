    review: 'My full review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez2vqh-0V6M&t=172s


      A dull, poorly written visual novel that the author cares little for. He actually
      made his ''sad ending'' a middle finger to his critics, abandoning his audience.


      After that? I see no further point of addressing it on any other level than
      a slowly winding middle finger. Nothing but dull, dross, followed by a middle
      finger and crying laughing emojis, in terms of content.


      Trash game, trash dev, not even worth a pity purchase.'
