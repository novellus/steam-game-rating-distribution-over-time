    review: "Game consists of killing these fast worm type things (that I've seen\
      \ in another very similar game & that have no AI other than B-line towards you),\
      \ picking up skulls, finding weapons/health, finding the exit.\n\nThen go to\
      \ the next level and do the exact same thing.\n\n- No progression.\n- You can't\
      \ spend those skulls you collect on anything.\n- Levels are procedurally generated\
      \ but look and play the same.\n- New enemy types offer little variety\n= No\
      \ incentive to keep playing.\n\nLooks like a re-hash of \"Slug Blast\" which\
      \ is no longer on steam store.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/app/618540\n\nI feel\
      \ like I had more fun in that game, than this one.\n\nAlso, you know how in\
      \ some FPS games the camera will \"roll\" left/right to simulate weight/momentum\
      \ shift? This game does something like that, except from top down view it actually\
      \ \"yaw\"s (rotates about vertical (or in this case, the camera view) axis)\
      \ - kind of wonky feeling.\n\n\nImprovement suggestions for Dev:\n\u2022 Add\
      \ a melee weapon to destroy the boxes without consuming ammo/energy, and would\
      \ also act as a backup when out of ammo/energy for weapons.\n\u2022 Maybe change\
      \ weapons to use ammo that has to be found\n\u2022 Or a buy an airdrop of ammo\
      \ as something to use  thsoe skulls for (and just make them coins, they look\
      \ like enemies coming after me)\n\u2022 Grenades\n\u2022 Boss enemy and actual\
      \ end game"
