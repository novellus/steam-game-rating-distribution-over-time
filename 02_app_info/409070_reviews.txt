It's like a mix between Ninja Gaiden and Vice: Project Doom on the NES. Tight game play, good music, and a solid understanding of what made classic 8-bit games fun. \n\nAnd then the final level came around and killed everything.\n\nI can't beat it. I threw in the towel after an hour. Why? Nine consecutive screens with only three lives. This should be doable except the worst flaws of this game shine through here. 1. You can only use the analog stick on your game pad and not the D-pad. That sucks for a 2-D platformer. Combine this with rampant input eating. Thought you were going to jump? Nope. Thought you were going to hitch to that wall? Nope. The platforming at the end became impossible for me because of the input eating due to using the analog stick. It sucks and it ruined an otherwise awesome game for me. I love the other games Sinclair Strange as put out, but man, I really hope this is patched to using D-Pad controls.","timestamp_created":1609728763,"timestamp_updated":1609728763,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x/TT5fYCfvOiwAI="}
