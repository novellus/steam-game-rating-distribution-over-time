      is a story told through an assortment of casual gaming, a virtual pet adventure
      with a cute race of creatures that eventually shows more depth. Who knows what
      each day will hold: Fool around with a toy, feed your pet, dress your pet up,
      do college homework, play hide-and-seek, veg out with an old video game system
      or just save the world if you feel like it. You''ll see the beauty of passion
      and creativity when you''re young - and its bad moments too.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>
