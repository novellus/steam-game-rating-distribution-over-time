    review: "+Graphics are phenomenal\n+Intricate progress system with a large tree\
      \ of skills to level for each turtle\n+General brawler game play is enjoyable\n\
      \n-Suck Ass A.I.\n-Difficulty only adjusted for four human players\n-Earning\
      \ XP takes too long.\n\nThey should've balanced the difficulty and toned down\
      \ boss fights for \nsingle player games...\n\n..The A.I. teammates are feasible\
      \ from point A to B but the moment a large fight requires teamwork and the coding\
      \ behind your teammates really begins to fail.\n\nHaving used an unlimited item\
      \ hack ( from a trainer ) so that I could keep reviving my heroes\nthe first\
      \ large battle with Cerberus still proved frustrating and took too long.\n\n\
      In single player games the progress system takes far to long to earn XP to spend,\
      \ there are too many smaller enemies, during boss battles, getting in the way\
      \ and absorbing your strategically timed attacks on the boss and the enemies\
      \ all have far too many hit points.\n\nSuch a shame as this was almost a decent\
      \ game."
