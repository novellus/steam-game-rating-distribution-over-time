I previously wrote a positive review for this game while it was in early access because I saw massive potential and really thought the game could have turned out to be one of the best zombie survival games out there.\n\nI really liked the camp management concept and thought the giant city zombie infested world felt a little bit like the movie/book \"I Am Legend\". However... the game turned out to be just another early access scam that never actually got finished. The control scheme for this game is one of the worst I've ever seen. Just downright awful controls. You constantly lock onto one enemy at a time and it doesn't work with groups of zombies coming at you.\n\nThe game didn't get a proper texture/graphics update and I suspect the game came out of early access because the developer didn't want to work on the game anymore. This is a terrible reason to release a game as full launch. They should have pulled it from steam instead. The game came out of early access in November of 2019. They pushed one more update a couple of weeks after that and havent' touched the game since.\n\n[i]It's been abandoned.[/i]","timestamp_created":1486329702,"timestamp_updated":1609748023,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47bCd5vYCeKG0cQ=="}
