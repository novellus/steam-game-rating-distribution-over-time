    review: 'Fairly generic RPGMaker JRPG, but with some more effort put into the
      mechanics and writing than usual, even if the writing could have used some proofreading.


      Unfortunately, that effort came to making the difficulty rather obnoxious, with
      one of the early examples being that you are constantly poor, often too poor
      to afford recovery items, because monsters don''t drop gold and just occasionally
      drop items you can sell for money... and then the second continent is the Land
      of Nothing But Poison, where you need poison antidotes or resting at an inn
      after almost every fight. Boss fights can also be fairly RNG-dependent, but
      that''s another way of saying they''re short and painful, which I don''t dislike.


      This one is a tossup for me. Some parts of it were pretty good, like the amount
      of options for dealing with the final conflict, and the amount of times the
      game remembers optional things you did earlier, enough that I''d give it a thumbs-up
      for being an amusing short game, but then there was that second continent...


      ...eh, I''m feeling kind of merciful. Recommended, but with a warning that if
      you hate hugging up to a recovery point and grinding as much as I do, you might
      be very displeased with Broken Ties.'
