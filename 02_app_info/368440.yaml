    about_the_game: "Pavel Quest is a pixel art, puzzle platformer where you cannot\
      \ stop running, and you can only turn around by bumping into walls. Breakable\
      \ walls, fireballs, acid spouts, and spikes are only some of the obstacles in\
      \ your way. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreated by ElevenSeventy, a team of two game\
      \ lovers, Pavel Quest is the first commercial product released by ElevenSeventy.\
      \ We opted to aim for a simple concept, and make it great. Over time we added\
      \ features like gravity anomalies, bounce pads, fireballs, acid spouts, secret\
      \ characters, and a replay system. All while preserving the balance of simplicity\
      \ and difficulty. Pavel Quest is a hard game, but it is rewarding as well."
