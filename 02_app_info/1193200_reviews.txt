[/h1]\n\nThis time, it's really grindy. Like you need resources, you only got one drone. If you want more (which is advisable), there is a long wait for that to happen. For each bit of the desired resource is a timer attached to it. Some 20 seconds, others 50 or more. And it's only one resource at the time.\nOnce you got the resources, you can start manufacturing parts which you need to fix your base. This costs time, a LOT of time...\n\nSo in the meantime, you could explore the place. Your base has seven buildings, each with it's specific function; Headquarters, Research, Communication, Extraction, Manusfacturing, Living Quarters and Medical Bay. \nIn order to travel to each of them, you have to use a tank. You need to repair your base and enhance it, because at the moment, you have little power.\n\n[h1] Mine for resources, manusfacture parts to fix your base, defend your base with turrets... Gotcha! [/h1]\n\nThere are times you can get lost, but there is a map so that helps. And when you reach the door, the door tells you what building it is. So that is good too. The tutorial teaches you in a good way, but for some reason it still felt overwhelming and had not really the idea what to do. But that came a little bit later, better late then never, right?\n\nThe game has a lot to offer, the mechanic works - eventhough it requires A LOT of time, but in the end, it might be interesting enough. There are some mysterious things happening, which makes it a bit more intriging. There are terminals with files and emails, found containers which are locked with a code...\n\n[h1] All&All this game is a nice timewaster, with the feels that you are alone but with a duty. Sadly, it takes a lot of time, which I don't have, therefor, for me: not my cup of tea - but in the big picture, this game is really good! [/h1]\n\nPersonally, I would preferred that the entire base was all connected with eachother, so you don't have to go with that tank outside. But on the other hand, if you need more power, you will have to turn off the turret control and use your tank for the meantime as protection.","timestamp_created":1595673890,"timestamp_updated":1595673973,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kJLlwvMCf9O4lwI="}
