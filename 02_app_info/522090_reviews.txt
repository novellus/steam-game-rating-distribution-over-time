Limited times to play levels; you gotta wait till the timer runs down or you can buy defense attempts. Just for $99! Towers can be upgraded for elixir, which you get by playing levels. Or you can buy elixir! Just for $99! Really don't buy this shit, not even on sale. As a TD game it is not even that good and with the ridiculous pricing scheme on top, this is a no-brainer: POS.
