This game differs from Missile Command in two major ways...\n\n#1 being that it's in 3D of course. and you get to set the locations of your units before each match.\n\n#2 It isn't all about defense. You have to take out your enemy to win. \n\nThink of it sorta like the classic board game Battleship. You are the total missile commander flicking between defense and offense as easily as you press the space bar. The controls are simple enough, using your mouse to aim the recticle and fire your SAMs as well as plot targets on the map for your offensive missiles which depending on the map can come in 6 different flavors (3 standard 3 special) \nNow there is multiplayer over LAN and IP but I haven't actually tried that yet but for $4.99 it makes for a good singleplayer skirmisher, casual but still fun.","timestamp_created":1476297481,"timestamp_updated":1476297481,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474016815423965454","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4svuL3dcCeaOYYw=="}
