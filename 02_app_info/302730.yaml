    about_the_game: "Game\u2019s action takes place in a magical land of Namariel,\
      \ where magic and science joint together. The game is played from the first\
      \ person; you will see the world through the eyes of king\u2019s daughter, who\
      \ was overthrown by the brutal Iron Lord. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe selected Steam\
      \ Punk as a style of the game, which means that you will find many interesting\
      \ puzzles, interactions with objects and mechanisms. The player will have to\
      \ escape from the air prison, find the Great Prophet in magic forest, reveal\
      \ the secret of the Iron Lord, sneak into his citadel and rid Namariel from\
      \ cruel tyrant. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe tried to invent something new, for example\
      \ there is \u201Cmind reading device\u201D in the gameplay; by using this item\
      \ you\u2019ll be able to divine thoughts of characters, who are unable to communicate\
      \ with you. Also you will have a robot assistant at your disposal, his name\
      \ is Jim, he will help you in solving quests, and also, from time to time you\u2019\
      ll be able to switch controls of both main character and Jim to walk through\
      \ levels with his assistance. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nLarge game world, many magnificent\
      \ locations and lots of pleasant animation; by the way, animation is what we\
      \ are especially proud of, because we are a small studio, but we really wanted\
      \ to do our best in terms of quality, so that you would like it. <br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nIn spite of the linear gameplay, at the same time there is a freedom\
      \ in choosing several quests to resolve, not connected among themselves, we\
      \ don\u2019t lead you by the hand, giving you rein to choose. <br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nDozens of brain-teasers, mini-games and innovative solutions, ranging\
      \ from simple mini-games in two moves to advanced mode mini-games, where help\
      \ of your assistant may be needed."
