      \ monophonic audio, easy commands and good gameplay, using only the directional\
      \ keys on your keyboard or a USB control you must collect the vials with the\
      \ medicines that will appear in the scenario, after that go to the hospital\
      \ to create the vaccine to defeat the virus.<br />\r\n The game has two portals,\
      \ one on each side of the scene, where the player can teleport from side to\
      \ side of the scene in order to escape the virus.<br />\r\n At the beginning\
      \ of the game, the player must collect 10 vials to produce the cure and at each\
      \ completed level, 5 more vials will be added to the count. After 10 levels\
      \ of difficulty have been completed, the virus is completely eliminated and\
      \ the game is ended, saving the player's score in home screen."
