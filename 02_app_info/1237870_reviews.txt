For now i just wanted this to work more as a shoutout for what seems to be a great deal.  \n  \n[b] UPDATE: [/b] At this point i've beaten 17 bosses (there are 20 in total).  \nI've really enjoyed my time in the game so far. Every boss feels unique, with interesting fight mechanics. And the amount of bu****it attacks that feel cheap is kept at the absolute minimum.  \nThere is one part of the game i really don't enjoy. To the point where it almost left me with a  sour taste in the end, although my overall experience was good.  \nAnd that's the progression system.  \nHaving unlocked only 1 new weapon this far into the game just doesn't feel right.  \nAlso having to grind challenges in order to unlock the few remaining bosses feels forced. Challenges should be something you complete cause you enjoy the game so much that you just want to spend more time in it. Not a mandatory thing in order to progress the game.  \nThat being said, i think this game deserves your support and that we're gonna see really cool stuff from this dev in the future.  \nRecommended even at full price.","timestamp_created":1607144336,"timestamp_updated":1609634311,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tc3r4vYCe6K1twI="}
