    review: "The \"No\" recommendation is a \"Not Yet\" recommendation. The idea is\
      \ great, and the world is stunning. Really good work on the lighting etc. However,\
      \ sadly, this game is far to incomplete to have been launched for users to play.\
      \ Let alone pay for and then play. I would have only released this as a free\
      \ closed Alpha. \n\nLots of potential, but way to soon to be on here."
