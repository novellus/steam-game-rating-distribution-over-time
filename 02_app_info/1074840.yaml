    review: 'This game is absolutely abysmal. The gameplay itself is decent enough
      for a simple cheap game like this, and I took the liberty of the Steam Summer
      Sale to buy it very cheap. It is still hardly worth it. The content however
      is far less than advertized.


      There are two zones, both very small and simple.


      There are a total of three weapons, at least for the warrior class, not counting
      bare fists.


      There are two, three if you count the boss, types of enemies: Zombies and spitter
      zombies. The boss is just a slightly tougher regular zombie.


      The quests come in two varieties: Gather potions and kill zombies. They are
      infiitely repeatable from the same questgivers. When you gather the potions,
      you give them to the questgiver.


      The potions and the gold is hardly worth bothering with though, as 60g is enough
      to buy the best gear: one sword and a helmet, and the quests give you so much
      exp, that it is easy to kill the enemies by simply leveling up and dumping all
      your points into str.


      None of the other abilities do anything. Using skills is hardly necessary.


      Despite all this, I liked the grinding. It was fun in a sort of brain-dead repetitive
      way. The controls were a bit wonky, but ultimately not an issue. I was seriously
      disappointed when the game ended abruptly as I entered the second stage and
      realized that I couldn''t continue any further, because the game just isn''t
      there. I was awaiting more challenging types of zombies, and maybe some lame
      plot hidden in the backgrounds I play through, such as saving a village or something,
      but there was nothing. Just a pile of rubble after the boss, sparking some confusion
      and frustration, as the game didn''t even say it was over.'
