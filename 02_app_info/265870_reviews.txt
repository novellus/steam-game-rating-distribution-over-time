I might have beaten sooner if I didn't fight every enemy which made me able to fight the few bosses fight in the game. I only had one game over at the last boss fight but this was due to my own fault. The only things I didn't like the game is that up until the last boss fight you don't get a skill that will attack all of the enemies. No healing skills that will everyone in your party but everyone have their own healing skill.  It also left questions unanswer and left is at a huge cliffhanger. This would not be a problem if the sequels were brought to STEAM.  If fine a place I trust to get the sequels I'll post it here.","timestamp_created":1594948721,"timestamp_updated":1594948721,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lsOWrfMCc+filQI="}
