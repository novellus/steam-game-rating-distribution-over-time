    review: "Ich finde Calavera \xFCberaus empfehlenswert! Die Story war super und\
      \ zudem grafisch sehr gut umgesetzt, aber vor allem ist das Setting mal was\
      \ anderes, was mir besonders gefallen hat.\n\nDie R\xE4tsel und HO-Szenen sind\
      \ toll inszeniert und weder zu schwer noch zu leicht.\n\nIch habe keinerlei\
      \ Abst\xFCrze zu vermelden, das Spiel lief bei mir reibungslos.\n\nKlare Empfehlung\
      \ von mir!"
