      \ /><br><br>Spelunky returns in this greatly-expanded sequel to the original\
      \ roguelike platformer! Meet the next generation of explorers as they find themselves\
      \ on the Moon, searching for treasure and missing family. Spelunky 2 builds\
      \ upon the unique, randomized challenges that made the original a classic, offering\
      \ a huge adventure designed to satisfy players old and new.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >A Bigger and More Dynamic World, with So Much to See and Do</h2><br>Spelunky\
      \ 2's world is even denser than the one in the original game, offering many\
      \ more areas, characters, traps, and items, as well as new ways to interact\
      \ with them (and for them to interact with each other). The world has expanded\
      \ in other ways, too, with branching paths and multi-layered levels adding a\
      \ third dimension to the classic 2d platforming. Animals can also be tamed and\
      \ ridden. And dynamic liquid physics create new challenges and make the world\
      \ feel extra reactive and alive.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Build a Community, Make\
      \ Friends</h2><br>Back in Base Camp, characters you unlock will mill about and\
      \ relax between runs, offering encouragement and advice. As you explore, your\
      \ camp will expand and develop into a thriving little community to welcome you\
      \ whenever you need a break from exploring. While there, you can also access\
      \ shortcuts and practice your moves in safety.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Game\
      \ is Yours to Explore</h2><br>Spelunky 2 is not just about &quot;getting good\
      \ and beating the game&quot; - more than that, it's an endlessly replayable\
      \ playground to experiment in and find your own way, creating stories against\
      \ the backdrop of an expansive, deeply-interactive world filled with secrets.\
