Rock and Heavy Metal being my top. However I do like classical, even some country, techno and I love pop music and am personally glad they finally decided to add some of the pop music genre. To be a great musician, you need to dabble in all the genre pools. No matter how hard or easy. There is always different styles.\nThank you Ubisoft for bringing this out.","timestamp_created":1518468962,"timestamp_updated":1518468962,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.684464871883392334","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7bLzxeECdvHamAE="}
