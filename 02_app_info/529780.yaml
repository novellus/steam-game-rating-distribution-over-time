    review: "Before I begin this is a remake of my old review. Disturbed is a great\
      \ horror, choose your own adventure like game. Let\u2019s get into the story.\n\
      \nA farmer whose crops and cow have mysteriously contracted a plague that's\
      \ killing them, his only hope to save his dying land is to travel and find out\
      \ what is the cause of this plague. \nSo what\u2019s the likes. The game has\
      \ a good creepy atmosphere as you travel through a medieval land. The new art\
      \ is very good even better than the old art. The story is good as you find out\
      \ what caused the strange plague, I also like the choose-your-own-adventure\
      \ feel to the whole game.\n\nThe deaths you can get can range from funny or\
      \ very scary, mostly scary. The game\u2019s music and sound is good I like how\
      \ they added some more sound to it witch I liked. \n\nThe levels are nice to\
      \ explore and there are some parts where I just stopped and marveled at it.\n\
      \nSo what\u2019s the Dislikes. The new death where if you take too much time\
      \ in the game a ghost kills you was kind of dumb luckily I didn't have to deal\
      \ with it because I found a charm early on in the game that protected me, but\
      \ still that new death was dumb.\n\nThe tree puzzle can be annoying and the\
      \ cave that was under the tree can also be kind of annoying but they're both\
      \ not too bad.\n\nSo all in all Disturbed is a great horror, choose your own\
      \ adventure like game. With a good creepy atmosphere, nice levels and many great\
      \ deaths to get.\n\nSo if you\u2019re looking for choose your own horror adventure\
      \ game, this game is for you and I cannot wait to play the sequel.  I all so\
      \ say get the DLC it doesn't really do anything but its $0.99 and it will help\
      \ support the maker of this game."
