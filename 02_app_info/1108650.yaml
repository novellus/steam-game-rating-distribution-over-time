      Elemental Evil(1985), by Gary Gygax and Frank Mentzer, was published in August
      1985 as part of what might have been AD&amp;D''s biggest year ever for the publication
      of majorbooks.<br><br><strong>The Long Wait.</strong> The first part of this
      mega-adventure was published years earlier as T1: &quot;The Village of Hommlet&quot;(1979).
      That adventure into Hommlet''s Moathouse set up an expedition to the Temple
      itself, and the expectation was that TSR would publish what was being called
      &quot;T2: The Temple of Elemental Evil&quot; just a short time later. Unfortunately,
      as early as 1980, Gygax reported that the adventure was delayed. It would in
      fact be six years after &quot;Hommlet&quot; before the Temple finally appeared.<br><br><strong>Part
      of the problem was with Gygax''s design of the Temple itself.</strong> He''d
      run it as his house campaign mainly to explore ideas about random dungeon generation.
      However, he didn''t feel that the random dungeon he''d created was appropriate
      for a published adventure, so he thought it would have to be redone. Tension
      over this work probably increased when T1: &quot;Village of Hommlet&quot; received
      considerable critical acclaim. Now, Gygax had to both recreate the Temple and
      do it at a level of quality that matched its already well-regarded predecessor.<br><br><strong>The
      other problem was Gygax''s role at TSR.</strong> From 1979 onward, he was increasingly
      doing business development and management, leaving him less room for creativity.
      He recognized this by creating a Design department, but he wasn''t willing to
      turn the Temple over to them -- so it sat and waited (not unlike the Temple
      in the adventure itself). The likelihood of Hommlet''s successor being produced
      decreased even more in 1982, when Gygax was effectively exiled to the West Coast
      by the Blume brothers.<br><br><strong>The &quot;Do or Die&quot; Year.</strong>
      In 1984, TSR, then under the Blume brothers, took a hard stumble, and Gygax
      came rushing back. Returning to TSR, he found the company a million and a half
      dollars in debt. To help correct the deficit and get TSR back on his feet, Gygax
      proposed five major releases - four of which would bear his name as a creator.
      T1-4: The Temple of Elemental Evilwas one of these five projects.<br><br><strong>The
      Format.</strong> Temple was published as a &quot;super module,&quot; a format
      used for the first time a month earlier by Lankhmar: City of Adventures(1985).
      The 128-page book was 2 to 4 times the size of any of TSR''s adventures to date,
      and it also included a 16-page map book that a GM could use to easily cross-reference
      locations with details. The format would continue to be used in the years afterward
      for TSR''s most prestigious adventure releases.<br><br><strong>The Adventure
      Continues.</strong> Templeforms the start of a major Greyhawk adventure path,
      which continues in two more super modules, A1-4: Scourge of the Slave Lords(1986)
      and GDQ1-7: Queen of the Spiders(1986). Though connected, they weren''t as closely
      knit as the adventure paths later created from their ashes by Paizo in the pages
      of Dungeon.<br><br>Ironically, you can probably trace the origins of adventure
      paths back to the original GDQ adventures (1978-1980). However, the new &quot;TAGDQ
      path&quot; formed a much more extended campaign of the sort that had originated
      with TSR''s own Dragonlance saga (1984-1986) and DGP''s &quot;Grand Tour&quot;
      for Traveller(1985-1989).<br><br><strong>About the Creators.</strong> &quot;The
      Village of Hommlet&quot; was entirely the creation of Gary Gygax. He also gave
      Frank Mentzer what has been described as &quot;200-300 pages of notes&quot;
      on the Temple; from that source, Mentzer created the finished adventure. While
      Mentzer was working on Temple, he was one of the major designers at TSR. He
      was right in the middle of producing the BECMI edition of Basic D&amp;D (1983-1986),
      and he''d already been picked to lead the work on AD&amp;D Second Edition. As
      it happens, Mentzer never got to work on 2e; instead, he joined Gygax in forming
      New Infinities Productions in October 1986.<br><br><i>Converted by: </i><strong>Mike
