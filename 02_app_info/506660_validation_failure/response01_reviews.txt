But I can tell you its not just \"early access\" its beyond that.\nBugs everywhere, no sound clips, terrible inventory system, water and hunger depletes quickly, its just a mess.\nI only played a little bit, and I have to say, its probably one of the worst experiences I have had playing a video game. I said ONE of them. So this is actually far from the worst. But it is still pretty bad.\nYou spawn in a cave with all the resources outside of the cave. Upon exiting you run into a bandit where you must kill with your axe. In probably the worst fight I have ever been in. No gun sounds, no hit sounds, no hit indicators, nothing. I was just swinging hoping I'd hit something. He died, after swinging and spamming my mouse button. I figured \"Yes! A gun!\", when I collected the corpse... I got NOTHING! Absolutely nothing. \n\nThere were a few planks of wood next to the fire, and everytime you go to a menu, they multiply. On top of that, the building menu (B) doesn't work. The mouse cursor goes away until you exit the building menu. So I had to open the building menu, and open the main menu. WHich still didn't work because the game bugged out and wouldn't place anything. \n\nBut I won't say I don't admire the concept. A western survival? That is unique and its something I really want to see. But I want to see it done right. So my opinion is this can become a great game, it is early asscess so I am hoping that this actually becomes a functional game and a good one. So don't buy it, but follow it. Lets see where this goes.","timestamp_created":1472355853,"timestamp_updated":1472355853,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.621616482734680176","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4rOzP59YCfqePYA=="}
