    about_the_game: 'DERE EVIL .EXE is both a terrifying thriller with a gripping
      story and an unorthodox retro platformer with unique puzzles and difficult obstacles.
      This game is not for the faint of heart. If you choose to get DERE EVIL EXE,
      you can also get DERE .EXE and PROTO DERE .NES, two full games, as free DLC.<br><br>Note:

      arrows to stick. This game DOES NOT have controller support. Unplug any and
      all controllers while playing this game. Use the space bar and left and right
      arrow keys to move.<br><br>In DERE EVIL .EXE, you step into the tiny shoes of
      a silent hero named ''Knightly''. Knightly must jump, run, and manipulate environments
      in order to survive the heart-racing journey through a stunning pixel art world.<br><br>Within
      surreal structures and blocky hills lurk dangerous creatures known as ''corruptions''.
      They take the form of their creator''s greatest fears. Their creepy creator,

    review: I love horror games that appear to be friendly on the outside, and even
      though I knew that it was eventually going to get scary, the game kept me on
      the edge of my seat the whole time xD I also died many times as the levels proved
      to be a challenge! I recommend this game if you enjoy cute looking games that
      come with scary plot twists and difficult levels!
