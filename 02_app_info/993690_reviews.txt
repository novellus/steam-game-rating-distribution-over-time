Its a good game. The loading bug was fixed so you can actually save now. buses no longer get stuck, and there are new maps and there is water. Maybe add boats? Heres my old Review: \"I like the design of the game, -but the buses can't move, therefor they wont generate a profit, so you have to reload the game. This brings me to my next issue, the game breaks the more you reload the game, I saved one game, then reloaded it. It broke, streets were not curved, braking the connections, and all of the vehicles are gone.- Also, suggestion! Maybe you could have more than one car per every one hundred population depending on what graphics you put it on.\" Update, 2020, It seems the developers have actually given up on this game as they haven't updated this game in a solid year and a month.","timestamp_created":1548450259,"timestamp_updated":1609177923,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ428+e1fYCe9aauQE="}
