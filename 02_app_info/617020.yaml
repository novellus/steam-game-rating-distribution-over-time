    review: 'Omega Pattern is a sci-fi visual novel both developed and published by
      Borokai Studio. The title centers around the "Omega Pattern" which is a brain
      signal that gives the person born with it psychic abilities. Enter Shaiel, a
      young man who possesses the Omega Pattern and finds himself constantly on the
      run from a shadowy organization known as Bioagora which seeks to control anyone
      with these unique skills. As the protagonist, you will have the opportunity
      to make decisions and determine Shaiel''s personality as the narrative progresses.
      Will you be able to unravel the mysteries surrounding the Omega Pattern and
      Bioagora?


      I found the presentation in this visual novel to be above average in the genre.
      The manga inspired artwork is pleasant to look at and has great color. Also,
      there were some interesting characters introduced throughout the story some
      of which I would like to know more about perhaps in future installments? However,
      the audio I found less inspiring and the soundtrack is not very memorable in
      my opinion. With that said, this V.N. puts forth some solid visuals and has
      a decent presentation yet try as I might I just couldn''t seem to connect with
      the story which to me is the most important part of a visual novel.


      I did not enjoy my read of Omega Pattern and was also quite shocked to learn
      that this was only the first part as I was under the impression that this purchase
      was for the complete novel...guess I didn''t read the "fine print" close enough?
      Nevertheless, I found the story hard to follow at times yet I did enjoy the
      concept of shaping the protagonist''s personality through flashbacks from his
      past. Also, I came across quite a few typos and found some of the English version
      dialogue strangely worded. As far as options go, there are Steam Achievements
      and Steam Trading Cards as well as an original soundtrack available. In conclusion,
      the story in this first installment of Omega Pattern was not a good read for
      me yet I will give the next installment a try when it eventually becomes available
      but I would NOT RECOMMEND this visual novel to anyone fan of the genre or not.'
