The UI is great very simple and clean. The controls are terrible and if they fixed that it'd be awesome! So far I've completed the starting area but it was very frustrating figuring out all the controls and how to change them, if they just implemented a simple hit ESC key and navigate with your mouse cursor it'd be great but it's very annoying but I gave it some time! Also as a game design student myself I loved the fact it was made in Unity! <3\n\nYou can check out my starting area gameplay here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UerJTwKIv1s&t=9s","timestamp_created":1523386942,"timestamp_updated":1523574895,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508896768093109131","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mf6I3uICdMf4nQE="}
