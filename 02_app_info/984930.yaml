    review: "[b] General Gameplay\t[/b]\nThis has a Her Story vibe that I really like.\
      \ Typing in words that might be important based on what you hear. The feedback\
      \ for those guesses\u2014when you type in a word that isn't relevant, nothing\
      \ happens (really nothing)\u2014is not the greatest and the hint system is slow\
      \ and a sort of tedious. \n\n[b] Results System\t[/b]\nNot sure how I feel about\
      \ the whole numbers system because it's also unclear to me what those numbers\
      \ relate to. Like if you type in a word and the number 4 pops up, is that part\
      \ 4 of a particular chapter or what? I really felt a bit lost with that and\
      \ also with the numbers that pop up next to the topics you've found. One of\
      \ the words, for example, had a 26 next to it. If there are 26 relevant parts,\
      \ why can't I access them all? Why can I only access 10? I'm not sure if that's\
      \ what the number means but... that would be my question if it is. If you CAN\
      \ access all 26 then I'm not sure why it's not obvious HOW to do this. \n\n\
      [b] Atmosphere/Visual\t[/b]\nI also found it a bit boring that you only stare\
      \ at a talking picture the whole time, music also wasn't doing it for me anymore\
      \ after the first 45 minutes. Without the ability to control speed of the playback\
      \ or even scroll through the playback, it is easy to get frustrated when you\
      \ miss something. You can't just rewind, you have to listen to the whole tidbit\
      \ again and some of them are really long. \n\n[b] Concluding Thoughts\t[/b]\n\
      Overall, it's eerie and interesting. I don't think it was a bad experience but\
      \ I'd hesitate to recommend it because I wouldn't say that I enjoyed it so much.\
      \ Still a really cool idea and a decent execution. I liked the voice acting\
      \ as well.  A few times I was tempted to google the case but didn't want to\
      \ ruin the suspense of the game. There is definitely something to be said about\
      \ the historical use of the death penalty and the possibility that many innocents\
      \ had their lives ruined by hearsay, prejudice and whatever else. As a black\
      \ American woman, I can certainly think of a few unfortunate tales from my country's\
      \ history. Would have been nice if there were more cases, I think. But, then\
      \ again, with stories like this, more would always be better but maybe not the\
      \ best ;)\n\nThat being said, if you liked Her Story, you're probably the type\
      \ of person that is most likely to be entertained by this one. The novelty of\
      \ a non-fiction story is actually valuable here."
