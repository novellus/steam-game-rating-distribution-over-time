    review: "First impression: medium-sized exploration puzzle game.\n\nThis is a\
      \ first impression because I got killed by a T-Rex on my first playthrough,\
      \ which has never happened to me in a Sokoban-style game before. This game is\
      \ special! The premise is that you have a tech tree that allows you to mine\
      \ resources and build stuff, and for some research you need unique materials\
      \ that you can get by solving box-pushing puzzles that are scattered around\
      \ the environment. This is all good fun except for wo things:\n1) The inventory\
      \ is quite limited, and you can't discard unique resources. If you pick up puzzle\
      \ rewards you don't yet need, you may find yourself unable to complete the research\
      \ you need to progress (e.g. to un\xF6lock a bigger inventory).\n2) The level\
      \ is quite big and confusing, and you don't get a map until you've found and\
      \ solved all the map pieces puzzles, which isn difficult because you have no\
      \ map.\n\nApart from that, I thought the game was well made. It supports keyboard\
      \ or digital gamepad as controls, and I found the world quite engaging. Some\
      \ of the puzzles I've encountered are  difficult! (I've yet to find out if you\
      \ can cheat by building on the playing field, but I suspect you can't.)\n\n\
      If puzzling and exploration are your thing, give this game a try -- it's not\
      \ that big, but it's not that expensive, either!"
