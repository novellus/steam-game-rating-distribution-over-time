According to [url=https://www.realmeye.com/forum/t/heroic-weekend-kiddforce-toastrz-stream-and-more-x-32-0-5/51639]this RealmEye thread[/url], the current version is [b]X.32.0.5[/b].\n\nWhen redeemed, I received the following items:\n[list]\n[*]Halloween Cemetery Key (x10)\n[*]Pumpkin Head Pet Skin (Soulbound) x1\n[*]Frankensteins Monster Skin x1\n[*]Witch Skin x1\n[/list]\n\nNote that the \"1x Halloween Candy\" was missing from my gift chest in the vault. There was literally an \"Empty item slot\" where it should have been, but I am almost certain that this was a token for Halloween events. However, the Witch Skin and Frankensteins Monster Skin were [i]not[/i] soulbound, so you can trade them if you wish. Since the other three reviews have been written, the pet skins act like the standard skins in the way that you can change your pet's skin or family in the Pet Yard for Fame or Gold.\n\nAs for value, decide your purchase on how much you would pay for the Frankensteins Monster Skin and Pumpkin Head Pet Skins, as you can purchase a Witch Skin for either 285 or 300 Gold in the Nexus depending if it's on sale and standard Cemetery Keys cost 50 Gold each (500 Gold total). You can probably get the keys for less if there's a Cemetery event and you're willing to gamble on a mystery box. \n\nI personally recommend this at the time of reviewing because I wanted those two skins and I plan to pop the keys before their conversion.","timestamp_created":1571431324,"timestamp_updated":1571431324,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.668113350868225098","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwluOm8O0CfNWp1AE="}
