Some slot machines/casino tables, a luggage cart, a fancy hotel meal cart, some plants, some lighting, a store shelf, a couple of counters, a stairway that looks like an escalator that isn't even animated.. and animated open/closing elevator doors. I guess the editted walls and floors are nice, and the wrestling ring is.. there, but I can't see anything that I would do with it since it is all one big piece aside from the crowd background. If the spotlights were separated you could at least use them for a stage or something, but they aren't - the spotlights continue right onto the poles and ropes of the ring, making both look weird if you try to use them apart.\n\nLike, this is the type of thing you'd find for free on the Lucky Duet resource site. At least they have an animated escalator. \n\nYou may be thinking \"Ah, it's on sale, I'll pick it up anyway..\" - Don't. There's nothing in here you need, unless you just HAVE to have a few more slot machines and a blackjack table. This is honestly worth maybe a buck or two at most, and even that is less a \"This is worth the effort\" and more of a \"I'm tipping the creator for their work\" thing.","timestamp_created":1608920670,"timestamp_updated":1608920670,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw86PJzfYCd6yQvQI="}
