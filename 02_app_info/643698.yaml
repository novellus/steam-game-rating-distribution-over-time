      Railroad, built from 1911 to 1915 in a run of more than 6.900 cars in total.
      The car featured a steel under-frame and wood sheathing, making it extremely
      light compared to older cars. The X23 served as a new standard design and it

      arrive and the X23 boxcars were quickly outdated. During the late 1940s and
      1950s, the X23 boxcars were scrapped with some of the cars being assigned to

    review: Needed some rolling stock for my Steam era Pennsylvania K4 and these vintage
      looking Boxcars fit the bill nicely. They are highly detailed and each car is
      assigned it's own number and look great behind my old 4-6-2.
