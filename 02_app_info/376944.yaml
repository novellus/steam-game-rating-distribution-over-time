      \ contemporary railroad lines comes to Train Simulator with the Alaska Railroad\
      \ \u2013 Seward to Anchorage route!<br><br>The Train Simulator Alaska Railroad\
      \ \u2013 Seward to Anchorage route includes the Alaska Railroad\u2019s line\
      \ from Anchorage via Portage to Seward (114 route miles) as well as the important\
      \ ARR line from Portage to Whittier, Alaska (12 route miles). And as an engineer\
      \ on this extraordinary modern route, you\u2019ll take the throttle of the Alaska\
      \ Railroad\u2019s powerful Electro-Motive SD70MACs and versatile GP38-2s, both\
      \ of which are included with the route. <br><br>The Alaska Railroad \u2013 Seward\
      \ to Anchorage route offers a superb variety of operating challenges and realistic\
      \ experiences, ranging from lugging massive unit coal trains and manifests over\
      \ the Kenai Mountains to yard and lineside industry switching duties at Anchorage\
      \ to handling port switching jobs at Seward and Whittier.<br><br>Another fascinating\
      \ aspect of operations on the Alaska Railroad is the railroad\u2019s reliance\
      \ on Direct Traffic Control (\u201CDTC\u201D) given that a majority of the route\
      \ is not equipped with lineside signals (the areas around Anchorage and Whittier\
      \ Tunnel being the exceptions). ARR\u2019s use of Direct Traffic Control involves\
      \ dispatchers providing, via radio transmission, permission for trains to operate\
      \ within assigned DTC blocks. The Alaska Railroad \u2013 Seward to Anchorage\
      \ route authentically re-creates ARR\u2019s block system and DTC operations\
      \ as well as the CTC-governed signaling around Anchorage and Whittier. <br><br>Along\
      \ with the ARR Electro-Motive SD70MAC and EMD GP38-2, the Alaska Railroad \u2013\
      \ Seward to Anchorage route provides a variety of authentic and useful freight\
      \ equipment, including flatbed container car, covered hoppers, center-beam flatcar,\
      \ 4-chute coal hopper, timber flat, stack car, piggyback flat, boxcar, tank\
      \ car, and ARR extended-vision cupola caboose. And this remarkable Train Simulator\

    review: "I'm not sure how this is rated as mostly positive in the store. The DLC\
      \ is a huge let down overall. Par for the course from dovefail. \n\nPros:\n\
      - Scenery. The route itself looks pretty good. There are minimal graphic glitches\
      \ (in some locations the water pops below ground spastically). PC performance\
      \ is average.\n- Trains included with the route are based on the prototype.\
      \ ARR has GP38s and SD70MACs. They are represented in the activities.\n- There\
      \ is dispatch audio when the dispatcher is speaking to the player. It's prerecorded\
      \ and applies only to scripted scenarios but I still think it's a nice touch.\
      \ They could definitely use this concept across many other routes.\n\nCons:\n\
      - Sounds. Recycled garbage from many years ago. The Geep sounds like the BN\
      \ GP38-2 from Chicago-Aurora Racetrack DLC. The SD70MAC has the original SD70\
      \ sounds from 2012.\n- Scenarios are limited. Two sessions broken out into four\
      \ and three part series. Typical control freak stop-on-a-dime-as-marked or fail\
      \ the whole scenario. Leaves a lot to be desired for those who understand US,\
      \ and specifically ARR, operations.\n- Route is freight only. Not a single passenger\
      \ car or schedule is even mentioned. The ARR operates an extensive passenger\
      \ schedule. Real opportunity missed by the devs.\n- Signals are the original\
      \ Kuju models introduced to Rail Simulator in 2007. The aspects are generally\
      \ incorrect. The models are dated, look subpar and have errors which haven't\
      \ been fixed in 14 years of development/updates.\n\nThis route needs severe\
      \ amounts of attention and should not have been released in its current state\
      \ (again, typical from dovefail). If you enjoy Alaska Railroad operations or\
      \ want to expand North American content, I highly suggest waiting for a sale\
      \ greater than 60% discounted. The route is not worth more than about $15 as\
      \ it stands today."
