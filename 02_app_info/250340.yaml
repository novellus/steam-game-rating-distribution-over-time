    about_the_game: Blockland is a non-linear sandbox game with no set goals, giving
      players the freedom to design and construct elaborate structures. Styled as
      a tiny minifigure, players build inside of the virtual world using bricks reminiscent
      of toy blocks. These structures can be built in either a single-player or multiplayer
      (either online or through a local area network) setting.

    review: This was the game I played before I found out about Roblox. Back in 2009
      or so, I was a huge fan of Legos, and believe it or not, I still kinda am to
      this day. So I was watching Lego videos and saw one where someone built a Lego
      house which was, in fact, this game before it became Blockland on its own. I
      remember playing the hell out of the demo a while back and honestly, I'm actually
      amazed that it's released on Steam now so I can play it as much as I wish. Of
      course it is kinda dated nowadays, and Brickadia is taking over, but I really
      suggest you getting this game for yourself so you and your friends would have
      one hell of a time with the minigames or just building together with a wide
      variety of bricks. (Psst, it's even better with add-ons :D)
