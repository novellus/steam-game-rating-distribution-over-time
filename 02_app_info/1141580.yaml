    about_the_game: "Taiji is an adventure puzzle-solving game set in a mysterious\
      \ world full of puzzles. Unlike many adventure games, the puzzles in Taiji all\
      \ use a consistent interface:  a grid of tiles which can be toggled on or off.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough this might seem simple, the consistency\
      \ of the interface frees the player from guesswork or pixel hunting that happens\
      \ in many adventure games. It is always clear what the player must interact\
      \ with in order to solve the puzzle, but it is never entirely clear what they\
      \ must do. There are many different areas in the game, each with their own visual\
      \ and mechanical themes. As you explore this dense world, it is important to\
      \ think hard and to pay close attention, as vital clues are sometimes hidden\
      \ in plain sight."
