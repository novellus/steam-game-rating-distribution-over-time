There are tons of classes to master. It could be somewhat better if it focused on turtles with the name Tortoiside or dolphins with the name Porpoiside. Maybe at some point in time there will be an ANThology of several -icide games. Until then, you'll find me online playing!","timestamp_created":1498607086,"timestamp_updated":1498607086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm6389dwCes+/fQ=="}
