The foremost being that you cannot drag and drop items from the shop lists to character sheets, and you cannot duplicate them to your item list either. This means you have to manual create the items in your item list from scratch. \nI assume this is because it is an older module, but LoS has not been added to any of the maps. In the society modules such as \"The Commencement\" the maps have LoS added to them already.\n\nOverall, it will still save a ton of time having everything setup, just be sure to double check before game night as there are ALWAYS some minor annoyances with FG AP modules for Starfinder. They seem to care about 5E working smoothly, and 5E alone.","timestamp_created":1597029230,"timestamp_updated":1597029230,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw24SX6/MCfdLCmgI="}
