    short_description: Doler is a game about being a mouse in a giant spooky maze
      filled with treasure and scary spiders where you search for a big stash of food.
      The maze resets everyday and is the same for all players. You can communicate
      with other players by leaving messages in your droppings! Can you find the goal?

    review: Doler is a maze game that resets every single day. You can read messages
      left from other players or read them on your own. I would suggest playing it
      at the same time as a friend for faster navigating. Or slower if you aim to
      be mean to one another. It's dark but not very scary.
