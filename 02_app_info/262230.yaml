      \ uma hist\xF3ria a la visual novel com Kotetsu e Waka, os dois amigos de Hanabusa,\
      \ que se deparam com o estranho desaparecimento de garotas e espadas pela cidade...\
      \ Sem mencionar um estranho esp\xEDrito que parece ter se interessado pelo que\
      \ Kotetsu anda fazendo da vida...\nTambem existem tr\xEAs historinhas extras\
