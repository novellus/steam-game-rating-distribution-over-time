    about_the_game: Undholm is a dwarfish colony sim inspired by games like Rimworld,
      Banished, and Dwarf Fortress, with an emphasis on playing how you want to play.
      There are many paths to building a successful colony. Build a walled-off mining
      base and dig underground; construct a military camp and raid other colonies
      for supplies; recruit lots of cooks and trade cakes to survive. While this project
      is still in (very) early access, I'd like to add as many ways to succeed as
      possible. The ultimate goal is a game where players feel free to experiment
      with different strategies and adjust their bases to fit the ever-changing world
      around them.

    review: 'For me its a good game and I pray for updates, I havent played it much
      but it has some flaws that are really ticking me off.

      Namely the path finding is pretty useless as even with a stair case or straight
      vertical lader system they just wont go down to do jobs & zones seem useless
      to me. Needs more content & love.'
