I'm sorry that you were disappointed with the game. We are well aware that the game is not for everyone. However, this should not be due to bugs that might be easily fixed. We would be happy if you could provide us with your savegame that causes the crash. We already tweaked some issues in the XML code so that the bug could possibly be fixed with the next release iteration. If you don't have the time or inclination to help us here, we will of course accept that; that would be perfectly okay. If you are willing to help us, the base directory path to local savegame files on your computer should be:\n\nC:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\TankWars Anniversary Edition\n\nIf you don't have any local savegames anymore, we can provide you with a free game key. Again, if you don't have the time or inclination to help us here, that will be totally fine.\n\nThank you very much in advance!\n\nBest regards,\nFlinsch"}],"cursor":"AoJ4z4mVhfQCf+PInAI="}
