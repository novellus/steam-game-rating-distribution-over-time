    review: This is hands down, the best  multiplayer game I have played in years.  It's
      super addictive and works amazingly well with steam link and with lots of controllers.  You
      can play with up to 8... yes 8 of your friends at once in this game and the
      fun literally never stops.   Even after your car dies, you get to continue playing
      by throwing exploding barrels on the remaining players.  While the graphics
      may look simple, the game play is revolutionary and reminds me of when consoles
      used to cater to multiplayer and how much fun that was.  I play with my two
      younger sons and we max out the computer players and have a blast.  Btw, the
      computers are amazing players in themselves and you won't be disappointed if
      you are playing it by yourself.  Great game, so glad this exists. Keep up the
      great work Typical Entertainment... you're amazingly atypical :)
