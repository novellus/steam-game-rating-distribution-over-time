      \  [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[b]Captain Prosper[/b] is a lewd turn-based tactical RPG\
      \ about a smuggler's smugglin' exploits.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nBefore I could\
      \ play the game, it aborted the moment I hit the \"Esc\" key. [i]I hate this.[/i]\
      \ Anywho, let's get into it.\n\nThere are two major parts to this game, visual\
      \ novel-like cutscenes and battle. Each battle is separated by a chapter of\
      \ dialogue, and you may save between chapters or turns (during battle). Battle\
      \ is turnbased, and fought from an overhead view. All units have an attack and\
      \ movement range, and wide variety of skills and stats which affect their capabilites.\
      \ Units gain advantages based on terrain and height. It's in your best interest\
      \ to strategically position troops, rather than charging enemies and spamming\
      \ \"attack\". In addition to terrain and abilities, some units provide \"tactics\"\
      , which offer useful buffs and special attacks for nearby units.\n\nTo be honest,\
      \ the battle is actually pretty fun \u2014 it's the highlight of this title.\
      \ I found battle to be difficult enough where it'll keep you on your toes, but\
      \ not so hard you'll slam the \"Esc\" key faster than you can scream [i]feck.[/i]\n\
      \n[h1]Story[/h1]\nCaptain Prosper is on his way to Suthar. He is joined by Vyla,\
      \ his right-hand navigation woman. They are to deliver smuggled goods to Old\
      \ Man Pierro, a famous chemist known for his \"special\" medicine. Following\
      \ the exchange, Leah barges in with urgent news \u2014 Ispar is overun with\
      \ pirates. Old Man Pierro offers Prosper a healthy sum in exchange for his crew's\
      \ help defeating the Pirates. They encounter and defeat Pyrka, the pirate captain\
      \ whom swears revenge on Prosper.\n\nHuh, I wonder when she'll be back.\n\n\
      The next day Prosper is tasked with smuggling an anonymous woman from the island\
      \ of Archi to Siaru. They set sail, and on their way to Archi they are intercepted\
      \ by Pyrka.\n\nOh hey! She's back!\n\nCaptain Prosper defeats her (again) and\
      \ retrieves his woman. They leave town, [i]and[/i] that's as far as I could\
      \ get for the night.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThe titlescreen is boring \u2014 it\
      \ appears to be a low-resolution photo with a filter slapped over it, though\
      \ the interface was stylistically appropriate. This will be a common theme for\
      \ the remainder of the game. From \"Config\", you may adjust audio and a variety\
      \ of gameplay preferences. I could not see any options for display or resolution.\
      \ Characters are represented by portraits, and they look [b]awful.[/b] They\
      \ look like they were made in MS Paint, and in some cases appear to be \"frankensteined\"\
      \ using multiple images. There is no gallery, which I feel should be a staple\
      \ for any lewd game worth its salt. \n\n[b]- The Goods -[/b]\nSex-scenes are\
      \ rendered via text and one or more static CGs. Despite the shortcomings of\
      \ the artwork, I liked the way the characters were drawn. However, it is in\
      \ my opinion that the CGs are of poor quality, and the text accompanying them\
      \ equally shoddy. I was not a fan of the backdrops used against the characters.\
      \ To my knowledge, CGs cannot be fullscreened. Expect male-on-female intercourse.\n\
      \n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nI recommend this game provided that it is (A) on sale and\
      \ (B) you're willing to look past its glaring flaws. The artwork leaves [b]a\
      \ lot[/b] to be desired, and the story telling was far from riveting. I was\
      \ not a fan of the chapter-by-chapter gameplay, and I would liked something\
      \ more akin to an RPG or point-n'-clicker, where I could explore towns or upgrade\
      \ my crew between battles. This is a flawed, but nonetheless fun game. \n \n\
