    review: "As everyone sees in the democlip - the graphic is not at all fitting\
      \ today\xB4s standards even for a puzzle game. That would be okay, if the gameplay\
      \ was good. But already in the first room the absence of user friendly playability\
      \ makes it hard to get in the game. The music could also be better (to raise\
      \ the athmosphere) but doesn\xB4t get into a symbiosis with the game. \n\nOverall\
      \ the game makes it very hard to feel comfortable. Instead of using the mouse\
      \ for everything (walk, take, use, inventory) like all the other games since\
      \ at least a decade do, it throws you back to a time, when every action had\
      \ it\xB4s own button. So the paste is very slow, actions take much longer and\
      \ this really is an issue for you will have to do try and error a lot because\
      \ not even the normal hints in the game are done very clearly. And for a puzzle\
      \ game, try and error is okay at some point, but not too much cause it feels\
      \ like guessing, rather than working with an idea.\n\nIf you can overlook the\
      \ missing standard comfort functions, you do not need an athmospherical setup\
      \ and it is on sale, you might give it a try -  and maybe if you do not expect\
      \ too much. I was deeply disappointed because of reviews I read and expected\
      \ a lot more.\n"
