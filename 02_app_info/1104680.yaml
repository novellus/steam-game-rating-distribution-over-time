    review: One thing I've always really liked about Atari compilations is that they're
      never shy about including some of the deep cut stuff such as third party games,
      unreleased prototypes, and even fanmade homebrew. This isn't the first time
      Adventure 2 or Combat 2 have been included in a collection but the fact that
      they're considered an important enough part of Atari history to keep re-releasing
      really shows how dedicated Code Mystics and Atari are to actually [i]preserving[/i]
      these titles and there are definitely some I've never seen before. I haven't
      played every game but there are certainly some fun ones here, I find myself
      particularly liking both of the Frog games and Dark Cavern is a lot of fun.
      They even included some games from the much-maligned Atari 5200 and while the
      interface for those is a little odd due to how that system's controller worked
      I'm really glad they're here. I hope that Code Mystics and Atari will continue
      to put out further packages for Atari Vault. I think it's been the best platform
      for these games yet and 50 games for 5 bucks is a steal.
