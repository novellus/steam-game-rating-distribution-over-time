We sort of mashed those two themes together in Felix The Reaper.<br> <br>For the character himself and the world around him, the inspiration was more diverse: We took cues from the ancient TV show <i>The Twilight Zon<\/i>e, medieval painters like <i>Bruegel and Bosch<\/i> and the cartoon characters of <i>Adventure Time<\/i> and <i>Hayao Miyazaki<\/i>.<br> <br>Another important inspiration for Felix The Reaper was the amazing artistic collaborators in the production.

We designed the game in a way that lets the music artists be themselves. We wanted them to add to the game through their personal artistic expression, rather than ask them to be what we want them to be. This made for a varied and strange combination of music. But since the gameplay is a non-stressful puzzler, you actually have time to appreciate and enjoy the weirdness while playing.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Art History<\/h2>The idea for the game itself stems from art history. We actually started with <i>The Danse Macabre<\/i> and <i>Death and The Maiden<\/i> as a basis, and then asked ourselves: How can we make a game about this? Eventually and through several different prototypes, we ended up here. <br> <br>Alongside the production, a history scholar was diving into the art history of Death across more than 10 centuries for a book manuscript he is working on, and every time he hit upon something interesting he told us, and we tried to put it into the game if it fit.
