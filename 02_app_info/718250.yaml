      \ of manipulation, your instinctive reflexes and a dash of ingenuity are key\
      \ to obtaining top spot. Nova Flow\u2019s simple movement system is coupled\
      \ with more complex interactions as you progress. These interactions marry together\
      \ to give the player a rapid and smooth-flowing experience as you traverse a\

      \ test as you attempt to best the rest.<br><br>As you jump, run, and shoot your\
      \ Nova Cannon you'll find additional ways to interact with your surroundings\
