The game is all delivered by a very small group, mostly a single developer as a labour of love and some contracted elements. This does leave some rough edges, but those work well enough.\n\nI have played through multiple variations of the game and systems since its EA release 2 years ago, and my biggest praise has to be towards Nathaniel's (Developer) commitment to his project, fixing things promptly and engaging with the community. \n\nStory wise, the game delivers a plot with the right twists to move the heroines along.\nThe combat system is definitely where the crux of the effort goes into. The player must organise their forces in squads (up to 12 characters) within the elemental leadership and class system. The squad limit depends on the field of the encounter but generally speaking, you get more then enough to overwhelm the enemy early game, while strategic placement and squad composition become extremely important by the second chapter. The game has built in permadeath which brings real consequences to making tactical mistakes or poor compositions. Allowing your lance to be in a position of focused fire can be devastating, especially given that if a sister falls in combat then it is game over. \n\nYou do have the freedom to do a lot of different composition strategies, from making defensive lines to glass canons, or literally bait/fodder. Pretty much every class has various skills and cross class options that can be useful to try out, while the different classes vary in their combat behaviours. \n\nAs with anything, there are flaws that are important to point out. It can be difficult to understand just exactly what happens in a lance to lance combat given that there's no combat log, leaving you wondering just how many reactions or abilities a group might have left. Should you move them? Attack?  \n\nFurthermore, there's limited information on just exactly how various parameters interact for damage calculations. Should you invest more in elemental strength? Or perhaps only weapon parameter? This can leave newer players to the genre frustrating, and makes true optimisation quite difficult. Not for everyone but there's a lot of grind required of not so challenging encounters which gets tedious.  You may also find yourself in a death spiral if you're not too careful about your troops/composition leading to heavy attrition. \n\n\nFinally, there's collision/map issues and bug crashes that are still being hammered out. There is also no undo/movement or direction correction in combat, so a miss click can be very costly/frustrating.\n\nDespite the flaws (which are getting worked through as I revisit the game now and again), if you like indie games, growing your characters, the grind (you need a lot of crowns and materials) then this game might be for you.","timestamp_created":1609129394,"timestamp_updated":1609916051,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw38T27vYCc6L+vQI="}
