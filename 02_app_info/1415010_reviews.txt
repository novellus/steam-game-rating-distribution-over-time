This is built on Unity so there should be no reason you've not compiled a linux version, if you've not specifically leveraged Windows specific functions.\n\nMore about the gameplay:\nThe 3D 4K tack is far to narrow on a 1080P display, which strains to look at it. Using Musynx as an example, the track almost goes the full width of the screen, which makes it easier to follow.\n\nThe UI needs some love and attention. It's not the most sleek of systems, and it feels almost \"cobbled\" together. I'm aware that this is an early access game, so it would make sense that there's still work that needs to be done.\n\nSince I'm using the Steam play option, running it through proton 5.0, I've already had the game lock up exiting a beatmap, and going back to the main screen. It's also slightly clunky, which means it doesn't give the smoothest experience.\n\nWith the game in its current state, I'm going to refrain from recommending it, but I would like to see it improve over time.","timestamp_created":1608852036,"timestamp_updated":1608852036,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwmrvDy/YCdtjzvAI="}
