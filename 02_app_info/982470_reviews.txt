Is this game Great!!! Is this DLC worth the $1.19 (who even came up with $1.19??)\n\nThe answers to your quests are a resounding.\n\nNo\nNo\nNo\nAnd still wonderingâ€¦.\n\nSo why might you ask did I bother donating to a free game? Simple it looks like some guy/kid is going it alone trying to make a game and letting us have a crack at it for free. While the game needs a tone of work to be even half decent it is far better than half the stuff out there listed for $10 bucks.\nSo I donated the $1.19 to see where it goes after all who know maybe this person will make other games in the future that are great. After all we all have to start somewhere.\n","timestamp_created":1551745037,"timestamp_updated":1551745037,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.578397214412689209","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rMbNpekCfJ6nvAE="}
