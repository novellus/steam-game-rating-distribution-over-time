Half the time, I have no idea why the plane falls (or fails without falling.) I've passed over the wall 3 times, barely got any further before the plane dropped for no apparent reason, and each time I had to restart from scratch.\n\nAnd some joker put \"casual\" and \"relaxing\" in the sales tags.\nWorst flying I've ever experienced, at least in a video game.","timestamp_created":1602317973,"timestamp_updated":1602331549,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41OOZifUCfMH8pgI="}
