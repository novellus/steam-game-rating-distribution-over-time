    review: 'If you can''t find the encyclopedia, make sure you have downloaded the
      DLC and then check your game folder. It should be located somewhere like:


      C:\\Programs\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Okhlos\\Okhlos - DLC - Encyclopaedia


      You can then drag out the PDF document onto your desktop.


      Review:

      It is a nice requiem of the magnificent humor of the game and worth the money.
      It is also made in a way so that you could technically print out the pages and
      make little booklets out of it. Since there is no wiki for the game, you can
      also use it to check the heroes which you are missing for the achievements so
      you would know which ones to buy in game. There are some small formatting and
      spelling mistakes, in case you have serious OCD and can''t bare that kind of
      stuff.


      My OCD couldn''t bare the thought of this encyclopedia not having a review oO.
      Also I love the game and the devs.'
