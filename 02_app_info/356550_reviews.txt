To conquer fear is the beginning of wisdom.”— Bertrand Russell[/b]\n\nIt came to the third part of [i]East Tower[/i] series already? Wow, with each new one, the mystery has been kept well-fed, I must say. At this point, we all know the drill, we all know what we will encounter... or do we? This third chapter deviates from the routine a bit, by introducing the unique condition of Kuon's story. He is a bit different from the other participants. For once, he is the youngest, and he may not be declared as the boldest, for good enough reason. He is the cautious one, with some heavy trust issues. Want to find out more? Well, keep reading.\n\nSakuya, our protagonist with a gender complex, arising from a past trauma, participates the demonstration for the newest VR game by posing as a boy – that part doesn’t change since it always serves to be our prologue for the series. She joins the game alongside four other young men and gets partnered up with Kuon this time, a bit unwillingly. He is a cool looking young man with a stone-cold attitude. As he somewhat halfheartedly treads around, we soon realize that he seems distressingly familiar with the content and the rules of this game. May he be the hacker? Or what lies under his uncanny knowledge and control over the game? Spoiler alert: [spoiler]poor guy played this game more times than he would care for![/spoiler]\n\nOur partnership with Kuon is deep layered, and his character may be considered the best written in the game, so far. [spoiler]His narrative is a great example of a well-established psychological coping mechanism. Since he’s been in the game for a long while, compared to everyone else, he grew up in many senses; yet some parts of his psyche remained juvenile and frightful. This dissociation also gets reflected upon his personality. His demeanor instantly changes according to the visage he dons. His character immediately changes, according to his form and the condition – which makes him really hard to communicate with. Kuon's story - however sad and somewhat disturbing - has been a joy to read about. At some point, Sakuya describes him as a wolf under a bunny guise - which is a really fitting depiction. [/spoiler]\n\nChallenges in Kuon's route differ from previous ones again. They are not only psychologically unique to this pairing, yet they also contain a philosophical aspect this time, about the very element of courage and wishful thinking. In terms of artwork or atmosphere, the series are not one of the best examples in the genre as I have noted in my previous reviews, yet I have played the series enough to decide that the narrative and character build don't disappoint at this point. We have 2-3 hours of game time, some achievements and our last set of clues concerning the character of the mystery hacker. Ready for the last part? I know, I am curious - which makes the series a success by its own, in my book. See you for the last chapter in the [i]East Tower[/i] series!\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/11672469/]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","timestamp_created":1566224175,"timestamp_updated":1567191493,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":23,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.7537497878074646","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mI358ewCdePU0AE="}
