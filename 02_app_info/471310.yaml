    review: 'I got this module to cover me for 2.5 hours of game time and it just
      barely managed it.


      Positives: It is pretty loosely designed and very easy to modify to meet your
      needs.


      Negatives: It features a 175 foot pirate ship - that will sail out and engage
      the party''s ship with a crew of 5.  I know it is a fantasy product, but that
      doesn''t mean that I am willing to completely discard reality.
