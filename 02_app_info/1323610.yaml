    about_the_game: "Grit Paintball is a Virtual Reality tournament paintball trainer\
      \ and simulator. Aimed mostly at current paintball players looking to gain an\
      \ edge in the real game, Grit allows players to practice from home.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nGrit uses a mouse, keyboard and monitor for the menu and field building\
      \ parts of the game, and then you enter VR to experience the field you've designed.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nGrit Paintball has an in game layout editor featuring the\
      \ 2019 NXL Paintball bunker set, which can be locally saved and loaded, as well\
      \ as easily shared between players by sending a small text file via email or\
      \ messenger. By utilising VR, a player can gain an edge by being able to 'walk'\
      \ a field layout before a real life event and find blind shots, bounce shots,\
      \ lanes and other areas which could be missed when walking a real field before\
      \ an event. It also allows field owners and tournament operators to walk their\
      \ field design to see whether adjustments need to be made before publishing\
      \ a layout for a real event.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTargets are also included in\
      \ the field editor, allowing players to practice muscle memory for breakouts,\
      \ snap shots and, with a large enough play area, moves from bunker to bunker.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game only requires one VR controller (but will detect\
      \ 2) as it's designed so the player can replicate the feel of swapping their\
      \ gun from hand to hand. It is fully compatible with the Vive Tracker, or using\
      \ a VR controller. Custom hardware is being developed to allow players to utilise\
      \ their own paintball gun with a Vive Tracker so that players can get the most\
      \ immersive and realistic feel possible. Of course, anyone can design their\
      \ own hardware if they have a Vive Tracker!"
