    about_the_game: "Air Conflicts: Secret Wars is an arcade flight simulation set\
      \ in a world war I + II scenario.  During the 7 campaigns the player has to\
      \ fly and fight through 49 missions. Before taking off, the player can choose\
      \ between different aircrafts, each with different strengths and weaknesses.<br>\t\
      \t\t\t\t\tWithin the missions the player gets different objectives like patrolling,\
      \ sneaking, hit &amp; run, bombing and escorting. Objectives are presented as\
      \ dialogues between different characters. After some missions the player can\
      \ upgrade one of his skills in order to maneuver the airplanes easier, have\
      \ more endurance or have your wingman boosted. Further, the player can choose\
      \ between two control schemes. Arcade and simulation. The first one makes the\
