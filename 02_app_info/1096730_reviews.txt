Every single H-scene is just the main character having his way with the knights.  It's just so repetitive.  The story doesn't have any climax in it and it makes no sense.  Why did the other characters assume that the main character is a monster just by looking at him when he is clearly human like the rest of them.  Is it because that he is the only male human in that world?  If so, how were the people in that world able to reproduce before he got sent into that world?  To make matters worse, this VN is also censored and there is no patch for it.  Absolute disappointment.  This is more boring than Nekocharm.","timestamp_created":1609104261,"timestamp_updated":1609104261,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+M+F0/YCeKHxvQI="}
