    about_the_game: '<strong>Blueprint?</strong><br>Fishhead: Blueprint is the fourth
      main game in the Fishhead platformer series. The game picks up where Fishhead
      2 (2002) ended. The clone machine, invented by dr Bau and misused by Highhair
      and Tomatoman to build an army, was badly damaged. Now the blueprint has been
      stolen from dr Bau''s lab! It is up to Fishhead to get it back before things
      get out of hand.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1386190/extras/fhbgif01s.gif?t=1597740506"

      /><br><br><strong>About the game</strong><br>The game is based around a big
      overworld with 50 doors. Most of these doors lead to levels, some to other locations.
      In most levels you have to collect usb-keys to open doors, find switches, collect
      hammers and defeat enemies. Some levels have light puzzles, others have mini
      bosses. The game has around 40 enemies and other dangers.  You can get new moves
      (like wall-jumping and swimming) in labs, opening new parts of the game. In
      some levels you get help from a goose, which somehow stumbled into the game.
      He will fly you to places, or you can ride him when he is too lazy to fly. The
      game features simple but tidy, low-res pixel art graphics and a very limited
      palette. The music and sounds are chiplike. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1386190/extras/fhbgif04s.gif?t=1597740506"

    review: "For what it is, the developer made a faithful retro platformer similar\
      \ to what you would find in the SNES library. On a side note, the FishHead games\
      \ started in 1998 so it's cool to see an indie developer going back 20+ years\
      \ and still making progress, just looking at the games you can see him improving\
      \ so much in terms of visuals and game logic (sorry I know I sound like an obsessive\
      \ fan). The game has 4 worlds that are separated into multiple stages and one\
      \ bonus world, or about 5 hours of content for 100% completion. It also has\
      \ some traditional platforming progression in a form of unlockable power-ups\
      \ such as double-jump, wall-jump and swimming power, although I am not sure\
      \ why the Fish dude could not swim in the first place ;). Oh yea, you can also\
      \ ride a goose sometimes, too bad you can't do that during regular stages like\
      \ a certain dinosaur.\n\nVisually, I thought the pixel art was very enjoyable,\
      \ I like the whole 'Fishman vs Tomatoes' premise. Some would say that every\
      \ great platformer starts with a very unlikely character - you know, plumbers,\
      \ hedgehogs, 7-up mascots, or a worm in a power suit (at least you got the weirdness\
      \ down). The game has good platforming controls, I am particularly happy that\
      \ all the basic moves use the classic inputs like 'up' to grab or just bouncing\
      \ off walls with no extra buttons - you would be surprised how many people ____\
      \ that up. All the compliments aside, I do feel like the game is missing that\
      \ 'secret ingredient', every game that I love in this genre has something special\
      \ about it, some gimmick like hitting blocks with your head, spinning into a\
      \ ball or using your head like a whip. You made a decent game, but it just feels\
      \ like a tribute instead of being FishHead experience. \n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\
      \n+ faithful retro aesthetic and soundtrack\n+ decent length with some bonus\
      \ content\n+ cute characters, riding a goose :)\n+ decent controls, some power-up\
      \ progression\n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\n[u] General Feedback [/u] - the big\
      \ thing that I found kinda clunky was the lack of invincibility frames, you\
      \ have 3 hitpoints but the enemies can get very lucky and hit you 3 times in\
      \ 1 second (usually in the corner or on the belt). The game has some occasional\
      \ problems with hidden death pits, there is no way to look down at the time\
      \ of this review. Additionally, I would like to be able to perform a regular\
      \ jump while on the ladder. Oh and the boss fights were too short, I know you\
      \ just making a simple game, but you can beat some of them in 6 seconds, maybe\
      \ they needed a second phase.\n\n[u] Secret Ingredient [/u] - sometimes I find\
      \ myself attached to a platforming game even without any story, something about\
      \ the level design that makes it memorable. This game, it's kinda like getting\
      \ over obstacles, you not taking full advantage of the player's desire to navigate\
      \ the world, but there are moments where I feel like you had the right idea.\
      \ So I would just say, double-down on exploration, more secrets, hidden characters,\
      \ make the currency more relevant, maybe unlockable fish hats, I don't know,\
      \ just more than just levels that feel like an obstacle. \n\n[b] Overall Thoughts:\
      \ 7/10 [/b]\n\nI think the developer and myself are holding on to the past,\
      \ the developer makes a decent but predictable retro game, then I buy it because\
      \ it reminds me of something that I played as a kid. So where do we go from\
      \ here? Maybe next FishHead game could be a Metroidvania? Whatever it is, I\
      \ just hope that you enjoy what you doing, even if only 3 people play it. \n\
