      Knights</strong> is a puzzle game about wits, chivalry and mud. In the game,
      valiant knights of varying cape lengths assist Ladies and Bishops across mud

      of the Puddle Knights says: <i>a badly designed sanitation system gives ample

      doing most of the heavy lifting in these puddle puzzles!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1180540/extras/SteamGIF_Headhop_v3.gif?t=1606396526"

    review: 'In Puddle Knights, you guide some colourful knights, laying their capes
      across puddles to help the nobility of the land keep their feet dry. The most
      impressive aspect of Puddle Knights, thanks to its creative theme, is how natural
      and intuitive the mechanics feel despite their relative complexity.


      Not only is the base game a great collection of satisfying puzzles but the two
      free expansions kept delivering more quality content. There were only a few
      puzzles that I had to stumble through due to the very large possibility space,
      but the vast majority of them required careful deliberation to find the insightful
      trick. If there are more expansions in the future, I will be playing them for
      sure.'
