This is not a simple reskin of the main character, it quite literally lets you play the entire game as the iconic Shovel Knight. His complete move set along with many of his special MP abilities have been facelifted directly from Shovel Knight in such a proper manner that this actually feels like you are playing SHOVEL KNIGHT 2!!!\n\nTLDR: Blaster Master Zero is worth every penny but for 2 dollars more you can make it Shovel Knight 2.","timestamp_created":1560816367,"timestamp_updated":1560816367,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.73233795166015625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42fb5s+sCeNjPwwE="}
