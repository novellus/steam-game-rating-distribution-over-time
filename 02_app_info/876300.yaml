    review: "It`s quite nice. You search on each map the exit which spawns you to\
      \ the next of the 5 or 6 maps (that I went through). The maps are openworld\
      \ so you can do a bit of exploration besides the actual task to find your home.\
      \ This task is not that difficult:(  I didn`t get lost that often. The hitboxes\
      \ are sometimes bad and the mapdesign somtimes boring. Instead of just a flat\
      \ way there could be way more offroad stuff in your way. The playthrough happened\
      \ in 25 minutes. And i did sometimes have to respawn because i jumped on a high\
      \ obsticle or because of a fence pice which rolled me, when I was speeding over\
      \ it.  So you could do a fast run in maybe 15 minutes or so. The physics are\
      \ good and thanks to the openworld design you have some replayability. But don`t\
      \ expect it to be played regulary. I bought it for 65 cents in a discount. The\
      \ 3 \u20AC are a bit much for this game so I would say: what for a discount\
      \ and then get it."
