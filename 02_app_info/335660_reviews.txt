Where it lacked in an appealing artstyle it made up for story wise. It's a very bleak and dark story that kept me engaged the whole game. A nice change from all the dull and sappy visual novels out there. I highly recommend this game!","timestamp_created":1561818995,"timestamp_updated":1607729273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iruIqvYCeY2sxgE="}
