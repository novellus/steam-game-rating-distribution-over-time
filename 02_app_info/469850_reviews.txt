The only issue I had was that there were not enough floor plans that actually gave a proper sense of distance in key locations. With three four Level Two party members, some of the encounters do need to be tweaked in order to provide a good challenge.\n\nIf you're looking for something small to run that you can use to introduce your group to Fantasy Grounds, this is a good one.","timestamp_created":1478462846,"timestamp_updated":1478462846,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540126264095306396","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww5bQndgCeM75ZA=="}
