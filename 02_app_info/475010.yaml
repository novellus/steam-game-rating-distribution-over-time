      \n\n\n[h1]MY THOUGHTS[/h1]\n[b]General thoughts[/b] A average price of $3.99\
      \ isn't that bad considering How much I love/loved Phantom brave (so seeing\
      \ all the art brings back memories of the olden days), But I'm also Cheap, so\
      \ $3.99 is kinda iffy for me, so personally I'd still recommend at it's $3.99\
      \ price, but I'd DEFINITELY recommend at it's on sale, $1.59 price~\n\n[b]Artbook[/b]\
      \ \n-This artbook was pretty good, but I might be biased because I like the\
      \ characters.\n-Having such info on those main characters adds to its appeal.\n\
      -I loved the Illustrations!~\n-Though the pages showing the world/locations,\
      \ was disappointing, on half a page, they had 9 Locations >.> which even if\
      \ you zoom in 500% to see them, their all blurry, etc...i wish they would have\
      \ given them a page per location at full res >.>"
