    review: 'So this game is really cute!! I know there''s some other management games
      that have a lot of similarities, but this one''s casual, friendly style really
      drew me in. Part of why I decided to give this game a try was someone else''s
      comment on the community being really welcoming, and I can attest that it is
      indeed!!


      The game seems to be actively updated and cared for and I''m absolutely looking
      into getting more of my friends to play soon!'
