There is no pathing, and limited strategic options. \nThat said, the graphics are very cute, the sound effects and music are nice and there seems to be a robust upgrade system, though to date you can never actually use more than four of them. There also seem to be a lot of levels, I think there are twenty levels for the first set of missions, and there appear to be three sets of missions, so it looks like it might be a lot of game.\nOther comments talk about an increase in difficulty around level five? Either this has been addressed or it simply didn't impact me. \nGet it on sale if you like the genre, but you wont be missing much if you give it a pass.","timestamp_created":1609608481,"timestamp_updated":1609608593,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45r+J4vYCfLHlvwI="}
