For an RPG, it definitely goes a step-above to be interesting and unique, compared to 90% of the genre as a whole that is devoid of any substance or creativity. \n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple, with the exception that you can't level up and you can only attack or defend. Unfortunately there's not enough details in the combat to really say it's too advanced, such as seeing if someone is attacking or just using a spell, or even what spell. However, the unique part of the combat comes along when you're able to create jams. You use items to survive, and this makes for a great need of strategy and speed in combat. I did find it to be a little too difficult, however. Might just be me, though. \n\nThe artwork for enemies, as far as I know, is original and it really shows how much detail they put into it. It looks amazing and I love it. A lot of the music I recognised to be royalty free. I point this out because people see this as important, although I don't really care. It was used appropriately and effectively.\n\nThe world building in this game was fantastic. There's a library you visit when you first start the game that has information on the world, its races, stories/myths, etc. and I loved it. You could really tell that a lot of effort and love went into this game. You can see the same level of quality with talking to random NPCs around the starting town. The story itself is a little in the beginning, but it's because it starts out as two adventurers doing boring quests, until something goes wrong, and then it gets a lot better.\n\nI had to call it quits with this game because I encountered a bug that crashed the game and the game is no longer supported or updated, and I'll get to that in a moment. Needless to say, I didn't want to try to start up the game again. I didn't lose any progress but I'd have to be a lot more conscious about saving and I hate having that feelings in games.\n\nUnfortunately, this game isn't supported anymore. From what I could gather, this game was wiped from the face of the earth. Why? I don't think anyone has a specific reason but I saw some comments that implied the creator didn't like the lack of success this game got and decided to remove the website and remove the game from Steam. It's honestly upsetting that this happened because, so far, this game isn't bad, it's just different. I don't understand why this game didn't get a lot of attention, either. I remember, for some reason, this game having quite a few eyes on it but... I guess shit happens.\n\nI'd recommend it, although I obviously have a bad experience with it because it crashed on me.","timestamp_created":1552183509,"timestamp_updated":1552183509,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gJjWsukCcdvbvAE="}
