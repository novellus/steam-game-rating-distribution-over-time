    review: "I like the idea of developers selling (and me buying) a mostly-nonsense\
      \ pseudo-website about their game via Steam. That's why I recommend this \"\
      game\". I don't think this thing can be called a \"point-and-click puzzle game\"\
      . Because the goal flags are too straightforward and easy to get. You won't\
      \ get what you'd expect from a \u0428\u041F. Nevertheless, this pseudo-website\
      \ has some contents. So buy this if you need a detailed guide on how to build\
      \ a \u0428\u041F-like game, the list of \u0428\u041F releases, or a bunch of\
      \ crude 100% Russian comics."
