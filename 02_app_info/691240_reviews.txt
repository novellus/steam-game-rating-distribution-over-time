The graphics are good, with a pretty distinct and unique style. Without spoiling anything in particular, this game can be finished in an hour or 2. That is, \"finished\". This game has layers upon layers of secrets, which you could spend many more hours looking for. While the checkpoints can be tedious at times, it's not a big detractor. The city feels big, and you'll be rewarded for your efforts in the form of achievements. All in all, I give it a 9/10. Well worth the buy.","timestamp_created":1590802840,"timestamp_updated":1590802840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnJ/PsfICe9uNiwI="}
