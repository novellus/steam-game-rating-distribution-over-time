    about_the_game: Sandbox Anything is a creative, but challenging game where you
      must throw around objects in a specific, or random/erratic way to finish game
      levels. There are other game modes including a zombie survival, where you can
      throw around lifeless civilian bodies fighting for their life! This game can
      be both be played in a calm manner, or sped run to see how efficiently you can
      put together working structures. The game also includes a built-in level editor,
      allowing content creators to create interesting levels, or to play around with
      physics! Multiplayer is also another large feature within Sandbox Anything,
      allowing friends or strangers to either work together, or battle it to see who
      can build, and/or destroy better! Slightly competitive, or a great team-building
