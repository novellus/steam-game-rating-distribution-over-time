I think I might have a problem! (Do [i]you[/i] think I have a problem? Feel free to leave your opinion in the comments below; as long as you know that I'm always right, and if you disagree with me you're clearly in the wrong!)\n\n   Actually, nah...if listening to high-quality stuff like this is a \"problem\", then I'm glad to have one. An absolutely fantastic faux-orchestral soundtrack to what I'm told is a genuinely classic game. Boasting 22 tracks, it's also got pretty good bang for your buck. Evidently a no-brainer for die-hard fans of the series, especially on sale. (I could have done without the Lily Allen-isms towards the end, though.)\n\n   Verdict: 9/10.\n\n(PS If you enjoyed this review, feel free to check out my two Curator pages: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/9284586-ReviewsJustfortheHELLofit/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/10868048-Truly-Horrible-Horror-Games/?appid=398210\nCheers!)","timestamp_created":1577547488,"timestamp_updated":1577772969,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563166618347167969","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wp2mre8CdJbk5wE="}
