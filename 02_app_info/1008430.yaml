      \ Missile Command or other arcade games like it and have any sort of access\
      \ to VR, then this is definitely a must buy.  It takes the classic formula and\
      \ ramps it up to 1000.  There are all sorts of new things to worry about besides\
      \ missile leveling your city.  And the graphics look amazing.  This is no triple-A\
      \ title, but it really made me feel like I was fighting for the lives of all\
      \ the little people getting blown up in the buildings any time I messed up.\
      \  There's no plot unfortunately, I think if they add a story mode down the\
      \ road that would be AMAZING.  In the meantime I'll keep working on getting\
      \ to higher and higher difficulty levels.  If there's an end to the madness,\
      \ I doubt I'll get there as I just don't have the skill.  But dang am I having\
      \ fun trying."
