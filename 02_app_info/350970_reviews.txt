Most of the puzzles are easier to figure out, and less frustrating to execute.  The visuals are bright and colorful, and the music is lively, as well.  Another nice bonus is the interesting and heartwarming story told through audio logs, so if you prefer something a bit less abstract, this is it.","timestamp_created":1608705169,"timestamp_updated":1608705169,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45pqTx/YCc9GvvAI="}
