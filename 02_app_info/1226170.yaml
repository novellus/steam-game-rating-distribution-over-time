    about_the_game: 'This is a game I made for my 8-year old who loves games, but
      doesn''t like to practice math. In the game, the damage dealt to enemies is
      a result of calculations. This means that results which are harder to compute
      are more beneficial to the gameplay. I was surprised that he would estimate
      and compute hard ones first, because it meant beating the enemies in style.<h2

    review: "[h1] Math game with addition, subtraction and multiplication with numbers\
      \ between 0 and 99. Can be good for children but for adults it will probably\
      \ be over fast. You judge for yourself if the price is worth it. It has only\
      \ about 4 monster types and you play in a labyrinth with limited attack powers.\
      \ \n\nStill, I appreciate a game about math education making it's way to Steam\
      \ and I hope the developer can make something more complex in the future.\n\
      Recommendation for future development: instead of the labyrinth we could have\
      \ winning streaks and if you are good, the calculations can become harder, otherwise\
      \ they can become easier, after the 2 digits mark. [/h1]"
