I'm a bass player, and the tab seems accurate to me. Its not quite as demanding as some of the bands other songs, and so it can be an excellent choice for those of us still learning the instrument. \n\nOne thing worth mentioning is that Mastodon downtune to Drop-C. That may cause you some difficulties if your instrument is not set up for going that low. Be especially cautious if you're playing guitar on an instrument with some form of trem-system.","timestamp_created":1480861078,"timestamp_updated":1480861257,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.602717339992523193","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40rGN5dgCdY/Caw=="}
