    about_the_game: <strong><i>KIN is a colourful indie platformer, that will awe
      you with its beautiful otherworldly landscapes and surprise you with its challenging
      boss fights.</i></strong> <br><br>Lively colours, intuitive gameplay and interesting
      level design set the tone for KIN, in which the player moves through the world
      as a mysterious, tiny girl with a full head of hair clad in a bright dress.
      Defeating enemies and solving puzzles, she leaps from platform to platform,
      travelling through different landscapes.<br><br>The game holds an abstract aesthetic
      that has become characteristic for House of Secrets, the studio behind KIN,
      through their earlier VR experiences such as APEX and Surge.<br><br><i>KIN supports
      both the original VR mode from when it was first launched, as well a new camera
      mode and input system that allows the game to be played as a traditional non
      VR platformer.</i>

    review: 'excellent game in VR. wish there were more platform games in this style/the
      style of Moss. Cannot praise the game enough apart from the fact it is short.

      I would wait for it to go on sale then it is worth it.'
