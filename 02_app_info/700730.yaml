    developer_response: 'Thanks very much for your detailed review of my game, Dungeoneer.  I
      found it covered the game in good light while highlighting some of its pitfalls,
      but it does sound like you are enjoying it.  I''d be interested to know where
      you got killed though I have an idea since it was on level one.  I hope you
      enjoy the rest of the game and find the later levels more challenging and engaging.

    review: 'I bought this because I like medieval-themed RPGs and adventure games.
      I also like to pick up quirky indie games, and I really wasn''t sure what the
      heck kind of game this was from the description.


      It''s a sort of poor-man''s non-twitchy Dragon''s Lair. You''re a lone adventurer
      exploring the dungeon of a mysterious castle inhabited by some evil entity named
      Darkcore. Everything is first person PoV. The camera movement is pre-rendered,
      so when you step into a scene, it pans around a bit as if you''re looking around.
      You then have a contextual cursor to look at and manipulate objects, and when
      you''re ready to have the camera move you to the next scene, you click when
      your cursor is a directional arrow.


      You have one heal spell at the start, and it''s single-cast. You can find more
      spells in the dungeon that solve certain puzzles. It''s possible to cast a spell
      at the wrong time, thus ending your ability to progress and forcing you back
      to a previous save. You can also find inventory items that solve puzzles. Like
      your spells, you have a limited inventory and can''t always go back if you make
      a mistake and take the wrong item, again forcing you to a previous save.


      I''ve died once so far to an insta-death mechanic, and I don''t think there
      was a clue showing me that choice A led to death, and choice B to success. However,
      like Dragon''s Lair, now I know which choice to make at that point.


      Since your only saves are auto-saves at the start of a level, this can mean
      having to re-watch many pre-rendered scenes. However, your space bar immediately
      terminates the current scene, allowing you to get back to where you were fairly
      quickly.


      The graphics are primitive as can be seen in the promo shots, and the dungeon
      is a bit silly and inconsistent thematically -- I found a dead [spoiler]ninja[/spoiler]
      and a dead [spoiler]amazon[/spoiler] inside, for example, and Darkcore is a
      villain straight out of a Saturday-morning cartoon (these criticisms could be
      made about many old-school RPGs, however). Still, the game does a pretty good
      job of giving a sense of place. The music is decent, if a bit melodramatic.
      I get the sense there''s a fair bit of content here; I''m 45 minutes in and
      still on the first of what are promised to be multiple dungeon levels. There
      will be little to no replay value, however.


      I think I got my $2.50 worth.'
