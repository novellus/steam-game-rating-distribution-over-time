    review: 'This isn''t the worst Choice of Games/Hosted Games game, but its easily
      one of the most disapointing. It has a great premise, but doesn''t do anything
      with it. For starters, the Yeti (which the game is named after) is barely in
      the game. That''s not a problem per se, but it does go to show how misleading
      the entire thing is. Characters and plot points come and go at break neck speeds,
      the overall plot is pretty incoherent as you travel all across Earth and the
      galaxy at the drop of a hat following unrelated plot threads, your choices don''t
      seem to make much of a difference, there''s a forced romance that''s uninteresting,
      your stats and money are completely useless as far as I can tell, and the ending
      is unbelievably rushed.


      Worst of all, the game is almost condescending in how it reacts to your choices.
      It pats you on the head, literally speaks to you-the player-and says you made
      a good choice. You''ll be given a new clearance level every five seconds (which,
      again, does nothing) and even at the end my boss went out of her way to tell
      me I was their best agent, even though I had failed at almost every step of
      the way.


      With such an interesting premise, I was hoping for a lot more, but unfortunately,
      this game wastes it.'
