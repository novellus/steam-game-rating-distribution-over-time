But this third book was a pain to play through. There were moments of good chapters, but overall, I was left confused and bored from the new sleuthing play style. The thing that bothered me the most however, was the randomness I felt that came from the choices that would rapidly decrease attunement. Half way through the book I resigned myself to this unforgiving mechanism that was punishing to play through. I forced myself to to make uncertain choices for the sole purpose of finding how the plot moves forward in book 4. Disappointing to say the least.","timestamp_created":1607870583,"timestamp_updated":1607870583,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jcKjrvYCdN/suQI="}
