How about the look of inexplicable water spots in your vision when  coming out of the water? How about carrying a weapon(staff), when stowed that looks like you have like two feet of a wood stick pointing out of your midsection?\nI was willing to give this a shot, knowing it's early access and has a long way to go. It's too early for early access. Visually, this reminds me a lot more of Morrowind than Skyrim, but there isn't really a comparison to either, it's too far behind both. This is in a stage that should only be used for internal testing. I didn't play nearly long enough to see any major bugs, just bad graphics, unbalanced environmental sounds, bad implementation of controls(stuck in third person for no reason until an npc comes to you, then forced to first person?), inexplicable swimming (can't keep your head above water?), ability to see better through water when you aren't in it than when you are, awful character customization, and weird collision with objects that you aren't next to, and apparently can't be any closer to. Maybe come back in a year or two.","timestamp_created":1609328226,"timestamp_updated":1609328226,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw7f3b2fYCdILgvgI="}
