    review: This is one of the best football games out there.  I by luck found it
      on steam. It never was a big seller because it was marketed as (Canadian football)  However  one
      little click in a check box after loading turns it  into American rules. I think
      had they given  it a name like "Ultimate Football" it would and still can be
      a big seller. And then it may be that I just like Canada.
