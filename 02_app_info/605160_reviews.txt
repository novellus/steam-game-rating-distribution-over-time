Today I gave it a try and... ooh boi.\n\nWhere do I begin? How about the sound design, it's completely borked. Sounds are horribly unbalanced, with the first level having constant loud 'Pew Pew' sounds. \nThe touted voice acting is a joke, just a couple of muffled voices speaking in broken english. Guys. There's a site called 'Fiverr', you can get cheap professional sounding voice actors from there for cheap.\n|Controls\nThe Controls cannot be rebound to other keys. To turn on the flashlight you press 'T'. Not 'F'. T!? Who the fuck thinks to use T for a flashlight, this is a simple convention that was established in Half Life over 20 years ago, how do you mess that up? And what's the point of having an optional flashlight? Everything is fuccin dark, why not just have it on by default? Or properly light your levels, that would help!\nWhat F [i]does[/i] do is swap weapons you can pick up. But it doesn't do it automatically, no! You have to hold F and walk into the weapon, an half the time it didn't bloody work anyway.\nPlayer moves slow and it feels like you're battling the heavy physics of the character, you feel like you're battling the game for control of that character and that ain't fun.\n|Interface\nThe ammo counter for some guns never count down to zero. Sometimes the game will tell me theres a bullet in the magazine yet never fire. \nActually, when I booted this up for the first time, my cursor was out of sync with the menu, so I had to click to the right of a button to use it. A reset actually fixed this, but it was a dire first impression.\n|Experience\nMost of the weapons feel the same. The aforementioned poor sound design makes nothing stand out. The only weapons worth a damn are the rapid fire weapons.\nWhen you reset a level, your weapons get swapped out for no reason, have fun messing around trying to figure out what your current inventory does.\nThe enemies are all abstract cube shapes but they do nothing other than waddle around while you shoot them\nSometimes the frame rate drops for no reason, it's really distracting.\n|Level Design\nIt's all corridors. It's sooooo dull. When I saw the trailer to this I thought it would be like an arena shooter, but nope. Just walking around trying to figure out where to go while nondescript enemies shoot at you.\n\n|Verdict\nIt's bad, buy something else","timestamp_created":1556746284,"timestamp_updated":1556746284,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvuXTuuoCePuqwAE="}
