      \ wait your turn and plan your timing, in order to strike or parry at the very\
      \ best moment. <br>The game leans heavily on action, but when the combats are\
      \ so perilous and gritty you'll often find yourself in what feels like a stand-off.\
      \ Either battling monsters or common warriors, you will be eagerly waiting for\

    review: I was looking forward to try this.. project, so to say. However, the modern
      GPU, I have and windows 10 were not in the same mood. After the introduction
      video, which was ok, i guess, game crashed to me, and few times more when trying
      to relaunch it.
