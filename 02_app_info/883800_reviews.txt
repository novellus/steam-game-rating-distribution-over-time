These have quickly become some of my favorite songs to play and add some extra variety. There is a mix between faster, more upbeat songs (Supersonic, Ray of Illuminati, Dance Macabre, Heart of the Witch), and some slower ones (Miles, Sin, Proposed Flower Wolf 1), and some in-between ones (Brand new days, Proposed Flower Wolf 2, The Clear Blue Sky).\n\nThe songs are pretty well polished (aside from one error on first note of Dance Macabre) and I haven't needed to adjust my note timing when I play them.\n\nPlease keep adding more songs; I'll keep buying!","timestamp_created":1547187619,"timestamp_updated":1547187619,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y7DknegCeoOGuAE="}
