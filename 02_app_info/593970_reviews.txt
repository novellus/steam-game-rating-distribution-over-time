It is good to see that it came through. Since then there is a huge improvement in graphics which was the primary concern back then. It is certain that the developers had considered the feedback that is given there.\n\nModels of the ships and the water reflection is stunning. Most VR games do not use water like that so that's a first for me.\nAnimations are also nice but I wished that ships kept burning after sinking (the parts above the water at least).\n\nThere is need for improvement nonetheless. Terrain looks a little dull and empty but I personally don't care then again some people might.\nAlso I cannot wait to see the multiplayer of this. There is a comment on moving the board around and I totally agree. The area in which you play must be movable somehow. Timing between the turns may be a little shorter but it is a minor thing.\n\nAs a battleship enthusiast I played VR Battle Grid as well but I can tell you that this one is way better considering the graphics, interaction with the ships and implementation. That's why I cannot understand people who didn't try the game but say that it is a cheap copy. To those people I wanna say try it out first. It is a good game and obviously a lot of thought and effort was put into the game. \n\nI specifically liked how you can place your ships as you wish unlike the random case in VR Battle Grid. I believe anyone who likes to play battleship knows that you shouldn't know which ship or which part of the ship you hit. That is where the logic and the fun of the game is. This game implements these aspects as well.\n\nPeople may not like the battleship game itself but as far as the implementation and the effort goes this game does a good job. I will try and update my review in case of an update.\n\nSo first play the game fellas. It definitely worths the price. Highly recommended.\n","timestamp_created":1489795841,"timestamp_updated":1489795841,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526494741439819336","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vo+w79oCd8rTdA=="}
