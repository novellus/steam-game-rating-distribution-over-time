    review: 'It is a very good game until around level 50 at which point you''ll really
      need to use consumables. The invisible enemies that start spawning around level
      50 are ridiculous. They come at you from all sides and you can''t see them or
      their bars and they make the whole game quite absurd. The consumables do not
      cost real money, but you will have to spend a lot of time farming them in order
      to progress thru the levels...... It is a cheap game and the first 50 levels
      are worth 3 bucks.....but the post 50 levels are awful and not worth playing
      at all........If you love this sorta thing and you have already crushed OFDP
      1 & 2 and Fatal Fury buy it on sale for the first 50 levels...

      I do feel like I got my 3 bucks worth out of the first 50 levels, but......I
      just can''t recommend this one.'
