      class="bb_tag"><strong>About Weird and Wry</strong></h2>Based in Barcelona,
      Weird and Wry is a game development studio founded in 2014 by two brothers:
      Carlos and Max Carrasco. Together, Carlos (programmer) and Max (artist) share
      a taste for sims and classic gameplay -- which is easy to see in <i>The Spatials</i>,
      their first project. Inspired by the great classic sim games of the ''90s, <i>The
      Spatials</i> combines classic base-building gameplay (based on isometric tile
      room building) with a real-time combat system and an exploration campaign. After
      publishing version 1.0 in mid 2014, Carlos and Max saw the potential of their
      idea and developed a much improved second version with Early Access starting
      in August 2014.  In October 2014, the game was approved for release on Steam.
      In 2015, <i>The Spatials</i> continued to grow in popularity -- featured in
      Let''s Plays from YouTubers and articles in major sites such as <i>Rock Paper
      Shotgun</i>.'
