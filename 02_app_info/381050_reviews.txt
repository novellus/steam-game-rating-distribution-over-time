Our heroine takes a boat to a family owned island to meet up with some old bad blood relatives and get the skinny on a possible will reading.  You get to the house and find it ransacked and are soon attacked by a maniac and find yourself on the run from hooded cultists.  \n\nThe story in Ritual on Weylyn Island is certainly in theory a high-point and has the makings of a snubnosed horror experience but it drops the ball more than a wide receiver who decided to play the Super Bowl after taking a fistful of morphine.  It's more of the same; short playtime, read this/read that, get lost in environments that are pretty drab and run around like you need to hit the nearest Weylyn Island outhouse or else.  \n\nMost of your time will be spent jogging down linear wooded paths trying to find the next checkpoint or significant landmark from which you can progress.  Going anyway but the right way will have a hooded cultist in your face bumping up against you like some kind of irritated cat that wants you to get off the couch.  Their appearance and what they say is kind of tense at first until you realize that as long as you run the other way they have about zero chance of catching you.  They act like ushers telling you to get back in your seat...or to stop being so damn curious and go the right friggen direction before they really get upset!  It wouldn't be so bad if there was at least some hiding mechanics or interesting environments to traverse but there absolutely is not.\n\nYou're going to have a tough time being challenged much or really fear dying in this game.  Hell, even the collectibles are all laid out like road signs that are more or less telling you to go the right way you damn fool.  The grainy graphics actually gives off a certain charm (well, one that you can imagine if the locations weren't so dull) and the sound design (complete with voice-acting, a very cool touch) gets the job done but this is the most safe horror game with threats ever.  \n\nThere are some tenser moments when a house you're trying to hole up in gets busted into to by these Grim Reapers in training as well as my favorite segment which requires you wheeling yourself in a cart across a zip line as the S.O.B. squad tries to stop it from happening.  These moments hint at what Weylyn COULD have been if it had more budget and time behind it but sadly it didn't...  I died once and was actually mad at myself for it because I just simply didn't understand what I was doing in that house \"defense\" segment.\n\nOn top of everything else you can complete the game in under an hour and a half without a walkthrough.  The ending is actually fairly well-done for such a low budget entry but it needed way more build-up to truly have an effect.  This isn't the worst horror game I've played.  Oh no, no, no, I've played some real trash and Weylyn is fortunately cheap even without a sale but it would definitely be on my lower tier, \"you've played most everything else in the genre\" list without even a second thought coming to mind.  I don't regret anything in my life yet if someone asked me if I'd have rather sat and stared at a wall in the time it took me to complete The Ritual on Weylyn Island...well, I might have hesitated to give my answer.","timestamp_created":1608969051,"timestamp_updated":1608969051,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4t+uBz/YCf86nvQI="}
