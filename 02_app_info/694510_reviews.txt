The developers have done a great job especially with such a small team. \n\nThe only real downside is that the enemy diversity is a bit lacking, but I can't really harp on that when everything else is so damn fun. Toppling a bridge out from underneath an army NEVER gets old.\n\nI really want to see this game succeed. I think it does a lot of things right, and it has so much potential, especially since the devs seem very actively listening and acting on feedback.\n","timestamp_created":1546284081,"timestamp_updated":1546284081,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.569420039653778076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49tPtgugCeaOLtwE="}
