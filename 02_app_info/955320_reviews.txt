However, the puzzles are well.. pretty quick to throw together and using the guide for the game, the puzzles can be completed quickly by throwing all the pieces on top of each other for the 192 piece segments, the pieces you pick up will be in left to right order starting from the top making the game very easy.\n\nIf you want a cheap and relaxing jigsaw puzzle game with increasing difficulty and time consumption, not a bad deal at full price or on sale.","timestamp_created":1610035032,"timestamp_updated":1610035032,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/J3k7vYCf/2mwQI="}
