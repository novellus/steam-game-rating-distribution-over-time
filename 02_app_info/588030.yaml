      /><h2 class="bb_tag">What makes Derail Valley different?</h2><br><br>You can
      feel the physics. Walk without restrictions, in and out of locomotives, changing
      them as you see fit. Couple and uncouple trains as you complete your deliveries.
      Choose new deliveries freely. Take many at once if you will. Service your trains
      after derailing. Do this all spontaneously, and at any point you can save and
      continue later.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/588030/extras/world_600.jpg?t=1590019964"

      Valley fully supports playing on a regular PC, using mouse and keyboard on a
      flat screen, but virtual reality is where it really shines. In VR you can, for
      the first time ever, truly be inside train cabs and operate controls with your
      own hands. Derail Valley supports all major PC VR headsets.

    review: "Latest edit January 4th 2021\nSome of the issues below have been solved.\n\
      Hats off to the devs for improving.\nThe tutorial now has info on the service\
      \ stations, which i could not find before.\nIt also shows on how to read the\
      \ station map, so i have a lot less trouble finding my destinations.\n\n\n\n\
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
      I realise this game is not officially out yet, so i will keep certain things\
      \ in mind.\nI've change my recommendation to yes in the meantime.\n\n\nPro:\n\
      My son loves playing this game with me so there is a big plus.\nWe play this\
      \ game on traditional settings, no VR here.\nThe controls work quite well, sound\
      \ is also nice.\nTrack layouts are interesting, as well as the routes and locations.\n\
      Immersion is there.\nIt's nice to have a goal in this game.\n\n\nCon:\nI have\
      \ a lot of trouble finding my destination platform. There is a station map,\
      \ but i have not found a map indicating where this actual platform is.\nThe\
      \ world map is very very unclear to me, zooming in does not reveal more details\
      \ on destinations. \nThe harbor is such a destination, i often have to walk\
      \ around for minutes on end to see where i need to be. This costs valuable time\
      \ which can cost you ingame money.\n\nThe game's stuttering has decreased after\
      \ latest updates. Graphics are also improving.\nIt is visible that people are\
      \ working on it and it is positive in my opinion."
