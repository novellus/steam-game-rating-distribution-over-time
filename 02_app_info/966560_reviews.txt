The game is one big tedious room after another looking for trinkets that don't progress the story at all. Eventually, I stopped caring at all about finding any of the loot and just tried to finish the story as fast as possible. I would not recommend this game at all it pretty much sucks.","timestamp_created":1604439153,"timestamp_updated":1604439153,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ltOByPUCdKCQrAI="}
