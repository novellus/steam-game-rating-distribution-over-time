    review: 'It''s a fun game, it has a nice story, and it is well made, but the fact
      that spikes kill you instantly for no reason completely ruins the experience.
      Feels like they should have had two versions of spike because instant death
      is really out of place in some puzzles.


      The real reason for the fact I don''t recommend the game however is the price
      to playtime ratio. It''s about twelve hours if you do all the content. You could
      double that if you aim for perfection with the Boss Rush mode or try your hand
      at community content, but even then, that just puts you slightly above a one
      to one ration with the $20 price tag. I got the game on a 50% discount, so if
      you are interested, get it during a sale.'
