Good for people at an Intermediate skill level. Not recommended for Beginner bassists.\n\nI Want To Break Free - Bass\nA very simple song, not too much fun to play but everyone has different tastes. Can be quite easy, meant to be played with a pick (Apparently) but it can be easily played with your thumb and fingers if you can do that Overall, good for Beginner-Intermediate bassists.\n\nSomebody to Love - Bass\nVery interesting bassline and once you hear it you'll most likely want to keep hearing it. Good for intermediate level bassists, probably not good for Beginners, but you can still try, it might be easy for you.\n\nOverall, great pack. Very weirdly so soon after the 2nd one, too. Worth the price.","timestamp_created":1549221906,"timestamp_updated":1549221906,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.586942493915557861","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5ci02ugCeLT3uQE="}
