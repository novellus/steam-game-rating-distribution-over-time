I had high hopes concerning this locomotive and I'm glad to say that it did turn out to be great! It's very detailed, the weathering is very nice, the amount of services is quite large. It takes some time to master driving it, there's quite a bit of complexity inside the cab and the throttle and brake systems are not as easy as in other german locos I drove in this game.\n\nI think the only thing I'd kinda wish for to appear in addition to this DLC would be services for other german routes than Ruhr Sieg Nord and an old-school version of the loco.","timestamp_created":1609894788,"timestamp_updated":1609894788,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwup/N6vYCdZ7vwAI="}
