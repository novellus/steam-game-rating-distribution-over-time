I love the immersion it achieves. Great to include a game mode that emulates the original, although, personally, I have discovered that I like the other mode better, because it is faster. Simple graphics, reminiscent of the original game. I wonder what the game would look like with better graphics, more elaborate trees and landscapes (this is a suggestion for you, dev). The gameplay, anyway, is great. Makes you want to move one more level forward.\nPlayed with Oculus Quest via Link and Virtual Desktop. Runs flawless in both ways.\nI really like this game.","timestamp_created":1597278787,"timestamp_updated":1597278787,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ424LP8vMCc7ONmwI="}
