The games are incredibly fun, due in part to the simplicity and playfulness. I would probably play this game for hours if it didn't have so many bugs. If this game worked it would be worth much more than the $3 they are asking, but at present it is worth nothing because you can't play it long enough to get anywhere or do anything without reloading constantly. I hope this game gets fixed! I want to drive to my hometown.","timestamp_created":1607044611,"timestamp_updated":1607044611,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u9fUlfYCep+QtwI="}
