I was not able to play on multiplayer, no servers available.  I did play on singleplayer.  There is crafting, building, finding loot that spawns and wildlife.  It has survival aspects of needing food, water and stamina.  I found the food bar drops very quickly.  I would have liked more interactable structures such as being able to climb the ladder to the watchtower, build a water well, etc.  The character is not customizable, but has a nice design.  I was unable to rotate the building structures except by walking around and placing.  Hoping they continue working on this EA game, it has a nice design.","timestamp_created":1603349326,"timestamp_updated":1603349326,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540567457675933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1603368845,"developer_response":"Hi, thax for the review, there is servers running 24 hours, you just need to refresh 2 times for the server list to come up, there are 2 Official servers EU.
