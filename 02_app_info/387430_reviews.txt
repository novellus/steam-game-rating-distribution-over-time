Has a very boardgame-like feeling, as buildings/projects/cures are set like \"cards\" over the \"tile\" they improve; and with all the advantages of the computer making all the myriad calculations for you. Random territories ensure high replay value, despite the limited set of challenges, as not only them are drawn at random, but also previous beneficial buildings and projects, unrelated to the challenge. That affects the way you must min/max (min/maxing is too a key aspect of After the Empire, which happens in the far future of the civilization used as background for The Viceroy).\n\nAdd to that a very rich setting, a decadent eons-old great Empire and several factions trying to get the most of the disasters or rebuild a crumbling society. In fact, golden material for a scifi pen-and-paper RPG campaign.\n\nAnd beware, this is no military strategy game... combat is rather simple, although ship designing is not that unconsquential; careful watch of how the Rebellion crafts theirs, and counter them, can make a difference.\n\nIt has a disappointing aspect, and is the lack of modding capabilities.","timestamp_created":1566420569,"timestamp_updated":1566420581,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539835214614868164","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qKf82uwCeobo0AE="}
