    review: In Wargame the online community are mostly (although not everyone of course
      (but must be 75%)) an aggregate of some really nasty people. I cannot recommend
      the game therefore because multiplayer is the best aspect and yet the games
      are always full of a lot of arrogant, argumentative, rude, aggressive and hostile
      people (nasty pieces of work sums it up). For this reason you can barely ever
      just enjoy a game without some sub-human racist trying to pick a fight over
      every aspect of the game or some egoist blowing his own trumpet so hard it makes
      you want to vomit with disgust. People sprouting pathetic insults everywhere,
      complaining constantly and sometimes even team killing your units to be antagonistic.
      If you can find enjoyment beyond this fact the actual game is pretty awesome.
      I however have decided to uninstall the game to avoid this perpetual abuse.
