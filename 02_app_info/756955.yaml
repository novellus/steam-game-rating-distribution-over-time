    review: 'Insufficient pay 2 win happening in this pack.  It seems like the best
      bang for the buck, but it''s not right now.


      Arkhan is next to useless as the most expensive hero in-game.  Jamilah is outshined
      by Strix, which you probably won''t be able to earn in game for a while until
      the Strix event runs again.  The other champions are alright as buff heroes.


      The devs have hinted in Q&A''s that a hero rebalance is coming, with specifically
      a "Make Arkhan Great Again" focus.  But that could take some time.  When that
      happens, I will probably recommend this pack.  But it seems like the ''meta''
      in the game right now is abuse seasonal champs and their overtuned power creep
      abilities, which means players who have started late are sub-par for now.'
