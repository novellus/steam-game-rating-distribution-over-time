That's basically it but there are no achievements or unlockables so it's pointless. For example I suck at this kind of thing so I gave up then deliberately mistimed the buttons to get my score to 0 and it didn't make any difference so there's no challenge and no reason to actually do anything. There's also other modes unlocked in which you can just watch one of the girls dance and rotate a camera around her for pervy purposes. Boring game.","timestamp_created":1609431599,"timestamp_updated":1609431599,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+ajm3PYCc7aSvwI="}
