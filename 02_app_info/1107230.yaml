    about_the_game: "The 13th Doll is a game created by and for fans of The 7th Guest\
      \ series! It began as an all volunteer, freeware passion project, but evolved\
      \ into a fully licensed game.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the 7th Guest, evil toymaker\
      \ Henry Stauf built a mansion, and invited 6 guests. A 7th Guest, Tad, snuck\
      \ in and was trapped there, afflicted by mystifying spirits, dolls and the ghosts\
      \ of the other guests - until he defeated Stauf.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe 13th\
      \ Doll ties in with the events of The 7th Guest. A decade after Tad managed\
      \ to escape the mansion, he is still haunted by the souls, dolls, and Stauf's\
      \ victims he left behind. So haunted, in fact, that the young man now resides\
      \ in a mental institution - misunderstood, plagued by guilt and obsessed with\
      \ one idea: to escape the dreary padded walls of his asylum cell, return to\
      \ the mansion - the site of his innermost fears - to rescue those he left behind\
      \ and defeat Stauf once and for all!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSoon, a new doctor by\
      \ the name of Richmond arrives in the asylum. Na\xEFve to the legacy of Henry\
      \ Stauf, and equally bewildered and intrigued by the fantastic legend, the staunch\
      \ rationalist plans to take Tad on a cathartic trip back to the mansion.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThis unconventional therapy attempt rapidly turns into a fateful\
      \ journey, unravelling Tad and Richmond's contrasting worldviews and leading\
      \ the unlikely duo straight into a horrifying vortex of lies, illusions, lunacy\
      \ and death. And soon a blood-curdling question arises: Have the two visitors\
      \ really made their way to Stauf's harrowing home on their own accord or are\
      \ they mere pawns in a much grander, inescapable scheme?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      While playing The 13th Doll, a lot of time will be spent navigating through\
      \ gloomy sites, concealed rooms and maze areas from an immersive first person\
      \ perspective. Thanks to the game being developed in Unity3d, this becomes an\
      \ advanced and engaging experience, as the engine allows free movement and a\
      \ fully accessible environment in detailed high-definition visuals. For the\
      \ first time, players will be able to explore every inch of Stauf's residence\
      \ and face all its eerie inhabitants up close and personal. A plethora of interactive,\
      \ delightfully animated objects will bring even the most desolate locations\
      \ to life.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLogic puzzles were an integral part of The 7th\
      \ Guest's gameplay, and The 13th Doll follows suit. We've designed 26 original\
      \ brain-teasers, all varying in style and offering a wide array of intellectual\
      \ challenges. These diabolical creations are found throughout the game - whether\
      \ it be card tricks, pathfinding and chess challenges, or even artificial intelligence\
      \ puzzles versus Henry Stauf himself!."
