    about_the_game: '<h2 class="bb_tag">Tank Wars: Anniversary Edition</h2><br><strong>Do
      you like classic game concepts? Do you like old school, pixelated, low-resolution
      2D computer graphics? Do you like pixels?<br><br>We do. We like pixels a lot.
      We <i>love</i> pixels. And we love classic game concepts, especially this one.</strong><br><br>In
      <i>Tank Wars: Anniversary Edition</i>, a player has to control a (stationary)
      artillery tank in order to take down opponents with ballistic shots from a selection
      of different weapons. <i>Tank Wars: Anniversary Edition</i> supports three different
      game modes:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Classic (turn-based)</strong>:
      In classic mode (or turn-based mode), the players perform their shots successively,
      one after another, until only one tank (or only one team) is still alive. While
      one player performs his or her shot, the other players have to wait until it''s
      their individual turn.<br></li><li><strong>Simultaneous</strong>: In simultaneous
      mode, the players make their settings for their next shot simultaneously. After
      all players have confirmed their individual firing settings, all tanks fire
      their weapons at the same time. The procedure repeats until only one tank (or
      only one team) is still alive.<br></li><li><strong>Real-time</strong>: In real-time
      mode, all players may fire at their own will and at any time, provided that
      they don''t already/still have a projectile flying around. This massacre lasts
      until only one tank (or only one team) is still alive.</li></ul><br><i>Tank
      Wars: Anniversary Edition</i> is currently in early access and only supports
      single-player and local multiplayer matches (&quot;hotseat&quot;). The networked
      multiplayer modes (LAN and Internet) are currently under development. Hotseat
      matches only support classic (turn-based) game mode; simultaneous mode and real-time
      mode are only available in single-player matches (and will be available in networked
      multiplayer matches as well).<br><br>However, <i>Tank Wars: Anniversary Edition</i>
      is still best played as a hotseat match on a Saturday evening with some friends.<br><br><i>Tank
      Wars: Anniversary Edition</i> is a remake of an adaptation of a number of artillery
      games from the 80''s and 90''s. We don''t know who is or was the actual pioneer
      of this game concept back then, so we cannot give credit to a single specific
      person or company. Regarding name and gameplay of <i>Tank Wars: Anniversary
      Edition</i> we want to mention Kenneth Morse at least. Anyway, many games, clones,
      adaptations, and remakes following this basic concept have been made through
      the years. Some newer games have a lot of different game settings, modes, and
      other features as well as modern graphics and effects. However, <i>Tank Wars:
      Anniversary Edition</i>, as a remake of an adaptation from the year 1997, deliberately
      distances itself from fancy newfangled developments. Nevertheless, we don''t
      want to bore you or hurt your eyes and ears more than necessary, so we tried
      to walk a tightrope between pure old school, pixelated, low-resolution 2D computer
      graphics and some modern-ish concepts and effects.'

    developer_response: 'Dear billybob,


      Thank you very much for your review. I''m sorry that you were disappointed with
      the game. We are well aware that the game is not for everyone. However, this
      should not be due to bugs that might be easily fixed. We would be happy if you
      could provide us with your savegame that causes the crash. We already tweaked
      some issues in the XML code so that the bug could possibly be fixed with the
      next release iteration. If you don''t have the time or inclination to help us
      here, we will of course accept that; that would be perfectly okay. If you are
      willing to help us, the base directory path to local savegame files on your
      computer should be:


      C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\TankWars Anniversary Edition


      If you don''t have any local savegames anymore, we can provide you with a free
      game key. Again, if you don''t have the time or inclination to help us here,
      that will be totally fine.


      Thank you very much in advance!


      Best regards,

      Flinsch'
