Although not old enough to remember this loco running through Surrey and South London on to Brighton and the South Coast. I have seen it on the Bluebell Railway East Grinstead, Sussex. .  It is such a pity that Dovetail did not include the preserved Terrier No.82 'Boxhill' with the LB&SCR version.  Considering 'Boxhill' is a preserved loco at the NRM York and 'Boxhill' 'O' gauge and 'OO' locos are available from Dapol models.  I have the 'O' gauge model.  I used to live on Boxhill village  near Dorking Surrey, that this loco is named after.  However, this is a great little loco, and is very accurate in detail and performance, and I love its whistle.  Recommend.","timestamp_created":1561722608,"timestamp_updated":1561722608,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmPv6zusCdYbGxAE="}
