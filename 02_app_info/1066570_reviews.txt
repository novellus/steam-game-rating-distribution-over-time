I thought the BGM for the game was pretty grand. I bought this for one song in particular, which the OST didn't actually have, but I did get 27 other well done scores. The price is a little steep, but you can often find it on sale, as I did, which makes it more manageable. Most tracks are decent length at around 2 minutes, with good fading in and out, so it doesn't just start and get cut off at the end abruptly. Several tracks have made it onto my regular playlists.","timestamp_created":1604956134,"timestamp_updated":1604956134,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwp+O11/UCeZO2rQI="}
