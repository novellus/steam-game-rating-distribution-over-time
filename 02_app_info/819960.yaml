    review: 'Box pushing with a rhythm.


      I normally wouldn''t leave a negative review on a small indie game when there''s
      nothing obviously wrong with it, but given that Resynth is already 2 years old,
      it''s not going to suddenly start selling well whether I recommend it or not.
      So I''m  taking this opportunity to explain why I''ve started playing it about
      three times and always dropped it again very quickly, even though I''m in the
      target market: I like puzzle games, and I like music.


      The first issue is the music. If you like how it sounds, you''re going to like
      the game more; and I don''t. But the choice of having the game sound out the
      game board continually also means that I don''t get much of an aural feedback
      on what I am actually doing in the game: walking, pushing or turning essentially
      only adds to that tapestry (and there is no way to adjust the relative volume
      of it), which makes moving feel somewhat unreal. There is a kind of progression
      in the music as I solve the game, but it doesn''t really sound better at the
      end than it does at the start.


      The second issue is that these levels are sprawling compared to other box-pushing
      games. To get to 3-stars, you need to plan way ahead; and since there''s also
      a timer in addition to the step counter (and the step counter always counts
      up even if you undo), it becomes impossible to 3-star a level the first time.


      The third issue is that these initial levels are designed such that you make
      the level harder to navigate as you solve it. In a typical box-pusher, you''d
      need to figure out how to access the difficult boxes that you need to push;
      in this one, on the first few levels, I can access everything, but solving stuff
      cuts off paths. In effect, as I play a level, I''m making things more difficult
      for myself. That''s the exact opposite of a traditional box-pusher, where playing
      along makes my short-term goals easier to achieve.,


      All of these issues conspire to kill my motivation for this game super fast
      before I''ve even gotten into it. Looking at the play time on the reviews here
      on Steam, there are quite a few positive reviews who''ve only accumulated less
      than an hour as well, suggesting that this problem is more widely spread than
      the review score suggests.


      So, to sum it up:

      - this game punishes you for walking

      - this game also punishes you for thinking

      - but you still need to plan ahead

      - the sound of this game does not really correspond to the environment

      - unless techno is Zen for you, the sound punishes you for listening

      - the game punishes you for playing because you need to make the level harder
      for yourself to complete it

      - motivation derives from a single number going up


      If you''re seeing this as a welcome challenge, this may be the game for you,
      especially if you''re into the way it sounds.

      It''s not for me.'
