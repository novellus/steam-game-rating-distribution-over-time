The first missions have a nice pace to it, tho later missions seem to pile on the enemies so fast that it’s isn’t too obvious what you should be doing, as you find yourself overloaded on trying to think of a good strategy to defend your planet.\n\nThere is no story behind what you are doing, so it lacks any sense of urgency for your mission. Maybe that will come later as it is early access.\n\nThe enemies are well differentiated and colorful for the player to easily recognize, tho they also lack some character.\n\nThis is clearly a in progress project. I dont know if the manual targeing mechanic is a strong enough unique feature to stand on it own, but maybe that will change as the game is developed more. \n\nIf you like fast paced towe defence than give it a shot.","timestamp_created":1517684680,"timestamp_updated":1517684680,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.554764032363891602","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw1MzDruECf4P1lwE="}
