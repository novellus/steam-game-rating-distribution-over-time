It is amazing how the art has changed so much, for the better in my opinion from the very beginning til now. I was able to make it through the entire game and defeat the final boss in 4 hours. But I am following the creator in case he creates more works of art. Well done!","timestamp_created":1587757371,"timestamp_updated":1587757371,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ459nt1vECfs6bgwI="}
