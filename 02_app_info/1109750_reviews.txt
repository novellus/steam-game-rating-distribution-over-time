It takes less then an hour to finish, maybe a bit more if you are working towards 100 percenting this gem. It features a tutorial, a collection of 4 themed worlds, a few weapons with upgrades for each and 4 different and unique bosses. The games plays rather simply with your standard fair of WASD and mouse or full controller support.\n    I was warned as I started that I would encounter many bugs, glitches, and an impassible crash on the second worlds boss. I'm glad to say I encountered no bugs, save for breaking the magical book weapon post game. It runs smooth and has a certain level of charm. Everything you fight is a pot including bosses, the merchant the big bad, and even yourself. I can say I had fun, even if I had wished the game was juicier and plump with more content.\n    In the end, you can tell there was effort. In a Steam full of asset flips and big titty flops there was a degree of work put into this game. Even with this review (and this game even being bought for that matter) are being done only as a meme, I can't say it wasn't worth it. Over all I can without a doubt give this game 5 Depressed Developers out of 5.","timestamp_created":1576464505,"timestamp_updated":1576464505,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568627476692199707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iuumhu8Cca7T5AE="}
