    about_the_game: "You thank the driver and step out of the car into the frigid\
      \ mid-afternoon breeze. You walk towards the small house, footsteps crunching\
      \ loudly in the snow. You hear the car behind you slowly fade into the distance\
      \ as you step up the stairs to the door. You lift your fist to alert Nathan,\
      \ your caretaker, of your arrival, and with a loud rapping, you are sure he\
      \ would hear. You hear the creak of the front door, and expect to hear Nathan's\
      \ voice welcoming you. Silence. A small amount of warmth emanates from the interior,\
      \ feeling angelic compared to the harsh winter cold, and you realize that the\
      \ door is cracked open. You wait for a response as you listen to the calm, melodic\
      \ chirping of unseen multitudes of birds. Several long seconds pass. You try\
      \ again, but no response comes from the house. You press the doorbell and hear\
      \ a distant chiming of bells. Nothing. With growing concern, you pull your phone\
      \ from your pocket and send a message to Abel, hoping he will be awake despite\
      \ the time difference. You were not prepared for this; with no caretaker, you\
      \ will be forced to sit in the snow until someone helps you navigate. Stupid\
      \ injury. If only you could understand what you're seeing and where to go, you\
      \ wouldn't be in this situation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou awaken on\
      \ a cold, winter night, your nightmares depriving you of much-needed sleep.\
      \ You have yet another conference that morning, so you roll over and try to\
      \ dispel your fears. Your phone decides to destroy your thoughts of sleep with\
      \ a pleasant little ding. You wonder who is texting you this late at night,\
      \ but turn it on anyway. It's Elijah, your youngest brother. He says his caretaker\
      \ won't come to the door when he knocks. Now that you know it's Elijah, you\
      \ dispel all thoughts of going back to sleep. He received a serious brain trauma\
      \ a few years ago, and he has a hard time making sense of environments, let\
      \ alone walking around in his multi-story house. Debating whether to tell him\
      \ to just go inside or to wait, you start typing a reply, but suddenly stop.\
      \ From the hallway outside, you hear loud, ominous footsteps. Just like your\
      \ nightmare. You scramble to the bathroom door, knowing that you would be defenseless\
      \ against a burglar, especially if he was armed. You wrench it open, stumble\
      \ in, and slam the door shut behind you. Heart pounding, you stifle your breath\
      \ as a door creaks open and the footsteps tromp closer. Closer. Closer.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWelcome to Terror for Two.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTerror for\
      \ Two is a hardcore, survival horror experience with a twist. Your younger brother,\
      \ Elijah, is in a situation equally as terrifying as yours. You must guide him\
      \ to salvation while saving your own skin! Can you text your way to victory,\
      \ solving puzzles and discovering Easter eggs?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey Features:<br\
