    review: "juego clasico muy bueno, si te gustan los juegos de pelea es bueno darle\
      \ un intento la verdad!\n\npros: \n- el estilo clascio de los juegos de pelea\
      \ de los arcade\n- buena dificultad\n- te vicia desde el primer momento\n- personajes\
      \ que nunca se te van a olvidar\n- un modo historia naisu\n\ncontras:\n- no\
      \ tiene modo online\n- no se puede poner en un formato de pantalla actual (al\
      \ menos yo no supe como)\n- llegas demasiado rapido a mi parecer con el final\
      \ boss a pesar de que si hay dificultad en los primeros personajes\n- el arte\
      \ de los personajes no me gusta mucho pero eso ya es opinion personal"
