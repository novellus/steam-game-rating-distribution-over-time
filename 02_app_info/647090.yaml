    review: '[b][u]Game Information[/u][/b]


      "Maestro: Music of Death" Collector''s Edition is a Hidden Object Puzzle Adventure
      game. The game was developed by ERS Game Studio and published by Big Fish Games
      Studio.


      "Music of Death" is the first episode of "Maestro."


      Since this is a collector''s edition, it comes with extra features that are
      not available in its counterpart; the standard edition.


      [b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]


      Game Visuals


      I want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely done. The visuals
      can be adjusted in the game''s option menu.


      Game Audio


      I want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio
      is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game''s
      option menu as well.


      Gameplay


      There are two different difficulty game modes to choose from: Regular and Expert.


      The notebook keeps track of progression in the game. Such as story events and
      clues.


      There is no map in the game. The player has to remember where to go in the game.


      There is no padlock feature that is available to lock the inventory panel in
      place to make it stationary.


      The hidden object scenes consist of the following: Traditional word list. Some
      of these hidden object scenes may require little or no interactions.


      The puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of
      them.


      Since this is a collector''s edition, there is a bonus chapter, but it can be
      accessed only after the main story is completed.


      Miscellaneous


      There are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Soundtracks; Concept Art;
      Wallpapers; Screen Saver and Game''s Strategy Guide. Most of these extra features
      can be accessed only after the entire game is completed.


      Final thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay
      value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game''s
      full price value.'
