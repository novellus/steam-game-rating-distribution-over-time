    review: "Gef\xE4llt mir f\xFCrs erste ganz gut.\nMan kann im eigenen oder auch\
      \ in anderen Systemen die teilweise sehr weit entfernt sind Stationen bauen\
      \ und die Ressourcen von Planeten pl\xFCndern. Grafisch gef\xE4llt mir das ganze\
      \ auch sehr.\n\n\n\n\nMit dem Bauen hab ich noch Probleme, da ich nicht ganz\
      \ verstehe wann die Stabilit\xE4t nicht mehr gegeben ist. (Faustregel f\xFC\
      r mich: max. 8 Parts mit Eisen + schwere Bauteile innen + am Anfang nur spezialisierte\
      \ Stationen bauen.)\n\nWarte Aktuell auf mehr Inhalt, der mir das Management\
      \ zwischen Stationen und mit Schiffen verbessert, da die \xDCbersicht und Steuerung\
      \ sp\xE4ter mit vielen Shuttles und Raumstationen noch nicht gegeben ist.\n\n\
      Ihr k\xF6nnt zwar keine Pause dr\xFCcken oder beschleunigen werdet aber AKTUELL\
      \ kaum bis gar nicht bestraft f\xFCr falsches bauen.\n\nKleiner Tipp: Ihr k\xF6\
      nnt so gut wie alle Ressourcen von der Erde bekommen auch wenn sie euch nicht\
      \ angezeigt werden.\n\n\nIch seh gerade ist mehr ein Guide geworden als eine\
      \ Rezension. Tut mir leid hilft euch aber vielleicht bei der Entscheidung. Werde\
      \ ich auf jedenfall noch bearbeiten."
