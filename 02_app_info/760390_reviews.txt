It's kind of like the ultra-reduced version of Guitar Hero... Playing on more advanced modes REALLY stretches your concentration. \n\nIt's 79p and if you like reaction games, you'll probablty get your money's worth.  I usually go on about Â£1 per hour to be worthwhile, and yeah, it's earned that.\n\npros\n* simple\n* challenging\n* configurable\n* stable\n\ncons\n* it's a one-trick pony\n* graphics are are basic as you can possibly imagine.\n\nI'll give it a thumbs-up because, although it's extremely simple, it does exactly what it sets out to.","timestamp_created":1545876046,"timestamp_updated":1545876046,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi5DZ9ucCcszFtgE="}
