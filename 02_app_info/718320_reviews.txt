I've seen this kind of platformer a million times before and there's nothing that makes this one stand out among the crowd.\n\nThere are 3 key issues that stop me from recommending it though:\n1) It's a very lazy mobile port, meaning there are a lot of references to touch controls and there is a noticeable lack of a quit button on the main menu (I ended up having to force close it).\n2) The collision detection needs a bit more work. Sometimes I could not grab onto ladders unless I jumped at it at the perfect angle. Enemy hit boxes are a bit hit and miss as well.\n3) There are a lot of blind leaps of faith that you need to do in order to progress, most of which will cause you to land awkwardly onto an enemy or a spike pit. It's very cheap, especially considering that you get almost no invincibility frames after taking damage.","timestamp_created":1607378502,"timestamp_updated":1607378530,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7b3On/YCceyHuAI="}
