There is always a crash on the boss of the 6th floor not allowing you to go any further. I don't know how close or far I was from the end but I grinded a lot before that.\n\nBesides that, gotta say this game had me surprised, but not in a good sense. I thought I was in for card games and strip-fights. Nope. This game is first and foremost a dungeon crawler made in RPG maker where for every fight you're going to have you have to grind. And grind. And grind. And grind. Entrances and exits to floor can be very frustrating to find and I have several times wandering the same level for around 15 minutes before I find the tiny black spot hidden in a corner and aggravated by your small line of sight.\n\nCombat during the dungeon can be pretty frustrating, as your hit chance is around 70% at best, everything considered; except for magic. The mage girl was so OP but you needed her so badly.\n\nYou can go ahead and play this game if you want, but I wouldn't if I were you. Wish I could have the time I grinded back hoping that I could get my strip battles.","timestamp_created":1595382523,"timestamp_updated":1595382523,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518518567085266113","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x6yNuvMCdonolgI="}
