    review: I am going to consider this as one of the best games so far. The game
      gives you some vibes of Max payne 1 except it has different environment and
      storyline. I really enjoyed the game, first 2 3 minutes i got annoyed by the
      graphics but after that I became used to. The gameplay and environment all looks
      awesome to me , definitely recommended. I played this game non stop for an hour
      without getting bored .
