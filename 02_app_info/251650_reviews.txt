Let me just say this is probably one of my favorite games this year. From the art style to the music, this game was really great! The game plays like Pikmin but with a zombie take on it and I absolutely loved the settings. The characters were really great, I was actually invested in each of them and boy does this game get dark at spots. There is a mixture of humor within the game as well to keep it going and there are several references to 80s stuff which was fun to find. \n         The gameplay was pretty clean with maybe one major bug where I lost control of my character after what seemed to have happened when I resurrected a dead person just when a cutscene was taking place. Other than that, it was excellent performance wise through the rest of the game. I found the combat to be really easy though until maybe 2 spots later in the game but I didn't have any issues controlling my zombie army. The game also throws minigames in between portions of the story as you go from the past to present and I like that addition. Quite frankly, I didn't want this game to end but I plan on playing it again to find all the batteries and graves so there is a reason to replay the game.","timestamp_created":1609991170,"timestamp_updated":1609991170,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/fS87fYCfZuXwQI="}
