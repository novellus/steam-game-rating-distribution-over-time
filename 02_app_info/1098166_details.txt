There would be various Pacers based off multiple buses, but the largest and most prolific would be those built with assistance from British Leyland with their ‘Leyland National’ bus design – and these units were dubbed the BR Class 142.<br><br>A fleet of 96 Class 142 Pacers were built between 1985 and 1987, and they were quickly put to use on regional services in Devon and Cornwall, as well as the North West. It was early on in their careers that they came under scrutiny for being uncomfortable, and bouncy, thanks to their bogie-less wheel configuration; the 142s in Cornwall were struggling with sharp curves on the branch lines, and so they had to be moved elsewhere, in particular around Liverpool and in the North East.<br><br>Love them or hate them, it cannot be ignored that the revolutionary Pacer stands tall as a fine example of a stopgap that made an era-defining impact on the British rail network.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Included Scenarios<\/h2><br>A trio of engaging Career scenarios are included for the Liverpool-Manchester route:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>[142] 1.
