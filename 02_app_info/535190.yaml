      <br><br>Fill your Universe with a collection of cosmic chunks: boulders, white
      dwarfs, comets, and chunky fireballs. Add some trails to your rocks to trace
      their paths. Or bust out the sparkly photon cannon - a delete button with a
      kick! It''s a big physics based playground. Create a random cluster of boulders
      and watch as they collect into larger, chunky groups. Launch a super-massive
      White Dwarf and observe how it affects the other bodies in the system. Create
      a small ''solar system'' and see how many chunks you can get into orbit. <br><br><strong>It''s
      your Universe. Do What You Want.</strong> (^_^)<br><br>There are two versions
      of the sim. You can pilot a simple spaceship through the void with your gamepad
      or go full roomscale with your Vive wands or Oculus Touch controllers. The roomscale
      version features a new kind of ''pinch and pull'' movement that makes it easy
      to move around in 3D space. This isn''t a game - more like a physics-based toy.
      Might even be educational. It certainly gave me a new appreciation for how Gravity
      works.'
