      them at the touch of a button, on-the-fly, to maintain the momentum of play.<br><br>For
      example: while wielding a pole, activate your spring as well to instantly have
      a pogo stick, then also activate a spike to have a pogo-drill that destroys
      terrain as you bounce.<br><br><br><strong>Food</strong><br>Food works in much

      line and this creature could influence a unique ending for you. It may simply
      add flavour to the usual route. The point is that you make action-based decisions

    review: i really like the game but im thinking you should make some chekpoints
      witch are tombstones maybe and when you die you dig yourself out of the tombstone
      and you can only use it once before the tombstone will shatter and break so
      the game can be a bit more challanging to play and progres on into the game
      so i hope this review will be helpful for some people.
