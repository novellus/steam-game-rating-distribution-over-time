      /><br><br><strong><i>MAXIMUM GUTS AND CARNAGE !</i></strong> -- <strong>Enemy
      Remains</strong> is a punishing continuation to <strong>Kalaban</strong>, offering
      a blend of intense top-down action and survival horror.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1478590/extras/HypeQuotes.png?t=1610098850"
      /><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1478590/extras/HypeBanner1_v3.png?t=1610098850"
      /><br>Play the game solo or with your friend in couch co-op mode! Monsters and
      fiends won't stand a chance against two players working as one. But sudden death
      awaits the careless and brash explorer.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1478590/extras/HypeBanner2_v2.png?t=1610098850"
      /><br>We've built the game from the ground up to focus on the gameplay. Nothing
      comes between you and the action; no unskippable cutscenes, dialogue windows,
      inventory screens or menus that you have to haul around. There is no food meter
      to manage, and no useless junk to carry around. It's just you, your weapons
      and medkits -- against the <strong><i>relentless</i></strong> supernatural foes.<br><br><img

      /><br>Powered by the Unity engine, all the environments can be explored in full
      3D glory. Objects will have physics, bullets landing on different surfaces will
      react with different effects, crates and barrels can be pushed around... You
      can even use the environment as your advantage, luring the enemies into mines
      or laser traps, or destroy these deadly mechanisms with explosives. <br><br><br><img

      /><br><br>There is a small town, in the middle nowhere, which you left as a
      child. Now as a teenager, after graduating from high school, you hear strange
      stories of animal mutilation, unholy rituals and ravenous mutant wildlife brewing
      in your old hometown. It's time to investigate these occurrences and put an
      end to the corruption that's unfolding.
