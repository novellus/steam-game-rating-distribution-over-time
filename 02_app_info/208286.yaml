      \ now you can be the engineer on your own trains on this great railroad line\

      \ Wyoming, the route is well-known for the tough grades which resulted in the\
      \ Union Pacific Railroad building new heavy freight locomotives to work the\
      \ line. The first single track railroad was laid in 1868, passing over the summit\
      \ at 8,247 feet, and the route was steadily upgraded with double tracks and\
      \ stronger bridges in the following decades. <br><br>The Sherman Hill route\
      \ for Train Simulator features a superb fleet of Union Pacific diesel locomotives\
      \ including the SD70M, SD40-2, ES44C and SW10, plus some seriously long freight\
