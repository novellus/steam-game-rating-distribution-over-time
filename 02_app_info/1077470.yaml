    review: "[h1]Summary[/h1]\nThis game asks hard questions of you pretty soon after\
      \ you start it up. 'Course, in several cases you can sidestep the question.\
      \ Sometimes it's even an option to set boundaries for what you feel comfortable\
      \ and capable answering!\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1]First play session[/h1]\nI did\
      \ experience a crash bug -- hence why I stopped at 2 hours because I was [b]hooked.[/b]\
      \ It was kinda helpful because I needed the prompt to stop. Since I was expecting\
      \ it from the reviews I'd read, it wasn't jarring or upsetting. And yeah, to\
      \ echo the others, I would absolutely agree that the game is still worth playing.\
      \ I hope they're not every 10 minutes or anything, but if 2 hours is more the\
      \ average, then I'd say it's a good exchange. Oh and my save file was fine afterwards\
      \ too afaik.\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Crash bugs might be common.\n\
      \    [*]Near the end of [spoiler]your introduction to Dr. Freeman,[/spoiler]\
      \ there is a very out-of-place voice line.\n    [*]The collectibles can be a\
      \ little hard to find until you know what they look like.\n    [*]Some of the\
      \ UI is a little rough -- still works tho!\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Neutrals[/h1]\n[list]\n\
      \    [*]The art quality feels a little inconsistent.\n    [*]I don't know how\
      \ to do certain things, but idk if that was because I missed instructions or\
      \ they weren't given.\n    [*]I didn't know what some of the psychology terms\
      \ meant precisely, but a quick search generally helped. [spoiler]I'm thinking\
      \ of the early bit where you explain some of the ethical issues.[/spoiler]\n\
      \    [*]There was a weird bit where [spoiler]I increased the trust level for\
      \ someone that was then different between a conversation and the next day at\
      \ the desk. However that could have changed overnight regardless.[/spoiler]\n\
      [/list]\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Literally everything about the\
      \ story is enthralling.\n    [*]I don't feel talked down to.\n    [*]A video\
      \ game can talk about mental health with respect and nuance?!\n    [*]Syntherapy\
      \ asks really interesting questions about balancing commitments, responsibility\
      \ and integrity.\n    [*]The characters feel like they have real expectations,\
      \ back and forth.\n    [*]'Helping' fictional characters feels like helping\
      \ yourself.\n[/list]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[b]TL;DR:[/b] omg just play it. jfc check\
      \ the TWs tho."
