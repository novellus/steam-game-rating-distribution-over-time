    about_the_game: "Molly is a single player game about a little girl that fights\
      \ to survive. One morning she wakes up to realize that everyone on the military\
      \ base that she lived in is gone. She explores... she searches all day. Night\
      \ falls, wait... is that some she recognizes? If she knew them once she no longer\
      \ does, for they are now ghouls! They are dead and follow Molly around. But\
      \ Molly remembered her father speaking about a legend that if you could survive\

    developer_response: 'Hi there, I am developer of "Molly - Can you survive 100
      nights?". You, Zaxtor99 and Sarah, reviewed my game and gave it one of the worst
      game review scores I have ever seen - 10%! Wow that is staggeringly low! With
      that said thanks for reviewing my game and thanks for taking the time out to
      comment on it and to review it - it was great to hear your comments and feedback.
      Sorry you did not like the game, I put alot of work into it, it was my first
      game and I learnt a lot from making it. When I played it, my friends and I liked
      it, but there is nothing like putting a game out into the wild to see its true
      metal. As for it being an asset flip, I wrote the code myself, it was not a
      pre-existing game that was on the unity or a demo or anything that I converted.
      I had an idea, fresh out of my own mind but I did not have enough time or money
      to make my own assets. There is a tutorial that explains a bit about the game,
      I see on the video you posted that you missed the link for it. Points about
      the game:

      1) There are 3 types of ghosts, each with their own appearance and sound and
      speed

      2) Red squares give ammo

      3) White squares give health

      4) Red rods are iron that can be converted into ammo (see the tutorial window)

      5) There are 2 flower beds that have plants that give health

      6) You can play as 4 different profiles (4 different saves)

      I did use free assets that I downloaded from the asset store because my skills
      as an artist are not that developed yet. I thought the 100 night challenge was
      a pretty fun aspect with that said.'

    review: "Even though the days and nights pass in about a minute of real time,\
      \ playing this LOW EFFORT UNITY TRASH for 100 minutes would be like stabbing\
      \ your eyes with rusty nails for 100 minutes.  Ugh.\n\nWatch my First Impressions\
      \ Gameplay HERE:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gr5YKu_2_es&feature=youtu.be\n\
      \nYou run around in a circle on a very small map with the same default buildings\
      \ pasted over and over around while blank white and red boxes fall from the\
      \ sky.  Collect them to add to your health and ammo respectively.  The \"zombies\"\
      \ are really horrid looking flat sprites with no animation that slide at you\
      \ and vanish into thin air when shot.\n\nRinse and Repeat for 100 minutes. \
      \ Ugh.  No thanks.\n\nAbsolute trash.  NOT RECOMMENDED.\n\nMy Score:  10%  (1\
      \ out of 10)\n\n------------- UPDATE on May 9, 2019 ---------------\n\nThe developer's\
      \ response shows me he is actually a legit developer who tried to make a \"\
      fun\" game, but maybe lacks the experience and development time to have made\
      \ this better.  He asked me what I thought could make this game better.. so\
      \ here is my list of suggestions for this developer  (Take them or leave them,\
      \ these are just my suggestions that I think would make this game better):\n\
      \n1) Learn how to make the AI \"NOT\" go thru walls to get to your X Y position\n\
      ..This will be VERY important as you continue to develop games.  I'm sure there\
      \ are tons of good AI videos on youtube for Unity so your enemies don't go thru\
      \ walls.  Having enemies just move at ease right through walls and hit you/kill\
      \ you feels cheap and cheap deaths make people rage.  \n\n2) I'd change the\
      \ health to either a bar that diminishes but preferably to a red heart shape\
      \ that starts full and goes down as you lose health and just the % from 1 to\
      \ 100 inside the heart\nI'd also move your health to the left side\n\n3) Put\
      \ your day # and time both together in the upper right where your health is\
      \ now like this:  Day 4:  2:15 PM (all together with just a couple of spaces\
      \ between)\n\n4) I'd put your ammo on the bottom left side, just feel like these\
      \ locations im giving you are more standard positions for this kinda info in\
      \ games.\n\n5) Move your iron to bottom right where your ammo is now\n\nThese\
      \ are just my suggestions, but most importantly... put your health in a heart\
      \ shape or in a health bar.\n\n6) I'd replace your current enemies.. with one\
      \ of the following:\nIf you want them to float, fine.. make them more ghostly\
      \ and make them animated as they move.. right now they look like stiff cardboard\
      \ cut outs, and it just looks and comes off as \"cheap\" and \"no effort\" \
      \ \nMaybe make one of them (instead of the see thru one). maybe make one a big\
      \ floating clown head or something.. i see it with red hair and evil eyes make\
      \ sure it animates tho, at least a little!\n\n* I couldn't make assets like\
      \ what I'd want in your game, if your game was mine, i'd probably find someone\
      \ on fiver to make me what I wanted and pay them $20 per asset or whatever and\
      \ promise to only sell it to me.. so that It would be only MY asset and not\
      \ seen in 20 other Unity games on Steam\n- Also with those assets, especially\
      \ if you have them made... make sure the person making them gives you a death\
      \ animation or an exploding animation where it gets shot and looks cool when\
      \ it dies so it doesn't just disappear when shot.. that also feels cheap and\
      \ unsatisfying when you play it\n\n7) I actually like your boxes falling for\
      \ health and ammo, that works just fine...\nBut maybe replace the white box\
      \ with a super simple first aid kit instead, nothing fancy needed tho and if\
      \ you do that, replace the red ammo box with something that actually looks like\
      \ ammo.. maybe a dark green military ammo box?\n\n8) Your current map is just\
      \ fine but make sure your enemies don't spawn in mid air where they can be seen\
      \ spawning... Making them spawn under ground and SLOW come up thru the earth\
      \ in random locations would look and feel MUCH cooler imo.\n\n9) Ohhhh, you\
      \ need a SCORE!!  ..make SCORE be the thing in the top middle and make it bigger\
      \ font!  Give players scores for each enemy type, the tougher the enemy, the\
      \ more points he is worth.  Also give points for surviving a night perhaps and\
      \ other actions as well.  A High score leaderboard for Steam would be cool too\
      \ but not required.  However, learning how to make Steam leaderboards for your\
      \ games is definitely something I'd learn how to do if you want to make more\
      \ Steam games in the future.\n\nI hope that helps or at least gives you some\
      \ ideas.  =)"
