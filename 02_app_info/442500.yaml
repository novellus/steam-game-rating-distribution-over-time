      re almost out of money. Two more days and you will no longer be able to pay\
      \ your staff or gladiators. The fight scheduled today will draw exceptionally\
      \ massive crowds, meaning the fight purse will be bountiful and the opportunity\
      \ to place a large volume of bets will be high. One problem though: your top\
      \ fighter is fatigued from his last fight and has a nagging shoulder strain.\
      \ Plus he has a history of concussions, so it\u2019s fair to say he will not\
      \ be at full strength if you put him in the arena. But he\u2019s the best you\u2019\
      ve got. The rest of your gladiators are rookies yet; still working with your\
      \ trainers and far too inexperienced to send into the crucible just yet. <br><br>The\
      \ next fight is a week away and poorly hyped. You cannot wait that long. <br><br>If\
      \ you were of an evil disposition, you could execute your top fighter instead\
      \ and seize his life savings; with the fight purses you have shared with him\
      \ through his career, he has amassed a lot of gold. It could keep you going\
      \ for a month or two - maybe more. Something to consider.<br><br>Or if you find\
      \ that distasteful, you could go to the money lenders instead. But their interest\
      \ rates have been high these last few days: 30% or more. You could finance present\
      \ operations with that \u2013 but you would suffer in the longer term.<br><br>So\
      \ maybe you should send your top fighter into the arena. He is bruised up and\
      \ fatigued \u2013 but he also is ranked 3rd overall by the so-called experts\
      \ and pundits of Leptis Magnus, the current city you reside in. You know he\
      \ is one of the best and might still have a good chance at pulling out a win.<br><br>Or\
      \ he could lose his life.<br><br>What do you do?<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>What\
      \ Is It?</strong></h2><br><strong>Age of Gladiators</strong> is a single-player\
      \ strategy/business management sim set at the height of the bloody gladiatorial\
      \ games in ancient Rome. <br><br>Hire scouts to scour the provinces for potential\
      \ prospects \u2013 once you have recruited your gladiators, you will need to\
      \ manage their morale and personality while equipping them for battle in the\

      \ and manage the wealth and reputation of your business as it grows each day.\
      \  <br><br>As your fighters win battles and increase in level, it will be up\
      \ to you to decide how to focus their abilities by spending attribute and expertise\

    review: "Age of Gladiators ist ein Gladiatoren-Manager. Um Geld und Ansehen zu\
      \ erlangen, leiten wir eine Gladiatorenschule und lassen unsere K\xE4mpfer in\
      \ der Arena antreten. Durch den Einsatz auf dem Kampfplatz sammeln sie Erfahrungspunkte,\
      \ um ihre Werte und Fertigkeiten zu verbessern und folglich immer f\xE4higere\
      \ Kontrahenten zu bezwingen. Sind s\xE4mtliche feindlichen K\xE4mpfer der Stadt\
      \ besiegt, k\xF6nnen wir in den n\xE4chstgr\xF6\xDFeren Ort weiterziehen und\
      \ nach unseren Darbietungen f\xFCr provinzielle Kampfzirkusse schlie\xDFlich\
      \ an den popul\xE4ren Blutorgien im Kolosseum Roms teilnehmen.\n\nOb wir einen\
      \ Gladiatoren in den Kampf entsenden, entscheiden wir nach dem individuellen\
      \ Geschick in Gegen\xFCberstellung zum Format des Ereignisses. Unerfahrene oder\
      \ versehrte Kandidaten schickt man besser nicht in massiv gehypte Gro\xDFveranstaltungen,\
      \ da die \xDCberlebenschancen angesichts der dort antretenden Veteranen gegen\
      \ Null tendieren. \xDCberdies erleiden Arenenk\xE4mpfer berufsbedingt h\xE4\
      ufig Verletzungen, plagen sich mit Ersch\xF6pfungszust\xE4nden und Krankheiten\
      \ herum oder verlieren bei ausbleibendem Lohn jedwede Kampfmoral. F\xFCr ihre\
      \ Effizienz und ihr Wohlbefinden sorgen hinzugebuchte \xC4rzte, Trainer und\
      \ Waffenmeister sowie eine angemessene Bezahlung, Kost und Logis. Eine gewisse\
      \ Risikobereitschaft wird dem Spieler dennoch immer abverlangt, denn allein\
      \ die Wettgewinne, besonders jene der gef\xE4hrlichen Gro\xDFevents, wirken\
      \ den t\xE4glich anfallenden Unkosten entgegen. Und obwohl der Erhalt der liebgewonnenen\
      \ Recken mit fortschreitendem Spielverlauf immer bedeutsamer wird, sollte sich\
      \ ein Scout zwischenzeitlich nach neuen Deb\xFCtanten umsehen, denn im Gladiatorengesch\xE4\
      ft herrscht naturgem\xE4\xDF stets personeller Verschlei\xDF.\n\nDie Pr\xE4\
      sentation von Age of Gladiators erweist sich als so antik wie sein historischer\
      \ Rahmen und beschr\xE4nkt sich fast ausschlie\xDFlich auf Zahlen und Tabellen,\
      \ welche die verschiedenen Charakterwerte sowie die offensiven und defensiven\
      \ Fertigkeiten detailliert ausweisen; bestenfalls die starren Avatare unserer\
      \ Waffentr\xE4ger binden plastisch ins Geschehen ein. Selbst die K\xE4mpfe werden\
      \ zwar minuti\xF6s, jedoch lediglich \xFCber Texteinblendungen nachvollzogen,\
      \ bevor uns das Spiel das mathematisch errechnete Kampfergebnis auf einer blutbespritzten\
      \ Tafel pr\xE4sentiert. Das Fehlen grafischer Inszenierung besitzt den Charme\
      \ alter Schule und mindert die Dramatik keineswegs, sofern man \xFCber etwas\
      \ Vorstellungsverm\xF6gen verf\xFCgt. Unweigerlich schlie\xDFt man so manchen\
      \ erfolgreichen Gladiatoren trotz seiner gr\xF6\xDFtenteils numerischen Skizzierung\
      \ rasch ins Herz und entwickelt ihn zu einem Star der Arena, der jedes Blatt\
      \ zu wenden vermag.\n\nTrotz des episch anmutenden Gesamtbilds ist das Spektrum\
      \ der Prozesse und M\xF6glichkeiten stark begrenzt. So kreuzen stets nur zwei\
      \ Gladiatoren die Waffen. Ein Kampfgelage mehrerer Kontrahenten ist ebenso wenig\
      \ m\xF6glich wie das Auftauchen wilder Tiere in der Arena; nur frisch angeworbene\
      \ Novizen k\xF6nnen sich zu Schulungszwecken mit Panthern, B\xE4ren und L\xF6\
      wen rangeln. Zudem motiviert das repetitive Spielprinzip kaum \xFCber einen\
      \ langen Zeitraum hinweg: Zu Beginn werden Entscheidungen angesichts schwindender\
      \ Geldmittel und unterschiedlicher Gegnerst\xE4rken noch reflektiert getroffen\
      \ und die als zeremoniell empfundenen Auseinandersetzungen durchaus kontemplativ\
      \ verfolgt; sp\xE4testens in Rom aber erstreckt sich das Geschehen auf uferlos\
      \ aneinandergereihte Duelle, die wir mit mechanisch einstudierten Mausklicks\
      \ bew\xE4ltigen, zumal unsere hochgez\xFCchteten Gladiatoren nun praktisch unbesiegbar\
      \ geworden sind.\n\nObwohl ich Age of Gladiators gern gespielt habe, kann ich\
      \ es als Nischenprodukt nur eingeschr\xE4nkt empfehlen. Tats\xE4chlich ist es\
      \ wohl mit einer Veranstaltung im Circus Maximus vergleichbar: Es birgt kurzweilige\
      \ Unterhaltung, stiftet aber keinen tieferen Sinn."
