Be warned that purchasing their games is now condoning their part in the decline of quality in online games.\n\nSouth Africa is the only actually-new-content to speak of since relaunch. It's \"okay\" at best.\n\nThe starting missions are a neat sort of tongue-in-cheek meta-critique of a lot of the grindy missions in MMOs, framed as you actually-grinding them in a cult compound, but the rest of the writing in that section feels so ham-fisted and poor that I'm sure it's unintentional and they really just wanted to put in a story-sanctioned timesink. The premise is neat but poorly-executed. It may be the smallest zone in the game, in terms of both area and actual mission content. It's neat for about ten or twenty minutes before you both get the point and just want it to be over. It has a neat \"final boss\" that's marred by the game's crummy new targeting mechanics that make some fights - like the one they wanted this boss to be - more frustrating than they ought to be. It is also the least-party-friendly part of the game, so forget about playing with friends or randos by the end of the story.","timestamp_created":1608647283,"timestamp_updated":1608647717,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.442028999328613281","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iIa4xfYCe9OXvAI="}
