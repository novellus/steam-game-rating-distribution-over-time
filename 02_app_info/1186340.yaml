    review: 'I originally purchased this from Alawar over a decade ago after loving
      the original Action Ball and was not disappointed with the challenging game
      play when I purchased it. It was quite a surprise to see it appear in the Steam
      store considering its age, however, I immediately bought  it because it is one
      of my all time favourite 3D breakouts and also  I wanted to convey my thanks  and
      support to the developer for including it on Steam;  as well as suggest a few
      additions that may improve the re-playability, or even see a  new version created
      by the developer, that may incorporate some of the suggestions I''ve made at
      the end of this review and in the comments section.


      The game mechanics are similar to most 3D breakouts; however, compared to most
      3D versions of breakout, this one is quite challenging, in part due to the addition
      of the robots,  boss battles & invader like mini game, but also because the
      ball speeds are a tad faster than most other 3D breakouts, where  ball speeds
      in those breakouts start off very sluggish and rarely get any better. also,
      the shape of each arena  differs slightly.


      Also, if you do lose all of your lives, you  can choose to continue,  by restarting
      the level with the same number of lives you started out with at the beginning
      of that level.  If you are lucky you''ll have a full complement, or even more  if
      you''ve gained extra lives; however, if you only had the one life left at the
      beginning of the failed level, (likely if you''ve just completed a boss battle),
      that''s all you''ll get when continuing. The advantage of not starting  totally
      from the beginning is that you retain your score as well.  If you do choose
      to start from the beginning, i.e. with a score of zero, you can still select  any
      level you''ve previously unlocked. (I''m not sure if this is actually possible
      as the game  saves your progress when you  leave the game).


      You can earn more lives by collecting the infrequent life power-up or destroy
      25 robots. The ball physics are acceptable, though I''d like to see the ball
      ricochet off at more acute angles as it seems to be limited to specific angles,
      though this does not affect game play at all. I think the different shaped arena
      that changes each level  helps to counter the lack of more acute angle ricochets.   The
      overall speed of the game is good compared to many other 3D breakouts, where
      the balls always seem really sluggish; making those games easy to beat. Also,
      when the last few hard to get bricks are left, the rocket launchers, that are  usually
      placed along the top of the arena come into play and soon dispatch them to oblivion.
      I think this may also include any robots that are still lurking.


      Unless you are an expert breakout player you will need as many lives as you
      can muster to survive the boss levels, especially the later ones, which are
      more difficult to beat.  There are five different boss types, but you will usually
      only face one or two at a time.  Both can be quite hard to beat, especially
      the dual boss levels.   As you have one  facing off against you frequently,  while
      the other is firing missiles  (and later bricks) at you. Usually you do get  several
      machine gun or laser power ups in the boss rounds which does help somewhat.  You
      can see your progress  against  the boss levels via the health bar located at
      the top of the game arena.


      As with  most  breakouts, Action Ball 2  includes a wide variety of power ups
      totalling thirty one; some of which are rarely seen in breakouts, for example
      freeze robots, lightning bolts,  bombing raids, grenades and meteorite showers.  There
      are four types of robots to contend with (not counting the boss robots),  these
      include a supply robot that  replaces destroyed  bricks,  a repair robot that
      repairs damaged bricks;  sentinel robots that  fire rockets at  your bat and
      Kamikase robots  that try to destroy your paddle by dive bombing you..  Each
      robot  when destroyed is added to a counter (located to the right of the arena)
      that,  as mentioned above,  adds a new life  once you reach 25 kills.


      A nice touch to this game which I''ve only seen in a few other Alawar based
      breakouts is the upgrade system (e.g.  Strike Ball 3), where you earn upgrade
      points after scoring a specific amount of points.  These upgrade points can
      be added to either  the size of your bat,  the amount of ammo  your bat can
      carry, the power of your bat and  the defence of your bat.  Each of these can
      be upgraded up to four times. You can also select  from four different  paddle
      styles once they are unlocked. Most power ups are time limited. An indicator
      at the  left side of the arena will appear whenever you pick up a useful  or
      negative power up. Different power ups are stackable, but not the same power
      up, though the new one will cancel the part used one if you pick up the same
      power up while one is still live.   Every fifth level you get either a boss
      battle or an invaders like mini game that alternate throughout the game.


      There are 13 achievements available with the Steam version, most of which are  easily
      earned.  I got the first eight or nine within 25 minutes of playing the game
      for the first time.



      [b]Suggestions for the developer - part 1[/b]



      I would  consider revamping the  achievements. As they stand I think they are
      far too easy to  achieve and are not in that sense achievements. I''d consider
      scrapping most of the ones already included or at least supplementing them with
      others such as level markers e.g. attaining level 10, 20, 30 etc (after beating
      boss levels) also being able to survive a boss battle without  losing a life,
      and/or not using any power ups to beat the boss, achieving your first extra
      life for killing 25 robots, collecting 200 or more power-ups in the mini game
      (space invader like levels), Beating all boss levels without using power ups
      etc.  I''d also like to see trading cards added.  These could include images
      of the boss robots as well as images of the rarer power ups and different paddles
      etc.


      please see other suggestions in the comments below.'
