      solar system, in the year 2045. This summer you are invited to join Nicole and
      Rocky in their tale of survival in a city overrun with extraterrestrials. In

      through dangerous streets and places. The extraterrestrials run on their primal
      animal instincts, and they are out for blood. You're in their zoo now, their
      research facility. You start out as Nicole and meet Rocky later on, but you
      can't trust him or can you? You certainly can't trust the extraterrestrials.  Who

      and make it out alive?
