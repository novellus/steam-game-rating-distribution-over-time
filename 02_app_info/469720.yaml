    review: 'Just when you think this game isn''t deep... it opens a whole new dimension
      to you. Give it time, it''ll grow on you. I initially thought it was grindy
      but after upgrading my keep and unlocking a few classes, the "customization"
      depth started to open up. There are a lot of quality of life items/upgrades
      you''ll want to take. After that, you  can just jump right into the action.
      Dollar for dollar, definitely a good time passer if you''re waiting for the
      next release or have a loot itch you can''t quite scratch.


      Reminds me of a turned based Diablo 2. Scratches that loot and dungeon crawler
      fix. Stats on items and sets are more akin to Grim Dawn, WOW or Diablo 3 than
      Diablo 2. Set "types" can be assigned to any item and each item can have any
      number of stats (better or worse). Set pieces also support partial completion
      for when you want some of the bonuses but don''t want to fully commit to all
      the items in the set (allowing you to mix and match 2  sets if you want). Sets
      don''t appear to be on weapons tho. Loot is  locked behind character level so
      don''t expect to find level 10 loot from monsters while you''re still level
      4... but you can equip anything you find (most items are for your current party-
      did I mention you can have more than one party? Tho not at the same time). Shops
      have higher level loot so you could buy items you can equip later (if you see
      something powerful or lucky and want to snatch it before going on a quest to
      level up).


      Some reviews say that the difficulty is bad/unbalanced. You can change the difficulty
      in game at any moment. Increasing it increases your loot quality. I appreciate
      this feature a lot now. If you run into a horrible dungeon (every dungeon can
      have attributes that change how it plays) or you run into a hoard of monsters
      that just annoy the living crap out of you, you can tone them down and get on
      with having fun! I hate when games stop being fun and being able to "soft bypass"
      the annoying enemies  is nice. When you''re ready and powerful, crank up the
      difficulty to rake in that sweet loot. If you can handle it. If not, play on
      easy and miss out on all those fat rewards.


      Can sell items anywhere from within your inventory which is a nice quality of
      life feature and keeps your stash organized. Which is good cuz travelling the
      map is kind of slow (but not Diablo 2 slow at least) and would suck if I had
      to go back to town to sell all the poor quality items I collect. I just got
      spoiled by the "instant" action roguelikes that take you from one encounter
      to the next. Walk? Hahaha... that''s for peasants! Just kidding. Traveling and
      exploring the world map is part of the game. Also, recently discovered "waypoints"
      that allow you to teleport instantly for free... so nevermind what I just said.
      If you want a non-stop dungeon grinder, use the waypoints to bypass walking!
      Walking is still a feature as that is how you find secret locations and waypoints
      initially.


      There are 7 factions you run missions for. Reputation goes to 1000 for each
      of the 7 factions. I thought this was grindy at first a couple hours in you
      can easily score 200+ points with a faction in under an hour (and probably faster
      if I wasn''t focused primarily on running dungeons and getting sweet loot).
      So 1000 doesn''t seem so bad in hindsight. You unlock new classes at the 500
      mark and get bonuses every 250 points you sink in making the reputation worth
      it in the long run.


      Character skills are simple but provide enough depth  to feel like your choices
      matter and you can mold your team to your playstyle. Characters seem to level
      a tad slower than I''d like but we''ll see... So far they''re powering up nicely.
      Skills and item stats crush your character''s inherit attributes. Kind of like
      Diablo 2 or 3. Seems like skills and gear matter the most but the extra point
      or two to your character''s stats help out in the early levels. Maybe if you
      get 5-10 points at later levels your character stats will still contribute...
      Maybe characters should get their level/2 in stat points on level up. So far
      I seem to only get 1 point each level. Recently I found some items you can buy/find
      to increase your stats so there''s that.


      A good time sink if you''re bored and need something to fill the void. You pay
      for what you get. Could benefit from a "keyboard only" layout. That might improve
      input speed (player wise). There are some keyboard shortcuts and I appreciate
      the ones that were put in but would be nice if everything had a keyboard shortcut.


      Overall, I really like this game and it''s my current addiction. Good place
      to zone out, zen and find your gamer flow. Would definitely buy again and wish
      I had bought it a year ago.'
