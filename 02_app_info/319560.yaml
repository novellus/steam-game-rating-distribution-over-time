    review: 'As a fan of the original Populous games, I must say Reprisal Universe
      is a good title. There are some quirks regarding the cursor, but this can be
      mitigated by clicking and dragging whilst terraforming.


      The graphics are obviously an upgrade from the 16-bit Populous titles, and the
      ability to form flat areas quickly is a big plus.


      I''m 2 & 1/2 hours and 7% into the game (never mind what Steam is reporting,
      since the game can be played without opening the Steam client) and I''m still
      having a good time. It''s becoming more difficult, but so far it has not been
      unfair.


      Also, to whoever was saying all the AI factions only target you, I don''t think
      that''s the case, as I''ve seen other factions getting destroyed without my
      involvement.


      This game is worth the low price, imo!'
