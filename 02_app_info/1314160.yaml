      \ Mechanic Simulator is a game in which you are a mechanic working on one of\
      \ the first Martian colonies. Your main tasks include the repair and maintenance\
      \ of Mars rovers, so that the remaining crew can collect detailed information\
      \ about the structure of the Red Planet.<br><br>In this free version of Rover\
      \ Mechanic Simulator you will be able to play through the whole tutorial of\
      \ the game and learn everything you need to know about repairing and maintaining\
      \ Mars Rovers before playing the full version. Your save files from this game\
      \ will also work on the full game so don't worry and have fun!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\
      >Use various devices!</h2><br>There are many devices at your disposal that will\
      \ allow you to dismantle and maintain even the smallest parts of the rover.\
      \ Use different tools such as a 3D printer, recycling machine, overhead crane,\
      \ soldering iron and many more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Fix damaged PCBs</h2><br><img\

      \ workbenches to repair damaged PCBs, clean and maintain parts that have worn\
      \ out during rover's work. Thanks to this, you can save resources for much more\
      \ difficult tasks.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Gain Experience</h2><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1314160/extras/disassembly2.gif?t=1609608545\"\

      \ Are you a tinkerer who enjoys disassembling devices into small parts? Become\
      \ a technician! But if you prefer to precisely analyze the damaged parts and\
