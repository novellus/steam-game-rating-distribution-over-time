    review: "I initially got the game for the music, and it is really good funny light\
      \ hearted music.\n\nThe game itself is funny - if you love cats or have pet\
      \ cats,  now you know what they think about -  how to knock off everything from\
      \ your table for the high score.\n\nQuick Review:  You are a cat, run aound\
      \ the house and make trouble.  It is comical fun.\n\nOdd how cats are either\
      \ sleeping ... or sleeping ...  or running around bonkers.  \nBut that's how\
      \ cats think, probably would sleep less and explore more if they were outside\
      \ cats.\n\nI bought Catlateral Damage on sale, and I enjoyed it.  Thanks for\
      \ the good music too ! :-)"
