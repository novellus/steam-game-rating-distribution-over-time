    about_the_game: '<h2 class="bb_tag">Tomomi: Denkitomodachi</h2><br>Jump into the
      shoes of Haru Takamoto! A pretty average young man who just wants to get through
      his life without making too much noise. Haru''s dream of having a somewhat boring,
      average life is blown away when he is suddenly met with a series of complex
      decisions regarding a girl he meets on his travels called Tomomi. Though, this
      girl isn''t like your average person... she''s a Denkito. What does that mean?
      That means she wasn''t conceived in the traditional sense by man and woman,
      but rather she was born in a factory. Tomomi was built to an exact specification
      and for all intents and purposes, she meets it pretty well. There is just one
      problem with that... Tomomi is supposed to be locked away for the rest of her
      operational life.<br><br>Let''s just hope the authorities don''t find out, for
      both of their sake.'

    short_description: Haru Takamoto's life is turned upside down when he is suddenly
      burdened with a rogue Denkitomodachi on his doorstep. He could get in a lot
      of trouble for even speaking to her, but he's a sucker for cute girls! Even
      if this girl in particular is artificially made.
