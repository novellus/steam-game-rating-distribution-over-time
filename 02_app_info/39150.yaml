    review: 'It was quite difficult to get my controller input to work, and it took
      a few hours for the story to get going, but afterwards it became an excellent
      game. (Around the time I learned I could press F1 to accelerate time during
      walking around and climbing on ladders and other slow stuff, but that might
      just be a coincidence.) There''s a lot to complain about, don''t get em wrong;
      the junction system, the frustrating-and-frantic pseudo-realtime turn based
      gameplay, the fact that characters'' faces are made from 5 sided polygons, etc,
      but this is ultimately a good game, even without any nostalgia, as I had never
      played it before. Overall: 7/10.


      If you''re a fan of the Final Fantasy series, you should play this game. If
      not, you''re better off starting at X, as I believe it''s the best one.


      The remastered version didn''t work on my computer, otherwise I would have played
      that.'
