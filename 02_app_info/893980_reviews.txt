It shows how each Kanji looks when it's written, when it's printed, it's English meanings and it's Kun'yomi and On'yomi readings (though these are in Romaji, so if you prefer the readings to be in Hiragana/Katakana you're out of luck). You definitely don't need it, but if you have a few dollars spare then it's a cool thing to have and reading through it makes for some nice revision.","timestamp_created":1604745677,"timestamp_updated":1604745677,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jPmS0fUCf6zwrAI="}
