Below are my main thoughts on the game.\n\nPROS (Strongest To Weakest):\nStory - While the story is basic, I could tell that a lot of effort was put into it.\nLevels - Each level design is unique and true to its nature.\nEnemies - The game contains a pretty wide range of enemies. I noticed a few enemy types to be similar, but this didn't bother me.\nBosses - A nice touch to the game.\nItem Shop - Has items to aid you in the game. Pretty balanced system. Although I didn't really need the items.\nStructure - A little sloppy, but really impressive, considering this is the developers first game.\nItem Lottery - I believe this system needs to be more randomized as, throughout the entire game, I got the same reward.\n\nCONS (Strongest To Weakest):\nLength - The game took about 45 minutes to complete. Take this into consideration before buying. (Still Worth Money) \nAnnoyances - I thought the breaks at the endgame cutscenes were a bit to long.\nGlitches - The only glitch I was able to find, is that when you defeat a boss, enemies continue spawning after the games says \"Level Complete\"\n\nI personally recommend that you purchase the game, but wether or not you want to spend $3 is up to you. I hope the above information helps in this decision. Thanks for reading!\n\nNOTE FOR DEVELOPER: Great game! I hope you continue this series in the future! If you do, I hope you take the points I made in my review into consideration. \n","timestamp_created":1517277561,"timestamp_updated":1517277561,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.533897936344146729","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1517298994,"developer_response":"Thank you very much for the excellent review, I really appreciate the time and effort you put into it! \n\nThe cons list will help me majorly when I release the next Stick Adventures game! \n\nThank you again, I'm glad you enjoyed!\n\nSincerely,\nVince"}],"cursor":"AoJ4isiyouECdc7BlwE="}
