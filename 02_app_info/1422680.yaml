    review: "If you want to unfriend or simply let someone know you don't like them,\
      \ in a most hateful of ways...leave this steaming pile of dog turds on their\
      \ Steam Library doorstep.\nThe controls, if they actually work...made this boy\
      \ very sad? The jump button just simply stops working on level 2, making you\
      \ have to restart, over and over, until it, by chance, decides to work long\
      \ enough to complete the level.\nThankfully, it worked on the 3rd level...too\
      \ bad the level itself is glitched all to hell. \nI can't figure out if the\
      \ devs are just sadistic worshipers of the unholy, attempting to spread anger\
      \ and rage across the land. or if they actually tried...and unlike the Engine\
      \ that could....they in fact, could not...make a game worth playing.\n\nThat\
      \ said...it takes a lot for me to realize I truly hate a game...and the level\
      \ at which this game excelled at making me not even want to finish it and get\
      \ the achievements (which I of course did), in and of itself was an accomplishment.\
      \ \nSo hats off to that. A+"
