      /><br><br>Gunsmith is a industrial management experience where you start your
      own arms manufacturing company. You begin by inheriting a small factory where
      you shall start forging your empire.<br><br>Acquire licences or don't, to begin
      making your first military grade items. You will build up your factory by unlocking
      machines and technologies. You start with very little and the government will
      not allow you to produce more serious items until your reputation has grown.

      by making small almost harmless things such as boots, trousers, vests with no

      push politicians into certain ways and cause conflicts on the basis of selling
      more arms to create even more profit. ( This is by no means inspired by anything

    review: "Must play if you liked Factorio, Production Line, Satisfactory.\nIt's\
      \ a really good game, it's in Early Access so remember that.\nKeep it on your\
      \ wishlist if you don't like Early Access, it's extremely promising and the\
      \ devs are consistent, and communicate with their consumers. \n\n[h1] Easily\
      \ 20 hours of gameplay. Definitely can get to 40-50 if you don't rush it. [/h1]"
