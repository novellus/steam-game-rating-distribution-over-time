    review: 'This game has become a standard for party style games in my library.  This
      game is surprisingly complex, and can be very competitive.  It''s easy to play,
      and the ships have stats that differ slightly and lend themselves to different
      playstyles, whether you want to be the first to the finish, or destroy your
      opponents right off the starting line.  It also has catchy chiptune style music,
      if you''re into that.


      If you have multiple xbox controllers and friends, I highly recommend this game.  The
      more players the better.'
