    about_the_game: Experience the End Times in style! This DLC contains a bold new
      look for the Waywatcher Kerillian. The new skin is applied when downloaded (to
      revert, simply uninstall).<h2 class="bb_tag">Tirsyth Garment</h2>The Elves of
      Athel Loren's other realms consider the Ashenhall to be a drab and sombre place.
      As proof they point to the lugubrious character of its in inhabitants and the
      cinereal colourings of their raiment. There is no joyful song in Ashenhall,
      they say, just the dirges of Elves who live ever under the shadow of death.
      In truth, the Elves of Tirsyth are no more fatalistic than others of their kind
      - they simply revere life as fervently as they do its start. So do Ashenhall's
      Elves fill their glades with intricate moonstone statues of the departed, so
      that they might remember and honour the deceased even if their kin elsewhere
      in the forest do not. The forest spirits respect this gesture for reasons of
      their own, and groves of Treemen have sprung up around statues of those Elves
      beloved of the forest. Woe betide he who interferes with such a shrine.

    review: The reskin looks all-right, but it does not fit with any of the elven
      hoods, as they are all green.
