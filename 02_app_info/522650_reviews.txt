Woo!\nRating bumped up by 0.5, portions in the review that are no longer applicable struck out and edited.[/i]\n\nPicked this up as soon as I could - mere hours after its release. All great chiptune songs - I generally like that genre of songs.\n\nThis pack comes with 3 songs and 3 associated arena challenges. I personally find them slightly more challenging than their similarly-rated counterparts, and the reason for this is [strike]twofold: one,[/strike] the note charts are a lot more technical, even though the songs are not really fast [strike], and two, you are restricted to using a specific set of abilities since you can only play them in Free Play[/strike].\n\n[strike]I do feel a bit disappointed, like a few others, that I can't use my preferred party setup. But this [i]will[/i] be changed in the future - and even if not, on the flip side of the coin I relish in learning how to adapt and still nail the high score runs.[/strike]\n\nThe arena challenges offer interesting equipment as rewards - not strictly overpowered enough to be essential, but still fun enough to spice up your game with new interesting item combinations.\n\nAnd, like the rest of the game's base soundtrack, the songs in here (especially Flow Unlimited) are now stuck in my head.\n\n[h1]When to buy[/h1]\nIf you like replaying for high scores you'll definitely get a lot of mileage out of your 2 bucks. Just be warned, the more difficult songs will have you close to playing Twister with your fingers.\n\n[b][h1]9.5/10[/h1][/b]","timestamp_created":1476096723,"timestamp_updated":1477641677,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.66313016414642334","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jNWThdgCec+FYw=="}
