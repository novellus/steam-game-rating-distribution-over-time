      /><br>A near-future faction with advaned techonlogy units. GAIA get experiences
      from battlefield to unlock new abilities, both passive and active. Active ability
      is the game changer, like massive repair which can recover HP for friendly units
      in the zone, or Quake Missile, which can directly kill most land amor units
      directly.<br>GAIA is also benefit much more from vertain units than the other
      two faction. When a unit grow up to vertain level, it will  refund 100% of its
      cost, and for land vehicles it will add a laser guard system to block incoming
      missiles.<br><br><br><i><strong>Faction 2: Steel Alliance</strong></i><br><img

      /><br>A traditional military faction with balanced air and land force. Its technology
      system is very special and more effect on defending resource points.<br>Steel
      Alliance do not gain experience from battle to level up, but get a buff from
      how much resource points it captured. There are 6 powerful passive buff, when
      the player captured 1 point, the first 2 buffs actived, like +20% attack range
      to Hummv and APC. When captured 2 points, another 2 buffs actived, like add
      an gatting gun on the turret of the main battle tank.  Finally when the player
      captured all resource points, all the 6 buffs are available and now it is unstopable.<br><br>There
      is also an intersting building, the artillery field. It has 3 howtizers, each
      one watch over one resource point. When the resource point is captured by the
      player, the according howtizer will fire automatically to the enemies nearby.<br><br><br><i><strong>Faction
      3: Legion</strong></i><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1114830/extras/Legion_small.png?t=1597630670"
      /><br>The Legion is a faction containing 2 identical unit groups, the mecenary
      band and the Legion troop.<br>At the early stage of the game, its forces are
      made of fast speed, hit and run mecernaries. Its technology system contains
      a count down timer called &quot;Legion Tech Time&quot;. Destroy one enemy will
      reduce 5 second and level up will reduce 30 sec. When the Legion Tech Time comes,
      it will unlock the Legion Factory, to make the powerfull Legion Troop like twin
      cannon tank.<br>So the Legion faction has 2 different phase in the gameplay.
      At the early stage use mercenaries to hit and run, get experience and reduce
      the Legion Time as possible, and in the late stage, an iron tide of Legion units
      will destroy the enemy.'
