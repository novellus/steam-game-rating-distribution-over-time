      yuri (girls' love) game created for a game jam. <br><br>As the saying goes,
      dead men tell no tales. They only leave tales behind. <br><br>Toma Andrews,
      aged 14, has always felt like an outsider. She enjoys spending time in graveyards,
      and feels more comfortable among the dead than the living. <br>That is, until
      Toma meets a strange girl in her local graveyard who might be a real ghost.
      <br>The girl asks Toma if she will stay for a while and listen to a story. A
      story about a girl called Emmeline Burns, who died a tragic death back in 1851.
      <br>Toma is compelled to listen, but at the same time, she feels uneasy. After
      all, what can she do? How could she ever hope to help somebody who has already
      died?
