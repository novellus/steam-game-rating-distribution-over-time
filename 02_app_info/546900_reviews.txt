Combat is wonkey, it felt easier to just keep shooting and recover my health after a fight. As far as i can tell there are about 7 missions so it is a rather short game. The riddles seemed ok but due to a rhythm game about 30% into the game i got locked out of the rest of the content. This game would've been a definitive refund. Sadly i own it for a while aready and just tried it out. \n\nI can excuse a lot in a game especially if it is cheap but not beeing able to finish a game because of a pretty flawed design decission is a no go for me. Puzzles were advertised but not a rhythm game and i am not talking about an easy one.","timestamp_created":1609588110,"timestamp_updated":1609700457,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ovfn5PYCetXZvwI="}
