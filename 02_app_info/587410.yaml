    review: "TOTAL SCAM\nthis pack was released more than a year ago, and the devs\
      \ said that it would be only available during beta, and we should buy it soon,\
      \ i bought it, and its still on sale \n\nthis pack also says that we will got\
      \ all future pilots, since the release, no other pilot was released, in fact,\
      \ not a single thing was added to the game\n\nDONT BUY IT\n\nEdit: more than\
      \ a year and a half after this pack was released, they released another pilot,\
      \ on the meantime they removed ingame upgrades, and a lot of content, still,\
      \ dont buy this"
