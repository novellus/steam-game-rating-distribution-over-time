I waited for it to release and bought almost immediately after it did. However it's just not what I expected. \n\nLet me preface by saying that I have a soft spot for rpg maker games. There was a point in my life where all I had was a hand-me-down PC, slow internet access and barely enough cash to scrape by on. I played free rpg maker games to unwind. I still pick one up now and then to enjoy. \n\nLet me start with what I liked. The mapping and character art is great. This game looks really polished. Sprawling maps to explore. I love nothing more than grabbing a pencil and keeping track of maps and where I have yet to explore. This game has a nifty map option that helps you see exits on each map. I really enjoyed that.\n\nI do intend to persevere with Lotia and finish it but I put it down for the following reasons:\n\n1. Random encounter battles with the same redundant fight over and over again. I could tolerate this usually but exploring the huge maze like maps and having a battle every five steps is just gluttony for punishment. If I'm rolling my eyes at the start of each battle, here's your sign.\n\n2. Lackadaisical character development. I have no feelings for the characters whatsoever because I had no introduction to them. The game began with a brief cut scene that tried to play out with urgency but failed. I have little information about the characters in which to gauge their motivations for being who they are and doing what they do. You simply handed a party of the standard classes of rpg characters and expected to give hoot about their job/plight and I just wasn't able to muster it BECAUSE.....\n\n3. You are bombarded with books/tomes of try-hard science-fictiony lore that reads like they plucked the worst writer from the syfy channel and tasked them with this portion of the game. After reading about 15 of the long winded tomes I decided I didn't give a **** about the dream world or it's history. I quit reading them. They are BORING and convoluted nonsense. They try to weave a dreamworld setting where everyone exists in an alternate reality....or wait....is everyone asleep....no wait....that can't be it....it's just all jumbled up in my head and I can't make sense of it because the premise sucks. It sucks. It's dumb. I'm sorry.\n\n4. It's easy. I've played a shit ton of rpg's in the past 15 years. FFVII was my first. I recently beat FFXV. Chrono Trigger. The tales series. The Lunar games. The Trails games....you get the point. There is no challenge here. They try to hide the challenge behind beasts that stand for emotions but it's just a facade for the basics.\n\n5. The world map is a list. You select a location from the list. Usually the first point on the list is where you are coming from (a town). Then there are a few random maps with some loot and the last point is the general destination you are supposed to be going to. You explore momentarily, nab a chest or two, exit the map and select another point from the list. The more fun maps to explore are the target destinations. It's a weird way to do an overworld map and it would be forgivable if it weren't for problems 1-4.\n\nI don't know guys. I keep thinking about all the free or super cheap rpg maker games I've played over the years that stole my heart. Even if this one had been free, I don't think I would have finished it. Since I paid for it and played too long for a refund I will try to finish but I'm disappointed.
