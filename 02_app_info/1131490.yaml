    about_the_game: 'Embark on a quest in search of ultimate power, lying in the hands
      of a hoarding entity. Between your goal and you lie a series of challenging
      levels and colorful areas that, despite their harmless and welcoming appearance,
      will not hesitate to send you back to the starting line if you miss a beat.<br><br>With
      a stripped down, three-button input system, you''ll have to master the skills
      of walking, jumping, dodging deadly hazards, sprinting, gliding and flying...
      all while on ice! Even the ground you walk on poses a threat!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1131490/extras/giffy.gif?t=1576785286"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features</h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><u>PLATFORMING...
      ON ICE</u>: Originally an entry for an ice-themed jam, the frozen landscapes
      you''ll traverse will have you sliding right into harm''s way should you not
      be careful. Watch your speed and momentum, especially under wind currents!<br></li><li><u>MOVEMENT
      ABILITIES</u>: Essential to beat the trickier challenges, forcing you to re-think
      how you move around. Double jump to reach new heights, glide through air streams
      to increase your maneuverability or sprint at a high speed to clear large chasms!<br></li><li><u>50
      LEVELS</u>: Split up on four different areas, each with their own distinct look
      and feel.<br></li><li><u>A BETTER FINAL BOSS</u>: Deadlier and nastier than
      before; he''s been re-built from the ground-up to crush you again. Again. And
      Again.<br></li><li><u>NEW GAME+ MODE</u>: Was the first time too easy? Do you
      just like suffering? Every level (even the boss!) now has a tweaked, more lethal
      variant just waiting for you.<br></li><li><u>ACHIEVEMENTS AND SECRETS</u>: Aside
      from the standard progress and challenge types, there are also cryptic and secret
      feats that unlock a small bonus game!<br></li><li><u>TIMED MODE</u>: Do you
      keep your cool if there''s small time and death counters staring at you constantly,
      watching your every move and mistake? What if you couldn''t even pause to breathe?</li></ul>'
