That said this is still early access and admittedly needs some work.\nThe community is active for its size and the developers are very open to feedback at this stage of the game.\nThe graphics are fantastic.\nRecently there was a major update, adding many new weapons, and a new map, along with an overhaul of an existing map\n\nThe Bad: The player base is rather small and outside dev dallies and community events you are unlikely to find someone to play with.\nProject genesis lacks a tutorial aside from a video\n\nOverall I personally love this game, but advise hesitation if you think you will jump into a larger community, that said dev dallies are at 5pm pst and 11am pst and i would love to see you there.","timestamp_created":1592623557,"timestamp_updated":1596419714,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwvfWB2fMCedGHjwI="}
