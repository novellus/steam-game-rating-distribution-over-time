If it says anything, this is the first OST I've bought of the 220 something games I have on Steam. If I could buy it twice, heck, even three times, I would.","timestamp_created":1598200629,"timestamp_updated":1598200756,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8oaMjvQCdvymnQI="}
