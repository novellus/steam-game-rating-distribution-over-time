    about_the_game: "British Railways decided that changes in the steel industry would\
      \ require the use of more bogie vehicles, and as a consequence built a number\
      \ of different designs. The wagons, fitted with bolsters to support the load,\
      \ were mainly grouped according to length (and hence the nominal capacity).\
      \ The largest were classed as Bogie Bolster D, being 52ft in length with a load\
      \ capacity of 42 tons.<br><br>The first Bogie Bolster D wagons built for BR\
      \ were 150 vehicles built at Derby in 1949 to an LMS design, which BR described\
      \ as Diagram 1/470. This featured five fixed bolsters and lashing down rings\
      \ on the solebar and the wagon was carried on LMS diamond frame bogies. The\
      \ next 200 vehicles were to an LNER design, appearing in 1950, as Lot 2211 to\
