    about_the_game: "Some say the old train station and hotel are a 'haunted hotspot',\
      \ hidden away in the woods, forgotten by some, feared by others. The old hallways\
      \ and train platforms echo with the ghosts of many eras, all trapped within\
      \ the very fabric of the place, each hoping for salvation. The dusty old rooms\
      \ seem possessed, exhibiting 'time slips' as the past becomes the present. You\
      \ must tread very carefully, or you too many join the Lost Souls forever. So,\
      \ why are you here? <br><br>Amy Haven went missing 5 Years ago. On the anniversary\
      \ of the child's disappearance you, the Police Inspector who failed to find\
      \ her, has returned to the Train Station and Hotel one last time. As you attempt\
      \ to solve the mystery of Amy's disappearance you must face the horrors of your\
      \ past. Someone, or something, does not want you to solve the mystery, that\
      \ much is clear. Never turn your back on the darkness....for something hides\
      \ there; something evil, unknowable and hungry.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key features:</h2><ul\
