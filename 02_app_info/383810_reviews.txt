The visuals are not bad but the gameplay is basic and takes far too many cues from 'rage' games, throwing enemies and pitfalls at the player that they couldn't reasonably be expected to avoid without prior knowledge. The level design is run-of-the-mill and requires pixel perfect positioning to avoid damage from enemy attacks.\n\nOverall I just didn't find the game rewarding or enjoyable; I was sick of it within 20 minutes. There are plenty of these 'retro inspired' platformers on Steam and most of them are better and cheaper than this. Go play one of those instead.","timestamp_created":1488563794,"timestamp_updated":1488563794,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhZ7UytoCea/Kcw=="}
