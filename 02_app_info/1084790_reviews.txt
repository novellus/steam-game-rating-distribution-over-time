I enjoy it more than games like HoI IV or War in the East which are too tedious and complicated and Strategic Command WWII which is too simple and not realistic to my taste.\n\nI think WarPlan strikes the right balance between realism and playability. There are all the main mechanisms under the hood to make it realistic without the need to micromanage things that won't change the course of the war. I think it makes a lot of sense to apply different mechanics for land and naval and it works really well in WarPlan, the goal being to try to simulate as best as possible the look and feel of actual engagement... Supply is another element very important that I think is working very well. \n","timestamp_created":1609826235,"timestamp_updated":1609826235,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p97H6PYCc9POwAI="}
