      \ maybe counterfeit cash!<br><br><strong>Multiplayer Coop</strong> - Play with\
      \ 5 of your friends in Fastidious! Keep in mind that everyone doesn\u2019t have\

      \ a remote commander where they have access to blueprints over the building\
      \ and can access the police radios etc.<br><br><strong>Hostage Negotiations</strong>\
      \ - Negotiate your way out for the price of a hostage! Maybe you need a getaway\

      \ you!<br><br><strong>Freeplay</strong> - You\u2019re not forced to do anything\
      \ or do it in a certain way, instead it\u2019s up to you how you roll. <br><br><strong>PvP\
