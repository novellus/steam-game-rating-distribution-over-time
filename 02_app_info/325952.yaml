    review: In one word, disappointing. Terrible sound, flaky handling and imo this
      loco has bugs. You do not really know what you're doing because the instruments
      do not give you any clue and all those nice screens have no function. On top
      of this, the manual is very basic and gives no solutions to possible errors
      or problems. Refund requested.
