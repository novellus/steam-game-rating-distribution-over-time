I used to play this all the time on PS2 and Gamecube back in the day. Your objective is simple. Get through each level, find the keys, kill a bunch of mutated monsters, and have fun! You start with an infinite ammo machinegun and a jetpack to help you get from one floor to another on an abandoned and deteriorating space station. Just know that it is an older game, so there may be some bugs. For me, the xbox one controller won't work but I think an xbox360 one will but have yet to test it as it has been years since my last time playing. Overall, things have worked just fine for me aside from an error message at launch but doesn't seem to affect gameplay in any way.","timestamp_created":1600629753,"timestamp_updated":1600629753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yvi91vQCe4+GowI="}
