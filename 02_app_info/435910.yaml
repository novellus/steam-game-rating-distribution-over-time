    review: The soundtrack for [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/383870/Firewatch/]
      Firewatch [/url] is one of my personal favorite videogame soundtracks. Composed
      by Chris Remo, the soundtrack present throughout [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/383870/Firewatch/]
      Firewatch [/url] adds a lot to the game and its overall atmosphere. Not only
      do tracks like Prologue add emotional depth, but tracks like Camp Approach and
      Stay in Your Tower and Watch make exploration and gameplay feel more lively.
      Furthermore, the original song Ol' Shoshone, written by Sean Vanaman, is a nice
      addition as well. Overall, the soundtrack for [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/383870/Firewatch/]
      Firewatch [/url] is just excellent, and although it's available on streaming
      services, you can purchase it here if you'd like to support the composers and
      the developers.
