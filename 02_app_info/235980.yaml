    review: "Tetrobot and Co. has you flying a little robot around who can pick up\
      \ blocks from a distance and throw them, but only along the row they're in.\
      \ Each block material, like wood or stone, interacts in different ways with\
      \ the various traps and gizmos that are introduced throughout the game. While\
      \ the main level objectives have some neat ideas in them, the truly great puzzles\
      \ come from collecting the three golden memory blocks found in each level. In\
      \ fact, if you like challenging puzzles, I'd suggest pretending they're mandatory.\n\
      \nNot every puzzle is a hit, sadly \u2014 towards the end of the game, just\
      \ as everything is ramping up, some gimmicky puzzles are thrown in that are\
      \ a little disappointing. Not only that but the game seems to get buggier towards\
      \ the end, particularly with some of the real-time elements, so be prepared\
      \ to undo a puzzle into an uncheesed state out of upstanding puzzle solver principle.\
      \ Nonetheless, many of the complex multi-room memory block puzzles are wonderful\
      \ to wrap your head around and are still worth the time."
