    review: "Update\n----------------\n\nRuns under Linux Mint 19 (Ubuntu) using the\
      \ (relatively new) Proton 5.13.  Sometimes still crashes at launch, but 2-4\
      \ tries and it will be stable each time.\n\n+++ Ooo-oo! Custom portraits! I\
      \ love these.  Gotta scan in and color some drawings.\n\nWell....custom characters\
      \ are not intuitive:  \n1) Go to Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Stranger of Sword\
      \ City\\PICTUREGATE\\   \n2) Choose a folder per character   \n3) Each folder\
      \ need 4 files labeled as userImgA,B,C,and D.  thats an i not L.   \n4) userImgA\
      \ [746 x 720 pixels. This is your main character image!]    \n    userImgB [350\
      \ x 380 pixels. This is the portrait that displays in your party.]    \n   \
      \ userImgC [160 x 240 pixels. This is your character creation/selection portrait.]\
      \     \n    userImgD [146 x 32 pixels. This is the mini icon that displays during\
      \ combat.]     \n5) Look in the USERDATA folder for examples of framing.   \
      \  \n6) Save as either.jpg, .bmp, or .png  Png and Bmp are recommended for the\
      \ transparency layer.     \n7) yes, userImgA is wider than it is tall.     \n\
      8) IMPORTANT, images must be imported in the options menu.  The game doesnt\
      \ tell you this unless you f*** around for 3 hours with the Userdata folder\
      \ enough that an error appears.       \n9) Where in the Options??? There are\
      \ tiny TAB buttons in the  corners of the screen.  Miss them?  I sure did. \
      \ hence the 3 hours of trying to figure this out.  \n\nCool! Now I have my character\
      \ for this fantasy game!  I have imported my DnD elf cleric!\n\n---The main\
      \ character must be human.   S***.  Continue anyways and deal with dialogue\
      \ as it comes.  \n\n---Ooooooh.  The schoolgirl on the cover isn't japanese\
      \ fanservice.....there are too many not so subtle hints that you, the PC, are\
      \ a human who fell through a portal from earth and all earthlings are stronger\
      \ here, hence the schoolgirl using a bastard sword.  Well......there goes my\
      \ fantasy game immersion.  \n\n---Combat! I read that it's no cakewalk, even\
      \ for beginner, but seriously, all the mobs are 10 levels higher and one shot\
      \ me.  Ok, I'll just defend and heal while the schoolgirl swings for 10 turns.\
      \  I still die.  what fun.  Hope it doesnt count against my hearts for permadeath\
      \ or this will be REAL short.  She revives me, no consequence, she tells me\
      \ to be more confident and attack more.\n\nNext fight. dead turn 1.  Schoolgirl\
      \ diablo-click till win.  fun.\nNext fight. Dead turn 1. Schoolgirl diablo-clicks\
      \ twice as long for a win.\n(Yes, I used her Taunt skill.  They all still attacked\
      \ me.)\n\nSave point.  Motivation is fully gone now.\n\nIt may sound petty,\
      \ but the first impressions are: \n1) No, you are either a boy or girl human.\
      \  Athlete or a gamer.\n2) Look how much you suck at everything!  Be careful\
      \ of one hit permadeath! (Good for DarkSouls, bad for RNG evasion)\n3) We broke\
      \ our own rule of permadeath to show you how much cooler our characters are\
      \ compared to yours.  \n\nI am building a sandcastle, it must look traditional,\
      \ A bully can randomly kick it over, I can do nothing; the bully's sister will\
      \ beat up the bully.  Nothing matters because she is still grouped with he bully\
      \ and my sandcastle is still smashed.\n\n==========\nOriginal\n-----------------\n\
