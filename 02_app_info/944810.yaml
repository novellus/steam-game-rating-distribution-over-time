    review: '[i] My Experience [/i]


      Family Practice has the same irritations as Pet Rescue 911, namely the inability
      to earn gold hearts (which screws with your ability to get check-out bonuses)
      and the wait time before a "customer" knows what they want. The wait time isn''t
      hard to get used to, but in most of the other GameHouse time management games,
      customers know what they want immediately upon arrival. The gold heart issue
      doesn''t seriously hinder your ability to easily earn the highest "grade" on
      each level, but it does complicate the ability to earn the "Purrfect" combo
      (checking out four customers at once). Doing this, in my experience, basically
      required you to allow a customer or two to lose hearts.


      However, the game still has the same engrossing feel as the other GameHouse
      time management titles. It''s still engaging to keep track of your stock of
      items, prepare the most time-consuming items in advance, and to quickly complete
      the mini-games. It felt like it took a bit too long to restock items, even after
      you''d bought the associated upgrade, but this wasn''t a huge deal.


      The biggest changes in Family Practice are the "daily challenge" system and
      the system of pet ownership. I didn''t necessarily dislike these systems, but
      they did feel more like "game as service" features, encouraging you to log on
      frequently in order to "get the most" out of these features. From time-to-time,
      your pets will ask for something, and their neediness meter counts down even
      when you''re not actively playing the game. If it''s been a while since you''ve
      played the game, your pets will have these scowls on their faces when you visit
      them as though you''ve betrayed them in some way.


      The other big change is the "choice" system. At certain times during the story,
      you''ll have the opportunity to make a choice for one of the characters that
      has some impact on the overall story arc. I had no problems with the system
      itself and welcomed the change to the formula.


      I have mixed feelings about the story overall, however. Alice (Amy''s mother)
      evoked strong emotions in me. If you would''ve told me beforehand that Amy was
      estranged from her mother, I would have imagined that perhaps her mother left
      when she was very young to pursue a lucrative career or something to this effect.
      Many saccharine stories like these feature this sort of set-up. I was then very
      surprised to find Alice to be a genuinely toxic person, and I wouldn''t be surprised
      at all if you were to tell me that she has Borderline Personality Disorder (I
      believe that she meets some of the diagnostic criteria).


      After I finished the game, I was pleased with how each story arc resolved. However,
      when I looked at the achievement list, I found that I had missed the achievement
      for getting the "best" endings. [spoiler] Apparently, the developers would prefer
      that Amy allow her mother to continue poisoning her life instead of creating
      meaningful and healthy boundaries. [/spoiler] This soured me a little bit on
      the title, but I think it''s noteworthy that the game even elicited this kind
      of reaction in me. I''ve run through many of these GameHouse games not thinking
      overmuch about the storyline, so it was refreshing to find this one so engaging.


      If you like GameHouse time management titles, you''ll probably like this one
      as well. I liked the "choice" feature (which I haven''t seen in any other GameHouse
      game), but wasn''t as big a fan of pet management and daily challenges.'
