    review: "The adventure itself is nice and structured, the art in it has little\
      \ to reveal about the section  it is in, (the art for the tavern is half an\
      \ undead face) and in some cases raw (background story art is something apparently\
      \ done by a 12 year old), the battlemaps are trash (the battlemap for the fight\
      \ at a library is  a giant stone floor with nothing else, and the battlemap\
      \ for the tavern looks more like a meeting room with a single huge table) \n\
      Not recomended at the price of 7\u20AC"
