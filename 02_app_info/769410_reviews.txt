The idea is you build a maze that forces the enemy to pass your towers numerous times. You don't get much resources to build many towers and your towers do very little damage, you rely on the enemies keep passing them to slowly whittle them down. I didnâ€™t like this, I prefer a shorter route and my towers actually do some damage. There are 4 standard towers which can be upgraded to a further 8 special towers however, pretty much every tower is useless except for 2.\n\nIf you are aiming to 100% this game you need to beat 9 basic maps and 8 challenge maps on any difficulty and pass wave 50 of a random endless map on insane difficulty. This is where my issues start. One of the challenge maps is considerably harder than all the other maps. I beat it eventually on normal but I don't believe it can be beaten on hard or insane.\n\nNext, I'm not convinced endless wave 50 can be legitimately beaten. My playtime shows 44 hours but I've spent around a further 20 hours off-line planning my layouts on a spreadsheet. I've put a lot of effort in to trying to beat it and I can't even get close. On the later waves your under powered towers have to contend with enemies with huge amounts of health and have incredibly powerful buffs.\n\nAt time of writing 4.2% of players have done this which is high and would suggest it's not that difficult. However there is a glitch where it is quite common to get a blank random map with no enemies and you can simply hit go 50 times to get the achievement.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, perhaps I'm overlooking something obvious but it's not a very popular game so there is little to no help available. If anyone can prove my accusations wrong I'll retract my negative review.","timestamp_created":1607106023,"timestamp_updated":1607106099,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4856/l/YCeZqntwI="}
