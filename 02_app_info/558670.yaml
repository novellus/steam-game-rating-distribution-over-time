    review: 'You receive a cry for help from the caretaker of an orphanage which burned
      recently. Everyone disappeared and the building was hiding orphans with paranormal
      habilities. Given the fact that the caretaker is also missing, it''s up to you
      to help them to come back in their physical forms: they''re not dead but if
      you don''t hurry, they might be... What is the truth behind these walls?


      This is a sequel to Mystic Hospital and if you''ve played the CE Edition, you
      learned in the bonus chapter that a member of a brotherhood is supervising an
      orphanage... which is Cinderstone. So, it''s not a shock to find yourself at
      this destination. The plot is also good: you help the "ghosts" with their most
      prized belongings and they''re giving you their powers so that you can advance
      in the story. It''s just the end that is quite hard to make sense (and it''s
      more confusing in the bonus chapter). Who was really behind all that? I mean,
      yeah, I''ve understood who was the real culprit but I still don''t understand
      how he managed to pull all that?


      Anyway, Cinderstone Orphanage has the same mechanics of Mystic Hospital: you
      find items, you use them, you solve minigames and you''re searching for hidden
      objects, some even hidden in hidden scenes (red items). You have also a second
      type of hidden scenes: replace items at their right place. I would say that
      the game isn''t not so difficult but it''s true that some minigames need more
      thinking. I will not say that everything make sense (it''s an hidden object
      game, so searching for vital items hidden where you don''t expect them is normal)
      but at least, it''s reasonable. Besides, I''ve noticed that hidden objects in
      a word list often find themselves being used in a replace scene. Also, searching
      for postcards returned, so, it''s nice to have collectibles to find.


      The real new feature is the use of the powers. Mystic Hospital spoke about paranormal
      stuff but even being stored in the Nexus didn''t help. Here, the Nexus comes
      back but you can use the powers that the caretaker and the kids let you borrow.
      It means that you can change the size of the items, see through walls, use telekinesis,
      repair broken stuff or bring pictures alive. That''s a nice addition.


      The art is still good and given the time of the year, it''s always sad to see
      an orphanage with Christmas objects and snow being destroyed. But it''s not
      so dramatic, it''s perfectly dosed. The cutscenes are also good. What disturbed
      me most is the ending, it constrast totally with the rest of the game. I also
      liked the colored powers as they''re really indicating which person holds them
      and in the end, you can see the "souls" being related.


      The soundtrack and the voice actings were good too.


      I''ve just a little problem with the bonus chapter: the minigames are repetitive
      (which is a recurring fact in the series, it''s worse in the next game) and
      you always have the impression that there is more hidden objects scenes than
      in the first game. I like bonus chapter and as in Mystic Hospital, you get a
      clue of where your next adventure will happen, but if it''s to be axphyxiated
      by hidden objects scenes and minigames, I would prefer none.


      My conclusion is that this game is still an enjoyable one and while it''s maybe
      an old game, you can still find pleasure in it for the genre. Cinderstone Orphanage
      is a nice sequel, though Mystic Hospital was better in terms of atmosphere,
      however, the addition of the powers is a nice feature. So, go ahead for it,
      you will not regret it!'
