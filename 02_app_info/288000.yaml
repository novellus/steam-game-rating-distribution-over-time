    review: This is way to rushed. I feel they decided to make a quick cash grab.
      There is no indications wall weapons need the power there is no indication of
      what the power is. I keep getting these random masks. The juke box is way to
      expensive. There is no good way to make points. round 4 2 shots with the sword
      and round 5 the sword 8 shots. But there is potential keep updating music shouldn't
      be worried about
