    review: 'Catacombs is an interesting game with a lot of neat elements and a tense
      battle system. I''m not gonna beat around the bush here. These are the Pros
      and Cons


      Pros:

      -Very Strategic RPG battle system that has a lot of quirks. You must be always
      paying attention to your HP and MP to survive every fight.

      -Characters, a bunch of side people who have really cool textures.

      -Simplistic and Direct, no overarching story, nothing crazy, throws you right
      into the game, no bs

      -A lot of fun and stays away from being too grindy.

      -Cool settings and level design

      -Neat little side quests and in-game achievements for extra XP

      -Armor and Weapon break mechanic


      Cons:

      -Grid system hitboxes are a little off for some enemies

      -No auto-battle button

      -No Steam Achievements

      -Low sound effect variety and quality

      -Glitch where if your female companion uses magic, she uses the same sound effect
      as the guy using magic

      -You can walk into NPCs instead of clicking near them

      -Low caliber music (pretty basic and repetitive)

      -Empty World Syndrome. Tons of cabinets and drawers but none of them give items
      or even say they are empty when the models clearly show stuff on them.


      I think this game is more impressive with the combat over everything else. The
      world is kinda weird and feels slightly off as you are playing. I only played
      about an hour but I will continue to play and I will update this review accordingly
      the more I play. Overall 5/10. Average, but could be a lot better.'
