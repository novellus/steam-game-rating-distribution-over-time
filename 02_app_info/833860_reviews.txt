I love how easy it is to use and it has a great fantasy flavor/style to it.  Hand drawn and charming, and lots of great features/art which all fit/flow together well.  I cranked out my fist map in about 30 minutes (which included exploring the features/learning it for the first time) and the map looked even better than I was expecting or hoping for.  (And the river graphics they added worked great for me.)  I'm very satisfied with this product at this price.  And honestly for me- the ease of use, and the speed of production vs. output quality ratio is so good- I'd have been happy paying $20 bucks for this. Also something I really appreciate- the developers included a help menu which made it very easy for me to figure out how to use it.  I've tried several overland map making programs- and I don't see myself using any other than this one from now on.","timestamp_created":1554444468,"timestamp_updated":1554574130,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtdf1+ekCc+HLvgE="}
