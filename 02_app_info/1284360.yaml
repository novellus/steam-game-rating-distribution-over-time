      \ to make this a successful undertaking. Don\u2019t read in to the rumors that\
      \ she\u2019s apathetic or that she secretly wants you to fail so she can execute\
      \ you to satiate her bloodlust.  Instead, she\u2019s personally assigned you\
      \ an aide, Greyg, to assist you in running things. Greyg\u2019s never had a\
      \ job before but he did find the notes from the previous Alien Harvest Leader\
      \ that was executed for failing the Martian Queen, so he has some things figured\
      \ out.<br><br>Your Workers and the Martian Queen have opposing views about how\
      \ you should run things and even Greyg knows you don't want either side to become\
      \ too unhappy.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1284360/extras/GameplayHeader.png?t=1608756933\"\
      \ /><br><br>To run your base you\u2019ll need to collect Harvest Material from\

      \ on how you harvest. If you Harvest recklessly, alerting specimen to your presence\
      \ and not infiltrating, then the harvest zone will be sparse, with only a few\
      \ of the juiciest of specimen caught outside after dark. Focus too much on infiltration,\
      \ however, and you won\u2019t have secured enough Harvest Material. Either way,\
      \ we\u2019ll need to develop new technologies to handle their overzealous defenses:\

      \ need to maintain our base defenses to thwart the herd. We\u2019ll also need\
