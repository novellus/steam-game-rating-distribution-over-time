So it peaked my interest to check the movie out. \n\nAt the beginning, I eventually realized that the movie will have some fantasy element to it. The native language used was “Tagalog” however it sounded more formal than local but I guess I understand for the sake of aiming to wider audiences locally in my country. But I can’t help but to crack myself up each time the locals converse each other because it sounded like two Englishmen talk in 18th century style set up in a modern time which is hilarious and entertaining to me. \n\nActing wise, I guess it was well executed from the westerners but the locals looked more like a bunch of entertaining clowns in a good way. \n\nPlot wasn’t surprising but how it transforms from Action comedy adventure to semi-horror was a bit creepy. However, its still watchable. \n\nOverall, the movie was entertaining. Just like I said I believe that there's a lot of imagination and vision to the movie despite its limited resources knowing that it is an indie movie. However, it was a fun adventure movie overall and mostly hilarious and a bit dark on the fantasy side.”\n\nThis is best to watch with friends and make sure to have at least one Filipino for confirmations and would laugh on things non-locals won’t understand from the native Tagalog speakers.","timestamp_created":1447228112,"timestamp_updated":1455182579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":14,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551546156406402588","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ404Dp59ICf/TASA=="}
