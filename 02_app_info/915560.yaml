    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Story</h2><br>Somewhere in Hokkaido lies a
      small village of fairies, once known to the locals as 'Koropokkur.' As times
      changed, their village prohibited its residents from interacting with the human
      world and the Koropokkur were long forgotten. <br><br>However, a few of these
      young Koropokkur became fascinated with the human world and gazed upon it through
      a magic viewing pool. Asirrera, in particular, was enamored with an ancient
      Koropokkur legend of a young girl who ventured out into the human world, became
      human through the grace of Kanda's Kamuy, the local deity, and found love with
      a human man.<br><br>Asirrera summons up her courage to break the village laws
      and see the human world for herself, using her magic to transform into as small
      as an apple to human-sized!<br><br>Unfortunately, her clumsiness quickly gets
      the better of her and ruins Satoru's last ditch efforts to save the maid cafe
      he runs in Akihabara. Plagued with guilt, she offers to help make amends and
      winds up working with Satoru to help revive the cafe.<br><br>After seeing her
      plight through the viewing pool, her friends, Cirta and Haruante, leave the
      village to help. While they're both supportive of Asirrera, they also seem worried
      by her lack of urgency in fulfilling her true goal...<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul
