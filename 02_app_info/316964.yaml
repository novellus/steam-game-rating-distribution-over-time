    short_description: The MiG-21bis is a delta wing, supersonic, fighter-interceptor
      jet aircraft. Much like the AK-47 became the everymans' rifle, the MiG-21 has
      been operated by more than 40 countries worldwide, and has enjoyed the longest
      production run of any modern jet fighter to date.
