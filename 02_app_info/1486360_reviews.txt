On the other hand the Infinity Caster is easy, shoot, you can't miss.\n\nOverall, similar to the other DLC this just adds cool content. It doesn't change the game too much but is definitely worth it if you enjoy the game already.","timestamp_created":1610136665,"timestamp_updated":1610136665,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uvfn8fYCef7PwQI="}
