    about_the_game: The Game is ON is a puzzle game where you have to move things
      and click around until the situation on the screen matches some well known phrase
      or idiom from the English language. By solving the puzzles, you get jigsaw pieces.
      Collect enough pieces to unlock extra levels. You can also get jigsaw pieces
      by solving the puzzles in least possible moves and by finding pieces hidden
      in levels. Some are hidden behind other objects or produced after you manipulate
      buttons or other things on the screen.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1386280/extras/logo.png?t=1605987429"
