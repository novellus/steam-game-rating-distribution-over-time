I won't touch the story because that is clearly in development and the developer comments and works hard on making that more indepth. Kudos.\n\nMy issue, if you can even call it that, is the lack of depth to the physical appearance of the vehicles. The depth for engine building and brake ratios are great, however I would love to see that level of depth for the suspension. Axle length/width, rear end ratio, would also be great things I would love to see expanded on. Along with this a \"stress test\" for the vehicle / engine in game would be great. If you have your engine redlining on the block I would love for it to eventually blow up, valve blowby, headgaskets, sparkplugs. Along with full choice in engine placement. A mid-engine SUV?\n\nI understand this whole review is just me asking for more depth and that's not fair to be a negative review. It's just I'm just a boomer and don't know how to post this in a more appropriate/high vis spot. \n\nThis is a good game made by a person who still pushes meaningful updates, so thank you.","timestamp_created":1610022028,"timestamp_updated":1610022028,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwrtCy7vYCdJOhwQI="}
