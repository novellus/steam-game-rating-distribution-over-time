    review: "This DLC is a Core Rulebook for D&D 5E. This review is not specifically\
      \ about this particular Core Book, but about how these work in general. \n\n\
      Fantasy Grounds comes stock with the 5E SRD and Basic Rules for 5E, so you don't\
      \ strictly speaking need to buy the core books to play - that said, Wizards\
      \ of the Coast did a great job when they created the SRD/Basic Rules, leaving\
      \ exactly enough content out of the free version to make the free version feel\
      \ fine to play, but also making the paid content vastly superior by comparison.\
      \ \n\nAdding the Core Book DLCs to your collection grants you the ability to\
      \ utilize the corebook material in place of the free content, which is usually\
      \ superior with more listed options. \n\nAfter loading the module, you can access\
      \ the content of the DLC by clicking the Library Button in the lower right corner\
      \ and scrolling down until you see \"Core Rules\" where you can then click the\
      \ title of the DLC Core Book in question and then a reference table appears.\
      \ \n\nFrom here you can access and drag-and-drop any content from the book into\
      \ your campaign and at the bottom of the reference list, there will be a \"\
      reference manual\", which is actually a fantasy-grounds version of the book\
      \ itself, that you can read page for page (though it isn't nearly as easy to\
      \ read as a physical book, or even a PDF). \n\nThis still makes for an incredibly\
      \ user-friendly and hassle-free supplement that any fantasy grounds DM can take\
      \ full advantage of, but it isn't a particularly good replacement for the \"\
      real thing\". If it comes down to buying the physical book or this DLC, I would\
      \ say buy the book - the free content will carry you far enough - that said,\
      \ having both is great."
