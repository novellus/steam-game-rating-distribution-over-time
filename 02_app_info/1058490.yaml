    about_the_game: "Hobo Living VR is a game that puts the player into the shoes\
      \ of a homeless person living on a city street block.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      You will need to make money any way you can to purchase the essentials for street\
      \ living.  The daytime is good for begging for change, busking or doing odd\
      \ jobs.  Upon initial EA release you will be able to beg for change, but busking\
      \ and odd jobs will be added soon after.  At night, the hobos must sleep, but\
      \ depending on how the day has gone you may not be able to sleep without the\
      \ aid of drugs or alcohol.  Money can be used to purchase these items from the\
      \ corner store.  Stealing is also an option, but be careful, or you could end\
      \ up in jail for the night.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBodily functions must be managed\
      \ as well.  Wait too long and you may make a smelly mess, which might get you\
      \ in trouble.  Keeping healthy is important, but because sleep is a must you\
      \ may need to do some unhealthy things to make that happen.  Alcohol and sleeping\
      \ pills may help, but they can degrade your health. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEventually,\
      \ you will be able to gather enough money to rent the apartment located above\
      \ the local store and get off the street for good."

      and once outside if you use it and didn''t pay you should get in trouble. Should.


      I''ll check on this and make sure everything is working correctly, then put
      up a new update. There also will be some more additions in the coming weeks
      and then another big update is happening in July.'
