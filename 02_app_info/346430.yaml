    review: "Everything about this is a disappointment.\n\nThe idea sounded intriguing\
      \ enough: a comic-based platformer, with some decently-cool-looking concept\
      \ art pieces to build off of. Instead, we get the most bare-bones version of\
      \ any ideals it was supposedly reaching for, built on a foundation of awfulness.\
      \ \n\nThe art was supposed to be the selling point; instead, it was just kind\
      \ of meh at best. The story was abjectly boring, essentially describing situations\
      \ in a simple, lifeless manner and providing no characters who were worth even\
      \ a passing glance. \n\nThe actual game was the worst part. Expecting to see\
      \ some sort of integration of 2/2.5D animation with some elements of 3D (with\
      \ the idea being we're literally jumping in and out of comic pages for the action),\
      \ we instead are handed basic and ugly 3D models for everything from the characters\
      \ and enemies to the scenery. The movement is strictly rudimentary, the timing\
      \ of inputs is unreliable, and that impossibly janky boss battle with Envy will\
      \ make you want to toss your computer through the wall.\n\nA complete waste\
      \ of time, on a game which clearly had zero love or care put into it. Any money\
      \ spent on it would have been better served getting flushed down a toilet."
