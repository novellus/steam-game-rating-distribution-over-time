They all at least have a few skills to vary battles","timestamp_created":1600530299,"timestamp_updated":1600530299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h8fC0/QCcvnlogI="}
