    short_description: Naruto's and Sakura's combined skills force Kakashi to use
      his Sharingan right off the bat. Naruto masterfully unleashes his jutsu one
      after another. And Sakura, though trained primarily as a medic ninja, employs
      deadly techniques taught her by Tsunade herself.
