    about_the_game: "Acoustic Kits is a collection of 24 bit drum kits recorded in\
      \ professional studios. The library includes Gretsch, Yamaha, DW, Pearl, Ludwig,\
      \ and Tama drum kits along with a full set of percussion instruments. Acoustic\
      \ Kits were meticulously recorded through a complete range of playable velocities\
      \ using 16 microphones, tube preamps and pristine 24-bit ADCs. The close and\
      \ overhead samples were then mixed for each individual drum for optimal punch\
      \ and room ambience. Each kit is comprised of up to five layers for unmatched\
      \ realism. Programmed specifically for Session Drummer 3, kicks, snares, toms,\
      \ cymbals, and percussion have been isolated and recombined to create alternate\
      \ variation kits and mixes. The result is real drums in real rooms played by\
      \ real drummers. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis collection contains 1.2 gigabyte of\
      \ 24 bit samples, 40 programs, &amp; 128 MIDI patterns."
