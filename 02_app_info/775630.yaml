    review: "An economy simulator where you sorta \"organically\" grow your own wrestling\
      \ promotion. The positive is it helps make use of your probably gigantic collection\
      \ of EDITs and create the illusion of growing your own wrestling promotion through\
      \ good booking (fan ratings really count here), savvy financing, and regularly\
      \ recruiting fresh talent. Or at least in theory that's how this is all supposed\
      \ to go.\n\n I love FPWW, and I totally want to support this game. But this\
      \ mode, like a few others, is so bare bones I'm having a hard time understanding\
      \ why it wasn't just included in the base product. I'm still having fun, for\
      \ sure. But I'm also amazed someone bought this at $19.99 because I'm a little\
      \ sticker shocked at $7.99. I do recommend if you are looking for more miles\
      \ out of FPWW, though. If you do pick this up, be warned: save often and frequently."
