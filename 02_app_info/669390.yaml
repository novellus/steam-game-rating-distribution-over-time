    review: "Looks fun, in fact it is okay enough that I am going to keep it, despite\
      \ it's numerous short comings, but I feel I should warn others who might be\
      \ looking at it. \nFor starters, it doesn't look like the developer has been\
      \ around for quite awhile. This is a shame, because for all it's potential,\
      \ it needs a lot of work, most of it in the explaining department.\n It also\
      \ has weird bugs, like the splitting and enhancing towers are mislabeled pretty\
      \ much every where.\nThere re also a lot of things you can spend resources on\
      \ that have no explanation or noticeable impact. \nIt seems to have had fans\
      \ in the past, but none felt it worth putting up a guide, which sadly would\
      \ have made a lot of difference, making up for the designers lack of effort\
      \ in that department.\nThat said, the idea is interesting, if you don't mind\
      \ playing something that seems unfinished and broken, you might have some fun\
      \ playing with the core mechanism. Me, I am having a blast with it. \n "
