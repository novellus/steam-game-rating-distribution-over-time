    review: "[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers [/h1]\n[i]\
      \ Note for Oculus users on Windows 10: It's UE4 and you do have to do a Windows\
      \ 7 compatibility fix [/i]\n\nWhere do I start? Well, I got this game in a bundle.\
      \ I would not have paid any money for this game. I had already tried the demo\
      \ so I wasn't expecting much. And yeah, I think I got even less. This game is\
      \ basically broken. \n\nTeleportation doesn't really work in this game. You\
      \ have to keep trying several times to move. It will show you places you can\
      \ and you can't go (yellow or red). However, sometimes you try to teleport to\
      \ a place you have just been and it says you can't teleport back there. I had\
      \ more difficulty trying to teleport than I did with the orcs.\n\nWhich brings\
      \ us to the second problem, combat is awful. Now, the bow & arrow felt fine.\
      \ But the sword / melee combat is just terrible. You basically just wiggle your\
      \ wrists in front of you. There's no skill involved, other than not being flanked\
      \ by the orcs, which can happen because you can't teleport properly.\n\n[b]Rate\
      \ 3/10. Looks nice, but the broken teleportation and the basic melee combat\
      \ just makes this a poor game. Avoid. Should be free to play because that's\
      \ what level of effort this game is. It's like someone learning to code in VR.\
      \ You can't seriously ask money for this.[/b]"
