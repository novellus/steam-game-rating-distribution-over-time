    review: "I am a massive fan of Flashback, along with other similar titles. Amiga\
      \ or Mega Drive versions, they are both great in their own ways. This sadly\
      \ uses a lot of elements of the DOS version, which isn't quite as good. Along\
      \ with some visual changes, the sound is pretty atrocious and the music just\
      \ seems to pop in whenever it feels like it. Sound effects are ear grating at\
      \ times too. \n\nSpecific to this \"remastered\" version; achievements don't\
      \ always trigger when they should, some locales seem as if they've had a portion\
      \ cut off the side of the screen and some floors can be fallen through, despite\
      \ there not being holes there in any other release. I found that using the \
      \ 'shift' key, while executing my Steam overlay shortcut to check achievements,\
      \ caused the action button to stop working too. Pressing it shift a second time\
      \ caused it to work again. What a peculiar bug!\n\nIt's not exactly the best\
      \ display of a game that is probably in my top 10 of all time, so I just can't\
      \ recommend it in this state unfortunately. Go try the original Mega Drive or\
      \ the Amiga versions instead if you can, as it really is a brilliant game."
