The simplicity mixed with other elements makes for a fun and in-depth journey for a text based game. \n\nOn another note, as a personal childhood friend of the developer, I can safely say that they are passionate about this game and will not leave it unfinished - Their drive to complete said game, and also revamp other, already completed areas is unparalleled. I wholeheartedly recommend trying out this game.","timestamp_created":1596839396,"timestamp_updated":1596839396,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547332465648651123","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqvDC5fMCc4CImgI="}
