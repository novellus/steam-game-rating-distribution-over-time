It took me a few minutes to get oriented and understand the mechanics but once I did and I was blown away. I have never played a VR game that so effectively captures the feeling of walking through an ancient pyramid the way this game does. It is absolutely beautiful and almost terrifying. The craftmanship that went into the level design is brilliant. Every corner brought something wonderful for me to explore. The dark corridors and the constant feeling of excitement at whats next to discover is fantastic. This is a gem in the rough. Not everything is perfect of course and I only played it for a brief amount of time but I cant wait to get back in and see whats next to find. The Pyramid VR is huge and full of wonders to behold. Give this game a chance especially if you own a Vive. It is absolutely wonderful. As a developer of VR myself I can see that Christopher Meyer and Alvaro Luna put a tremendous amount of work into this. They really captured the essence of what it must feel like to explore a real life Pyramind. Great work guys!!!","timestamp_created":1530991471,"timestamp_updated":1530991939,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42+GOu+QCebu/pQE="}
