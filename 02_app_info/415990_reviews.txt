Levels seem to be randomly arranged with no order of diffculty or other purposed order.\nWith the disorder of difficulty, player may always find a lot of \"too easy\" or \"meaningless\" levels in the end of game. \nSome complicate levels hold obviously useless gears for no reason, and the size of the board makes no sense for the space always be wasted, even some levels are placed in the wrong size pack. Such kinds of problems reveal the inadequacy in game puzzle design.\n \nObviously, the game mechanic allows player seperate or combine the light with lightbend gears. But this mechanic appears to be so limilted.\nPlayer needs not consider the matter that more than two functional gears effects in the sametime for the limitation of the game. If player do this, or just put more functional gears together, the game display will be broken.\nThis problem makes the superposition of lights with different colors following no logic. And player should carefully avoid such situation by themselves, for sometimes it could be seriously giltched, even get the whole game break down, which is very confusing.\n\nThe only control is keyboard, but the indicator of cursor is really bad.\nSome other annoying glitches still exist, like the resolution always switch to default when you back from desktop. Player may need reset the option every time. \nWhen I got all of game complete, the achievement seems to be bugged, I may never get the game finished achievement.","timestamp_created":1540107887,"timestamp_updated":1541000606,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk+ay5eYCf9uJrQE="}
