    review: 'An Audiogame fully playable by the visually impaired. The game is basic
      but enjoyable. The fights seem a little difficult right now, but hopefully will
      get easier with practice. The only flaw thus far is the use of Shift Tab to
      go back which doesn''t work as it is a Steam function. It is not a game breaker
      as pressing Shift will get you back, eventually, to where you need to be.

      For the price you should get a decent value for money.

      An enjoyable basic RPG lite game, audio is okay, don''t expect AAA and you won''t
      be disappointed.'
