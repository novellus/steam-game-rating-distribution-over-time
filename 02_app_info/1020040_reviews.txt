Mixing it with the standard Outside tiles, I was able to make a pretty versatile tileset that made a believable arctic city, which I'm happy with. 11.99 seems a bit much for something that otherwise doesn't have much use and is mostly for Christmasy stuff, but overall I'm happy with my purchase.\n\nLike most RMMV DLC (and ACE for that matter), only buy if you need it, it's totally skippable if you don't need winter or snowy tiles that are better than the base game.","timestamp_created":1557541276,"timestamp_updated":1557541276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.61538463830947876","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwlrms0uoCetT6wAE="}
