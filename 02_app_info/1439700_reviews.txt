The writing, story telling and just in general how he likes to form romance stories and relationships just really fits with my own personal likings. You play a young guy entering a magic academy and finding the love of your life in it. The relationship development is really nice and I also really enjoyed the overall story apart from the romance itself. Considering that you also get around 4 hours of story and that it is only 2 euro, I will never understand why his games dont take off more. For this price you wont find anything better on steam when it comes to romance VNs and just overall positive story telling. \n\nIf you are looking for a positive and very relaxing read then highly recommended. There is no r18 content though so if you are looking for that you might want to look elsewhere. If you care about story though and not just visuals then its really great. Apart from that the art itself is also pretty good and really if you consider the price you cant expect anything more from this VN.\n\n9/10\n\nCheck out my Curator Page: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/34401214/","timestamp_created":1605975980,"timestamp_updated":1606124632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.706003308296203613","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/J6f+vUCcOTZrwI="}
