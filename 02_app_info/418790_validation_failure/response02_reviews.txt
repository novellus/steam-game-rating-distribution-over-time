Whenever you feel like you have collected enough loot, you can find an extraction point and get out by helicopter.\n\nAs new game mechanics heat and food have been introduced: Lara has to warm up near fires in regular intervals and consume food in order not to starve.\nIn case you die you have to restart from the very beginning and all progress is lost.\nEach time the map will be different, as it is randomly made up of a few premade building blocks that are shuffled around each time. This works quite well and feels very natural.\n\nSimilar to the challenge mode from the base game, the experience can be modified using cards that affect gameplay, enemies and Lara's outfit and skillset.\n\n[h1][b]Verdict[/b][/h1]\n\nProbably my favourite DLC for the game overall and I enjoyed it a lot more than I originally thought I would. Endurance offers a unique new difficulty and actually brings something fresh and interesting to the known formula, even though the survival is quite rudimentary overall.\nAlso it can be played in coop with a friend, and that's always a plus.","timestamp_created":1524669888,"timestamp_updated":1597089492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.708189964294433594","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwvX87PMCfJGBnwE="}
