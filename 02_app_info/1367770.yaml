    review: 'A simple Hell of Bullet game. It  is fun, it have different set of weapons
      and increasing difficulty, as expected in a game of this kind. It is fine for
      playing some minutes in between other games. The playbility is good, you feel
      good control and nice sound.


      I feel very positive that once you reach a level you can start next game in
      this level without to restart the game.'
