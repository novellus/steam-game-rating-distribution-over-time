I reckon you'll like this.\n\nUpdated April 2020:\n\nI still sometimes go back to this game even after a couple of years. There's something relaxingly satisfying about it.\n\nI do still wish the devs would find a solution for a 'fast' swing passing through the ball. It's definitely possible to solve, but in the current state you just have to get used to it.\n\nMy last comment (and I really do hate myself for saying this), I think the game would be amazing with a friend. I know, I know... I just do. Having 2 (or even 4) people in a game I think would actually be quite fun. Tennis, but not taken too serious. Like being a kid again.","timestamp_created":1582332797,"timestamp_updated":1586430258,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtZWnr/ECfb/i8wE="}
