Regardless I bought this pack to get better shading effects into scenes made with the AGKVR pack. But when I try to add the AGKVR plugin to any of the shader demos I get an error:\n\nFailed to load plugin \"AGKVR\" required by this app, it may not be available for this platform. \n(the only plugin in the directory is windows, which I am on)\n\nThis is really dissappointing. Sure I can make plain old 3d games, but I could of just kept doing that with darkbasic which has a wider selection of shaders. Can I really not get any of these shaders into a AGKVR scene? If not I pretty much wasted my money. I cant find anything in the documentation that mentions any limitations.","timestamp_created":1539438752,"timestamp_updated":1539438838,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.640424966812133789","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1603447520,"developer_response":"Sorry to hear of your issues.
