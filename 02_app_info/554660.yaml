    review: "Sliding cards across the table forming hands of Poker.\nFairly simple\
      \ until trying to fit the last card against a perfect combination.\nFew modes\
      \ to play with, scores to obtain or beat.\n\nWas fun at first, gradually dull,\
      \ boring repetitive.\nChasing achievements, all else are possible by grinding\
      \ a thousand hands or a Million chips  \n' until '\nthe ridiculous 8 K hand\
      \ achievement.\nDespite 66 hrs and over 3000 hands of games,\nThe odds of a\
      \ natural hand of two Royal Flushes, accompanied by two three Four of a Kinds\
      \ are basically impossible or close to 0%.\nCould be rolling hands for my remaining\
      \ thirty years and still might not happen.\n2.2% of achievers have the achievement,\
      \ like real as\n' noone ' in the Casual, Challenge and Unlimited Mode Leaderboard\
      \ even crossed 8K.\n\nAnother game to stain my list of Completed games.\n\n\
      Not Recommending due to accumulated fustrations and failure to deliver a completed\
      \ game."
