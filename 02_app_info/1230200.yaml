    review: 'This was an interesting little game about what comes after the "happily
      ever after". You play as a dwarven adventurer who (with a party of friends)
      slew a great beast several hundred years ago, and has since settled down with
      the party''s healer. Your wife has passed away before the game begins, and you
      are living on a remote island with your war relics and your talking cat. Then
      one day, your magic axe (yes, the one used to slay the beast) gets stolen, and
      in order to find it you need to re-enter society, and in so doing see the ramifications
      of your actions from centuries before. I really enjoyed the story overall, and
      most of the side quests and characters were fun.


      The game is in an isometric style like an old-school RPG, and you have the ability
      to buy clothes/hairstyles/beards for your character at some locations in town
      and then see them on your sprite. You can also have a significant number of
      pets following you around (I think at the height of my pet collecting I had
      a talking cat, 3 chickens, a sentient rat, a talking crab and a hedgehog. They
      don''t really do anything though (except the ones that can talk) except kind
      of obstruct your character''s pathfinding and look cute. There are also several
      romance options (I found 3 m/f and 2 f/f options) but the romance path I played
      was pretty bland.


      The art looks great, with unique looking characters and locations, and the music
      is nice (especially the song at the speakeasy). The characters are "voiced"
      but it''s just an Animal Crossing-esque burbling sound, not surprising for the
      price. I liked that there were multiple solutions to many of the puzzles and
      lots of chances to express your character''s opinion. I did find a few quests
      were buggy for me (I would have quests to talk to people but they wouldn''t
      have anything to say if I tried to talk to them) but nothing game-breaking.
      You can continue your quests after the ending, until you choose to sleep in
      your bed, which gives you a slide show epilogue about how some of your friends
      are doing and ends that save. I found the epilogue kind of underwhelming and
      it was weird to me which characters got mentioned in it, but it was fine. There''s
      no manual save unfortunately, so if you want to try out other choices or romances,
      you will have to play it a second time.


      Overall I am satisfied with my playthrough and really enjoyed my time with this
      game.'
