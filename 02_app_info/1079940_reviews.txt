I can live with plain ugly graphics but not when it's the best part of the game nevertheless.\n\nIt's not souls-like at all (it was the reason why I bought it) because there are no souls/experience, no leveling, no char stats, no inventory, no stamina, no death run ... no nothing.\n\nThere are parcur elements which you will repeat tens of times each because of how poorly they are designed. It's necessary to hit very small objects during jumps, double jumps and/or free fall, hit them under very specific angle and at the same time rotate camera in three dimensions (while the screen is shaking and/or tilting). And you have to hit several objects in a row (sometimes around the corner) or repeat the whole sequence from beginning. And no, it's not getting any better using mouse+keyboard instead of gamepad.\n\nCombat is also bad. At least during Chapter 1 (there are three Chapters total but I have no intention to go on) there are only two weapons. When there is only one enemy you can stun-lock him to death using basic attack. When there are more you can theoretically kill them almost instantly using special attacks (which drain your health and also replenish it) but the controls are unnecessarily complicated. One key to draw a weapon (which drains fixed portion of life, brilliant idea which leads to automatic sheath of weapon during fights, which is also brilliant idea), another one to power it up (which immediately constantly drains your health) another one for locking opponent (which sometimes works and sometimes not and when not you are almost instantly killed by your own weapon when it's powered up), yet another one for special attack. The second big problem is how unresponsive main character is (especially dodging is completely useless during fights).\n\nGame is also plagued with lots of glitches. Sometimes during parcur it's possible to stand on objects you clearly should not be able to stand on, sometimes controls lock up and you are unable to move or camera is locked on some object behind the wall, sometimes main character respawns with drawn weapon and sometimes with sheathed weapon and so on. \n\n2/10\n\nEDIT: Finished, mainly thanks to the speedrun video at\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Va7Xrl4yeY&t=1580s\n\nOne of the worst games I played in last couple of years.","timestamp_created":1597411777,"timestamp_updated":1603294116,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537254929542541504","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwitfxpfUCfd6zmwI="}
