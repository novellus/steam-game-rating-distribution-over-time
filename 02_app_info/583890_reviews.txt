Even though the story, music and pixel art are already great from the very beginning, the gameplay feels unfinished and almost unbearable. Luckily, there are many checkpoints and infinite immediate respawns. But still, I almost gave up on the game (like many did, if you check the negative reviews). But I'm glad I didn't, because it does gets better in both gameplay and story - and the later sections and ending are surely worth the while. To my own surprise, I actually ended up finishing the whole game in one sitting (which took me around 3 hours).\n\nThe game is weirdly divided into 10 so-called \"chapters\" of varying lenght, but there are actually around 4 \"levels\". I'll try not to spoil them, because the third one is especially great (both gameplay and storywise). But it goes like this:\n\n1- HOUSE LEVEL: the very first, supposed to be a tutorial of sorts but actually the hardest and worst of them all. Some good ideas but badly executed. It feels like the game is going to be a mess and it takes way too long. Luckily, it does eventually end and the real game begins.\n\n2- FOREST LEVEL: the second level feels like the first true level of a proper story-driven plarforming game, and there's a little twist in the story that makes it even better. There are still bad sections with weird difficulty spikes, but there are also great moments that got me immersed and felt properly manageable. I stopped dying for weird, unfair reasons, and it finally felt like it dependend on my own skill. The ending for that level is pretty great.\n\n3- UNEXPECTED LEVEL: after the fast-paced finale of the previous level, there's a gameplay twist that come just in time to slow things down a little. It's still challenging, but it still feels a little like resting after what came before. Later on, there's another gameplay twist and things get fast again. It's just nice game design. However, I gotta say the fast-paced finale of this level may take a little too long and is not as cool as the previous one. But it's not bad either. Also, at that point, the story has changed from its darker dreamy tone to something a little more fun and lighthearted.\n\n\n4- FINAL LEVEL: the final level has a few different sections and a few nice epilogue-style moments. It's also refreshing in terms of story and environment. However, gameplay is a little uninspiring at first. But it does get better and the ending of the story is just great. It's not as serious as I imagined at first (that forest level is kind of gloomy), but it manages to be both emotional and funny. The whole thing is just a nice payoff for the adventure. (P.S.: the final challenges may be a little too easy compared to the struggles in the early game, but I actually liked it better that way - I was engaged in the story conclusion, but not really willing to have a super final challenge at that point)\n\nAll in all, its surely an indie project that could use some polishing, but it did have many nice things to keep me going after the bad start. I'd say the core of the game is in the second level (the challenges of the dreamy forest etc.), but it was a nice surprise to see the changes in tone and gameplay towards the end. By the time I finished the game, I had good taste in my mouth. I can't believe I'm saying this after almost giving up in the beginning, but I actually kinda miss the game already. I don't think it should be any longer (it could actually be a little shorter), but I'd surely play a sequel to those dreamy doggo adventures. It was a nice experiece overwall and I do recommend it for those who like indies and dogs, which is surely my case.","timestamp_created":1584861221,"timestamp_updated":1584861280,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8P7FgPECePz9+QE="}
