    review: "So far so good... Even though I gave the game a negative review, I still\
      \ RECOMMEND it!!! It is a little treasure \n\nIt is fun. You can relax, the\
      \ music lulls you, you come down and the time passes... I like it, really...\
      \ it is \"Animal Crossing\" for the PC.\n\nNot to the full playable extent as\
      \ \"Animal Crossing\", but you can play it on the PC. Better than nothing.\n\
      \nBUT:\n\nNone of the 7 free theme packs, not even Steve, whose tent appears\
      \ but cannot be entered, can be found in the game itself!\n\n0 out of 7 - you\
      \ have to get that right first! \n\nALL are in the STEAM library, ALL are loaded\
      \ multiple times, the game even loaded from the corresponding pages in the store\
      \ - not a single themenpack appears in the game...\n\nWith Steve this is especially\
      \ annoying because you can't get an Achivement: Enter all buildings...\n\nThese\
      \ themepacks were actually one of the reasons for buying the game, only \n\n\
      WHERE ARE THEM?\n\nThen suddenly all the fish disappear, not a single one appears.\
      \ But you have 3 quests to catch fish. So then the quests in the daily quests\
      \ are not all fulfillable when it says: complete 5 quests, because the 3 that\
      \ you have are blocked, because no fish are there...\n\nThe game is now 5 1/2\
      \ years old. You would think that it would work... \n\nMaybe there is something\
      \ I missed, but all DLC's are in the library on Steam, but not in the game.\
      \ In the options I have also not found a button for activate this or this theme.\
      \ \n\nThat the updating of the daily tasks is sometimes a bit messed up, you\
      \ can get over that, that's not so dramatic. I can live with that...\n\nI'm\
      \ lvl 17  and have now played 31 hours, all buildings and bridges built, including\
      \ the large lighthouse.\n\nNow I would like to start decorating my islands.\n\
      \nHope for tips and help. \n\nTHX\n\nEDIT 01:\n\nStill missing STEVE - and TWO\
      \ archivements are not possible to get. \n\nMet all villagers and visit all\
      \ buildings...\n\nIn the daylies it comes to visit him, pop up the town hall\
      \ building. But she is is never there. \n\nAND YES, I know the camp in the back\
      \ of the bank... thx ;)"
