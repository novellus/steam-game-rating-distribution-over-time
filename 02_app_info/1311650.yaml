    about_the_game: "Helwyr is a new IP being a 3D, third-person Action-RPG that follows\
      \ the traits of games in the souls-like genre. Within Helwyr as of now consists\
      \ of three sections being the Forest, Deserted town, and a Graveyard. While\
      \ in these areas the player will come across challenges such as enemies they\
      \ have to defeat and upon killing them gaining Essence that will allow for leveling,\
      \ there is a side quest that will add some side story and finishing off the\
      \ area with a boss enemy. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game has been produced in\
      \ 4 months by myself for my university Final Major Project. I will hopefully\
      \ be continuing development on this game once finished, as it stands now the\
      \ game has one full playable section being the beginning area that will hopefully\
      \ expand to have multiple sections trailing off it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople\
      \ born with a special birthmark obtained special abilities; these grew to be\
      \ known as Helwyr. They were stronger and faster than normal humans with special\
      \ abilities, as they grew, they took on the roles of protectors of the human\
      \ race. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor many years the humans lived at peace with the\
      \ Helwyr protecting them from the beasts but, as time went by the flame of hope\
      \ these people brought to the world was snuffed out. Now with only a few left\
      \ can peace be restored to this devastated world?"

    review: "what a fucking heap of shit. early access? sure, probably abandoned,\
      \ just put up on steam for a few quick dollars. i doubt they will continue updating\
      \ this game. seems quiet. \n\nanyway, sound is shit and laggy. game itself is\
      \ laggy. combat is broken. AI is retarded and so is the clanky controls and\
      \ camera. no pause button. honestly think this is just a scam and not a serious\
      \ game which will be built upon."
