The levels have extremely cheap enemy, trap, spike, falls and such placements but it is almost never punishing you for making a mistake because enemies often drop health, your health bar increases by finding secrets chests hidden which aren't hard to discover, you become very tanky, and you have a decent amount of invincibility frames when you are hit, and you get a health potion which fully cures your health twice which is basically like you have 3 lives in total and there is an upgrade that refills your potion in time. I'm very sorry to say this but the level design, for the game not punishing you for anything and giving you very high amounts of life and healing, turns out to be something totally useless: The entire gameplay consists of skipping every obstacle on your way by getting hit and occasionally hitting an enemy or two to get a health bar. There is a gameplay walkthrough speedrun video on youtube by the game developer himself and if you watch it you'll get what I mean. Hitting spikes, enemies, falling to bottom and such have no considerable impact on your success. Why make a very difficult and cheap level design then make it completely easy to beat by simply tanking everything by running and jumping forward until you reach next checkpoint which completely refills your health bar and even which allows you to travel back to town to refill your potions too. I just don't get it.","timestamp_created":1594999085,"timestamp_updated":1594999085,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/NLWrvMCfKDxlQI="}
