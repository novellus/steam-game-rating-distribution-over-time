    review: 'FUCK!

      I fell for their scam; i didn''t read the "RiffTrax" part which they make way
      smaller then the movie''s title in an obvious attempt to trick people like myself.
      Please do not fall for this like i did. Their commentary is unfunny and i''m
      pretty sure this is breaking copy right laws so i have reported this movie.
      Here i was wanting to sit down and enjoy a nice classical Halloween themed movie
      and i got cucked by 3 "comedians" (in the loosest term possible).


      Well i guess i now have to go pirate this movie because of you guys. I will
      also be emailing the movie studio about this too to let them know that you just
      stole their money.


      Have a nice day.'
