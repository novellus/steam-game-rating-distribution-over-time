    review: Years ago I played to BOXYBOY that was another version of Sokoban. Cursed
      mummy is missing one important functionnality that was present on Boxyboy, its
      the capacity to rewind last few moves (50). So if you push a box by mistake,
      you cant rewind and you need to reset the level. Its not very important on begining
      but later in game, when the levels become harder its going to be boring to dont
      being able to rewind a mistake.
