In general, this game was great. The story is interesting, the characters are fun, and the interface is just fine (which, sadly, isn't always the case). However, I found the ending to be a little too disjointed, especially compared to the rest of the story. There were elements that weren't explained, which I found frustrating. That being said, the story was still definitely worth it. I really look forward to seeing the other endings.","timestamp_created":1594656315,"timestamp_updated":1594656315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ454q7pPMCddaGlQI="}
