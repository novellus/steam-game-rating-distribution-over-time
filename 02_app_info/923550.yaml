    about_the_game: '<strong>Rescale</strong> is a simple game about resizing a ball
      to get through <i>or over</i> various obstacles. You''ll also need to change
      the size of your ball in order to change the perspective on the upcoming problems.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Content</h2>The game consists of 12 challenging levels that vary
      in uniqueness. Each more different than the last, forcing you to learn different
      paths and techniques to get past all the obstacles.<h2 class="bb_tag">Boosts</h2>There
      are also multiple types of &quot;boosts&quot; to help you get past certain obstacles.

      just a young programmer with dreams of becoming a game developer. This is my
      first game that I''ve completely finished and managed to publish. It''s not
