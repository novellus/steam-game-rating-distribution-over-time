    review: 'This is an older game (2016 for Steam, older according to copyright),
      but has obviously been updated.  It works smoothly, uses a wide screen without
      distortion, and has an interactive map.  The game also has a fully integrated
      guide, although it is less necessary than for many of these kinds of games.
      [Forgot to mention in original review: the bonus chapter is short and felt contrived
      (more than usual).]


      Pros:

      - excellent dry humour

      - coherent, interesting story

      - continuing character (protagonist)

      - the special feature of the game (acquiring certain living statues with different
      functions) is used intelligently by the writer(s), and feels much less gimmicky
      that expected

      - collectibles aren''t obvious, but are reasonably noticeable if you''re looking

      - about the right number of HO scenes (word lists)

      - excellent cut scenes, I enjoyed the fantasy movie feel :)


      [a note on the HO scenes:  they''re not easy, but all of the objects are distinct
      and visible; for the most part, objects are hidden by being well-placed; however,
      there were a few instances where there were too many neutral colours, or objects
      were hidden within a spot of the same colour]


      Cons:  none to mention except as immediately above.  This is an excellent game
      for any HOPA collection; a 9/10'
