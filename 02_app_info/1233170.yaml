    about_the_game: 'The year is 2033. You, an ex-Marine with little opportunities
      left, have signed up with Utopia Arura, a large mining corporation on Mars.
      They have sent you to a location they have proposed but you have chosen for
      mining. Everything else is up to you.<h2 class="bb_tag">Mining outpost on Mars</h2><br>Operate
      a mining outpost on Mars. You start out with a small base. You can earn credits
      (the currency on Mars in 2033) by mining rocks around the base for ore. When
      you have earned enough credits, you can purchase a rover that enables you to
      drive out and mine rocks farther out. You can upgrade the base, build it out
      with more buildings, equipment, etc. There are many missions and tasks that
      must be performed to progress in the game and earn credits.<h2 class="bb_tag">Mine
      rocks</h2><br>The first part of the game is about mining rocks for ore. Explore
      the area around the station and you will find rocks that contain valuable ore.
      Mine the rocks and bring the ore back to the base.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1233170/extras/GifB1C.gif?t=1606136166"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Rover</h2><br>When you have made enough credits from mining
      rocks, you will be able to purchase a rover vehicle. The rover enables you to
      drive out and mine rocks that are farther away from the base.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1233170/extras/Gif2.gif?t=1606136166"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Rua 51 underground mining facility</h2><br>Solar flares
      will periodically cause high radiation levels on the surface of Mars, since
      the atmosphere is thin. You need to seek shelter in the Rua 51 underground mining
      facility when the radiation levels get too high on the surface.<br><br><img
      src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1233170/extras/Gif4.gif?t=1606136166"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Sell ore &amp; buy upgrades, equipment, repairs, etc.</h2><br>You
      can sell the ore that you mine using the management user interface at the base.
      Just click the &quot;sell ore&quot; button, and you will sell ore at the current
      market price and earn credits. You can use the credits to buy upgrades, equipment,
      repairs, food, water, etc.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1233170/extras/Gif3.gif?t=1606136166"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Missions</h2><br>Go on missions to outposts, facilities,
      the domed colony, etc. Research tasks become available when you have upgraded
      your base to the highest level, and have hired a researcher. There are different
      tasks at different locations.<h2 class="bb_tag">Marketplace</h2><br>You can
      buy and sell ore in the marketplace when the station has been upgraded. Prices
      in the marketplace fluctuate, so it is possible to make or loose credits.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Dust storms</h2><br>Dust storms can happen at any time on Mars.
      Dust storms are dangerous because they can be very disorienting and affect communication.
      You can run out of oxygen if you get lost in a dust storm.<h2 class="bb_tag">Chill
      out on Mars</h2><br>Enjoy several hours of gameplay in solitude on Mars, mining
      for ore, operating your base station, driving your rover, etc. This may be a
      good game for you if you like space games and are tired of action-packed shooting
      games.<h2 class="bb_tag">Utopia Planitia</h2><br>The game is set somewhere in
      Utopia Planitia on Mars. Utopia Planitia (Greek and Latin: <i>&quot;Nowhere
      Land Plain&quot;</i>) is a large plain within Utopia, the largest recognized
      impact basin on Mars and in the Solar System with an estimated diameter of 3,300
      km. Plenty of space and opportunities for anyone who wishes to try ones luck
      as a prospector.'
