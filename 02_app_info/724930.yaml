      /><br><i>*The project is still under development, and the information will be
      continuously updated and more comprehensive.</i><br><strong>GrandNarr!</strong>
      is an action sandbox game with a medieval low magic background. Collect resources
      in the game world, make everything that enhances your strength, attack and occupy
      enemy bases on large maps. Then strengthen the base of the occupation and guard
      against the enemy's counterattack. <strong>GrandNarr!</strong> provides a highly
      real-time and dynamic world environment. Players can use their own ideas to
      achieve the goal of full-screen mastery with free and rich means.<h2 class="bb_tag">Combat
      system</h2><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/724930/extras/steam600.png?t=1595426355"
      /><br><strong>GrandNarr!</strong> is an action game. When fighting, it mainly
      considers the enemy's weapons, armor and physical state. Always keep well equipped
      and pay attention to your energy. Otherwise, it will be very disadvantageous
      to fight naked against the enemy. If the physical strength is poor, it will
      easily be overthrown by the enemy and fall into a disadvantage.<h2 class="bb_tag">Rich
      AI behavior</h2><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/724930/extras/steam600npc.png?t=1595426355"
      /><br>The interaction with npc in the game is very unique. Players don't need
      to face a lot of text menus and white water plots. Everything depends on your
      own behavior! If you make bad things, the villagers will not like you. If you
      are good to them, they will help you fight! Trading, hiring, cooperating, and
      rescuing, all in a simple interactive system - even the enemy, they have their
      seven passions, you want to have a relationship with them is no problem! They
      will respond reasonably to what you are doing, and there will be many unexpected
      things happening. Try it out!<h2 class="bb_tag">Production synthesis and a small
      amount of survival elements</h2><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/724930/extras/steam600surv.png?t=1595426355"
      /><br>In the game,all weaponry items are made from materials, and the items
      are inextricably linked. Players can explore rich usages and produce unexpected
      results to help with tactical implementation. The survival factor in the game
      is in a secondary position, and the player needs to pay attention to his physical
      condition for a period of time, but he does not need to be oppressed from time
      to time.<h2 class="bb_tag">Argument</h2>The overall goal of the game is to master
      the whole picture! By annihilating and occupying all enemy positions, you will
      be able to usher in the final victory. There are different types of locations,
      which determine the available items and how to fight. Occupy your desired location
      according to your own preferences!
