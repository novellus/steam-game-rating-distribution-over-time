The obstacles seem extremely difficult. I know it is supposed ot be a challenge, but if feels like its a last decision \"make or break\" everywhere I go. Sometimes, I just randomly stop moving, which Im sure is the game trying to turn around, but its so weird compared to the acceleration the ball starts at. Also for some reason, if you play a level again and don't get the star/time bonus, it just takes it away from you if you previously had it.\n\nIt's an alright game, but it feels too much like a bad browser flash game. I wouldn't pick this up unless you are looking for something new, or if it goes on sale.","timestamp_created":1504750326,"timestamp_updated":1504823828,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4qufr94Cc9jZhAE="}
