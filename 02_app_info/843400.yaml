    review: "I like how [b] Distant Castle [/b] got 7 positive curator recommendations,\
      \ despite being one of the most objectively broken games I ever played. At least\
      \ use the informative review, instead of giving a vague description that hides\
      \ very obvious problems. This is essentially a puzzle-platformer where you explore\
      \ a small castle with several riddles. In order to see the controls you have\
      \ to know to walk up to the screen on the wall, otherwise you would be completely\
      \ lost.  Unfortunately, the instructions do not reflect the actual controls\
      \ (-_-). Needless to say that game is not very optimized, pretty much all of\
      \ the mechanics are very clunky. The objects are difficult to move and it is\
      \ very hard to aim the dagger (it keeps going to the side). Want some icing\
      \ on the cake? The save feature is not working properly. \n\nNow to be fair,\
      \ I did not expect a good game. I try to keep an open mind because there are\
      \ some decent \"so bad it's good\" titles. Distant Castle is basically a student\
      \ project if you ever played one. The assets in this game are questionable,\
      \ I recognize some of the generic sound effects that originated in other unique\
      \ games. Regardless of the origin of those objects, the game is not exactly\
      \ enjoyable visually, I am literally getting a headache just looking at it.\
      \ During the night cycle the light effects make it nearly impossible to see.\
      \ I honestly have a hard time finding one upside, the developer tried to give\
      \ the character some interesting arm equipment, which is kind of cool but not\
      \ exactly original.\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n\xAF\\_(\u30C4)_/\xAF\n\n[h1] Cons:\
      \ [/h1]\n\n- clunky movement, not optimized\n- broken save feature\n- lack of\
      \ settings\n- control instructions are wrong \n- cryptic goals\n- numerous glitches\n\
      - light effects are just awful\n\n[b] Overall Thoughts 2/10 [/b]\n\nThe game\
      \ is almost unplayable; trying to deal with its mechanics is a constant battle.\
      \ There are some enjoyable bad games out there, I do not think that this is\
      \ one of them. I can't even look at it without getting my eyes hurt from those\
      \ awful light effects. I am not angry at the developer, but I don't think that\
      \ this game deserves a recommendation on any level, especially if it is a very\
      \ vague recommendation that hides what the game is."
