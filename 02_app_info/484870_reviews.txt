The game has moved on since then and so has the player base. Changed review to not recommended.\n\nA lot of fun even in this early state. Very playable and seems to have enough in it already to have some staying power.\nIt has the action of a traditional multiplayer FPS, but with a VR twist to it. Don't be scared by the unpolished aesthetic, there is a great game here right now. That said i'm even more excited for the possibilites for improvements. A bit of polish and balance here and there and you have an absolute hit.","timestamp_created":1466946877,"timestamp_updated":1607993960,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500031769275665283","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5JT6sfYCccjyWg=="}
