      \ as engrossing an adventure now as it was upon initial release. This strange\
      \ story about a young boy named Allen and other orphaned children creates an\

    review: "Gioco veramente carino.\nDura complessivamente poco, ma, \xE8 godibile\
      \ al massimo e i finali alternativi arricchiscono di non poco la trama.\nLa\
      \ storia \xE8 davvero carina molto originale, piena di curiosit\xE0 sulle storie\
      \ dei personaggi, riprese da favole facilmente intuibili. L'idea del sogno,\
      \ e delle vicende dei demoni mi \xE8 piaciuta davvero tanto. \nHo trovato il\
      \ tutto davvero curato, partendo dalle illustrazione al posizionamento degli\
      \ oggetti ma anche la scelta delle musiche.\nI dialoghi fanno davvero molto\
      \ riflettere e la traduzione \xE8 davvero ben fatta.\nInsomma 10 su 10."
