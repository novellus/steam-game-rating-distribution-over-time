It's still enjoyable, but after you go through it a couple times a lot of the quests lose their magic which is pretty sad.\nLike I said though, it's good for what it is and I'd say give it ago if you like RP games.","timestamp_created":1610148514,"timestamp_updated":1610148514,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjZGV8vYCf5PVwQI="}
