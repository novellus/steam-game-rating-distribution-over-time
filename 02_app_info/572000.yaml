    review: "How is the Don not tweeting about this game yet? By far, the most entertaining\
      \ 12 minutes of my life. The only thing I'd fix is the strength of that spring\
      \ holding up his big fat head because he's all floppy when I play. \n\nDo alternate\
      \ facts apply to virtual reality? Meh, who cares... the truth is that this game\
      \ pretty much ends my day because whenever Kellyanne Conway opens her mouth,\
      \ I just want to punch someone. This game is my therapy. Download this and play\
      \ before they yank it from the store! My wife's son loves it! Terrific game,\
      \ very good. Not much content though, if I had to pay for it I would have called\
      \ it a tremendous disaster. Sad. While handling massive (some of them at least)\
      \ rubber dongs is not something I do on a regular basis, there is an immensely\
      \ satisfying noise when the synthetic gentleman's sausage makes contact with\
      \ the CheetoFace. \n\nMy Vive controllers not only made high speed contact with\
      \ the virtual Chump, but each other, my chair, 4K TV, my left leg (don't ask\
      \ questions), and judging by the noise on one of the hits, my cat as well. (Sorry,\
      \ Smokey!)\n\nMy only disappointment is that while I spent at least 4 minutes\
      \ (this time around, I will continue) trying to beat him with a chair, for the\
      \ life of me I couldn't hold onto the bloody thing long enough to get a well\
      \ made WWE style smack out of it... I swear I felt like I was too drunk to hold\
      \ the chair properly for all it got me.\n\n\n\nSeriously though. The morphs\
      \ and physics on Rump's face work amazingly well with a satisfyingly proper\
      \ amount of jiggle. If you hold the controllers parallel to your wrists like\
      \ a claw, using either your pinky or thumb to hold the trigger, it adds some\
      \ more realistic \"I punched this motherf***er in the face\" feel to it. Some\
      \ of the textures could be worked on, or a skydome added, but you know what?\
      \ This thing is free, and beyond satisfying, especially since it got me off\
      \ of my lazy \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 for a while. \n\nPlease, if you do future\
      \ updates, LET ME HIT HIM WITH A CHAIR! Or let me attach the dongs to a chair\
      \ and get him in true gangbang impeachment style.\n\nIf this is not in your\
      \ library. Shame. It will likely be censored by the time you decide you want\
      \ it."
