Find notes and books to gather clues and solve the mysteries of this adventure. In order to find all clues required to complete the game, you'll not only need to find notes and items, but also mark specific words or sentences correlating with the things happening around you, and this is quite a clever system. You cannot find clues to things you haven't learned about yet, so that adds a lot to realism. Now, in the highest difficulty setting, you have to ffind everything yourself. And since notes and books are spread out over several areas, it can become quite a hassle to remember where you've read what. So, to be sure, make some notes yourselves.\n\nAfter you've found some clues, you might need to combine them to come to certain conclusions. This part I liked a bit less because some obvious connections couldn't be made while other more vague combinations are required to discover every little secret.\n\nWhile it's already an older game, the rooms and objects are detailed enough for good immersion.  Sound, music, voice acting, are all well done and fits the game nicely.\n\nReally enjoyed this one.","timestamp_created":1573989450,"timestamp_updated":1609959554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561749160289764404","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvafE7PYCcoPl2gE="}
