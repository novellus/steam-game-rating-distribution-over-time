(I'm assuming...) this DLC is worth it imo.\n\nAdds two new chapters onto the story which already enough is a pretty amazing thing.\n2 new areas, both are kinda fun to traverse with bringing in new gameplay elements. \n2 new outfits for Erina! You can finally dress her up LETS GOO\nThere's 3 new bosses with SP battles, so technically 6\nA new gamemode and 4 new items with +10 more Easter Eggs... Yay....\nAnd conclusion to Noah's story arc.\n\nAnd more achievements for anyone that is like me and wants more stuff to do in this game.\n\nOverall solid DLC for the game, would recommend to those that already love the base game enough and want to support the devs.","timestamp_created":1610002960,"timestamp_updated":1610002960,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6PHp7fYCc9+awQI="}
