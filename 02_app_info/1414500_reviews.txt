You then can pick a window you want to take a closer look at with your camera to see some details in the room or view a very bad video sequence, which may be of importance. However, the time is ticking and spying into one window will cause you to miss, maybe important details of another, and missing a sequence in this game will cause another sequence to never appear, so it's really trial and error all the way through.\nIf you can pick it up for 2$ and you have time to spare, go for it.","timestamp_created":1602965762,"timestamp_updated":1602965906,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.559087574481964111","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpdSNnPUCfN6+qAI="}
