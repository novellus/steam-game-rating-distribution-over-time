The user interface was garbage and it was hard to tell what I could pick or not for character before starting the game. There is no guide as to what buttons do what for the characters. Some didn't seem to do anything other than one thing while others did a special related to thier sport. Even without all those issues which were really bad the game just didn't feel like it would be fun. I will admit to not actually getting to play it with others before I returned it.","timestamp_created":1483433429,"timestamp_updated":1483470628,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.439734548330307007","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyqzvstkCf73Bbg=="}
