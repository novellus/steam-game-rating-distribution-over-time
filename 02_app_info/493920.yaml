    review: "[h1]Solid Concept, Lots of Potential[/h1]\nA part of the HELP game bundle,\
      \ and since it was made in a mere six days, unsurprisingly, it's not very complex\
      \ or polished.\n\nStill, this turned out to be a damn fine inclusion, enough\
      \ so that I really wish there'd been more to it. If they added controller support,\
      \ extra levels and achievements, I don't have trouble imagining a boost in sales.\n\
      \n[h1]A Real Life Problem, Turned Into a Game[/h1]\nThis is based on the real-life\
      \ problem of landmines, and the problems they create when left behind after\
      \ wars (or \"police actions\" or whatever sham euphemism we call them). \n\n\
      You play as a strange, padded ball thing and have to roll through the levels,\
      \ setting off the mines while using the force they create to propel yourself\
      \ in various directions. There doesn't appear to be any sort of score-keeping,\
      \ or benefits to getting all the mines or doing it in the shortest possible\
      \ times, but that didn't stop me from barreling through and decidedly not hating\
      \ the time I was spending.\n\nAt the end of each level, you'll get a random\
      \ factoid about landmines in real life. Heck, at the start of each level it's\
      \ a child that gives you your initial push to get on your way. So, it has a\
      \ nice touch of humanity to it. If they ever decide to expand on this, having\
      \ these take place in real life locations (or facsimiles) that have these problems\
      \ would be even better. (Though I imagine there'd be less convenient hills and\
      \ such for momentum.)\n\nDefinitely a worthy contribution to the bundle."
