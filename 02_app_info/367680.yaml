    review: 'I bought this along with the game when it foist released on steam, over
      the whole time I have played this game, I have never seen my character name
      Macco Tanthis appear in game at all. It cost much more back then then it does
      now just to get the Name in Game dlc, I feel like my money was taken from me
      without getting my product. I have quite a few friends online that religiously
      play this game daily, they have mentioned that they have never seen my name
      pop up ever at all.


      I don''t recommend buying this, even though it costs maybe 30% less than what
      I paid for it a very long time ago.'
