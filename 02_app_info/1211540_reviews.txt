In general you would probably be better off spending your money on a bigger game, but if you magically end up with this game in your library its worth a playthrough.","timestamp_created":1608915114,"timestamp_updated":1608945376,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsMOnzvYCeaGNvQI="}
