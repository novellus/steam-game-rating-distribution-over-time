    about_the_game: When five-year-old Oliver Hughes disappears while on holiday in
      France, it sets off a manhunt that will last for years to come. THE MISSING
      is a gripping dramatic thriller that takes you inside the mind of a father,
      Tony (James Nesbitt), desperate to locate his lost son. With help from a local
      police detective (Tcheky Karyo), Tony embarks on an obsessive quest to find
      his son and those responsible for his disappearance. A gripping puzzle with
      twists and turns at every stage, Tony's exhaustive search fractures his relationship
      with his wife, Emily (Frances O'Connor), and threatens to destroy his life.
      Told through a delicate and complex narrative, THE MISSING unfolds over two
      time frames simultaneously.
