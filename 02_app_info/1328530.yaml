    review: "A very fun and challenging yet rewarding single-player card game experience!\
      \ Unique and balanced mix of mechanics with a bit of randomization mixed in.\
      \ Beautiful anime style and design, high level of quality in all aspects. Nice\
      \ complementing story segments with a hacking/programming motif presented in\
      \ a visual novel style.\nMore details on different aspects of the game below.\n\
      \nGAMEPLAY: The mechanics are vast in this game, so I'll focus on what makes\
      \ this game unique in my eyes. First, you don't play multiple cards per turn,\
      \ playing a card [i]is[/i] a turn. So is most other manual action. There is\
      \ no opponent player per se, enemy cards come in waves and act on their own.\
      \ They have a countdown timer and act according to that turn count. The game\
      \ revolves heavily around card abilities and effects, the resolution order and\
      \ placement on the field plus turn timing. Additionally, there is a very interesting\
      \ sacrifice mechanic for single cards or entire rows for additional effects\
      \ or attacks.\nThere are a lot of different decks and archetypes to chose from\
      \ with various strategies and synergies (heck, there's even chess). Also you\
      \ acquire temporary cards (randomized loot) during matches that allow you to\
      \ tune and extend your deck mid-battle. All in all, the core gameplay is a very\
      \ solid and pretty addicting experience.\n\nDIFFICULTY: Despite its inherently\
      \ hard difficulty I find the game to be very beginner-friendly, judging from\
      \ personal experience as a non-competitive casual TCG player. Throughout the\
      \ beginning of the story you are introduced to the mechanics and slowly ramping\
      \ up difficulty in a comfortable pace. New battle stages will always present\
      \ a challenge and might seem impossible at first but after getting used to and\
      \ working out the mechanics of both your deck and the enemies, beating them\
      \ is a very rewarding experience.\n\nPROGRESSION: You progressively unlock more\
      \ and more characters and their decks as you progress. The beauty here is, although\
      \ each character and deck plays different, you are supposed to be able to beat\
      \ all major battles with any of the available characters and decks as they are\
      \ balanced pretty well. There are also mini battle stages that are more like\
      \ puzzles and are restricted to specific characters, where you have to use one\
      \ of their decks and the game's mechanics in a specific way to solve them.\n\
      \nDESIGN: The character and background art is top-notch, making the visual novel\
      \ story segments a treat for the eyes. \nThe cards use stylized pixel art matching\
      \ the whole programming/hacking theme of the game. Special effects and card\
      \ movement are very smooth and well designed. Menu and UI design is refined\
      \ and subtle, not getting in the way and fitting into the whole Scifi atmosphere.\n\
      \nSOUND: The background music tracks dip into the chiptune realm and match the\
      \ atmosphere pretty well, usually flavored around the respective stage's overall\
      \ theme. The sound effects for the game are really well chosen and feel natural\
      \ to the game.\n\nSTORY: Scifi story incorporating hacking and programming resembled\
      \ by the card game. It introduces you to the characters and establishes the\
      \ lore of the game. Cute and funny at times without being too cringy overall.\
      \ However, story is not the core of the game as this is not a typical full-fledged\
      \ visual novel in terms of story content and length. Nonetheless the story is\
      \ well written and doesn't feel artificial. It does what it does very well:\
      \ setting up the atmosphere of the game and giving personality to the characters\
      \ and the world while bridging the paths between the battles."
