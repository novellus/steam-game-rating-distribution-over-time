Really, really, really short though. The Space Channel 5 games typically are short but goodness. Still, the Hatsune Miku stage is cute, and the gameplay is solid(I had little to no issues with the game reading my movements to match the commands). I haven't done much of the 100-stage challenge yet but that'll be fun. $25 may be a bit steep for this, but they've got something good started here.\n\nI sincerely hope that this leads to more, that now that the foundation is laid there could be a part 2 sometime in the future!","timestamp_created":1609634136,"timestamp_updated":1609642253,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rPOJ4/YCfpj0vwI="}
