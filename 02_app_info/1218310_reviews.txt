[Includes time making many cups of coffee. There are options to make the waves much much faster.]\nAtmospheric. 1950s not 1980s, so teletype and bombers not ICBMs. If born in 1960 (like me), you will appreciate this a lot. \nMake sure your main strike unit has H-Bombs and countermeasures.\nOption to play 3 to 9 waves. Detailed things like killing radar stations, deploying spies / saboteurs might be more useful in extended play.\nDead body counter racks up the megadeaths.\nNot an all action game, more a gradual build up and then the bombs drop. Then you get two reports typing out at once! \n++EDIT: Designer actively doing updates. Map choices excellent.++\n-\nAt first wave the game seems entirely random... [ But by second wave you will see thought is required!]\nThis is nothing like Command and Conquer, so might not suit pew pew kiddies... Might look like Battleships but isn't.\n\nFirst try:\nEnjoyable, 4 hour 3 wave game. I won!  16 million red dead commies to only 11 million hero Patriots.  I admit the win came when I H-bombed Moscow on the last turn. I'll read the manual for the next game. Darned reds under the bed kept sabotaging me...\n\nKept thinking of the old black and white movies like Dr Strangelove, Fail-Safe and the Bedford Incident. I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb.","timestamp_created":1586988974,"timestamp_updated":1587457214,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw49j0zfECdPGLgQI="}
