Well first I will begin with how they seem to tell a story from start to finish with this album. They managed to tell the story of two farmers coming from nothing to making bank (money) in the city where they live now. There are songs that will bring you to tears such as \"Drill Baby Drill (Get That Dough) that really makes you feel the struggles that these white boys with attitude have to overcome in order to get that dough (money). If you are thinking of picking this game up after experiencing the game play of \"Whiteboyz Wit Attitude: The Pursuit of Money\" you will not be disappointed. Somehow they managed to increase the quality of their songs with this album (seems impossible I know). Hopefully you decide to pick up this game and decide to wear the purp like I know I have been.","timestamp_created":1610090963,"timestamp_updated":1610090963,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4g8y58PYCfaW9wQI="}
