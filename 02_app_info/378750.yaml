    review: 'Well, after completing the other 2 games I can say this one is easier
      than the first one and WAY easier than Shun. The bosses are really easy if you
      know what you''re doing. The difficulty here is catching all backpacks and all
      survival routes. I think you can avoid the hardest stage in survival (54), so
      it''s fine.


      The music is OK, good thing that you unlock the older musics, the new ones are
      good but not exceptional.

      Good game, but if you completed both first and Shun, this one won''t surprise
      you.
