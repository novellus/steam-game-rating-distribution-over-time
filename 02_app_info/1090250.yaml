      mechanic to Crunch Element. Place wall charges, throw grenades, and use peculiar
      weapons to blow holes in walls, ceilings, and floors to crack open entry points
      to compounds! Plan your entrance carefully! You never know what waits on the
      other side...<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Cooperative tactical shooter</strong></h2>Players
      can join up with allies at the Hideout and select a contract to begin. Once
      players arrive at the compound, they plan their attack, scout out the facility,
      and begin their raid. Players can play missions offline as a lone wolf and progress
      at their own pace.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Bullet Destruction</strong></h2>Bullets
      shred through interior walls made of materials like wood and drywall! Use heavy
      explosives to blast through heavier materials like concrete.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Procedurally

    review: There's so much potential, and it can be extremely fun with friends, but
      the execution is awful. Especially for a $20 game. currently, I can't recommend
      it.
