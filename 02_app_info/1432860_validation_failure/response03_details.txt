While there is a main quest packed with adventure, the quest is spaced out over time to allow the player a chance to focus on their farming, fishing, or whatever else they want to do – this is our way of making sure you can play the game exactly how you want to. You want to kill monsters and get loot? Do that! You want to relax, grow some potatoes, and flirt with the town doctor? Do that too!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSun Haven includes your sim staples – farming, mining, fishing, crafting, and of course romancing of the NPCs – along with a main RPG-style questline, side quests, variable combat, and open-world exploration.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCustomization is a must in life sims, so we’re going all-out. There are seven different player races to choose from: Human, Demon, Elf, Angel, Elemental, Naga, and Amari, the animal race. Not to mention a multitude of skin colors, hair styles, and eye colors to choose from. Your house is also upgradable up to three tiers and there are hundreds of equippable items and home decorations so you can hone in on your personal aesthetic. As a bonus, if your house is nicely furnished it actually reflects well with your neighbors!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOur relationship system is going to be dynamic as well. Talking to your neighbors is a good way to get to know them, but saying the wrong thing can negatively impact your relationship. You can increase your relationship by giving gifts and doing quests, plus there's a unique dating mechanic we're implementing – choose a date spot to meet your favorite NPC and gain some major ground in your relationship. If you play your cards right, you can eventually get married and have kids!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOf course, a huge part of Sun Haven is the magic. You can learn spells throughout the game which will help you in combat as well as farming and mining, among other things. In particular, your strongest magic is your Wish ability. As you play, you may see things that you want to be different in town. Run-down shops, neighbors in need, even a sick puppy around the corner. If you use your Wish power, those things change – like magic.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFeatures:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nRelaxing farming sim gameplay in an immersive fantasy setting<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSEVEN different player races to choose from: Human, Demon, Elf, Angel, Elemental, Naga, and Amari (animal folk)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTWO distinct worlds to explore: the human town Sun Haven, a renowned trading hub for travelers, and the monster city Withergate, where the sun never rises<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSIXTEEN romance-able characters (from both worlds with different races) - woo your life partner regardless of gender or race, get married, and start a family<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCustomizable homes (including upgrades up to 3 tiers) and hundreds of equippable items and home decorations so you can easily nail down your personal aesthetic<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCo-operative online multiplayer currently expecting up to 8 players in one game<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nExpress yourself to your online friends with player emotes<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nPlatformer-inspired combat mechanics for more fluid, reactive, adrenaline-pumping action with close range, long range, and magic attacks at your disposal<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMagical Wish ability that lets you grant wishes – bring new shops to town, increase relationships, and change the physical world with this unique power","about_the_game":"Sun Haven provides a relaxing farming sim game that also offers RPG gameplay for anyone who wants to do a little adventuring on the side.
