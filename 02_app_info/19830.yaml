    review: "$ENTO - SNIPER REVIEW\n\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Raven Shield\n\n8/10\n\
      \nRainbow Six: Raven Shield has the best sniper rifle load out for any single\
      \ player campaign. If you are a gamer who likes to choose your weapons before\
      \ every single player mission, then this is the sniper game for you.\n\nRainbow\
      \ Six: Raven Shield's load out for you and your team. Raven Shield may not have\
      \ the best graphics nor does it have the best realism, but what it does have\
      \ is the best load out. The player gets to customise their avatar, pick their\
      \ primary and second weapons and pick accessories for them. In addition, the\
      \ player can choose different grenades and other items. What makes the game\
      \ real awesome though is that the player gets to choose the outfits and pick\
      \ the weapons for the rest of the team. And some of the missions requires three\
      \ teams of A.I to help you (so much fun). What makes the game most impressive\
      \ to a sniper is that the player can pick a sniper rifle for each team. Better\
      \ still, you can even have a sniper rifle for every member of all the teams\
      \ (that is if you want to have a crazy sniper time). Probably the best single\
      \ player campaign load out I have experience yet. \n\nRaven Shield's sniper\
      \ rifles and accessories. There are a total of nine sniper rifles in the game.\
      \ The best one for close quarters is the VSS Vintorez. In reality the Russian\
      \ Spetsnaz use it to take down terrorists. For medium range you might want the\
      \ SVD Dragunov. But for long range try using the SSG 3000. The accessories for\
      \ the sniper rifles ranges from suppressors, to infa red attachments, etc. One\
      \ bonus is that some of the sniper rifles come with a bipod, which works when\
      \ the player's avatar is prone. The biggest downfall of the sniper rifle is\
      \ that all the cross hairs in the game are the same! Other than that, the sniper\
      \ rifles are very good.  \n\nRaven Shield's single player campaign for the sniper.\
      \ In the single player campaign, after every briefing and team load out. The\
      \ player will start by taking out bad guys with their A.I team in different\
      \ locations around the world. I normally go sniper for my team and have a back\
      \ up sniper in the other teams. In one mission, terrorists have taken over an\
      \ airport. The player and their team will have to go and rescue the hostages\
      \ and neutralize the bad guys. In another mission, it is snowing in a mountain\
      \ town where terrorists have taken over. The player in their winter gear, with\
      \ their team have to retake the town. There is a period where you can sniper\
      \ the bad guys from the top of a hill. Overall, the whole campaign is great,\
      \ the story line is good and the sniping is even better."
