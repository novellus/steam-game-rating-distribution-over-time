    about_the_game: "WALL-E follows the story of a small, sentient robot whose sole\
      \ purpose is to clean up Earth's voluminous garbage. In the year 2700, mankind\
      \ has left behind millions of tiny trash collectors to make the planet habitable\
      \ again. Yet only WALL-E remains functional, dutifully performing his task while\
      \ collecting an odd assortment of souvenirs. His uneventful life takes on new\
      \ meaning when he encounters a sleek, shiny robot named EVE, sent by humans\
      \ to monitor the clean-up progress. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBased on the 2008 computer\
      \ animated film from Pixar Animation Studios, the video game version of WALL-E\
      \ involves playing as the lonely robot as he navigates a trash-tainted world\
      \ and begins an unlikely trek across the cosmos. Gameplay consists of using\
      \ WALL-E's distinct abilities to create &quot;&quot;cubes&quot;&quot; used to\
      \ build platforms or to create distractions. In addition to solving puzzles\
      \ throughout the solo adventure, up to four players can compete in mini-games\
      \ ranging from timed races through space to competitive battles."
