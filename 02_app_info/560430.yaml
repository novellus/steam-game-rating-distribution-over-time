    about_the_game: "As Indiana Jones, you\u2019ll travel to 1935 China to prevent\
      \ a powerful artifact from falling into evil hands. This globe-spanning adventure\
      \ pits you against evil Nazis and the Asian underworld. It\u2019ll take more\
      \ than just a trusty whip and pistol to avoid the perils of the Emperor\u2019\
      s Tomb.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIndy's latest adventure plays out in dramatic fashion\
      \ thanks to new gameplay features such as brawling combat. This time, in addition\
      \ to using his trademark whip and pistol, Indy can engage in fierce hand-to-hand\
      \ combat against foes, many of whom are well-versed in martial arts. Improvised\
      \ weapons such as shovels, chairs and table legs also can be used to fend off\
      \ adversaries. The result is a more immersive and more Indy-like gameplay experience,\
      \ set amidst spine-tingling movie-like action sequences, such as a rickshaw\
      \ chase in Hong Kong and a spectacular battle atop moving gondolas in the South\
      \ China Sea area.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u2022 Explore levels across the globe\
      \ from Ceylon and Istanbul to Hong Kong and beyond.<br />\r\n\u2022 Shotguns,\
      \ submachine guns, improvised weapons - and of course, Indy\u2019s trusty whip\
      \ and pistol.<br />\r\n\u2022 Fierce fighting action and hand-to-hand combat.<br\
      \ />\r\n\u2022 Original storyline with new villains, wicked enemies and an alluring\
      \ partner.<br />\r\n\u2022 Leap, swim, climb and punch your way through exotic\

    review: Game makes me angry as hell but the Fighting and combat in this game is
      really good. The amount of multiple things you need to concentrate on is large
      and present in this game and you have to be fast in order to survive and move
      on. The thing that makes me angry most about this game is that once you fail
      or make one mistake it'll cost you the entire level and you'll have to do the
      entire level all over again. And once again each level you have to focus on
      multiple things making some of the levels hard. But this game was really cool
      for its time and even is now.
