    review: 'this game has huge potential but games with low prices, usually do not
      evolve much, the developer is doing a fantastic job I believe that if there
      was a team helping to develop Evospace in the end it would be a fantastic game,
      those who like Factorio will also like Evospace but in this case it is in 3D
      and it is much cheaper

      I bought this game because Satisfactory doesn''t work well on my PC because
      my CPU is weak, well, if there were hundreds of people, the game could evolve
      much more, most people do not know Evospace, small companies do not have the
      power to create advertising, for my part I am sharing information about Evospace
      with other players to try to get them to buy the game, who has Evospace I recommend
      that they share the game''s steam page, if more players come the developer will
      have more resources to create more things in the game, if you are a youtuber
      or twitcher or another platform share as much as possible, and I wish the Evospace
      developer a fantastic job.


      I don''t speak english very well I hope you guys understand my message.'
