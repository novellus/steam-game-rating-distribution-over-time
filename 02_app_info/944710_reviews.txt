That said, almost everything of my original review still applies except - 1 there were no longer any combat segments, and you didn't transform into a beast.  2 Now there is no dialog, but the story still remains to not make sense.  The game is more playable and feels like an Inside or Limbo.  You'll die a lot and will have to gradually learn what will kill you and how to get past it.  Controls are still sluggish, and the main character moves and climbs pretty slowly.  The environments are very dark and seems to play on a 2d plane.  The game seems to use an abundance of fog to hide the lacking background, but I oddly had to play the game at it's lowest settings because of lag.  I still can't recommend it.\n\nLike, I will give them credit, they scrapped a lot and went with an entirely different style of game, but I feel since the story and gameplay changed so much, I don't think there was a cohesive vision to begin with aside from Girl with glowing hair is being sought after by people. \n\n \nPrevious Version Review\nHonestly, I just can't recommend this game as is.  The controls are not very good.  The combat segment that I got to play was not fun and there's no hud that really lets you know what's going on.  The english dialog is very poor, and there is very little engaging from the start to build this world at all.  I've no idea what I'm doing or why I'm doing it.","timestamp_created":1572112120,"timestamp_updated":1609970448,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.514227211475372314","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw6O7t7PYCceXz1AE="}
