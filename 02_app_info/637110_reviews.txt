This game uses the carbon copy of the first game (even the map is same) just to add \"Magic talisman\" mechanic. They just stripped the story script, voice-acting lines, slapped a half-baked \"look! now you have a few more ways to cast spells\" mechanic, and released it. I don't know why they did not put the first game on steam instead of this second downgrade version. \n\nI've just bought this game for the sake of nostalgia, and giving it a thumbs up, for the sake of first game (that is most unfortunately not on steam)","timestamp_created":1572008055,"timestamp_updated":1572008055,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jeq+ge4Ccv3d1AE="}
