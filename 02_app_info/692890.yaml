      \ through randomly generated environments on an unrecognizable Earth. Scorched\
      \ canyons and vivid cities packed with secrets, upgrades, and enemies. <br><br><strong>Destroy</strong>\
      \ every laser-shooting evil bot and boss that stands in your way, choosing from\
      \ an arsenal of handcrafted weapons to do so. <br><br><strong>Gather</strong>\
      \ powerful technology to help you push forward. Upgrades, abilities and customization\
      \ for your character and basecamp. They\u2019ll stick with you after each defeat,\
      \ to make the next run a little easier. <br><br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/692890/extras/YOUR_QUEST_600x200_NEW.gif?t=1609932109\"\

    review: "Doom 2016's fast paced arcade arena play mixed with Warframe's slide\
      \ boost movement, add some rails to grind, good double jump gravity, and simple\
      \ but well-made roguelite mechanics make this an amazing hidden gem. It's compared\
      \ to Gunfire Reborn a lot, but aside from being roguelite FPS, they are vastly\
      \ different. \n\n2 Player COOP on Heroic Difficulty is insanely fun and I can't\
      \ wait to see what the devs bring next."
