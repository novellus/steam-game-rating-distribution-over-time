I hit a wall halfway through the second girls stage, and couldn't make any more progress even after turning on easy mode, which was absolutely identical to normal mode. No hints, no option to undo a bad move, no changing the tiles to look a little more different from each other, no noticeable extra time, no apparent differences whatsoever. I have never struggled with mahjong before in my life, and since the difficulty of this game prevents you from focusing on the girls at all, there's no real point in them being there anymore.\nI'm gonna try to find a classic mahjong like I played before for my PC. This one is just giving me eyestrain and preventing me from enjoying either the game or the art.","timestamp_created":1610027097,"timestamp_updated":1610027097,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uvvF7vYCfqGjwQI="}
