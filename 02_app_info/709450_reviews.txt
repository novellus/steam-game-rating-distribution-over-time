Now this game is a prequel to an upcoming game, and for a prequel it was good, it gives a little bit of story to the upcoming game.\n\nNow two things that were kind of annoying is one no save I mean I know this game is short but a save would have been nice. \n\nAnd lastly why'll the game is free the DLC to have this game be in your library is way too high I mean $4.99 I can see 99 cents, a dollar, even two dollars, but $4.99 \nfor the DLC that’s way too much to have this game be in your library.\n\nSo with said this game is sort but very good and I can’t wait to game the mine game when it comes out.","timestamp_created":1516895532,"timestamp_updated":1516935880,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501385033130645752","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1516930606,"developer_response":"Hi @Kokiri1232, thank you for taking the time to review Towards The Pantheon: Escaping Eternity!
