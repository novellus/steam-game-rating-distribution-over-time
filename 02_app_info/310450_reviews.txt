Overall so far I think it is well done, but it does have its downsides too. I'm enjoying the story, the battle system is straightforward and more or less as expected. There are plenty of side quests available that don't particularly drag you away from the main story but provide enough xp that so far I haven't had to grind out any levels in classic RPG style. \n\nI do have a few complaints, but nothing so serious that it has kept me from enjoying the game. The first is that there doesn't seem to be a world map, which can leave you floundering for town if you wandered too far from a road and aren't exactly sure where you are. The second is that the towns simply seem way too big, about 3 times as big as they need to be. The number of houses that have nothing in them is mind-blowing, yet for those of us familiar with RPG style games we know that we MUST check every one because the one missed have a unique item or quest. This can lead to frustration if you have a few quests you do at once because unless you've got an astounding memory you may not remember exactly where you need to go to turn it in. \n\nThe music isn't particularly riveting, and gets old with time. I don't mind this at all since I tend to turn game music off in favor of streaming anyway. The story seems to be unfolding at a good pace so far. There are occasional pop culture references that are fun. (Dr. Who, Eric Clapton) If you're an absolute fan of the genre, I definitely recommend the game. If not, I can't recommend getting it outside of a sale, but it is still worth trying.","timestamp_created":1417334485,"timestamp_updated":1417334485,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.501930415630340576","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gP7t/8kCcN2YMg=="}
