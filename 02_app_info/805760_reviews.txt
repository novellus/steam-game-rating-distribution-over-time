Initially, you steal minor things, and lie to adults. Then you steal evidence from a crime scene, aiding a paedophile in going free, only to give the material to a child-molesting priest SOLELY because you want a photocopy card. You photograph your underage classmate doing sexual activities and spread photos around the school.\n\nLater, you get obsessed with a woman, and attempt to manipulate her into 'fixing' you. You get one of your coworkers fired by setting them up. You (mildly) poison an innocent person in order to manipulate another coworker.\n\nBe warned, there's a highly sexualised chapter where you have to do 'stuff' to a giant set of lady parts. A bit surreal, but I'm a grown adult. It might not be suitable for younger players.\n\nA later chapter and you're defending a woman who loves her dog *too* much (if you get my drift) and also a paedophile friend of yours because child porn 'doesn't hurt anyone' if 'it's for personal consumption'. WHAT!!!!!???!?!??? What sort of sick people believe this stuff???\n\nThe chapter after that I got stuck because you have to grab something out of your inventory and use it on screen, and you are only given about 2-3 seconds to do it. It's not possible to do that on my laptop trackpad, so I couldn't even progress if I wanted to. I can't hit the top right inventory icon, then move down to the inventory at the bottom, then move to the upper centre of the screen, all in the time allowed.\n\nIn my view, forget this game, go for something like Projectorface if you like this black and white aesthetic. I hope your obnoxious character gets hit by a truck or something at the end of this, because I can't possibly empathise with such a ****head","timestamp_created":1609633287,"timestamp_updated":1609633287,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tdnn4vYCe+TzvwI="}
