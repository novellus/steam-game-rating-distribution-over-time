I love a fun platformer that adds some thinking to traverse a game. The game makes you use your brain with math skills and platform skills to move forward in this good looking and well designed game. Definitely aimed towards young ones, but fun for all!","timestamp_created":1604612942,"timestamp_updated":1604612942,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi82YzfUCd/fGrAI="}
