Brooke immediately secures an ally in another student named Molly while Brooke makes the most of her situation all the while trying to figure out the motive for Kendra's behavior.\n\n[h1]Graphics and Sound[/h1]\n\nThe graphics are purely original and the characters (and scenes) are very aesthetically pleasing, and with the exception of Molly, come across as very attractive, and may be refreshing to some people who prefer a visual novel that features something other than anime characters.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1715713124\n\nThe sounds are limited to basic sound effects that are few and far between, but the background music not only does it's job in setting the mood, but is also pleasing to the player's ear.\n\n[h1]Positives and Negatives[/h1]\n\n(Note:  These had to be combined because this could go either way.)\n\n[i]The Queen of Blackwood High[/i] features F+F relationships, which may or may not appeal to the player.  (The established term \"yuri\" cannot be applied due to the non-anime style of graphics.) There's also no sex or nudity which can be a good or a bad thing depending on the player's preference.  (Despite the large amount of trashy visual novels on Steam, players have been encountered that would rather not have these exciting elements in their visual novels....  Plot twist?)\n\nThe number of characters is also lacking, which wasn't quite so much of a concern for another visual novel found here on Steam, but in this case it's a bad thing because [spoiler]it's not known if it was the developer's motive, but Molly comes across as that unpopular student who attempts to take advantage a new student's ignorance by getting clingy so they'll actually have at least one friend.[/spoiler]\n\nWhen it comes to scenes, there's a significant amount of corner-cutting in the graphics.  I know [i]Kindred Spirits on the Roof[/i] managed to get away with corner cutting by not featuring the main character's [spoiler]first kiss[/spoiler] due to everything else that was featured, but this is really inexcusable for any visual novel to omit this important part of the main character's life. [spoiler]Regardless of the presence of adult material, it's safe to assume that the player would want to see girls kissing girls.[/spoiler]\n\n[i]The Queen of Blackwood High[/i] does not contain achievements, which makes it more difficult for the player to know if they have seen every ending in the game.  (The only way the player will ever know if they've seen anything is from the unique pictures that have been unlocked in the game's gallery.)\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nYes, the author is motivated to write reviews in recent times to help developers satisfy Steam's algorithm so that developers can release market items and have in-game achievements officially count on the profiles of Steam users, so go ahead and help out the developer (along with an untold number of other players) by writing a review, too.  Heck, just adding this game to your wishlist is good enough to help with satisfying the algorithm.\n\n[h1]The honest word of Il Pallino...
