    about_the_game: <strong>Meatball</strong> - A Hardcore 2D-game, if you are not
      all right with your nerves, then I do not advise you to launch this game, it
      will make you very angry, but if you still launch the game, then take care of
      your mouse. This is a game in which we play the role of a meatball, it fell
      under the meat grinder and our task is not to fall under the saws. You need
      to deliver the meatball to the finish line. You can rotate the platform around
      its axis by throwing the meatball. You can freeze the meatball in one place
      by clicking the palm button.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Increasing difficulty</li></ul><ul

    review: A simple puzzle game with an interesting visual style. The main game mechanic
      is the rotation of the screen relative to the main character. It will help you
      pass a couple of tens of minutes while waiting for your friend. Perhaps, it
      is suitable for playing in the background while watching streams or listening
      to an audiobook.
