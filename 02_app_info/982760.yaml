      implemented in the future).<br>Next you could gather different resources: wood,
      stone, etc. All of them you need to make tools, weapons and to build towns.<br>There
      are a social relations in the game too. Players can join guilds. Warlords can
      set standing to mark enemies or allies (planned to be implemented in the future).<br>You

      (provides the mercenaries) (planned to be implemented in the future)<br></li><li>Market

      (provides services for improving of weapons) (planned to be implemented in the
      future, but there are the furnace and workbenches in the game now)<br></li><li>House
      of lumberman (provides a bonus to gather wood) (planned to be implemented in
      the future)<br></li><li>Siege workshop (provides a possibility to make siege
      machines) (planned to be implemented in the future)</li></ul>... and a few other
      buildings.<br>The paid taxes and different resources are stored in the Townhall.
      And this building will attract the raiders. To defend it, you have to build
      walls, towers and hire guardians (planned to be implemented in the future, but
      there are walls and gate in the game now).<br>And finally - the war! A war for
      resources, towns and glory!<br>The combat system is supposed to be &quot;non-target&quot;
      in this game.<br>So, you will survive, gather, build and fight!'
