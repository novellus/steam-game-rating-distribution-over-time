Love the pearl handles also!\nRating: Approved!\n\nCorsair Knife:\n\nA very elegant diver's knife that was found amongst the wreckage of a Spanish Galleon! The handle is pearl with gold inlays for the pommel, screws and tang, The blade itself is accented in what appears to be gold but is most likely polished brass to be used to deflect oncoming blows. I like to personally use this knife more than the others that I own!\nRating: EXCELLENT!\n\nCorsair APS:\n\nThe ENGRAVING! The GOLD! The PEARL! The ARTISTRY! Pure Beauty of a Beast of a Weapon!\nRating: SUPERB!\n\nOverall Set Rating: EXCELLENT! A Must have if you truly love playing Depth! The set is so shiney and purdy! I think we're gonna need a bigger boat! Thar be sharks in dem waters!","timestamp_created":1595055355,"timestamp_updated":1595055355,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4x6atsPMCf5mClgI="}
