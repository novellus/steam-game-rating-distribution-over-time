A film that includes a plot surrounding someone with my eye condition. It has more plot holes than a sieve. However it has a greater meaning to me. Can I recommend it for most people? Probably not. For me though, the greater meaning comes through. I cherish every sight I have, and that I am seeing my kids grow up, and hope that my useful vision sees out it's usefulness.\nI get what this film encapsulates, in its mixed up way. Going blind does indeed suck. Dealing with all the other obsticles life throws at you can also sucks too, but they are a welcome distration in comparison.\nShould you watch it? That depemds on where you are at.\nIt does not present a true reflection of RP (my eye condition), but it sure does present a picture of realisation and a hope that one good thing will mean the same to others that matter to you.\nIt hit a cord with me because it meant something. That something may mean nothing to you. You decide.","timestamp_created":1488067737,"timestamp_updated":1488067737,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.682511866092681885","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42vbvu9oCeYiRcw=="}
