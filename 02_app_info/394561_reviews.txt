I'll give a positive review because, as always, the tables are well-done, with lots of great bonuses from history to new ball designs, and more pinball is always a good thing, but overall the tables here, at least for me, do less to show the real range of tables they could have, with no really stand-out inclusions or oddities. Likewise, the inclusion of El Dorado is a bit of a cop-out, since it's simply an older skin of a table they already had in a previous pack.\n\n","timestamp_created":1465722811,"timestamp_updated":1465722811,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.669087707996368408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p+b4odUCcfTaWQ=="}
