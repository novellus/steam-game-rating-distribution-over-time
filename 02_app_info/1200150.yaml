      Race or battle against other drivers in VR, or perform big stunts on the massive
      quarterpipes of the Xenodome. Take advantage of a large assortment of power-ups,
      as well as your laser rifle &amp; dedicated launcher, to alter the situation
      in your favor. Use a plane kit to soar over the daunting HyperCorp Complex,

      golden rings hidden (or otherwise difficult to reach) throughout the game's

      experienced hyperwheeler. Unlock new car decals and driver suit skins, as well

      vehicle design combined with the powerfully immersive nature of VR make the
      experience novel and unforgettable!<br><br><strong>Note on Comfort:</strong>
      Though the game is on the more intense side of things in VR, we have gone to
      great lengths to offer many different ways of experiencing the game including
      a third-person camera system that makes all first-person rifle and power-up
      handling continue to work seamlessly, helmet vignettes, comfort cages, and rotation-locked
      views. There should be enough options present to make the game suitable for
      most VR players, and there are less intense experiences available in the larger
      game such as the boat races.

    review: This game is a lot of fun to play. So many different modes to play. racing,
      capture the flag, stunt, death match, free play where you try and find all the
      rings. The reason I especially like it is because you can sit down and play.  The
      rockets and grenades look cool blowing stuff up. The races on water are my favourites.
      I think you could play this a long time and not see everything it has to offer.
      The leader boards keep a person striving for better times and trophies.  I recommend
      this game if your into action games.
