I’ve been wanting a more modern version of games to play on my arcade cabinet, and this is amazing. No 4:3 or 5:4 resolution support for my old-timey cabinet monitor, but I wasn’t expecting it. \n\nI also very much appreciate the fact that controller action buttons still work to fire bombs in mouse mode, because I didn’t think to wire up mouse buttons for my trackball, and now I don’t need to disassemble and cut into my panel again. \n\nLooking forward to many hours of blasting bug guts in 2020.","timestamp_created":1588974457,"timestamp_updated":1588974457,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4isKQ+/ECcqrAhgI="}
