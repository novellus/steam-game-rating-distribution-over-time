    review: Just too expensive for my taste even on sale. Without any intro or story
      the game just feels empty. The graphics are very simple and the long respawn
      waiting period was tiring. Maybe it has a lot of content in the end and I feel
      a little bad to downvote after some minutes of play. It just felt to cheap though,
      just play any other decent non-VR side-scroller instead.
