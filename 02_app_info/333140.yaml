      potentially one of the most scurrile protagonists since the invention of the
      hoverboard. Randal''s Monday is a crazy space-time odyssey in classic adventure
      design, spiced up with countless geek culture references of the last 30 years.<br><br>Randal
      wakes up after the engagement party of his best friend Matt; he''s ridden by
      a raging hangover and also has Matt''s wallet in his possession. Inside the
      wallet is his engagement ring and without thinking of the consequences, Randal
      sells the ring - and thus gets struck by a terrible curse. Matt commits suicide
      and now Randal is forced to relive the same ill-fated Monday over and over,
      trying to undo his mistake.<br><br>Randal needs to retrieve the ring and sort
      his own life out, before things get any worse... Collapsing the whole space-time
      continuum-kinda-worse, in fact. <br><br>Attention geeks! Randal''s Monday offers
      black humor of the finest sort, all kinds of pop culture references and all
