    review: "Having no more patience to deal with rebels and trivial incidents, I\
      \ united Europe in 1921 in the game and the game became over. I don't know if\
      \ the game will be better viewed if the player can make the scenario last longer.\
      \   \n\nThe game becomes extremely boring once the player finishes the research\
      \ of the first type of armoured car and owns a lot of them. Because in the game\
      \ the armoured units are almost invincible against others and the AIs produce\
      \ mainly infantry even if they are able to produce other units. This makes the\
      \ system of tactical battle completely unbalanced and the shabby interface and\
      \ mechanism of tactical battle are also dissapointing.\n\nThe strategic interface\
      \ is comparably better.  However it should still be better designed. There are\
      \ 3 resources (populations, industry points and education points) in the system\
      \ and you would find in most cases only the education points are important.\n\
      \nNo doubt with such a cheap price one can only acquire a crudely designed game.\
      \ The content is seemingly rich but indeed monotone."
