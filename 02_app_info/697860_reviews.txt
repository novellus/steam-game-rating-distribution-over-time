Is it perfect? no. Is it fun? YES. The ui can be unfriendly at times (in particular the sprite/figure editor, left click on the top left in the sprite drawing area on the SMALL white letter just next to it to change brush. not the boxed letters.) but the manual does help even if it could be a little more clear. Regardless though, the program is just great fun to play with, and has more potential than I think the store page might first let on. Audio reactivity stuff is probably my biggest issue, it could do with improvement both performance and stability wise, and just the way the program reacts to sound is maddeningly inconsistent sometimes. Live camera pickup also doesn't seem to work right, but besides that its just loads of fun. I've made tons of little animations and videos, including things I've ported into Blender as animations to put on a display, brilliant to add to the aesthetic of a render. The tool is a seriously great value considering how much similar programs are worth. Basically, if you're eyeing the program up at all, get it. Tip for new users too: If the program is running slowly, check what resolution you're running the render box at, reopen the program and make sure it's not too big. The resolution numbers for the CRT simulator on the open screen are different from the actual size of the render box, which can be scaled. I tend to just use one of the presets, I'd try a few of those first before inputting any custom resolution.","timestamp_created":1609753359,"timestamp_updated":1609753359,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qd6x5vYCdd6rwAI="}
