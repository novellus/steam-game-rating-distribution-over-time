      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Story</h2>On the brink of revolt, the common people\
      \ cry out for justice from their heartless queen. This story is set in an alternate\
      \ steampunk world in the early 20th century in the Capital of the strongest\
      \ Empire in the world. The game tells a story of a military veteran, Alex, who\
      \ becomes increasingly frustrated with the growing corruption of the monarchy\
      \ and the exploitation of the common folk. When Alex's brother gets arrested\
      \ for an attempted coup, Alex will have no choice but to fight if he ever wants\
      \ to see his brother again. It appears that a concentration of power lies in\
      \ the hands of a powerful few. But there is more to this than meets the eye.\
      \ These few are being manipulated by supernatural beings that feed off of the\
      \ fervor, lust, and wrath of humankind. <strong>A spark</strong> of revolution\
      \ will change it all.<br>  <br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1441860/extras/Ayiric2.png?t=1602544154\"\

      notes: 'Several of conversations reference general mature topics, substance
        abuse, sex, and prostitution (nothing is ever shown directly, only implied
        through conversations). Conversations might contain crude, and cursing words
        from time to time. '
