      \ /><br>Weapon Shop Fantasy is a shop simulator with a whole lot of RPG elements.\
      \ <br> <br>Or maybe it's an RPG with a whole lot of shop simulation\u2026  <br>You\
      \ decide. <br> <br>Anyway.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/599460/extras/01.png?t=1608695484\"\
      \ /><br>Craft mighty weapons! <br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/599460/extras/02.png?t=1608695484\"\
      \ /><br>Enchant them with magic! <br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/599460/extras/5.png?t=1608695484\"\
      \ /><br>Here are just a few of the things you can do in Weapon Shop Fantasy\u2026\
      \ <br> <br>Defeat mighty (pixelated) enemies <br>Collect rare materials <br>Learn\
      \ awesome and useful skills <br>Make your own skill combinations <br>Defeat\
      \ monsters for new materials\u2026 or just steal them and run away <br>Bring\
      \ on new staff, send them on adventures, keep all of the materials they gain\
      \ <br>Read some hilarious (and sometimes cheesy) dialogue between some pretty\
      \ silly characters <br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/599460/extras/6.png?t=1608695484\"\
      \ /><br><br>In Weapon Shop Fantasy, you can also hire a team of staff members\
      \ to do specific jobs for you, additionally you can improve their abilities\
      \ and push them to develop new skills.  <br>The staff training system is almost\
      \ limitless, so there's always room for improvement and investment in your staff.\
      \ Combine staff training with enemy battles, collected materials, and skill\
      \ unlocks, to make your crafted weapons and equipment more and more powerful.\
      \ <br> <br>There are over 200 different pieces of gear and equipment to be crafted,\
      \ with an equally impressive selection of over 200 skills. With skill combinations,\
      \ you've got almost limitless options. <br>There's a huge selection of over\
      \ 70 monsters, as well as a few giant bosses to conquer, in addition to over\
      \ a hundred missions to complete. <br> <br>We've also added some unique mechanics\
      \ to the game. One example is having to lure bosses out of hiding, using food\
      \ to entice them. Offer them something sweet, then destroy them.  <br>When you\
      \ craft different weapons and equipment, you'll notice that each one has its\
      \ own attributes and skill bindings. The weapon crafting also has an element\
      \ of luck, so you never know when you might just luck out and craft the perfect\
      \ weapon.  <br>Also, what weapon crafting game would be complete without additional\
      \ enchanting mechanics to further imbue your equipment with even more raw power.\
      \  <br> <br>In addition to crafting and making money, you can also send your\
      \ staff members on auto-battle journeys where they'll earn materials for you\
      \ as they progress deeper and deeper into dungeons. You'll see your materials\
      \ building up, but pay attention to the health of your staff. If you feel there's\
      \ a chance they might die, you can run from battle at any time and keep any\
      \ materials they've already earned from that journey.  <br> <br>We hope, whatever\
      \ you decide to do in the game, that you have a great time doing it.  <br> <br>Sincerely,\
      \ <br>Digdog Studios Ltd."
