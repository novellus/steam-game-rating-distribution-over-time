    review: "I remembered this one from back when I had an Oculus DK2. It was neat\
      \ then and still is. Some people complain about the paddle being controlled\
      \ by the HMD instead of your hands but you can grip the controllers and get\
      \ two rackets to use instead. In fact, the best way to play this game is to\
      \ keep switching back and forth between the two control schemes in real time,\
      \ using whichever is better for that exact moment the ball is coming at you.\
      \ I also like that your progress is saved No need to get levels and levels deep\
      \ only to have to start from the very beginning next time. A classic VR game\
      \ that's also a pretty cool way to introduce someone to VR that isn't a hardcore\
      \ gamer. \n\nNote: If you're playing using the controllers make sure you have\
      \ a decent amount of space around you and above you. You will need to dive left\
      \ and right and make overhand swings just like as if you were playing tennis.\
      \ If you don't have enough room then stick with moving your head to control\
      \ the paddle."
