    about_the_game: <strong>M.U.S.T. <i>(Memory Usage Set To)</i> Repeat</strong>
      is a logical puzzle game in which tiny robot Q.T. is evaluated for its cognitive
      abilities by solving the puzzles in the scientific testing facility. If all
      the tests are completed successfully, it may even improve the future of the
      planet. Q.T. uses the <strong>unique</strong> Repeat mechanic to navigate the
      rooms and defeat enemies. The higher the Repeat is, the more difficult it is
      to navigate through the room, but you have to increase your Repeat in order
      to defeat the higher level Guard Bots. <br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1293940/extras/L33t.PNG?t=1596637532"
      /><br><br>The test rooms are the only location in the game, but as the game
      progresses, you pass through the four different areas represented by new tilesets.
      The areas introduce new mechanics with which Q.T. must repeat the process of
      level completion in challenging and interesting ways while still using its core
      unique mechanic.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1293940/extras/Desc1.jpg?t=1596637532"
      /><br><br>Through repeating trial and error you can achieve the goal.

    review: '[i]M.U.S.T. Repeat[/i] bears a spartan veneer, but there are some cleverly
      constructed puzzles lurking under the chassis.  The aptly named robot Q.T. is
      undergoing testing and needs your assistance in dispatching scores of frowning
      guard bots.  Through the use of its repeat function, Q.T. can overcome these
      sour-faced sentinels and extinguish the negativity in each chamber.  The repeat
      function dictates the number of tiles that Q.T. will travel past during each
      move; while maneuverability is generally best when the repeat count is low,
      a repeat value equal to or greater than a guard bot''s assigned value must be
      maintained if Q.T. is to emerge victorious in battle.  Junction blocks located
      throughout most of the chambers can be used to increase or decrease Q.T.''s
      repeat value as required.  Deducing the proper sequences can be slightly daunting,
      but all potential movement options are nicely highlighted.  If you''re experiencing
      difficulties along the way, a maximum of three levels can be skipped and revisited
      later.


      A novel variation on the familiar ice-sliding puzzle.'
