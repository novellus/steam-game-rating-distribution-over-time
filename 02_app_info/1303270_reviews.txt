For more info you can check out my review video:\nhttps://youtu.be/V4ly2bGg8t0\n\nI am only recommending this because I enjoy the art style and environments, and because I think that the core mechanics are interesting. With some tweaking, the addition of a tutorial, and some quality of life stuff, this game could be cool.","timestamp_created":1604107677,"timestamp_updated":1604107677,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41JWRvvUCefKYqwI="}
