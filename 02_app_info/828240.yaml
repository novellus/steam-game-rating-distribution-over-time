    about_the_game: Immerse yourself in an alien realm where the sights, sounds, and
      sensations that you experience all become clues for your survival. Touch a green
      glow and see its effects. Open a gateway to a new area.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/828240/extras/host-portals-opening.gif?t=1591673474"
      /><br><br>Experience new rooms, and descend deeper. Level by level, tap into
      your gaming intuition to solve each puzzle. Who or what is the &quot;host&quot;
      and what is your relation to this space?<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/828240/extras/host-consumption.gif?t=1591673474"
      /><br><br>With a focus on experiential-based gameplay, Garrett Fuselier has
      created a virtual reality to challenge and cherish. The dim glow of the swelling
      visuals and the fluctuation of the atmospheric audio (all created solely with
      voice work) build a new kind of gaming experience that, like its narrative,
      grows in intrigue and innovation. Recalling the classic situation-based puzzles
      throughout gaming history, you will find no UI, no voice over, and no buttons
      to press (on your controller).<br><br>Inside the world of HOST, you are your
      only salvation.<br><br>The game will stay naturally within the confines of your
      environment. For the best immersive experience, change your Chaperone settings
      to be minimal and dark.

    review: "Rad environment design and great use of small room-scale space. If you\
      \ like short creepy puzzles, check this out. \n\nFor the dev: I saw in the recommended\
      \ settings \"Additional Notes: For the best immersive experience, change your\
      \ Chaperone settings to be minimal and dark.\" Would be nice to see this tip\
      \ at the beginning of the game since I didn't think about it until most of the\
      \ way through the game and it definitely helps the ambiance and atmosphere to\
      \ see less play-space outlines."
