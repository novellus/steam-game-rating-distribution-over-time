The game is fairly difficult with its lack of auto-saves, and complicated skill system. However, the writing (even with the few glitches that I experienced in the text) was memorable and enjoyable. I very much enjoyed the game after reading a few guides to character creation (and I very much recommend doing some research on the first few weeks). I decided to have Mr.Pebbles, a rock, as my familiar. This was very amusing. Training with him and going on my familiar quest was my favorite part of my play through. It was hilarious. Overall, I've played for about 26 hours and only completed one play through. I though originally that Year 2 would be included in this game. As, the title is slightly misleading. However, I will be looking forward to when Year 2 finally releases. The game is memorable and has high re-playablity after you get over the learning curve.","timestamp_created":1609390444,"timestamp_updated":1609390444,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3qnJ2/YCfLCAvwI="}
