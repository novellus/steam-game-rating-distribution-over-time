    review: Growing up, this was the first Star Wars game that allowed me to play
      as the Galactic Empire, I loved it for that experience!  It is an old game,
      so the graphics and AI are something to be desired (it is quite easy to cheese
      the AI once you understand it's rhythms).  However the game is filled with lots
      of complexities, requiring you to manage an economy to gather resources, keep
      tabs public perception of your faction, direct fleet and troop movements, taking
      offices on missions or placing them in command positions to boost the effectiveness
      of your forces.  The game is filled with hidden bonuses that relate to Star
      Wars lore, and secret missions which activate if your trigger events from the
      movies.  Despite it's age and all the other Star Wars games that are out there,
      I still find myself coming back to this one time and again.
