The game can be a bit frustrating with the quick time events it throws at you, but as long as you know how to type you'll be fine. Puzzles range from simple to baffling, and I ended up playing with a guide open. I think the biggest thing this short game missed, besides less-cryptic puzzles, was a system to remove items once they're done being used. \n\nOverall a fun, short game with an unlockable maid outfit. Definitely worth it.","timestamp_created":1609378675,"timestamp_updated":1609378675,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4k7ec2/YCcaT7vgI="}
