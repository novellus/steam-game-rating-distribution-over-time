So if you die in the dungeon you will get back at the entrance with all your progress lost.\n\nNot to mention that the game lacks achievements or trading cards, also lacks controller and screenshot support, so if you're playing the game for the lewd, which is very scarse BTW, you only get like 6 pictures that you could easly miss in your first walkthough, you can't even same or screencap them, so pretty much there is no point in playing this over something like Melty's Quest.\n\nIf you for some reason feel you NEED to play Girls and Dungeons because you like the sprite art of the girls, pretty much this game's only saving grace, buy it on sale.","timestamp_created":1608346961,"timestamp_updated":1608346961,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xuC8vPYCeOqquwI="}
