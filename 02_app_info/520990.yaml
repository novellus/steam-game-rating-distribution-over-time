    about_the_game: It has been 10 years since the 'Barrow Hill Incident', a terrible,
      unsolved mystery, when several people lost their lives to the force inside the
      hill. No-one knows what really happened, except you. Something to do with the
      ancient standing stones, the old Druid Circle. It was built by pagans, millennia
      ago, for purposes that we can only guess at. Until now.<br><br>It is the Autumn
      Equinox, when day and night are equal, exactly as they were a decade ago. You
      have returned to the scene of the crime, seeking answers. Could such an event
      happen again? What trials and offerings await? As you leave the car behind,
      and step into the dark world of the old woods, you wonder whether you seek the
      truth, or you are following the Dark Path.<br><br>Joining you on your adventure,
      once again, is kooky amateur late-night DJ Emma Harry. She is worried for her
      teenage friend, Mia, who has been behaving suspiciously. Emma has heard rumours
      of rituals, ceremonies and Devil Worship near the old Barrow Hill Service Station.
      Could Mia be involved? She may have good reason, Mia's brother Ben was among
      the missing 10 years ago. Is time repeating itself?<br><br>Features -<br><ul

    review: 'Barrow Hill: The Dark Path is a follow up to Barrow Hill: Curse of the
      Ancient Circle. It''s been 10 years since the tragedy in Barrow Hill involving
      the ancient stones that took the lives of the Emmett family, Ben Kendell, and
      Whincy the dog. Once again, it''s up to you to save the day and put to rest
      an angry witch who has been resurrected due to the fact that her tomb has been
      robbed.


      Pros:

      A mystery unfolds as you play

      Decent graphics

      Almost all of the puzzles are good logic puzzles

      Clues are scattered about forcing you to find and put them together

      Simplest of controls (Except for one time, you use the mouse and that''s it)

      Voice acting is decent (Females only)


      Cons:

      Too much reading (there is a lot of filler in the journals, information you
      don''t need)

      Voice acting for the males is not good.


      Much like the first game, there are several puzzles to solve, each one them
      (except one or possibly two) are well thought out and completely logical. Also,
      the game gives you a good reason for going back to the scene where you almost
      bought it ten years before.


      As far as I know, you can''t die, unlike the first game. The witch seems hell
      bent on inflicting misery on our friends, not you. Almost as if the witch sees
      you as a curiosity and not a threat. With that said, if you''re looking for
      a game with a sense of danger and suspense, then I''m sorry to say, this game
      has none of that. It felt more casual play and suspense. The witch does crop
      up from time to time and she does speak to you, but nothing really threatening.


      I don''t really have any complaints about this game. If I had to pick one thing
      I didn''t like (besides all of the reading), I would have to say the voice acting
      for Gus and Ollie. Almost like finger nails on a blackboard, especially Ollie.
      What a whiny little sh!t he is. At one point I was kind of hoping that he would
      die.


      At the time of this review, Barrow Hill: The Dark Path was selling for $14.99.
      I really like this game but I think that price is a bit too high. However, if
      you don''t care about price and you liked the first game, then you won''t be
      disappointed.'
