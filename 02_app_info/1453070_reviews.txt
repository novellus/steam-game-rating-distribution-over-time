I played both in VR so can't speak to the PC/2D version. Just more of a cohesive sequence. I played it all in one sitting, maybe an hour or so. Definitely feels like a much shorter, very 'budget', VR version of Outlast 1. \n\nThe jankiness makes it both more and less scary. Less cause it's easier to just laugh it off, but also more cause in VR the sounds seem to come from everywhere and nowhere at the same time. Lots of random women screaming that sounds very close, but it's coming from inside walls/there's no one actually there. One way to keep you on your toes I suppose. \n\n[spoiler] During the ending \"boss fight\", just after you save the girl and go out to the front lawn, the girl ended up straight up dying. You just have to spam the two bosses with the taser until they go down, at first I wondered if I was doing it wrong. Luckily the game didn't seem to give a shit that the entire thing was pointless after her death and I \"won\" anyway.
