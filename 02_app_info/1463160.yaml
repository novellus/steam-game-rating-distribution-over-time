    review: 'This review is for the whole pack rather than just this track.


      Overall: These are very high quality beat maps. They have a whole different
      feel from the other official packs. It seems like there was a professional choreographer
      involved with these, or at the very least they put a lot of time into studying
      the BTS dances and implementing similar motions.


      Con: I would prefer if you could turn the dancers off. They do spawn in the
      same zone the blocks spawn in. Though they didn''t have any effect on my ability
      to play the maps.


      Difficulty: I beat two of the expert+ maps on my first try. But the way you
      move differently in the maps kept them interesting and challenging. Those two
      will at least be good warmup maps. The rest of the maps are going to take some
      time for me to beat. (For reference, I''ve beaten maybe half of the OG expert+
      tracks)


      Other: They regularly use the zones you can''t stand in, so you have to move
      your body around pretty heavily in maybe half or more of the tracks. Similar
      to FitBeat in the OG tracks.'
