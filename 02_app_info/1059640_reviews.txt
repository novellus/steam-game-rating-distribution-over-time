Combat is fun and there is a big variety of enemies to fight. However, there are improvements that could be made. For example, the lack of a titlescreen makes the game seem less polished. It is kind of jarring to be thrown straight into the game. Despite this, Deepsea Salvor is a decent little roguelike and I see a lot of potential.","timestamp_created":1584736799,"timestamp_updated":1584736799,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4kZHr/PACfuvI+QE="}
