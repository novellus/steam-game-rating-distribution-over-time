    review: "I'm giving this a thumb up because if you're interested by what it has\
      \ to offer, you'll play it anyway. \nAnd the developers are self conscious enough\
      \ and have enough humour to make this interesting and coherent. But there are\
      \ big flaws, more precisely the walking speed of the main character and the\
      \ atrocious inventory make this an exercice in patience.\nThankfully the game\
      \ is not very long and you can soldier through it and finish it.\nI know the\
      \ whole game is second degree and the horrid gameplay is probably part of the\
      \ experience, but it's really a slog to play.\n\nThe game itself is OK. It's\
      \ a point-and-click adventure.\n Its main selling point, the 1994 look, which\
      \ is coherent and well done. It looks like all these sleazy 3D renderings must\
      \ have required a bit of time to create.\nIt really feels like a cheap softcore\
      \ game that you'd play at this time and the poser/3DS renderings are very faithful\
      \ to the era. As well as the general alien theme that reminds of the X-file\
      \ craze, and the douche characters straight out of a cheap 1990s softcore movie.\n\
      It would have been great if the musics had been similar to the smooth MIDI jazz\
      \ backgrounds you could hear in those old 90s porn movies, which is a lost art\
      \ in itself.\nThe sex scenes are exactly what you'd expect to find on a risque\
      \ CD-rom exploiting the latest 1994 tech. More horrifying than arousing.\nThe\
      \ game can be finished and you wont find yourself stumped because you forgot\
      \ something or because of a logical bug.\n\nMost of the cutscenes are displayed\
      \ slowly and with choppy sound and I'm not sure if it's part of the 1994 experience\
      \ or just because the engine is really shitty.\n\nI'm going to give this a thumb\
      \ up because of the overall coherence and design, but I really hope the devs\
      \ adress these problem if they make another game. Right now I'd advise to wait\
      \ for a sale if you want to buy it. Don't pay more than a couple dollers for\
      \ it tbqh.\n\n[h1](follow my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33882793/]GenXPlayers[/url]\
