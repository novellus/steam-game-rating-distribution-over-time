    review: "I am currently playing all the Strange Man collection games with a friend.\
      \ We finished the first one (Crooked man) already and just recently finished\
      \ this one.\nThe graphics are nice, at least in my opinion, but one has to like\
      \ the pixel style. The controls are okay and fairly easy. The first maybe half\
      \ of the game was amazing and really fun, very different from the first game.\
      \ Both my friend and I expected the story to go a different way though and think\
      \ that it lacked something towards the end. There is a character that we expected\
      \ (and wished) to take on a more important role, maybe be evil etc. The end\
      \ of the story sadly felt a bit rushed and unfitting for the previous story.\
      \ \nThe main character is also constantly changing in how they react and think,\
      \ especially in the last few scenes, which ruined our immersion.\nThe game has\
      \ a lot of potential and great ideas, not always used up to their full potential\
      \ sadly, but still very much worth playing."
