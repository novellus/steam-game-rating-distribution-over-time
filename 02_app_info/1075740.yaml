      /><br><br>We think Banners of Ruin is in a really enjoyable place right now.
      There's plenty to expand upon, balance and polish - a lot of the artwork needs
      a rendering pass (the game requires a huge amount!) - but we think there's plenty
      of depth to explore. As long-standing fans of deckbuilders like Dominion, we
      think the game offers a deeper, more unique flavour of deckbuilding while introducing
      new mechanics like positions, characters, equipment and races!<br><br>The game
      is designed to be re-played, with at least 4-6 hours of content, a fun core
      gameplay loop and an unlock system that increases the pool of cards you want
      to see over the course of successive runs. We want you to know that content
      is our biggest priority going forward, but also that it's all being created
      by a tiny core team of two, with an extremely talented composer.<br><br>There's
      so many exciting things we want to do with Banners of Ruin, and we know it might
      not come as quickly as you'd like, but nevertheless we hope you'll choose to
      support us and most importantly - love the game! We've got plenty of ideas in
      mind and we'd like nothing more than a vibrant community to join us in exploring
      them. <br><br>Don't hesitate to contact us if you're having issues, want to
      provide some feedback, or just tell us which animal you think is the best :)<br><br>(P.S.
      it's Bears.)<br><br><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://discord.gg/HXdVQHb"
