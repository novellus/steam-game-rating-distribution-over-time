    short_description: Naho got into a fight with Kakeru on New Year's Eve, and never
      managed to apologize to him before he passed away. At least, that's what the
      letter from the future says. However, Naho now believes that she's capable of
      dealing with whatever may come up, and faces New Year's Eve head-on.
