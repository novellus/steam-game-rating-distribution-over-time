      is the first entry in a series of made-for-VR escape room games to be released
      on Steam. In it you''ll find puzzles ranging from relatively simple to quite
      complex, with clues both transparent and cleverly obfuscated. We''ve endeavored
      to keep objects true to their real world counterparts and to give the player
      the tools they need to interact with the virtual world as comfortably and intuitively
      as possible.<br><br>Inescapable VR: Underground was made to mimic the feel and
      pace of real life escape rooms as closely as possible. The puzzles are not designed
      to be simple matters where you have to follow very basic instructions or complete
      overly obvious tasks. Each puzzle in the game has multiple parts to it, with
      some requiring the combination of various objects to find the final solution.
      A challenge awaits.<br><br>The game is designed around roomscale VR on the Vive
      and features both teleportation and sliding locomotion options which can be

    review: "I finished it on the 1st try with 2 minutes to spare, and just because\
      \ my wife that watched for a few seconds pointed something i hadnt notice at\
      \ all.\n\nThis could probably be the hardest escape the room game ive played...\
      \ but the time limit seemed perfect for a very very tense game, or at least\
      \ a couple of playthroughs. \n\nOnce i figured out, it didnt seem so hard, if\
      \ that makes any sense, but figuring out the first time gave me a really cool\
      \ sense of satisfaction every Escape the Room game should aim to deliver.\n\n\
      Puzzles have VERY different degrees of difficulty, from finding something, to\
      \ putting things together from 2 different clues that could seem not related,\
      \ or random clues that are more than they seem.\n\nIt gave me at least a couple\
      \ of \"frustrating\" moments where i thought \"what if X and Y and Z mean this\
      \ other thing and are the solution to this puzzle_\" and BAM it was actually\
      \ how it was meant to be solved.\n\nThere arent so many puzzles really, but\
      \ while clues to solving every puzzle are out in the open, they are easy to\
      \ miss, so you need to put attention on your surroundings and piece things together\
      \ out of very faint help.\n\nOffers teleporting and sliding movement \"following\
      \ the controller\".\n\nI didnt enconter any bugs that made me thing something\
      \ was wrong with the game and that why i couldnt advance, but the grabbing things\
      \ and using them are not as intuitive as id like, still, perfectly playeable\
      \ and it works fine.\n\nGood performance, and excellent price for the length!\
      \ even more if you need more than 1 playthrough to finish it.\n\nRecommended\
      \ if you like Escape the Room games, probably not the one id recommend to a\
      \ 1st timer of the genre."
