    about_the_game: "The Fairchild PT-26 was an American monoplane primary trainer\
      \ aircraft that served with the United States Army Air Force, RAF and RCAF during\
      \ World War II. It was a contemporary of the kaydet biplane trainer and was\
      \ used by the USAAF during Primary Flying Training and was used to train new\
      \ pilots before passing them on to the more agile kaydet. The final variant\
      \ was the PT-26 which used the Ranger L-440-7 engine. <br><br>The version recreated\
      \ for FSX: Steam Edition is a Fairchild PT-26 Cornell which has been recently\
      \ restored and ready for its first test flight. It includes a Hobbs engine hours\
      \ gauge that tracks your engine time. As the gauge is \u201Cused\u201D, it starts\
      \ at 19,100 hours. You can teach your friends to fly, take a scenic flight or\
      \ fly this one of a kind aircraft on an amazing low river run. <br><br>The panel\
      \ is based on the original configuration with a few minor changes: the wet compass\
      \ has been moved up to the canopy, the RPM gauge moved to where the wet compass\
      \ was, and in its place there is a custom dual clock for tracking your flight\
      \ time. The custom wobble pump lever allows you to add pressure to the fuel\
      \ pressure gauge and in return you get real world pressure levels for an accurate\
      \ start up procedure. <br><br>The PT-26 has 2 fuel gauges which are located\
      \ on the top of each wing which includes virtual cockpit views for both fuel\
      \ gauges and the GTX330 transponder. Developed with the help from a veteran\
      \ commercial pilot who restored a real world PT-26, you can expect exceptional\
      \ accuracy and attention to detail in this aircraft package!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"\

    review: "Worth it? Ayyyeee (read the few words below)\n\nThe plane handles nice,\
      \ fun to fly, and isn't horrible on the detail. \n\nA few bucks cheaper would\
      \ have been nice... (I say that for most things though), but stll worth it.\
      \ \n\nBuy it to have some fun free-flying, practice your take-0ffs and landings,\
      \ and have a plane that has those shark jaws on the nose >:). \n\n"
