    short_description: Pilot a jumping tank through a maze of underground caverns
      and dungeons in search of new abilities you'll need to progress deeper into
      the levels. Each upgrade is hidden out of reach of your tank, and can only be

    review: '[b]If you ever was a kid?..

      Ever loved Master Blaster or at least some of it''s exciting gameplay features?

      Still got that kid in you?

      You gonna love this game. :)[/b]


      The game feels not finished since there are some empty textures (weapon), camera
      glitches, and poor animations. Saving progress system is tough. Every loading
      is going to take you to where the level starts. But I think that the lowest
      price category is a "let go" to all those flaws.

      I guess that''s it. Other than that this game is just.. pleasurely awesome.
      Shooter, platformer, driving. 2D and 3D for each.

      Game gives you challenge (hover gas fly), it gives you spooks (flying heads).
      But also, that cool feeling of mastering it.

      I''m already like couple of days in, and I''m just at level 3. :D

      You can find some secrets and glitches to help you through. Just like back in
      a day'' games! B)

      It is a simple game. But it is just as interesting and entertaining.

      One of the best games of it''s price. You get much more than you pay for. %)))

      Maybe it''s just me. Maybe. But I''d say it''s just that kid in me. :)

      Peace. And thanks for the emotions.'
