You can not invite friends online at all. Your game also crashed twice, I'm sad now because I gifted this game to my friend to pay with but now I've given him a broken game. I was really excited for dumping a whale on him, usually i whale on my friend in games but was disheartend that i didnt get the oppertunity to do so with an actual whale. \n\n I really hope that you fix these bugs because your game looks awesome! I wish i could have done the tutorial but the keyboard support was broken too. I'll be regretfully refunding this game. I wish you all the best.

The more info we get the better we can pin down the issue and implement a fix. Thanks for describing you issues, that way we have a better chance to fix it. \nWe are working hard on getting the kinks worked out before a full release\nIf you get the chance I suggest playing locally with you friend using xbox controllers :)\n"}],"cursor":"AoJwsZC91OQCcvuipgE="}
