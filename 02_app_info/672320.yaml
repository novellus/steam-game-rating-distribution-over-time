      Equipped with two awesomely dangerous weapons, exploding fireballs, and long-range
      fire arrows, you have to defend the Tree of Life from the waves of super scary
      monsters. You can teleport to special locations in your village to cover all
      attack areas.<br><br><strong>Movement</strong><br><br>Build for HTC Vive and
      Oculus, it's a standing game that will make you look around, and exercise your
      aim and muscle when shooting arrows and throwing the fireballs.<br><br><strong>Why
      should I play this game?</strong><br><br>1. We made sure the graphics is really
      good, you will love the immersion of the village and the details of the monsters.<br>2.
      There will be many differfent monsters, so you'll see a difference in every
      wave.<br>3. It's simple to understand with very dynamic gameplay.<br>4. The
      monsters will take different paths to attack the Tree of Life, so there is true
      360 degrees gameplay<br>5. We plan to release more levels, waves, monsters,
      so this is just a beginning<br>6. Since you are standing, moving, and trowing
      the fireballs like a basketball when playing, you will burn calories (yes, we
      have tested it with our Fitbits ;)

    review: "A typical 'destroy the waves of the monsters\u2019 game. However, the\
      \ graphics and the monsters are gorgeous. The developer did a great job and\
      \ paid attention to all details. The game plays very well and draws you in;\
      \ you do feel you are really the last man standing defending the tree of life.\
      \ I like the teleport touch and the fireball weapon (feels a bit like basketball\
      \ :) \n\nThe game makes you look around and strategize agains carefully orchestrated\
      \ monsters in each wave. I like the monster variety, and the big boss is super\
      \ cool :)\n\nIt's a bargain for the price it's being sold."
