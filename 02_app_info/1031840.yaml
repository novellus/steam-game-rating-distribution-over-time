    review: 'At first I was like: this is just a throwing simulator. Then I realised
      there''s actually a fair bit of skill required. It sort of reminds me of Wii
      sports Archery, but continuous and with a keyboard. I haven''t yet managed to
      reach the end, it would be nice if there were checkpoints every five targets
      so you don''t have to grind so much to get money to afford upgrades. Graphics
      are alright. At AUD $1.50 it''s a good price for a pretty decent game.'
