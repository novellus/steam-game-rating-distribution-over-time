The obstacles and oversights are seemingly endless.\n\nI ended up making all of my changes (which did eventually help) in the .ini file and console because the game menu is useless for inputting specific values, and caps the range of values you can choose for sensitivity.\n\nTo make life harder, turning gamepad acceleration on / off and editing gamepad look sensitivity only affects controller one, but editing gamepad acceleration properties like multiplier, delay and threshold affects all controllers - so these acceleration properties were the only ones I could tweak to get every controller feeling the same.\n\nOh and turning on / off aim assist from the in-game menu only affects controller one... I wanted aim assist enabled for all controllers because it helps offset how imprecise and nauseating joystick movement feels in this game.\n\nSo if anyone else is struggling to play with controllers, here's what I did...\n\nI appended these commands to the SeriousSam3.ini file, then set the file to read-only. These commands improve and normalise joystick sensitivity for all connected controllers, and enlarge the HUD for split-screen. Feel free to tweak them to your taste. Since acceleration delay and acceleration threshold are both zero, you gamepad will behave as though acceleration is disabled (which is what I wanted). In this situation prj_fGamepadHeadingAccMul essentially changes the sensitivity, so try editing this value if that's all you want to change.\n\nprj_bLookAcceleration = 1;\nprj_fMouseSensitivity = 0.5;\ninp_fYLookSensitivity = 1.6;\nprj_fGamepadHeadingAccMul = 2.7;\nprj_fGamepadHeadingAccDelay = 0;\nprj_fGamepadHeadingAccThreshold = 0;\nprj_fGamepadLookSensitivity = 0.5;\nprj_fGamepadLookYSensitivity = 1;\nprj_fGamepadLookPower = 1.2;\nprj_fGamepadLookDeadZone = 0.1;\nprj_bGamepadLookSmoothing = 0;\nplr_fFOVOverride = 88;\nhud_fCustomHudScale = 2;\n\nI also enter these three console commands each time I launch the game. This gives auto-aim to all controllers, not just controller one. Since it's a cheat it disables achievements and leaderboards when active, but it's the only way I found to get auto-aim working for more than one controller. Skip this step if you don't want auto-aim.\n\ncht_bEnableCheats = 2;\ncht_bAutoAim = 1;\nhud_bShowCheats = 0;\n\nTo disable the auto-aim cheat just head back to the main menu, open the console, and set these values back to zero:\n\ncht_bEnableCheats = 0;\ncht_bAutoAim = 0;\n\nFull controller support my ass.","timestamp_created":1610273220,"timestamp_updated":1610273220,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2uzw9fYCd6KEwgI="}
