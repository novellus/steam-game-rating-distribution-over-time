    about_the_game: "You are given a mission, to travel down the path known as Road\
      \ Lite and make it to the Alien Masters who started the virus. You are the only\
      \ person capable of delivering the cure recipe to the CDC and stopping the virus.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n In this game you will encounter random events as you travel,\
      \ and although some enemies may seem easier than others do not underestimate\
      \ the power of the Aliens behind the virus. You only have one life, and every\
      \ run may be very different than the last. You will randomly encounter enemies\
      \ on your trip to fight the alien masters in a old school RPG style of game\
      \ play. You will follow a path from the start until you reach the CDC with the\
      \ cure. The CDC contains not only the man who can make the cure but the aliens\
      \ who made the cure. And you just might be the one to save the world......<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nIf enough people play this game I will add steam trading cards."
