    review: '--- QUICK UPDATE ---


      They fixed most of the movement pain in 1.0.2 so the game is finally playable.
      It still feels a bit clunky. I don''t think this game will ever have something
      like a playerbase. Seems like it was dead from the start :(


      --- SUMMARY ---


      Bellatia seems to be a solid grindfest: neat anime graphics, weapons with different
      elemental dmg, visualized loot (weapons + armor), redoing bosses over and over
      again, time trials, archievements, crafting, collecting different characters
      and some 3D-jump-n-run-stuff.


      But it has a major problem, its movement. Everything in this game which could
      be fun - is not. It''s a pain to move around, jump, dodge, counter enemy attacks.
      It feels clunky and is a consequence of bad design choices, too.


      Besides there are some other flaws, like problems with the inventory in savegames,
      reused graphic assets and privacy matters.


      If you are interested in the game, I would wait and see, how much the updates
      fix the problems. The devs responded to the critics and released a patch - this
      gives me hope.


      If you give Bellatia a try, here''s a hint: you should ignore the completely
      useless tutorial, do not instant rage-quit. Run through that tutorial level,
      then forget about it and start with the game.


      --- IN DETAIL: WHY NEGATIVE? ---


      I would not say this game is trash, like others did. In fact, I would really
      love Bellatia to be good. It reminds me of one of these random free2play cashgrab-MMOs:
      these having premium currency and pay2win, but also neat graphics and solid
      gameplay. Since Bellatian seems to have no ingame store or something, this could
      be fun - in theory.


      TUTORIAL: The tutorial is a joke. It will make you hate the game for wasting
      your time. Just skip it. Well, you can''t skip it. The upside is, it''s not
      very long.


      GRAPHICS/STORY: The anime style is cute af, even though the graphics are a bit
      dated. Story - yes, there is one, and it started not that bad. I didn''t play
      long enough to give a review on that, but well, it''s a grinder, who actually
      cares. Story sequences are told with drawings and text, no synchro, which is
      ok for me. The game is using graphic assets of an MMO called "IRIS Online",
      so be careful if you get annoyed by reused assets and played this "IRIS Online"
      game.


      MOVEMENT: Movement feels very very clunky, which totally ruins everything. It
      is broken to the core, means bad design. So for example jumping does not immediately
      react on your key presses, it does not trigger until you _release_ the button.
      This is not a thing of getting familiar with, it''s plain annoying, furthermore
      it is not consistent for all movement. Bellatia has some jump''n''run action,
      collecting coins with jump, double-jump and stuff. Imagine this with clunky
      controls - it''s a pain.


      BUGS: I also noticed a bug, items were missing after reloading savegame. Another
      reviewer stated that items are missing after restart, too. Since this happened
      right with my first tryouts, I doubt that this game is polished to a point where
      it should be released. At least this needs work, since losing inventory stuff
      is a no-go. UPDATE: well, there''s a patch now addressing the lost-items bugs.
      I didn''t test it, but it''s a good sign that the devs are caring.


      PRIVACY: Bellatia is single player offline, but immediately triggers windows
      firewall on start. They seem to grab user analytics without informing their
      users, which is quite common, but I thought you should know about the behavior.'
