What stood out for me was the Research Tree for Industry ( Jobs ) and Military, plus the expansion of play with cities joining each other through trade. I like how at a glance I know what is Residential, Commercial, and Factories. There is traffic, and its nice that the people in the cars drive around and park up at work then head back home. Music is a nice loop but the developer is planning on adding more music so that will be nice to have while playing. The user interface works well, plus there's the added help of if you hover over an item you'll get a description of it. At the moment Im not too sure how you can go to war with another AI player. What I do know is with your factories you can make many different weapons...All in all I'm enjoying playing the game. I give this game at the moment a 77/100. My rating will increase as time goes by with updates.","timestamp_created":1609809473,"timestamp_updated":1609813331,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4w8GW6PYCeqbIwAI="}
