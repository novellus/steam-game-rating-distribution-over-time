However, they are separate stories and you can play them out of order.  Took me around 15 hours to complete and get 100% achievements using a mouse (13ish hours on the bulk of it, extra time on the bonus puzzle).  Difficulty is easy, with bigger puzzles and differently-shaped pieces if you want more challenge.  \n\n- This game comes with 20 story puzzles, 15 special puzzles, and one super special puzzle.  \n\n- There are two modes.  One is Normal, and one is Challenge.  Challenge sets a timer and you win crowns if you beat it under a specific time.  \n\n- There are three shapes of puzzle in story mode: Regular, Square, and Arrow.  And you can choose how many pieces each puzzle is in the main menu.\n\n\nPretty sure every other review covered that.  I just wanted to stay in the loop.  Here's the real review:\n\nNo one is allowed to thumbs down My Jigsaw Adventures.  It's a rule.  This is the only adventurous jigsaw series I know of that provides what you want and then some.  The music's adventurous, the art is great, and it's fun to play as a whole.  That said, the story in this game feels simpler than Roads of Life.  Where the story in RoL is jumping sharks with dragons, swords, stumbling across the wildest unknowns, all in a quest to save the one you love (as stated in the very first scene, I'm not ruining it for you), and you're on the edge of your seat screaming, \"What's going to happen Next?!\", A Lost Story is more general scenery.  I had trouble following the story to this one because some of it seemed detached from the art (What was up with the wolf?) and the plot felt sad as a whole.  Sometimes the music felt off, too, swinging from chill to SUPER EXCITING AND I DON'T KNOW WHY!  This was extra weird because the some of the art in the Special puzzles felt like it could've provided a much more adventurous story concoction. \n\nThat's not to say the game is bad.  The puzzles are still fun to do, and the art is still great.  On top of that, A Lost Story adds in the special puzzles feature, offering a whole new set of enjoyment and spontaneity.  I clearly had no issues 100%ing everything over here because of how fun and chill everything is.  And you can dl the art after you beat the puzzles and get the soundtrack for super cheap, so that's cool.  Puzzles!  Woo!  Got it for 5 bucks, too, so it's also entirely worth it.","timestamp_created":1609387002,"timestamp_updated":1609444863,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wfWY3fYCe/j+vgI="}
