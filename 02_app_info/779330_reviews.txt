Hire workers for resources, use resources for buildings, etc. The ninja aspect is just a theme, you are very much a manager and don't have any direct control.\n\nIf you want depth and complexity, this isn't the game for you. But if you just want something to fiddle with for a few hours, you could do worse. It's just a very basic tycoon game with a ninja theme.\n\nFull price ($5) is somewhat pushing the limit of what it's worth, I'd suggest waiting for a sale or a coupon.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]","timestamp_created":1603817817,"timestamp_updated":1608670618,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561304807662963867","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmbSPxvYCcP28qgI="}
