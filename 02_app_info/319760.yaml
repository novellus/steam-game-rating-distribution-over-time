    review: 'What is Oh My Gore ?


      Initially I was not going to recommend this game but considering how ridiculously
      cheap and simple it is, I dont think its bad for what offers neither for its
      price, its a very simple indie RTS game that pretty much plays itself, you barely
      have many input on it, all troops follow a preset path all you have to do is
      manage the defense buildings such as tower and such and the spawn rate of the
      troops while defending your "hero" but you have no control to the troops, hero
      or anything, its a simple game and considering that there are many other RTS
      games that do much and offer much more than this makes this game very passable
      but since you can get it for pretty much a single dollar or even less makes
      it not a bad pick at all its just a simple game to pass the time for people
      who are fine with RTS games.'
