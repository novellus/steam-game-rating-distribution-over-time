    review: 'It took me 37mins to finish this game, on my first go.

      And I wan''t particularly good at it.

      And I accidentally let it run while I was typing something on another screen.


      Pros:

      - There are some cool game mechanics.

      - The music isn''t too annoying to listen to for the 37mins it took me to finish
      the game.


      Cons:

      - Walking around is very difficult, it seems to lag a little, and you can''t
      tell when you are trying to walk into a space which is occupied by the edge
      of another object (invisible walls that shouldn''t be there).

      - It''s extremely hard to see what''s happening in this game, or where the aim
      bar is at.

      - There is a significant time delay between throwing snowballs, and you can''t
      turn after you start winding up the snowball, which is frustrating because half
      the time I accidentally bumped a direction button while trying to throw one,
      or accidentally started to throw one while I was still trying to move into position.

      - The game doesn''t pause or stop between levels, and doesn''t pause when you
      have the game minimised.

      - The game seems to freeze when you reach the end, before displaying the message
      telling you that you have won. I almost quit and restarted the game when this
      happened, as I didn''t expect to have reached the end after 37mins.'
