      </strong> <br>Pilot your hovercraft across the desolate wildlands, scavenging
      valuable scrap you need to unlock utilities, upgrades, and win the game. It
      is a game of strategic and competitive escalation. Weak early game performance

      Despoiler, teams scavenge valuable scrap from the level, and the team with the

      - left by the miners who''ve long vacated the land. Their old silos are also
      still full of the stuff, so tear them apart with your weaponry and make it rain.
      Scrap is carried on the hull of your hovercraft where it absorbs damage, functioning
      like armour, but it''s also heavy so the more you have the slower your vehicle
      will get.  Choose to bulk up and tank damage or run rings around your foes.<br><br>Drop
      scrap off at your teams base to unlock Utilities and new Vehicles, equipable
      in the upgrade garage. Careful though, re-spawning costs your team some scrap,
      and if left unchecked you can find yourselves set back significantly if you
      feed the enemy too much. If you do fall behind, you can always make a run on
      the enemy scrap reserves, clawing your way back into the lead.'

    review: "Although gameplay and performance could be further optimized, the game\
      \ has potential. It looks good, features great concept and vehicle design but\
      \ also feels quite empty... And to play against the bots for me wasn't that\
      \ fun at all, to be honest. \n\nFrom the gameplay aspect, the game is pretty\
      \ straightforward, there is not much to do, you basically collect scrap metal\
      \ from shooting down enemies or towers, then you bring it to the base, unload\
      \ the scrap on the ground, get points from it, get upgrades with the points\
      \ and use them in order to get more scrap, rinse and repeat until the timer\
      \ runs out. \n\nHowever, I spent approx one hour playing the game, both, solo\
      \ and against bots and after that, sadly, I had little desire to return to the\
      \ game. I strongly feel what I got is not nearly enough for the price of 17\u20AC\
      . I'm really not happy with the idea of having purchased another early access\
      \ game that it's already dead on arrival, only to be rotting in my library.\
      \ Sorry for the awful analogy, but it's true. I requested a refund, but In case\
      \ it gets significantly improved in the future I will DEFINITELY buy it again\
      \ and change this review! However, in its current state, I'm sorry, I just can't\
      \ recommend it.\n\nOn a final note: I also have to say that the devs are a nice\
      \ team. I have contacted them about an issue I've been having and their reply\
      \ was quick and helpful! Kudos to the devs for the effort and the responsiveness.\
      \ So perhaps there is hope for future improvement...?"
