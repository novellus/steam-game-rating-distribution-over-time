    review: "The \u201CHilda\u201D in this novel turns out to be two unrelated characters.\
      \  One, a young princess tasked with hosting a formal party and giving her first\
      \ ever public speech; the other an unknown down-and-out thief who happens to\
      \ resemble the princess.\n\nThis is exactly what it says:  a short story.  There\
      \ are no player choices to be made.  We follow the tale of the princess' dread\
      \ as her debut public appointment looms, and switch to that of the lookalike\
      \ thief who breaks into the palace, [spoiler]steals her ring,[/spoiler] and\
      \ subsequently goes on the run.\n\nI had been looking forward to playing this\
      \ for several weeks before getting to it, as it is promoted as being for \u201C\
      deep thinking .. readers\u201D.  Certainly all of the points noted on the store\
      \ page are touched upon, but the depth and mental challenge I had been anticipating\
      \ after reading this claim, did not materialise.  The sole reason for this being,\
      \ that the story is just so, so short.\n\nThere are a series of hand drawn and\
      \ painted backdrops, several of them animated; each of which can be accessed\
      \ directly from the front menu screen.  This serves as an alternative to a save\
      \ function (not present), should you start the game and have to run after only\
      \ 5 minutes, this will prove useful.\nEach screen has three visible buttons,\
      \ one to take you back to the previous, one to skip to the next, and one in\
      \ the centre which takes you to the menu.  Bear in mind that there is not a\
      \ direct \u201Creturn\u201D button so if you choose to go to menu, you will\
      \ have to select the screen that you left from manually.\n\nWhat is [b]not made\
      \ clear[/b] anywhere within the game is that these are not the only progression\
      \ options.  From within each screen, you must also click on the main picture\
      \ in order to reveal further story details that it is very easy to completely\
      \ bypass.  I did exactly that on first play through, reading the screen text\
      \ presented to me, and then clicking the \u201Cnext\u201D arrow.  In doing so,\
      \ I unwittingly skipped much of the story detail, finished within 20 minutes\
      \ and came away thoroughly underwhelmed with the apparent flimsiness of the\
      \ story.\n\nNeglecting to include such a basic gameplay instruction is a horribly\
      \ careless omission.  I discovered what had been missed courtesy of watching\
      \ the store page promotional video.  So I started again and read through thoroughly.\
      \  The story became much more explanatory, and offered a degree of satisfaction\
      \ for both threads by the end.\n\nSo, recommendation or not?  I am so conflicted\
      \ here:  the story is nicely constructed and some of the animations are fun\
      \ to watch; whilst the absence of any basic user instruction hampers user-friendliness\
      \ and the ending is so quick and unexpected upon first play through \u2013 which\
      \ will also be the only play through for most players.  If this game was free,\
      \ I would recommend without hesitation as it is a pleasantly diverting 20-30\
      \ minutes; but when compared to some other games which are free or similarly\
      \ priced, then I'm afraid that even at this relatively low price point, it is\
      \ still expensive, and therefore I am going to have to say no.  Wait and see\
      \ if it becomes free or available at half price in a sale.  There is simply\
      \ not enough here to provide sufficient value when compared with its obvious\
      \ competitors.\n\n[quote] Please follow our curator page, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/4680120/]Otome\
