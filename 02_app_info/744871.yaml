    review: 'Non-essential DLC. Exactly what you think it is, though unfortunately
      lacks any content relating to the Drowned Past expansion update.


      [b]The Art of Seven: The Days Long Gone[/b]

      In my opinion the main reason to buy this. As mentioned before it doesn''t include
      any artwork for the Drowned Past section of the game which is unfortunate but
      does include a few concepts that never made it into the game which, at least
      for me, are very interesting. Some artwork is coupled with developer/artist
      commentary which gives some nice insight into the design process behind the
      game. Store page states that it contains every piece from the development process
      but I''m not entirely sure that''s true. Overall still pretty interesting.


      [b]Guidebook[/b]

      This is where it starts to fall apart, the guidebook [i]only[/i] includes basic
      control information (no info on some of the advanced movement/combat mechanics
      or any mechanical information whatsoever really) and a how-to for every quest
      though they lack expected info like what rewards each quest gives. Once again
      lacking the Drowned Past content. That''s it, doesn''t include any other information
      like where to find all upgrades or even a guide on the many unique weapons that
      can be found, a very sub-par guidebook.


      [b]The Island of Peh Map[/b]

      Absolutely pointless, unless you really want a map of Peh as your desktop wallpaper.'
