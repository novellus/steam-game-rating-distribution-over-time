    review: 'One of the best Choice games ever! The Story is long and your decisions
      feel authentic to you. While it lacks explicit romance scenes. The person you
      fall for make it feel extremely authentic. You will go on tons of adventures
      and have the choice to solve them in bunch of ways. The stat system does not
      hamper you and it still lets you play how you want.


      If you''re a fan of Choice of Games, do yourself a favor and buy this now.'
