    review: "Questo gioco mi piace, ma bisogna migliorare alcune cose. Quando uso\
      \ la pulsantiera (controller), non riesco a fare certe tecniche, che invece\
      \ mi vengono bene quando uso la tastiera. \nIn pi\xFA, ho notato che l'inglese\
      \ \xE8 l'unica lingua disponibile per il gioco. Mi piacerebbe che fossero disponibili\
      \ altre lingue. Una versione in italiano mi farebbe comodo, ma gradirei soprattutto\
      \ una versione in portoghese, perch\xE9 la capoeira \xE8 nata in Brasile.\n\
      Per il resto, questo gioco mi piace, soprattutto perch\xE9 non avevo mai visto\
      \ altri giochi ispirati alla capoeira."
