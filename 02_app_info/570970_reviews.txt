Controls feel way too laggy and unresponsive, the difficulty level is completely borked and the whole game is a technical mess. It reminds me of the later, 2D Mortal Kombat iterations, almost impossible to enjoy, when played like normal fighting games, yet turning stupidly easy the moment all the tricks to outcheap the CPU became clear.\n\nSure, I do appreciate the setting, the homages (the nod to Army of Darkness is epic) and the movelist itself, but giving Arena a pass solely because of that seems too generous to me... And it's a shame, as I believe the game could have been at least fun to play around, with a few changes in some critical areas.","timestamp_created":1609951894,"timestamp_updated":1610035384,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7Mnl7vYCeaeGwQI="}
