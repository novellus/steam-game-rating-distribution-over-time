This is an endless VR music video / relaxation app. You'll see & hear different colors, shapes, & sounds swirl all around you as you feed bugs to birds by guiding them with a rainbow (the golden orbs with a string). This experience still holds up in 2020 even though it's from late 2016. \n\nI believe the whole thing is looped for maybe every 5 minutes. There's a counter where you can see how many bugs you have fed. You can also extend the string or make it shorter to swing around. None of that matters though; your only goal should be relaxation. VR and chill. \n\nI do think that $2.99 USD may be a bit much for the simple experience that you'll probably only play for 10-20 minutes at the most. However, it is a unique experience. Also, it is something that you can showcase to friends or family that are new to VR. \n\n[b]Rate 6/10. There are better VR music videos & relaxation apps, but this one is unique & super chill.
