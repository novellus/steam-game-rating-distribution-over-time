Yeah, interesting graphics and a few interesting elements, but it's light on puzzles and did I mention that you can't save it? It's almost worth the 99 cents I paid for it.\n\nUpdate: Fatal flaw no. 2 is that the \"puzzle\" that opens the door to Chapter 2 is, for me, impossible. The puzzle, like all the rest (few as they are) is simplistic and obvious, but it turns out that not only must one figure out the order, one must be able to do it within an extremely short period of time. That makes it not a puzzle, but a test of manual dexterity. I've come across other such games made with this horrible Unity software, where the developer thinks it's amusing to make performing the solution to the puzzle nearly impossible. Please, developers, make solving the puzzle the hurdle, not whether one can move one's mouse quick enough. And even if I were able to get the solution performed, there's no way to save this game, so if I had to quit for a while, I'd have to suffer through the whole thing again.\n\nAnother issue I have this Unity thing is that the little tiny dot with which you aim the cursor is all but invisible.
