Plays roughly like a less responsive Company of Heroes.\n\nIf you're a 40k fan you can sink a lot of hours into this, and its post-launch survival game mode, Last Stand.\n\nA LOT of value for the price if you get it on sale. A lot of love was put into the models and voice lines. Lots of 40k meme references. \n\nTry Elite mod if you get it. Fleshes it out even further and adds a new if OP faction.","timestamp_created":1609741930,"timestamp_updated":1610314981,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.528301835060119629","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46JOQ9/YCftqnwAI="}
