All the factions in the previous games like 2 and Chaos Rising are playable right off the bat although the campaign is the exact same for all the races! Although it does tie up a loose end from the very first Dawn of War game's ending. I recommend this as it's got tons of people playing it. Playing as the Imperial Guard and Inquisition is the best! I wish the campaigns for all the different factions were all different! This is obviously best played in coop with a friend for the best and most fun experience! The Ork pirates are pretty funny and cool. The boss fights are still atrocious just sponge bullets!!! The Imperial Guard is easily my favorite faction to play in the campaign easily! This game is where the Dawn of War games end because of how garbage the third Dawn of War game is!!!","timestamp_created":1598678278,"timestamp_updated":1609813504,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520547926425933838","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgJaX6PYCeKS6ngI="}
