    review: "The game is extremely difficult like extremely difficult. Every enemy\
      \ has AOE skills and can teleport. You can't dodge effectively, ever. The developers\
      \ know that the game is hard so they allow you to turn off enemy health regeneration\
      \ and allow you to max out your own health regeneration. This only makes the\
      \ game a little bit easier. \n\nThe English translations aren't the best, but\
      \ you can definitely follow the storyline and jokes. The storyline is funny\
      \ so if you have $6 and time, I would recommend. Remember the game is not easy.\
      \ \n\nI always want to mention that the mechanics aren't really gone over within\
      \ the game. (There is no game tutorial.) I had to read the end of store page\
      \ description to find out that \"z\" starts battles."
