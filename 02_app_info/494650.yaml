    review: 'Ok so the original game is major d!ck but this sequel/dlc is actually
      playable. Still bad, but grab it for a few cents on sale and have some cheap
      fun. Tips: -kills all bug spawns first or you will regret it. -The exit is behind
      you when you spawned in at the beginning of the stage. It''s the ant hill. -If
      there is a green square with a pic of an ant then that is interactable. Use
      F to use it.'
