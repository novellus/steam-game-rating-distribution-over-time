I'm not sure how anyone could think that adding literal 50/50 random mechanics to it is a good idea. Most of the new campaign is so easy that it's irrelevant, but the last few levels are literally decided by random outcomes.\nAlso the new sprites, and especially the main campaign map are far less readable, which is a pretty important point for a 1-bit game.\nToo bad - there are some good mechanics, like the spikes, and some of the levels are finally sufficiently difficult, but they are ruined by pointless randomness.","timestamp_created":1606150396,"timestamp_updated":1606150457,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529703021049499512","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46uCB+/UCdvqLsAI="}
