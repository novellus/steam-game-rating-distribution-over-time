You cannot single out one block you want to move; they all move together. Different colored blocks have different properties. The goal is to get all blocks to their corresponding tile in as few moves as possible.\n\nI haven’t completed the game yet as of writing this; I’m almost halfway through. I like how the game isn’t messing around when it talks about simplicity: the best solution to every puzzle really is simple. It’s too easy to overthink them, and it’s a lot of fun when I come back to a puzzle and see the key insight I was missing for a while.\n\nI also like the calm music in the background. This is a happy, relaxing game. :)\n\nI wish there was an undo button. It’s kind of annoying to have to reset the whole puzzle every time I make a mistake when I’m going for the minimum number of moves for a puzzle.\n\nI recommend this for anyone who enjoys puzzle games or simply sitting down for a short while and calmly thinking through a small conundrum. This is a casual puzzle game; so far, it hasn’t been that difficult.","timestamp_created":1591158071,"timestamp_updated":1608865209,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qtv1y/YCf6jwiwI="}
