    review: it's definitely not worth its price but this is a fun little shoot 'em
      up. it's not the best made, i liked glorkian warrior better. honestly free shoot
      'em up linux games are better than this though. not recommended simply because
      it's not a very good version of its genre. if you watch a video of it and it
      looks fun to you you're probably right
