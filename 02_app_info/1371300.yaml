    review: I bought the game as a joke but ten minutes in I learned and experienced
      things I never could've imagined, I didn't need the Spanish language to understand
      the plot, for the pure emotion during the stunning cutscenes was enough to convey
      any situation. The combat was smooth like butter, responsive, and only got better
      once you got the hang of it. It's simply outrageous that the horrid "Cyberpunk
      2077" game is even trying to profit off of this game's popularity.
