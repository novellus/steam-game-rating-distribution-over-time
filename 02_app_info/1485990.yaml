      cargo ship currently run aground on the southern coast of Chile. Most of its
      structure is underwater and badly damaged, with rust coating 85 to 90 percent
      of all surfaces. Internal structure appears to be significantly larger than
      external dimensions, and is not flooded despite large holes visible on outer
      hull.<br><br>Internal structure appears to be a random assembly of rooms, halls,
      and structures. Initial salvage teams reported rooms made of human teeth, an
      engine with tendon strips for timing belts, a hall extending for 182.88 m (600
      ft) beyond where the outer hull should terminate, an open &quot;gym&quot; room
      with steel walls as pliant as taffy, and numerous audio and visual hallucinations.
