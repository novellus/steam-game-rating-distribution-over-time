I guess there is a limit to how high the highscore can be but I think it's possible just about to beat my highscore if you get lucky with whatever obstacle generates next. Just weird that it made my character big so I don't get a higher score but I guess the game was telling me enough was enough since the 2nd ranked person only has around 7500 points where I have almost 12000 so I guess the game decided it was time for me to stop xD \n\nEdit: I believe it's a bug that can happen when you step on a specific platform? I'm not sure but I heard something about a bug that increses your character size. so when it's fixed should be fine!","timestamp_created":1573995124,"timestamp_updated":1573995748,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqqPdvO4CcNHn2gE="}
