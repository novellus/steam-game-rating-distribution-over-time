    about_the_game: "<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Strategic View</h2><br>With Tacview Advanced,\
      \ you can embrace the whole battlefield at once. From a small region to the\
      \ whole earth, no theater will be too big or cluttered for you sight! Understand\
      \ at a glance everything which is happening while keeping an eye on every little\
      \ detail which matters.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">One-Click Charts</h2><br>Displaying\
      \ numbers is important, visualizing them graphically is better! With Tacview\
      \ Advanced you can draw \u2013 in one click \u2013 clear charts of any data\
      \ to analyze aircrafts as well as pilots performances. You can overlay data\
      \ from differents objects in the same chart and let the scale adjust automaticaly.\
      \ All you have to do is to select the data you want to display for selected\
      \ objects and there you go! And if you need to do advanced calculations on the\
      \ selected data, then you can export them in a tidy .csv file ready to be imported\
      \ in your favorite spreadsheet!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Online Debriefing Host</h2><br>Are\
      \ you flying with friends or leading a whole squadron? With Tacview Advanced\
      \ you can host an online debriefing to share your knowledge and expertise with\
      \ everyone! Any pilot with Tacview Standard will be able to join your online\
      \ classes. Even better: any pilot with Tacview Advanced will be able to take\
      \ control to interact and share its own experience with the audience!<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Real-Time Telemetry</h2><br>As a squadron lead or an instructor, you\
      \ need the best tools to follow and assess your trainees' progression. Thanks\
      \ to the real-time telemetry feature, you can review and analyze a flight in\
      \ progress. It is like being in the instructor seat, but with the possibility\
      \ of observing the action from outside of the plane. Now you can efficiently\
      \ train multiple trainees at once during join maneuvers! The real-time telemetry\
      \ is currently available for DCS World, X-Plane, FSX and P3D. The support for\
      \ Falcon 4 is being studied and may be available in a future update.<h2 class=\"\
      bb_tag\">Instructor Remote Control</h2><br>From the time of day to the aircraft\
      \ systems, control in real-time up to four client simulators! As a player, you\
      \ can now directly assist a fellow squadron member by reducing his workload\
      \ during his training phase. As an instructor, you can change in real-time specific\
      \ flight conditions, trigger failures to test and improve trainees\u2019 skills."
