    review: 'For five bucks, this is a nice little add on to JA:Bia.  Five bucks is
      pushing it.  It''s one map and the roll playing elements are very weak.  One
      brief conversation with Fox. I do like that they have a paradrop point with
      supplies for your team.  I would like it much better if your team was sent in
      with sane equipment in the first place.  Bringing a knife to a gunfight here
      is quite litteral for Shadow.  Do your sanity a favor and use an editor to hand
      him a gun.  I do really like the concept of DLC mini missions for JA: BIA but
      if we could make it 3 maps and a choice of mercs that would be a big improvement.  It
      would be nice if money was a victory condition as these are mercs.  It would
      be a sensible trade off if you could get better starting equipment but only
      by paying for it and bribeing smugglers or something.  Victory level set by
      how much money you make.  Still it''s a fun little map and a chance to play
      JA without committing to a long campaign.  THAT is very welcome.  It''s not
      a bad team and it''s cheap, so it''s a worthwild add on.'
