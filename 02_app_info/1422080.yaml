    review: "This is a really Great game.  All i can say is great music great atmosphere,\
      \ VERY immersive, and its fun.  Waking up today i didnt know Id become Tobias\
      \ Turdschitz of my very own Turdschitz kingdom,  Will update more after i get\
      \ more time in game.  \nTotally tubuler.\n\nUpdate- im addicted\n\nThe interface\
      \ is very intuitive i only studied the tutorial 5 minutes and i knew how to\
      \ play the game.  I love the fact that theres lots of decision making, and u\
      \ feel like your far away in kingdoms fighting for your people.  The bardic\
      \ music is  really nice and this is a good game to play while listening to talk\
      \ radio if u want to turn it off.  Its very addicting and  i woulda payed more\
      \ for this game, how far it will go i dont know, but i know within 1 hour of\
      \ playing i got completely addicted .   If youre thinking about buying it, just\
      \ get it, you wont be disappointed for the price."
