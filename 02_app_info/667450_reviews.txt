If you dig all around a fire (or bunch of fires), it can't spread anymore. If you run out of either trees or buildings (the bars at the top, not how many are on the tiles), you lose.\n\nIt took under an hour to beat, but could've taken half that if not for my biggest issue with the game: once you've isolated all the fires, so that there's no longer any way to lose, you still have to run and put out and dig all of them, which takes 3-4 seconds per tile. After 50 levels, my wrist is sore from all the unnecessary clicking.\n\nAside from the last few levels, there's not really any sense of danger or time pressure. For the most part, you have plenty of time to get to the fires.","timestamp_created":1573341069,"timestamp_updated":1573341069,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47O+bqe4CdPH82AE="}
