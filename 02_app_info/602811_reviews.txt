It is really stable and a delight to fly. Loads of liveries and 3 variants. The ones with the pop out floats are my fave, but all are just as great. The only thing I don’t like very much are the goofy expressions on the people on board. Hardly a knock against the pack overall. If you want a new helicopter and are used to only the stock ones, this is perfect! Actually anybody interested in a new ‘copter should consider buying. It’s worth every penny.","timestamp_created":1570305824,"timestamp_updated":1570305824,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0Krhzu0CdZfL0wE="}
