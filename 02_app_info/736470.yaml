    review: 'Godbeast is a short, stylish, janky game that''s a mix of several ideas
      found in other classic games. It features one big city you explore on foot and
      bike, hunting the mentioned godbeasts and their masters. The combat is budget
      Dark Souls, very similar to the dev''s previous game Malebolgia but somewhat
      faster and smoother. Godbeasts first need to be found with the help of your
      spear (halberd? harpoon?) and then harpooned so you can climb on them Shadow
      of the Colossus style. Killing the godbeast allows its master to be defeated
      in combat. Kill all the persons on the list and you''re done.


      I feel like I have to compare it to Malebolgia; this game feels less polished,
      but more daring. The textureless style is really pleasing on the eyes, but it
      can be a nightmare to navigate through forests or featureless halls, frequently
      losing yourself in the same shades of blue and gray. The lock-on camera in combat
      with lesser mobs and human bosses is very wonky and can be annoying. It''s never
      centred on the screen and you have to manually readjust the camera regardless
      of lock-on. There''s also a distinct lack of sound effects during combat, you
      don''t feel like you''re hitting something. There is also texture and model
      flickering at times, and cutscenes are incredibly basic with no voice acting
      and static models.


      All that said, the actual design of the city and the enemies do have a sense
      of direction. The city is fairly large, but you get the bike quite soon and
      distance isn''t really an issue. It has a logical looping highway and as soon
      as you memorise the layout you''ll do fine. There''s also a fast travel system
      that''s somewhat annoying to use, but it''s there. The map is not really useful,
      however. The bike is probably the coolest thing about the game; you can summon
      it at will and zip through the city, even attacking from it and jumping on mobs
      from it. The city is largely empty space, but you can find statues with hidden
      lore and bonus matches with beefed up normal enemies to upgrade your stats such
      as health and stamina. Each godbeast is modeled after a different animal and
      behaves slightly differently. One of them has a neat gimmick to lure it in before
      you can harpoon it. All of them need to be harpooned and then climbed upon to
      strike at their weak points, and it''s the most exciting part of the game by
      far. The human bosses are more standard Souls fare, but still function well
      enough.


      There are several neat touches that I wouldn''t want to spoil, so if any of
      this seems appealing to you, I''d say go for it. It''s only 3 hours long, more
      or less, try it out.
