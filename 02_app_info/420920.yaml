    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>Lost Labyrinth is a coffeebreak dungeon
      crawling game!</strong></h2><br><br><i>The Labyrinth was more than a dungeon.
      It was the crowning achievement of the necromancer Mythrax, who wielded the
      Staff of the Covenant to bring dead stone to life and shape it by his will to
      form the most impenetrable fortress ever constructed.<br><br>Then Mythrax vanished.
      For years, the traps and spells that guarded the Labyrinth kept it just as Mythrax
      intended. As they broke down, wildlife and bandits sought a haven in the upper
      levels, even as long-imprisoned monsters broke free from the depths.<br><br>Now
      the Prince of Ulther has recovered an ancient scroll which suggests the Staff
      of the Covenant was broken during the construction of the Labyrinth, leaving
      the pieces still inside. Soon a wave of heroes will brave the Labyrinth, seeking
      the staff along with other unbelievable treasures deep within.</i><br><br>You
      are one of these brave heroes that travel to the Lost Laybrinth. Hopefully your
      skills and equipment will be good enough to survive this dungeon. There are
      dangerous monsters down there, fierce traps, and loads of gold. You will need
      Light and you will need Food and Water.<br><br>The dungeon can be completed
      by either collecting all 9 parts of the staff of the last covenant or by reaching
      level 150. Each part is hidden in a different room of the dungeon. One every
      10 levels. Sometimes guarded by big monsters.<br><br><i><strong>Compared to
