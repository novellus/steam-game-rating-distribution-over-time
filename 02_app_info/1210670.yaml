    review: 'Sluggish boring platformer


      Platformers are sometimes called "jump and run" games. In Silent World, you
      can do neither. (You don''t have to be silent, either.) You push wooden boxes,
      you use your hat to sneak past zombies, you disarm obvious traps, you climb
      ladders and fall down platforms, and if you could see where you''re going (which
      will cost you a matchstick powerup), this would be entirely unchallenging, and
      if your avatar moved with any speed and didn''t fuss over climbing and pushing  (you
      have to get the positioning and direction just right, best to use an analog
      stick), you''d probably be done in half an hour. That said, I abandoned the
      game midway through chapter 3 (of 4), because the game presented me with a switch
      puzzle (guess which switch opens which door) with no visual feedback that would
      see me slog through several storeys of platforms using an elevator that moved
      even slower than I usually do.


      The game looks like it was inexpertly cobbled together with a 2D game generator;
      so uninspired that sometime during chapter 2 I suspected I was running through
      a procedurally generated endless game. And as with many similar uninspired offerings,
      the developers turn off the lights to hide much of it, make the enemies zombies
      to hide their lack of "intelligence", and embrace the cliches of the horror
      genre.


      I don''t often ask for refunds for games that only cost pocket change; but I''m
      doing it for this one.

      And I''m setting all games from this publisher to "ignore". I''m all for Korean
      kids coding their own games; but there''s no reason to reward publishing them
      on Steam when the farthest they should go is the family fridge.


      Don''t buy; don''t play.'
