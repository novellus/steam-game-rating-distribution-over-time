    review: To unlock levels and complete the game, you need to win up to 3 stars
      in each level. But those stars are won by gathering points in it, not by completing
      the level. So if you want 3 stars, you have to pay attention not to complete
      the level until you have 3 stars. If you don't pay attention to it and complete
      the level normaly, you will have 1 or 2 stars and won't be able to unlock all
      the levels. It's stupid. And the game is low res, without any true fullscreen.
      Play another match-3. There are so much better on steam...
