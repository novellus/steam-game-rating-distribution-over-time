I loved the 3D work but i'm a guy who loves watching scene demos so dont count on me for that one. 2D artworks are not any good and cripples the overall story telling.\n\n[b] CONS: [/b]\n- Platforming: For that, you have to deliver tight controls, its overall clunky (especially at the end with time limit).\n- Puzzles: Even exploring to understand what game is expecting from you in each memory fragment is somewhat fun, i cant say puzzle design is good overall, most of the things felt random and disconnected.\n- Time limited parts: This a 'f. you, no!' note from me for every puzzle game design including time limits. Instead of designing meaningful, challenging puzzles, you are trying to shove your turd design in my throat with time limiting? Well, go f. yourself sir.\n\n[b] FINAL: [/b]\n[h1] 4/10 [/h1] Master Reboot can be remembered as a somewhat nice indie attempt to tell a story with ok visuals. Gameplay-wise it is horrid and dont get near it if you are not going to give a fight against lot of clunky design choices.","timestamp_created":1609988686,"timestamp_updated":1609988686,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.524714827537536621","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi7iz7fYCfK6WwQI="}
