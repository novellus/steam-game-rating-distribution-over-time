Loses the western theme fast to have you fighting ninja, on top of dinosaurs, on sinking ships, and in areas with shifting gravity. Good for the low price, but nothing really memorable mechanically or to keep you coming back.","timestamp_created":1606699084,"timestamp_updated":1606699084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjs2ui/YCeaLItQI="}
