Let’s get into the story.\n\nMorgana Island a peaceful place were monsters can live without fear. \nThat is until the famous and fearsome pirates known as the sea spiders come to plunder the Island, and no one can stop them. \n\nUntil Chelshia the chimera the world’s first synthetic monster is made to kick their butts and take back their ill gotten treasure.\n\nSo with that all said, on to the likes. To start the game’s story is good and made even better with a colorful cast of characters bringing it to life.\n\nAnd now characters, they are really good, cute with funny and cute dialog, even the NPC’s dialog is good, it reminds me of games like undertale.\n\nThe platforming is fun and vary well made and did not feel unfair at all, same with combat.
