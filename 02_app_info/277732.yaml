    review: "Yet another major screw-up from Dovetail. I was hoping this locomotive\
      \ would be good, and the main reason I got it was so I could have something\
      \ to drive on the Norfolk Southern Coal District route that wasn't ANOTHER ES44AC\
      \ and the C40-9W. Seriously, how many ES44ACs have we had in Train Sim over\
      \ the years? It's like the Class 66 all over again.\n\nBut that's enough stalling.\
      \ Now I should have a look at the C40-8, and believe me. It's not good.\n\n\
      I'll start off by talking about the physics. When running light engine, the\
      \ loco takes off like a rocket even when you put the throttle in Notch 2. It\
      \ reminds me of the Class 150/1, prior to Dovetail releasing an update for it.\
      \ I've seen many diesel locomotives in my time, and even though they were all\
      \ in New Zealand, I think I have some room to say that diesels don't accelerate\
      \ anywhere near as quickly as the NS C40-8 in Train Sim. Coupling up to a big\
      \ rake of loaded coal hoppers slows down the acceleration rate, but perhaps\
      \ a bit too slow. You have to put the throttle in Notch 5 or 6 just to get it\
      \ moving. The brakes are equally disappointing. Even when you apply the brakes\
      \ to 26% on the F4 HUD, the brake pressure skyrockets to at least 40%. Much\
      \ like the NS ES44AC included with the Coal District route, and the CSX SD80MAC,\
      \ the brakes on the C40-8 take as much time to release as it takes for me to\
      \ get a girlfriend. Yes, I went there. Don't judge me. \n\nIn other words, the\
      \ brakes on the C40-8 take an insanely long time to release. For example - I\
      \ am coasting along at 25 miles per hour, and I see a warning for an upcoming\
      \ 20 speed limit. I apply the brakes to say - 30 to 38% - and by the time the\
      \ brakes are fully released, I'm down to 18 miles per hour. I don't know whether\
      \ or not the brakes on the real thing act like this, but they're just far too\
      \ slow for me. Again, it's the same situation on the NS ES44AC and CSX SD80MAC.\n\
      \n\nAnd what about the actual model. Much like the other trains that DTG makes,\
      \ the model is actually very accurate to the real thing. It captures the look\
      \ of the real NS C40-8 almost perfectly, although I do think the front of the\
      \ loco looks a little out of proportion.\n\nThe sounds are just as disappointing\
      \ as the physics. The engine sounds are very similar to - if not, the same -\
      \ as the ES44AC, and the horn sounds exactly like the Southern Pacific C44-9W\
      \ from the Donner Pass route. I don't know of any other locos that use the same\
      \ horn. It's just a very generic horn sound that I wish DTG would stop using.\
      \ Another problem I found was in the flange squeal sounds. They are exactly\
      \ the same as the sounds on the Class 395, Class 801, Kawasaki M8 and who knows\
      \ how many other trains. Basically I've heard these same flange squeal sounds\
      \ a million times, and the fact that DTG keep using those sounds show me that\
      \ they are just lazy, and don't really have respect for the source material.\
      \ How did they think they could get away with using flange squeal sounds from\
      \ ELECTRIC UNITS on a DIESEL locomotive?\n\nLastly I'll talk about the locomotives\
      \ features, or lack-there-of. Normally you press 'I' on the keyboard to turn\
      \ on the instrument lights, but on this locomotive, the key command doesn't\
      \ work. You have to physically click and drag the switch, which isn't very easy\
      \ to find. Strangely, the usual 'pressing 'L' to turn on the cab light' works,\
      \ so there is no excuse not to have the same for the instrument lights. On quite\
      \ a few U.S. diesels made by Dovetail (can't remember them all off the top of\
      \ my head), you can switch on the number-board lights and step lights. You can't\
      \ do that with the C40-8, nor can you switch on/off the ditchlights at will.\
      \ They only come on when you sound the horn; there is no working switch that\
      \ lets you turn them on/off yourself. As usual, the cab windows don't open,\
      \ and neither do the doors. This is a common problem with DTG products that\
      \ really ticks me off, especially when there's quick a few trains from them\
      \ where the windows do open (Class 377, UP Gas Turbine, BR 155 and 1938 tube\
      \ stock spring to mind).\n\nIn conclusion, I think the Norfolk Southern C40-8\
      \ add-on for Train Simulator was yet another cheaply-made/rushed product with\
      \ little to no respect for the source material. I can-not recommend this locomotive\
      \ at all, unless you are desperate for more Norfolk Southern engines, like myself.\
      \ My review of this loco has now concluded."
