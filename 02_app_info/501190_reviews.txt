Your receivers will run their route then stand behind the CB making it impossible to complete the pass. While on defense the WR will run the route then stand in-front of your CB making it an easy catch for the CPU. Blitzing is useless cause your LBs will just run into the OL and get stuck and stand still doing a running motion meaning they arent pressuring or covering.\n\n3) not being able to rebind commands is sad. \n\n4) some command arent always allowed. the manual says you can run faster if you hit space or A. This only true if you are a running back meaning you cannot use it on kick returns, punt returns, or INTs. This is insane, anyone who plays football should know how to RUN. \n\ni'm sure there are more problems but even with just these it destroys any fun that could come from this. i wouldn't buy it for a penny.","timestamp_created":1609721087,"timestamp_updated":1609721087,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wdC25fYCds+fwAI="}
