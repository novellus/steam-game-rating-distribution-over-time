If you're looking for a game with wonky physics and subpar control and terrible performance for a simple looking game, then look no further.\n\nSeriously though it goes without saying that the graphics are atrocious with textures that are clearly stretched way too far and interface elements that look like MS Paint.  Gameplay isn't any better.","timestamp_created":1469520703,"timestamp_updated":1469520703,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.62539982795715332","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1505932924,"developer_response":"The physics are handled by Unreal Engine 4. The controls are very tight. Kind of a must in such a game.... You say you're getting bad performance. This game runs great on an nvidia shield tablet using an ARM CPU and 2GB of ram. Does your PC meet the same specs? Feel free to leave a comment in the improvement/feature request section if you have any thing to add."}],"cursor":"AoJ44c2Qk9YCefvKXQ=="}
