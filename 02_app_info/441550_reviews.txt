It is an old game, so the graphics and AI are something to be desired (it is quite easy to cheese the AI once you understand it's rhythms).  However the game is filled with lots of complexities, requiring you to manage an economy to gather resources, keep tabs public perception of your faction, direct fleet and troop movements, taking offices on missions or placing them in command positions to boost the effectiveness of your forces.  The game is filled with hidden bonuses that relate to Star Wars lore, and secret missions which activate if your trigger events from the movies.  Despite it's age and all the other Star Wars games that are out there, I still find myself coming back to this one time and again.","timestamp_created":1609811554,"timestamp_updated":1609811554,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw7d2P6PYCc5bJwAI="}
