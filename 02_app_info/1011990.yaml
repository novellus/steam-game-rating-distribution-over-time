    review: "Bem, voc\xEA leu Dies Irae, se apaixonou pela megaloman\xEDaca escrita\
      \ do Masada e... Viu que o \xFAnica outra m\xEDdia dispon\xEDvel em ingl\xEA\
      s de Shinza Banshou \xE9 um spin-off sobre o Wilhelm. Beleza, todo mundo gosta\
      \ do Wilhelm, melhor psicopata das VNs.\n\nMas a\xED, mistura isso com uma hist\xF3\
      ria de amor... COM O WILHELM.\n\nQue tipo de pessoa doente faria isso? Eu n\xE3\
      o sei, mas sei mesmo \xE9 que a bizarra din\xE2mica da hist\xF3ria funciona\
      \ muito bem. Wilhelm melhor tsundere e Claudia melhor garota. Interessante ver\
      \ como a falta de compreens\xE3o dele em rela\xE7\xE3o \xE0 natureza benevolente\
      \ de sua parceira eventualmente se transforma em uma esp\xE9cie de admira\xE7\
      \xE3o amorosa. \n\nBoa VN, e ainda tem mais das batalhas exageradas que tornaram\
      \ Dies um cl\xE1ssico. S\xF3 acho que as vezes a megalomania do Masada acaba\
      \ entrando demais e interferindo no que era para ser uma hist\xF3ria de drama\
      \ interessante.\n\nVale tamb\xE9m dizer que conta com CGs hiper polidas e animadas,\
      \ realmente fazendo jus ao logo da Light no come\xE7o. Se curtiu Dies, leitura\
      \ obrigat\xF3ria."
