    review: 'Started game up, it was extremely loud. Tried to find a menu to turn
      the game volume down, there was none. When I tried to play with a friend, I
      accidentally chose "Host Game" instead of join, and found there was no way back
      to the main menu that I could find, had to close the game and restart to get
      to the menu again.


      Once actually in the game it was alright, but nothing special. It was very obscure
      what to do half the time, no indication of what objects are interactable and
      which are not. The area in which your hands have to be with an object to interact
      with it is extremely small. The ropes you climb were very inconsistent to grab
      because of it. Once you get into the main room it gets a little better, though
      the last room is really obscure and cluttered to the point that it''s distracting
      and we spent over 10 minutes before we happened onto the mechanic the game was
      trying to have us perform.


      There was also a lack of rotation options, snap rotation is something that should
      really be in any game where you''re expected to rotate around consistently.


      The lack of a real menu to adjust options, the lack of ability to go back to
      the starting screens, the lack of feedback from the game (pressing buttons doesn''t
      make and visual or auditory effect to signal that it did something), lack of
      snap rotation, just made for a generally irritating experience.


      Overall the game could use a lot of polish and better game design choices. The
      puzzles were simple and short, the game has little replayability other than
      trying to get the lowest score. It''s not a bad game, I did get some fun out
      of it, just not enough for me to recommend, there were more painful moments
      in the game than enjoyable ones.


      This being said, there weren''t that many bugs, even if many mechanics felt
      stiff, unintuitive, or finicky. The game is only $3 at this point, so expectations
      weren''t that high, so it was a closer call on whether to recommend or not.
      In the end, after playing it, I felt no desire to replay, thus my decision is
      not recommended.'
