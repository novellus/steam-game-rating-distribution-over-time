    review: Just finished (hopefully) the tutorial. As soon as you start, you're greeted
      by a big scroll with a wavy dragon head. It speaks to you for at least a full
      five minutes, where you aren't allowed to do ANYTHING besides stand and listen.
      This is continued further when you're told how to play by the bird familiar,
      with each individual step of doing one small thing being surrounded by about
      5-10 minutes of talking and awkward, uncared for jokes. During this tutorial
      phase, there is NO free-roam, object interaction, or anything besides the tutorial.
      I spent the first full hour of gameplay listening to that bird talk, and lost
      all appetite for the game. I may try it again in the future, but for now the
      controls are terrible and the tutorial completely ruins the game.
