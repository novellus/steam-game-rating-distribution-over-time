The jump button just simply stops working on level 2, making you have to restart, over and over, until it, by chance, decides to work long enough to complete the level.\nThankfully, it worked on the 3rd level...too bad the level itself is glitched all to hell. \nI can't figure out if the devs are just sadistic worshipers of the unholy, attempting to spread anger and rage across the land. or if they actually tried...and unlike the Engine that could....they in fact, could not...make a game worth playing.\n\nThat said...it takes a lot for me to realize I truly hate a game...and the level at which this game excelled at making me not even want to finish it and get the achievements (which I of course did), in and of itself was an accomplishment. \nSo hats off to that.
