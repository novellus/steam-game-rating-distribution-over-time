      notes: Hello! When you shoot monsters there is a comical amount of blood squirting
        out of them. There are also many zombies that will get in your face. As you
        take damage your screen  does turn blood red, covering more of the screen
        as you take more damage.

    review: I had multiple issues with this game. The knife didn't work at all, inventory
      is difficult to use, the floor is too far down (no way to adjust it). The render
      distance is horribly low. Aiming with the gun is incorrect, missing the enemy's
      head even at close range. At this point, I don't recommend this game.
