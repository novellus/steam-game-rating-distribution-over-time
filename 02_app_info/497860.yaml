      \ />\r\nIf you are into PVP you'll be delighted to partake in the fast-paced\
      \ and skill-based action the game provides. Should you prefer to play in peace\
      \ there is a Non-PVP world available as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOther notable\
      \ game features include dungeons, gathering of ingredients and brewing of potions,\
      \ player housing, a task system (including boss tasks), battle &amp; soccer\
