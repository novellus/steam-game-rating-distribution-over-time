But unfortunately just barely 2 mins into the game it already failed to amuse me. It's very bland and boring. I'm usually very easy to entertain and I do like the other KEMCO games that I've played.

I'll remove it from my library after writing this review.","timestamp_created":1607509859,"timestamp_updated":1607510097,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xq/Eo/YCceiuuAI="}
