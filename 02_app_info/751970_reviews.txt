Even though it took me about 13 hours to perfectly beat the whole game, it is worth learning enemies and building strategy skills. However, the game should have a tutorial at the beginning of the first level so that way people can understand how to play; for me, I at first did not know how the player and game mechanics worked and it took me about a half hour to figure out.","timestamp_created":1591332932,"timestamp_updated":1591332932,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517241418361663818","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmrG1wfICfLWejAI="}
