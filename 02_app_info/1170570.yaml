      \ and click adventure in the classic style. Taking cues from the recent revival\
      \ of the genre there is an emphasis on story, with puzzle solving being the\

      \ guy, and so puzzles are down-to-earth, designed to be unobtrusive, and give\
      \ an investigative feel.  We're keeping the pacing is quick and lean, you'll\
      \ never be wandering around lost for long periods - Mick is propelled through\
      \ the story at a good clip, from one situation to another, with barely a moment\
      \ to catch his breath."

    reviews: "\u201CThe Drifter has a style all of its own and it feels like a real\
      \ evolution of the genre. There are no ridiculously obtuse puzzles, the pixel\
      \ art animation is excellent, the user interface is intuitive (even using a\
      \ control pad), the voicework is fantastic and the narrative is riveting. The\
      \ Drifter really raises the bar for point and click adventures. Highly recommended.\u201D\
