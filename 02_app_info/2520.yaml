    reviews: <h2 class="bb_tag">GameTunnel - 8/10 and 2006 Game of the Year</h2>&quot;One
      of the quirkiest and best put together games I've played in quite awhile. This
      game has a bounty of inventive innovation from its visually impressive and original
      theme to its 'keep you on your toes' and constantly changing gameplay... Gumboy
      is quite possibly the best indie game I've played this year.&quot; Read the
      full review <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gametunnel.com/articles.php?id=562"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"  >here</a>.<h2 class="bb_tag">GamersMark - 8/10</h2>&quot;...
      The first thing you'll notice when you play Gumboy is that it's absolutely gorgeous.&quot;

    review: 'Although I will readily admit this game has some issues, I did find it
      a fun little casual physics game. Unfortunately it''s really dated and either
      doesn''t support controllers or doesn''t like mine. I also had issues with multi-monitor
      and 4K display throwing it for a bit of a loop, but a quick change to 1920x1080
      fullscreen fixed it.


      I still recommend the game because I did find it enjoyable to mess around and
      learn the physics and how to navigate the levels, but it very much shows its
      age and could be better/use an update...'
