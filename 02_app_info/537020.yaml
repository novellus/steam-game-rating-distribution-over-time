    review: "This game deserves a more in depth review than it has had yet, so I'll\
      \ do my best.\n\nBetween the campaign and the puzzles there is some good content\
      \ that will make you think hard.\nThe Campaign's final battle was suitably epic.\
      \  Unfortunately, beating the campaign and trying all of the puzzles and only\
      \ failing on 2 out of 17 puzzles, both of which I think were bugged, only took\
      \ me 13.8 hours.  paying the 6 USD sale price for 13.8 hours of good fun, I\
      \ think I got my money's worth, but I've had better deals. \n\n what would give\
      \ this endless hours of fun would be if the multiplayer or offline vs. CPU modes\
      \ were good.  Unfortunately I've tried searching for multiplayer games without\
      \ being able to find any.  It seems like this game got buried in mass of games\
      \ being produced nowadays and noone bought it, so unless you have a steam friend\
      \ you can buy this game for and convince to play it with you or this game shocks\
      \ everyone with a second wind of sales then multiplayer just isnt going to happen.\
      \  Multiplayer also lacks a menu where you could potentialy see what other players\
      \ games are going on and have an option to observe those games if those players\
      \ allowed observers into their games.\n\nthe Offline VS. CPU mode didn't impress\
      \ me either.  This and multiplayer are the only modes where you can build your\
      \ deck from the full complement of cards in the game.  The Campaign, while fun,\
      \ doesnt even use a deck in 6 of the 9 missions, and when it does use a deck,\
      \ your card choices are heavily limited.  Unfortunately, the CPU AI is pretty\
      \ bad, so I can't realy test what cards are good or bad effectively in the VS.\
      \ CPU mode.  Another feature I would have liked to see for the VS CPU mode would\
      \ have been the ability to play with or give the CPU a random deck.  there is\
      \ no random deck option, you have to pick your opponents deck, so you know what\
      \ they have.\n\nOne thing that disappointed me from Steam's side is that in\
      \ the window for \"similar to games I play\" on this game's store page, it didn't\
      \ list Pox Nora.  This game is infact similar to Pox Nora and less buggy than\
      \ that game.  Last I played Pox Nora was like 2 years ago though but I have\
      \ over 390 hours in that game.\n\nOverall I'll give this game a 6.8/10  I wanted\
      \ to give it a higher score, and I still do reccomend it.  It is good fun and\
      \ takes a good amount of thinking hard for about 13.8 hours.  Understand that\
      \ if you do buy it, chances are you probably wont find yourself playing it much\
      \ longer than that.\n"
