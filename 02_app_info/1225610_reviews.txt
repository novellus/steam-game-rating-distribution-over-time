The true question is: Why not? This shooting game combines fighting game inputs with shmup gameplay. It is also the game that has so many references to other games that I can't even list them all.  Main inspirations were Hellsinker and Re:frain prism memories which I recommend checking out aswell.\n\nThis game is different from the original CD version. I don't want to say what got changed, but it certainly made the game far better. One big plus is that ingame documents can now be read which wasn't possible in the other version. \n\nthe game consists of 6 stages with 3 difficulties. It plays after akashicforce. \n\nAdvent gives 500% shield which are 5 hits with shield and 2 with shield-off. your shield regenerates once you use them for grazing which allows for quick recoveries.\n\nOn Another shield gets reduced to 100% and you die instantly without shield-on. regeneration is slowed, bullets are faster and a bit denser.\n\nAkashic adds revenge bullets and forces a more radiant silvergun-esque playstyle. bullet density and speed are also enhanced. \n\nwhile it certainly takes a few hours to properly learn the system it becomes a lot of fun later once you learn to use them in more efficient ways. \n\nmy favourite feature of the game are the options. you can customize your inputs aswell as change the behaviour of your shield/wing. there is also the option to enable autocontinue and autorestart which I haven't seen in other games yet. \n\nOne thing to note is that highscores submitted to the leaderboards allow 1 credit clears only. Take it how you want. I don't really mind, because it allows for more optimization during the run. \n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1610029521,"timestamp_updated":1610029660,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9t7P7vYCdrSkwQI="}
