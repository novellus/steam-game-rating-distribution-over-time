Other episodes ran okay just that one failed midway. Best find another site versus crunchyroll unless they find what causing it fail. It also made my video display driver fail which makes me worried there should be no issue. \n\nClean Freak is pretty funny its in all subtitle and original dialogue Japanese but its very funny, comic and slap stick sort story.","timestamp_created":1509770198,"timestamp_updated":1509770198,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv5/Uwt8CeompigE="}
