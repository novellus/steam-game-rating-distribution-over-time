    about_the_game: '<strong>Ultimate Arena</strong> is a competitive first person
      shooter arena game.<br>Compete against other players online to prove your worth,
      wielding a loadout of 12 brutal weapons and wrecking total havoc within the
      arenas! <br>Control health, armor and weapon pickups throughout the map to gain
      an advantage against your foes.<br><br>Prepare to frag like you never have!<h2
      class="bb_tag">Weapons: </h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Gauntlet </strong><br>You
      spawn with it. This short ranged melee blade will hack and prune anyone dumb
      enough to get too close up and personal. <br><br></li><li><strong>Pistol </strong><br>You
      spawn with it. The long range and moderate firing rate will allow you to pick
      off enemies at both medium and long distances, providing they don''t overtake
      you with heavier firepower. Secondary fire uses ice charges which are able to
      temporary freeze opponents, bogging them down. <br><br></li><li><strong>Shotgun
      </strong><br>The pump action shotgun inflicts considerable damage at close range.
      <br><br></li><li><strong>Double Shotgun </strong><br>Slower than the pump action
      shotgun but twice as deadly at close range. <br><br></li><li><strong>Assault
      Rifle </strong><br>A special hybrid automatic rifle which peppers foes with
      16mm rounds even at long range without ever having the need to reload. Lethal
      if you have an accurate aim. <br><br></li><li><strong>Shredder </strong><br>This
      unique and nasty tool fires a pair of circular blades in quick succession. You
      can ricochet them off walls and slice foes who are out of your line of sight.
      <br><br></li><li><strong>Rocket Launcher</strong> <br>Blow stuff up. Solve problems.
      <br><br></li><li><strong>Grenade Launcher </strong><br>This particular model
      is able to detonate your grenades at any given moment by using secondary fire.
      <br><br></li><li><strong>Laser Prism </strong><br>The electric beam is able
      to harm targets at medium range. Your accuracy will determine the outcome of
      the fight. <br><br></li><li><strong>Plasma Cannon </strong><br>Designed to sweep
      large areas with plasma projectiles. You''ll need to properly predict the enemies
      movement in order to get the best out of this weapon. <br><br></li><li><strong>Gas
      Rifle </strong><br>This thing spews foulness all over the place. Good for crowd
      control. The low damage is heavily compensated by the large area of effect.
      <br><br></li><li><strong>Crossbow </strong><br>Primary fire shoots deadly bolts
      at high speed. Secondary fire also consumes electricity ammo but allows higher
      range and damage by using electrified arrows.</li></ul>'
