      \ /><br><br>One night, in 198X, in the small town of Watford, Arizona, a satanic\
      \ cult unwittingly summons the ancient evil, Baphomet, catapulting the town\
      \ into chaos. John, awoken by the kidnapping of his neighbor, sets out into\
      \ the night to fight back against the demonic invasion and rescue his friends\
      \ before it's too late...<br><br><strong>Kingdom of Night</strong> is an 80\u2019\
      s themed isometric, story-driven, action-RPG with an expansive, interconnected\
      \ map and open-ended quest system. It is a game about coming of age, cosmic\
      \ horror, and true love. The player takes control of John as his adventure leads\
      \ him through an hour by hour experience of what may be everyone's last night\
      \ on Earth. He will encounter unearthly evils, Demon lords, afflicted townsfolk,\
      \ high school bullies, and a torrent of engaging, serial-like side stories all\
      \ nested in a larger-than-life fantasy that brings the ultimate evil to a neighborhood\
      \ near you. <br><br>Players can choose their own class, customize their abilities,\
      \ battle nightmarish creatures, and collect unique items and equipment in order\
      \ to infiltrate the massive lairs of demon lords that have taken over the town.<br><br><img\

      \ play style depending on your choice.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Shape Your Character</h2>Skill\
      \ trees are split into 3 branches, containing 10 different talents each. As\
      \ you level up, you are allotted points to spend into any of the three branches\
      \ of your class. Once you have reached level 10 in your first branch, you are\
      \ free to cross over into another branch, allowing you to fully customize your\
      \ play style.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Hoard the Best Gear</h2>Get new equipment\
      \ via quest rewards, hidden items throughout the town, and random drops with\
      \ multi-tiered loot tables and variable drop rates. Items range from common\
      \ to completely unique. The items you collect provide an extra dimension to\
      \ character stat development and have special abilities that will make you even\
      \ more powerful.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Co-op With Your Friends</h2>You don\u2019\
      t have to face the forces of darkness by yourself. In Kingdom of Night, either\
      \ play through the campaign alone, or with a friend in local co-op. Team up\
      \ and synergize different character classes, becoming a torrent of annihilation\
      \ that the underworld will fear."
