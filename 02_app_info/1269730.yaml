    about_the_game: "Conservation. Sabotage. Stealth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake control\
      \ of a submarine and disrupt the forces that seek to plunder the ocean for wealth.\
      \ Sabotage engines, steal information by hacking into secret radio channels,\
      \ defend and heal dying ocean life. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou're a pilot and this\
      \ is wartime, but our enemies are not other nations, and your weapons are unconventional.\
      \ Use the ocean to fight its oppressors - plant shark pheromones to prevent\
      \ illegal divers from poaching and fishing. Place destructive barnacles on the\
      \ boats of your enemies to degrade their hulls. Sometimes, you may have to resort\
      \ to using good, old-fashioned explosives to disrupt the efforts of profit-seekers\
      \ lacking a conscience for the loss of ocean life. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPilot\
      \ through the depths as Max, a blind young adult who just lost his estranged\
      \ mother. In possibly the strangest inheritance in history, all she left him\
      \ was this old submarine. Retrace her steps as an ecological vigilante and team\
      \ up with fellow crusaders, Roger and Bazza.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe immersive\
      \ underwater environment is shown through the stunning colours and visual effects\
      \ as well as through the strangely calming rush and flow over water around the\
      \ walls of your sub in the deep ocean. Serene, beautiful, and dangerous. <br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThe game supports its' stealth based gameplay through sound:\
      \ as you pilot through shark infested waters, or slink over the ocean floor\
      \ to remain undetected, the submarine's audio-based sonar system assists your\
      \ journey. Listen closely and learn of dangers that you might not see on screen.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nJoin Max as he reconnects with his mother, protects the ocean\
      \ and heals himself."
