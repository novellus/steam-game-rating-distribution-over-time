    about_the_game: "Sam receives a strange tape in the mail. Watching it brings her\
      \ to a deeply unsettling place that feels strangely familiar.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nHeartworm is a game about the memories we keep and the ones we wish we could\
      \ forget. It marries cinematic fixed camera survival-horror with low-rez, retro\
      \ 3d graphics, and a chilling original soundtrack. These features combine with\
      \ an emotional and psychologically-focused narrative to compose a nostalgia-charged\
      \ love letter to late 90s genre progenitors Silent Hill, Resident Evil, and\
      \ Dino Crisis."
