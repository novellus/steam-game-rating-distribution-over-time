      /><br>Haunted Jail: Alcatas is a 2D Survival Horror Game based on the paranormal
      events of the oldest and the most haunted prison in Alcatas, witnessed by those
      who set foot inside the place. <br><br>Alcatas island is famous for the dark
      history associated with the most haunted prison in Alcatas. The prison was built
      in 1859 initially as the U.S. Military defense and then as long-term military
      prison during 1868. Long before the prison was even built on the land, there
      was a rumor going around that the land was haunted. The place had an unpleasant
      feeling from the very beginning as the earliest inhabitants of the land were
      the Native Americans. Fast forward to the early 1940s, it was reported that
      there were some prisoners who were shot to death by jail guards, some of them
      were punished inside a punishment chamber by various means including the beatings,
      electric shock treatment etc. It had resulted in deaths of some of the prisoners
      and their spirits were trapped inside the prison. Now, the majority of the jail
      is closed due to various reasons except the A-Block. No prisoners are kept in
      B, C and D-Block due to many reports of the paranormal events. It is reported
      that sounds of cell door slamming, voices, gunshots, scream etc. can still be
      heard to this day. Anyone who enters the building has some sort of unexplained
      paranormal experiences even though the people at the Alcatas main office located
      in the west of Alcatas Island are in denial about the paranormal.<br><br>At
      present, only two jail guards are recruited to maintain the tight security of
      the prison. No one usually visits the punishment chamber due to lots of tragedy,
      pain, suffering which are associated with it. You play as one of the jail guards
      whose mission is to secure the building. It is easier said than done because
      you never know what else is waiting for you in the Haunted Prison.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1056650/extras/hja_gif_1.gif?t=1570672023"
