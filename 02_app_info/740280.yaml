    review: While it is pretty, in that "Look what I made all by myself" way, this
      is a really bad game. I was hoping for a fun arcade shooter but this fails at
      being fun. It would have been a bad arcade game as well since they want to keep
      you playing long enough to keep dropping quarters in the slot. Your helicopter
      is HUGE and makes dodging bullets nearly impossible and you have to shoot enemies
      so many times that you're stuck in front of them like a sitting duck. Don't
      waste your time or money on this game.
