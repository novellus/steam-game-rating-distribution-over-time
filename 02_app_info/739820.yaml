    about_the_game: Follow the story of Maia, a young woman who awakens with strange
      abilities. Journey through laboratories, forests and city ruins as you discover
      the mysteries and origins of her powers. <br><br><strong>Setting</strong><br>In
      the year 2118, mankind developed the technology of interstellar travel. Following
      this discovery, missions were planned to explore Alpha Centauri, the nearest
      solar system. Over the next several decades, a mining station was built on Tauria,
      the moon of a planet in Alpha Centauri which is habitable. 60 years later, starships
      routinely travel between Earth and Tauria. <br><br>On Earth, the majority of
      Europe has unified into a single nation known as The Union. This nation is governed
      by the GCA, the Government Control Agency. A branch of this organization is
      responsible for all research on Tauria. They have labs on Tauria as well as
      on Earth where many secret studies are undertaken. <br><br><strong>Characters</strong><br>The
      story of Wraithmind features many characters, three of which are playable. When
      you start the game you will only control one character, but as you progress
      through the story, other characters will join your journey. <br><br><strong>Gameplay</strong><br>Wraithmind
      is a turn-based science fiction RPG. Featuring four to five hours of gameplay,
      the game will take you through several different areas each with their own story,
      enemies and characters. You control one character as you progress through the
      different areas. When you encounter characters or objects, you can interact
      with them and in some cases you can pick up items. <br><br><strong>Battles</strong><br>As
      you progress through the story, you will encounter various kinds of enemies.
      When you collide with an enemy on the map, the game will change to another scene
      where you can see all of your characters and all of the enemies you must fight.
      Every character and enemy performs an action one at a time. When it is the turn
      of a character to perform an action, you must select which action to perform
      and the target for that action. Enemies select their action and target automatically.
      Once all enemies have been defeated, you are taken back outside the battle scene.<br><br><strong>Progression</strong><br>When
      you defeat enemies in battle, your characters will gain skill points. These
      points can then be used to increase talents of each character. Talents allow
      you to decide how your characters will become stronger.

    review: I just bought this game made by Teko. I've played 3.5 hrs it looks like
      it's going to have a good storyline. I like the fact that you can change your
      stat build anytime. You can minus some stats to add it somewhere else which
      is cool and flexible.
