I was hoping this locomotive would be good, and the main reason I got it was so I could have something to drive on the Norfolk Southern Coal District route that wasn't ANOTHER ES44AC and the C40-9W. Seriously, how many ES44ACs have we had in Train Sim over the years? It's like the Class 66 all over again.\n\nBut that's enough stalling. Now I should have a look at the C40-8, and believe me. It's not good.\n\nI'll start off by talking about the physics. When running light engine, the loco takes off like a rocket even when you put the throttle in Notch 2. It reminds me of the Class 150/1, prior to Dovetail releasing an update for it. I've seen many diesel locomotives in my time, and even though they were all in New Zealand, I think I have some room to say that diesels don't accelerate anywhere near as quickly as the NS C40-8 in Train Sim. Coupling up to a big rake of loaded coal hoppers slows down the acceleration rate, but perhaps a bit too slow. You have to put the throttle in Notch 5 or 6 just to get it moving. The brakes are equally disappointing. Even when you apply the brakes to 26% on the F4 HUD, the brake pressure skyrockets to at least 40%. Much like the NS ES44AC included with the Coal District route, and the CSX SD80MAC, the brakes on the C40-8 take as much time to release as it takes for me to get a girlfriend. Yes, I went there. Don't judge me. \n\nIn other words, the brakes on the C40-8 take an insanely long time to release. For example - I am coasting along at 25 miles per hour, and I see a warning for an upcoming 20 speed limit. I apply the brakes to say - 30 to 38% - and by the time the brakes are fully released, I'm down to 18 miles per hour. I don't know whether or not the brakes on the real thing act like this, but they're just far too slow for me. Again, it's the same situation on the NS ES44AC and CSX SD80MAC.\n\n\nAnd what about the actual model. Much like the other trains that DTG makes, the model is actually very accurate to the real thing. It captures the look of the real NS C40-8 almost perfectly, although I do think the front of the loco looks a little out of proportion.\n\nThe sounds are just as disappointing as the physics. The engine sounds are very similar to - if not, the same - as the ES44AC, and the horn sounds exactly like the Southern Pacific C44-9W from the Donner Pass route. I don't know of any other locos that use the same horn. It's just a very generic horn sound that I wish DTG would stop using. Another problem I found was in the flange squeal sounds. They are exactly the same as the sounds on the Class 395, Class 801, Kawasaki M8 and who knows how many other trains. Basically I've heard these same flange squeal sounds a million times, and the fact that DTG keep using those sounds show me that they are just lazy, and don't really have respect for the source material. How did they think they could get away with using flange squeal sounds from ELECTRIC UNITS on a DIESEL locomotive?\n\nLastly I'll talk about the locomotives features, or lack-there-of. Normally you press 'I' on the keyboard to turn on the instrument lights, but on this locomotive, the key command doesn't work. You have to physically click and drag the switch, which isn't very easy to find. Strangely, the usual 'pressing 'L' to turn on the cab light' works, so there is no excuse not to have the same for the instrument lights. On quite a few U.S. diesels made by Dovetail (can't remember them all off the top of my head), you can switch on the number-board lights and step lights. You can't do that with the C40-8, nor can you switch on/off the ditchlights at will. They only come on when you sound the horn; there is no working switch that lets you turn them on/off yourself. As usual, the cab windows don't open, and neither do the doors. This is a common problem with DTG products that really ticks me off, especially when there's quick a few trains from them where the windows do open (Class 377, UP Gas Turbine, BR 155 and 1938 tube stock spring to mind).\n\nIn conclusion, I think the Norfolk Southern C40-8 add-on for Train Simulator was yet another cheaply-made/rushed product with little to no respect for the source material. I can-not recommend this locomotive at all, unless you are desperate for more Norfolk Southern engines, like myself. My review of this loco has now concluded.","timestamp_created":1502522397,"timestamp_updated":1607635982,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":13,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.693593323230743408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw68qkp/YCcpG0ggE="}
