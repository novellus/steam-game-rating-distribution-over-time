      (2E)</h2><br>In part one of the Randal Morn Trilogy, &quot;The Sword of the
      Dales,&quot; the legendary leader of Daggerdale, Randal Morn, was captured by
      unknown assailants as he sought to regain the great weapon for which that adventure
      was named. A stalwart band of enthusiastic heroes was recruited to ride to his
      aid, yet all they recovered was the Sword itself and a message: &quot;Seek me
      in Spiderhaunt Wood.&quot; In the second part of the trilogy, &quot;The Secret
      of Spiderhaunt,&quot; those same adventurers found Randal and freed him briefly,
      yet he was almost as quickly torn from their grasp by an agent of the evil Zhentarim,
      seeking to end the threat of Randal Morn''s return to power.<br><br>In this
      final episode, the heroes must follow the kidnapper''s trail and rescue Randal
      Morn again before the Zhentarim finish interrogating him and the axe falls upon
      his neck. Armed with the Sword of the Dales and aided by a powerful spirit that
      lives within the weapon, the heroes must march into the heart of Zhent-occupied
      Dagger Falls, free Randal Morn, and save the city from utter destruction. The
      job is dangerous - perhaps more than the heroes can handle - yet those who would
      live in songs and legends cannot concern themselves with living to a ripe old
      age!<br><br>This is the final part of a trilogy of modules that began with &quot;The
      Sword of the Dales&quot; and &quot;The Secret of Spiderhaunt.&quot;<h2 class="bb_tag">Product
      History</h2><br>&quot;The Return of Randal Morn,&quot; by Jim Butler, is the
      third and final adventure in the &quot;Randal Morn Trilogy.&quot; It was published
      in October 1995.<br><br><strong>Ending the Randal Morn Trilogy</strong>. This
      adventure concludes the trilogy of adventures that began with &quot;The Sword
      of the Dales&quot; (1995) and continued in &quot;The Secret of Spiderhaunt&quot;
      (1995).<br><br>The next trilogy of Forgotten Realms adventures, released the
      next year, would focus on &quot;Undermountain&quot; (1996), although they wouldn''t
      be as tightly connected as the adventures in this trilogy were.<br><br><strong>It''s
      All about the NPCs.</strong> As with the previous adventures in this trilogy,
      this one focuses on several NPCs - which is sort of a trademark of the Forgotten
      Realms. To be precise, the PCs are caught between Randal Morn and the villainess
      Gothyl, though it''s ultimately the PCs'' actions that will decide the fate
      of Daggerdale. Late in the adventure, the PCs may also get to meet other two
      more icons of the Realms: Khelben Blackstaff and Elminster.<br><br><strong>Adventuring
      Tropes.</strong> Of the three adventures in this trilogy, this one is the most
      typical of AD&amp;D adventuring in the 90s: It''s all backstory and plot, with
      big events occurring all around and the PCs being brought along for the ride
      as they move through various set encounters. Run well, it can give the PCs the
      feeling of taking part in the major events of the Realms; run poorly, it can
      feel like a railroad they have no control over.<br><br><strong>Expanding the
      Realms.</strong> This adventure returns to Dagger Falls and Daggerdale, areas
      that had previously been featured in FRQ3: &quot;The Doom of Daggerdale&quot;
      (1993). There are certainly new details to be found on the town and dale in
      this adventure, but it''s more notable for the fact that Randal Morn (probably)
      reclaims Dagger Falls from the Zhentarim - a major event in the Dalelands.<br><br><strong>Farewell
      to Daggerdale.</strong> Daggerdale was a major focus of Forgotten Realms adventures
      from 1993-95, with four total adventures set in the area. It has never gotten
      the same attention since, although it also appeared in three novels around the
      same time: All Shadows Fled(1995), Cloak of Shadows(1995), and Finder''s Bane(1997).
      And of course it receives a mention in Volo''s Guide to the Dalelands(1996).<br><br><strong>About
      the Creators.</strong> The &quot;Sword of the Dales&quot; trilogy was Butler''s
      first published work for TSR. He would produce all three adventures for release
      in 1995 and then would continue with more Forgotten Realms books in 1996.<br><br><i>Converted
