    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">What's it about</h2>Inspired by classic Japanese
      shooting games, Danmaku Unlimited 3 is a lovingly crafted medley of the best
      aspects of Japanese bullet hell games, all in a polished, accessible package.<br><br><br><img

      /><h2 class="bb_tag">An old school shoot'em up? Why is it worth my time?</h2>Bullet
      hell style mechanics is having a kind of renaissance with its inclusion in many
      hit indie games. However if players want to explore more into the world of Bullet
      Hell a lot of traditional titles can be hard to understand in its mechanics
      or just plain too difficult to get into as a newcomer.<br><br><br>Danmaku Unlimited
      3 is designed to be intuitive and accessible to players unfamiliar with the
      genre, all the while without losing any of the intensity and flashiness that
      makes the genre so exciting to play.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/450950/extras/DU3_2.jpg?t=1569363262"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Okay, so how does the game do that?</h2><br><strong>CORE</strong>
      A staple feature in Bullet Hells, only the very center of the player's craft,
      the core, is vulnerable to enemy fire. <br><br><strong>GRAZING</strong> Get
      the core close to bullets to just barely &quot;graze&quot; it will power up
      the player's craft. Once fully charged it can unleash a powerful rampage that
      makes you feel like a total boss.<br><br><strong>SPIRIT/GRAZE SYSTEM</strong>
      Shooting down enemies turns their shots into harmless ghost bullets that the
      player can safely touch while also powering up the plane.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/450950/extras/DU3_press_2_small.png?t=1569363262"
      /><br><br>All of this allows the game to be at a level of challenge that is
      manageable for a wide range of players without reducing the game into a bullet
      free turkey shoot.<h2 class="bb_tag">I'm good at bullet hell shooters, won't
      I just breeze though the game then?</h2><br>The game has two unique modes, <strong>GRAZE
      MODE</strong> features a differently tuned system (with conditions to trigger
      the ghost bullets) that offers a higher level of challenge comparable to the
      toughest traditional bullet hell titles.<h2 class="bb_tag">Is there a story?</h2><br>It
      is about a guardian, entrusted with Earth, rebelling against her overseers.
      Shakespeare it isn't, but you are here for the bullets and explosions right?<h2
      class="bb_tag">How is the music? A Shmup is nothing without good music!</h2><br>Music
