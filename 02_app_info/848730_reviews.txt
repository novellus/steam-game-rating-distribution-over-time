Mostly the puzzles were not too challenging and that is fine if you just want a casual game to waste some time. It's a very short game which you can play in one sitting, probably 1-2 hours at most. I quite liked the art style which reminded me a bit of the Rusty Lake games which I loved. Now for the annoying part! The game ended really abruptly, I couldn't get back in to finish it, there were things I had not yet done and screens shown on the Store page that I never saw, so why did the game just end like that? I suppose I could start over but what would be the point? It would probably just end abruptly again. I'm a little bit miffed at this.","timestamp_created":1569406374,"timestamp_updated":1569406374,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh5r6s+0CecLs0gE="}
