    review: 'Nice, relaxing but sometimes challenging puzzle game.


      I have been fan of Quell series since it first came out on mobile platforms.

      Finished the game few times on my phone and again in here.


      Not much replayability after completing it 100% but you can go back to it every
      couple months or years and still relax and enjoy it.


      I only wish they made more Quell games.


      Totally recommending it'
