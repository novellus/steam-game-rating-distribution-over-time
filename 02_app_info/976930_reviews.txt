Considering it's EA it will be interesting to see the final line up... Or create your own in the song editor.\n\n+ There has obviously been a lot of care in the staging while you are playing the game during the songs. The backgrounds and stage is anything but boring or static and it's a nice touch and gets you amped during the song at it dynamically changes.\n\n+ The devs listen and tune based on feedback. Open and willing to listen to feedback. This is not common these days of garbage AAA games being crapped out for $90 that last 4 hours.\n\n+ Does not need a lot of polish to feel like a finished game, also rare in EA these days. It entered EA with more polish than many EA titles that have been there for years.\n\nLooking forward to what's next","timestamp_created":1608077911,"timestamp_updated":1608077911,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4vbS6tPYCeJ7JugI="}
