I think it help me to find the correct place on the board.\n+The snapping into place of the pieces has no bug and work nicely.\n\n[b]Observations and suggestions~~~[/b]\n~I think it is ok to animate the character on the main screen, but the animation could be tweaked to make it more natural. At the moment, the animation for the eyes closing is playing in a loop constantly and is a bit weird.\n~The english traduction has a lot of problems in it. Try asking someone who use english regularly to correct your sentences before adding them to the game so that they are constructed adequately.\n~I wouldn't have put the difficulty in that order: hard, medium and easy. I think it's more natural to read (for english and french people at least) from left to right. So it would be better like this: easy, medium and hard instead.\n~When coming back to the game after closing it, the player setting should be kept (language and screen option chosen previously).\n~The sound effect is a bit to strident to my taste. Maybe add settings to change it and tune it down.\n~Puzzle pieces are re-centered under the mouse when clicked which I personally don't like really much. It would be nice to enable the player to choose between re-centering under the mouse or not.\n~It would be nice to have the current puzzle number displayed somewhere on the screen.\n~It would be nice if the timer would stop when the focus is out of the game instead of continuing.\n~Not sure why the puzzles from level 11 to 20 are the same puzzle as from 1 to 10 but without reference images. When looking at the selection of puzzle screen, it feels like I would have 21 different puzzle, but instead I only have half of that :/. Maybe add a different option on each puzzle that are the same to play them with or without reference image instead of making \"new\" puzzle in the list of selected puzzles.\n~I'm not sure if it's a bug or not, but I have done every puzzle at the easy difficulty  and the achievement \"complete level 11\" didn't pop up even though I did all 21 of them. You might want to check that out.\n~I think the demo video from the store page could be shorten a bit. It seems a bit long for the content it's showing.\n~The snapping distance is a mystery to me. Sometimes my pieces are quite far away and they snap on the board. Other time, I'm really near the correct spot and it doesn't snaps at all. Maybe make sure that the snapping distance is the same when coming from all angles around the correct position on the board.\n\n[b]Negatives---[/b]\n-First thing I did after opening the game was changing the settings to fullscreen and taking a print screen with F12 of the game which resulted in a crash. \"FATAL ERROR in action number 1 of Step Event0 for object oSteamScreenshot.\" You might want to look into fixing this issue.\n-The sound effects when hovering on menu elements doesn't seems to be in sync. If the player hover over a new menu element, the last sound should cancel and the new sound should automatically play. As it is, it seems like the first sound needs to finish for any other sound to trigger. (Note that it works fine for the buttons that are inside a puzzle.)\n-The game image \"World Puzzle\" is encoumbering the view when clicking menu option. Either open a new menu when user click setting so that the player can cleary read the menu items or put a background between the game title and the menu so that it's not black on black.\n-On the first easy puzzle, the puzzle pieces blend with the background image to solve making it extremely hard to know where the remaining pieces are. Either put a border around the pieces to help player know where they are, implement a functionality to make the remaining pieces flashes or anything else you could think of to differentiate the pieces and the background image.\n-When the puzzle is complete, the game quickly jumps to the next image to solve without letting the player time to enjoy the finished piece. I think it would be better to let the player click a next button when he is ready instead of quickly changing puzzle without is consent.\n-I'm not sure what is the purpose of the timer. When the timer goes to zero, the player is brought back to the main menu which is not really fun. The timer doesn't add meaning to the game other then forcing the player to place 1 correct piece each minute. It is not linked to any kind of rating with starts or trophies or high score. It feels like an incomplete feature. Why not let the player all the time he wants to complete the puzzle instead? I would either flesh out more this timer feature or remove it altogether if it serves no purpose. The goal of a game is usually to be fun so makes sure that the features you implement leads to a fun feeling :).\n-From a puzzle, the escape keyboard button or the menu button on the middle of the screen brings the player back to the main menu. There is no button while on a puzzle to go back to the selection of puzzle which is annoying.\n-Puzzle progress is not saved when quitting the game and coming back.\n-I'm not particularly liking the music choice for a puzzle type game.\n-Some puzzle pieces have a unique color (like completely blue for example) making it hard to guess where they go.\n-Pieces doesn't snaps to each other.\n-There is no validation to reset the puzzle. One could accidentally reset a puzzle without meaning too. Maybe add a confirm window or something? Specially because the pieces can be over the buttons!\n-There seems to have 2 music tracks. They don't go well together. One is really punchy, and the other is a lot smoother.\n-The music resetting between each puzzle is annoying.\n-There is an image where the tree line is not even visible on the board. (castle image)\n-No setting to mute the sound and the music at all.\n-I don't find the image very appealing. The style is a bit all over the place. From cute characters to realistic man ready to shoot you in the face. This game lacks a coherent art direction. It would have been best to stick to only one art style, example, the mediaeval theme which are present in 2 of the images, instead of through all kind of random images around.\n-No news, no credit inside the game. The dev seems rather absent from his new creation.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nTo the dev: I hope my review will shed some light on the aspects of your game you could improve. There is a lot of work to do, but you might get to improve it quite a bit if you put energy and research into it =)!\n\nTo anyone who wants to play a jigsaw puzzle game: go see somewhere else. For the moment, I wouldn't even play this game for free. I bought it on sale at 0.61 CND$ and the most joy I got from it is by reviewing it (because I like to review stuff). This game feels to me like a school project. It's not very polished, it's short and it's pricy for the little settings and variety of images it procures.","timestamp_created":1594251824,"timestamp_updated":1594251917,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541984736919403076","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47La0mPMCeZv1kwI="}
