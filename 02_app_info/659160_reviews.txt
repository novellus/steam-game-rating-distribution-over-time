Also for some reason the achievments didn't unlock for me, no idea why. Overall its alright but since the premise is so simple and there isn't much to it it gets boring very quickly.","timestamp_created":1540925279,"timestamp_updated":1540925279,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sbmT4+YCcPLTrQE="}
