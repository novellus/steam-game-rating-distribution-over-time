The game doesn't even have a settings page, so your stuck watching it on a tiny little box in the middle of your screen, which there is a workaround but its not even worth the effort. \nI personally think this game is dead and doesn't need to be played, it had its run when it was released but now it just doesn't compare to any of the other amazing Jackbox games. \n(NOTE: You can not play this with people who aren't watching the game in person, there is no jackbox.tv compatibility.)","timestamp_created":1606879108,"timestamp_updated":1606879108,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuqvdkPYCd9vUtgI="}
