The AI and its many personalities all present unique perspectives and goals to the table. It's hard to know who to trust and how the game will progress. There are quite a few dialogue options, and many conversations warranted replays in order to discover alternative goals and dialogue, especially if you decide to work toward achievements. Takes around 3-4 hours to complete on the first playthrough, and the big cutscenes are skippable. \n\nAlthough there were some questionable moments in the dialogue options that can make you go \"that's not what I meant,\" the game is immersive and gets you invested in the fates of everyone and everything present. This game, unfortunately, does suffer from offering the player fake choices in some areas where you'll have different dialogue options that give you the same result, with barely noticeable long-term effects. It's a bit of a shame that there is no option to replay a specific chapter, but the game isn't too long if you want to find out all the available options in a chapter.\n\nYou can tell a lot of work went into this game, especially in the animation. Worth getting if you're a big fan of UI/text-based games, because this game will stand out regardless.","timestamp_created":1604646782,"timestamp_updated":1604646857,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4kv2ZzvUCfoTQrAI="}
