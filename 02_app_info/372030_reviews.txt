My personal favourite is the Pakiceph.\n* Good enemy type variety. There are varieties that teleport, swarm, form laser networks, and much more.\n* Good equipment variety. All sorts of weapons, abilities, and upgrades are available.\n* Interesting tetris-esque outfitting system.\n* Variety of level types.\n* Amusing dialogue.\n\nCons: \n* The plot is thin, and somewhat cliche\n\nI've been playing this on Windows 10 for a while with no issues, so it seems the issues the author mentioned do not occur on all Windows 10 machines.","timestamp_created":1557561473,"timestamp_updated":1557561473,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/r750uoCdKn8wAE="}
