    review: "If there was a \"mixed\" review i'd get that, but no.\n2 of the ships\
      \ are nice.\n3 out of the 5 ships are quite reduntant clones of the original\
      \ ships and are extremely overpriced.\n\nFor all ships the wheelhouse is the\
      \ only interior compartment, no crew compartment, no engine room, not much to\
      \ hang around.\n\nAnyways for the actual boats.\nTake a look at the first screenshot\
      \ above on the storepage of this DLC, will review ships from left to right.\n\
      \nFirst all the way to the left, we have Tobie which is a more expensive B\xF8\
      rge, it has slightly more quota but its stability is awful, and will rarely\
      \ ever tread above 5 knots when full.\nIt's more expensive than Sjarken! and\
      \ even Selfy from King Crab dlc!\nIt's by far the worst boat  out of all DLC's\
      \ and vanilla game.\n\nNow secondly, that yellow boat is Sharky, which is a\
      \ more expensive copy of Sjarken.\n3 times more quota on Redfish than Sjarken,\
      \ and has more quota on other fish except Pollock than Sjarken.\nHowever the\
      \ max line length is only 1000 hooks vs Sjarkens 5000\nis somehow more expensive\
      \ than Selfy from King Crab dlc.\nNOT WORTH\n\nThen we have the oldest boat,\
      \ \"Fix\"\nNow this is an upgrade, being a smaller  Follabuen and for a fair\
      \ price.\n20,000 kg and massive quota (80 tons for Redfish!) for 895,000kr it's\
      \ a great upgrade from the smaller boats.\nIt only has 1000 hook lines however.\n\
      WORTH\n\nThe big red one? Snarset, which is a smaller Vibeke, despite that it\
      \ trades the Cod/Pollock quota for the other two. (120 tons for redfish!)\n\
      The Drawback?\nIt's double the price of a Vibeke.\nNOT WORTH.\n\nThen the big\
      \ old one all the way to the right, that's Moby D, it's Follabuen on steroids.\n\
      It's slower than a snail with alzheimers (lower than 5 knots when full), costs\
      \ 3,350,000kr, sounds awful right? You'd think you would never make money with\
      \ this, well oh boy.\nCapable of carrying 10,000 hook longlines, and with a\
      \ massive storage (50 tons on purchase, can be upgraded to 100 tons!)\nThis\
      \ behemoth can carry immense hauls, outrivaled only by trawlers, easily earning\
      \ you 7 digit numbers in currency,\nWORTH.\n\nIn Short, the modern boats are\
      \ trash, settle for ol'reliable."
