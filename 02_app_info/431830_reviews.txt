It comes with an AI that insults you in that wonderful neutral tone that's reminiscent of GLaDOS from Portals. Just like Don't Starve this is a game where you will die repeatedly over and over and start from the beginning each time while you try to figure out how the game mechanics work. Frustrating but then very satisfying. Someone please tell me where to find of make salad oil already!","timestamp_created":1603468427,"timestamp_updated":1603468427,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ478+Kq/UCfZ7RqQI="}
