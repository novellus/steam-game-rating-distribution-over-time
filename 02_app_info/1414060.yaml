    review: 'For the price, Lone Archer is a great endless wave defense game. The
      level and enemy variety is quite large and the game play is smooth and fun.
      It could definitely use some sort of progression mechanic, but what it currently
      offers is more than enough to entertain.


      If you are interested in seeing a more in depth look at the game I made a short  video:
