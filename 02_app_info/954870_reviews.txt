From the original Elite and Privateer, Eve online and Elite Dangerous. The X games, (all of them) and Freelancer to name but a few well known titles.\nAstrox Imperium has a great deal to live up to, as the pedigree of games like this on the market is incredibly high.\n\nSo, is it any good? Well, yes actually it is.\n\nIf you compare the complexity of the game to Eve or the X games, it does fall short, as a space sim.\nBut this is not a bad thing. You see it is a game you can dip in and out of. It is a far more casual experience if you like, while keeping the core essence of these games.\nGraphically it is not as impressive as Elite Dangerous for instance, but it looks fine.\n\nThe game is constantly being updated and tweaked, so this clearly is not the finished product and will only get better over time.\n\nYou can trade from system to system. You can pick up missions for the different factions. You can mine, refine and manufacture. Build your own bases. Go Pirate if you like, or hunt Pirates in the low law level sectors.\nYou can buy better ships once you have trained for them. You can fit better weapons or equipment to them, once you have trained for them.\n\nThere is a preset universe to try as well as a universe creator where you can set up 500 systems with multiple stations. You can tailor the game to be as hard or easy as you like.\n\nI would like to see better character creation, the modelling is, well, shall we say unflattering?\nMaybe the ability to build and sell your own ships. That would be cool.\nAnd some work on the ship modelling. While it is ok, some more detailed textures would add to the visuals no end.\n\nIt is an easy game to learn. It doesn't cost a fortune and is excellent value for money and will give you hours of game time.\nWell worth a try.\n\nA solid 8.5/10","timestamp_created":1609883993,"timestamp_updated":1609883993,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4uoik6vYCer/qwAI="}
