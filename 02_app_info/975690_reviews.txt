I also liked the elements stuff, it brings some strategy to the game.\n\nCons:\nOnly four types of enemies (despite that 3 of the enemies have 3 elements - makes 9).\nNo co-op mode.\n\nIt's fun to play and to challenge friends but if those cons turns to pros, it would be awesome. Hope you consider it! Keep up the good work.","timestamp_created":1546277764,"timestamp_updated":1546277764,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.571518659591674805","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwusfVgugCdYqKtwE="}
