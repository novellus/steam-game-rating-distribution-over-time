I do not speak Chinese nor do I read it. English is not an option according to what just about an hour of trying to change the language has given me atleast. It costs like $15 even though it's a fairly simple RPG-game. I am having a hard time getting into the options to run this in fullscreen and in all honesty, I haven't gotten to play the game itself, as I have no clue what to click on in order to get there.\nOntop of this absolute bullshit, they've even stolen the cinematics n' shit from another game.\n\nIf you're an adventureous person in general and like to explore the startmenues in games, then by all means! Go right ahead and play the game fellas!\n10/10 would buy again.\n\nEDIT : THEY REMOVED THE GAME FROM STEAM! WOO!\n\n\nTranslated version (Atleast I think it is.)\n优点：相当舒缓的音乐，流利的、绝对没有错误的中文语法，几乎没有占用RAM，这些天可以在几乎所有的电脑玩。\n缺点：这是中文。 我不会说中文，也不会读它。 英语不是一个选项，根据一个小时只是试图改变语言，至少我是这样。 它花费了$ 15，即使它是一个相当简单的RPG游戏。 我很难进入选项去开启全屏，讲真，我没有玩的到游戏本身，因为我没有丝毫线索点击什么地方可以进去游戏。\n如果你是一个冒险的人，喜欢探索游戏的开始菜单，那么不管怎么说！ 去吧，去体验这个游戏吧！\n10/10将再次购买。","timestamp_created":1478990983,"timestamp_updated":1484478739,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":210,"votes_funny":37,"weighted_vote_score":"0.67873847484588623","comment_count":49,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o/700NkCepmtZQ=="}
