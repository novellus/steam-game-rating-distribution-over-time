    about_the_game: 'Congratulations, you''ve just been given command of the galaxy''s
      finest battleship.  Well, it would have been, if it had been completed.  Your
      first mission: find some weapons!<br><br>In XO you must gather the remains of
      humanity, build a fleet, and try to stay ahead of the relentless Harvesters.  Each
      ship you add to your fleet gives you powers but also reduces your dwindling
      resources.  Who will you choose to survive?<br><br>If you keep moving, you might
      just stay ahead.  Yes, you''re going to need that pause button.<br><br>So, how
      will you command in this time of chaos?  By seizing cargo, weapons and ships,
      or through diplomacy and sacrifice?  You decide who lives and who dies, because
      without you, there is no hope for humanity.<br><br>Every game plays different
      based on the command decisions you make.<br><br>Original soundtrack by Jim Guthrie<h2
      class="bb_tag">Gameplay</h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Emerge from jumpspace
      near a planet where you will begin rescuing survivors, scouting ahead, and defending
      against ever-stronger waves of enemies until you judge it is time to evacuate
      the fleet.<br></li><li>Navigate treacherous political scenarios in a time of
      upheaval as the war brings out the best and worst in people.<br></li><li>Choose
      the next planet to jump to based on limited intel, taking into account the resources
      you need, reported enemy strength, and refugees at each possible destination.
      <br></li><li>Spin up the fleet''s jump drives and lead your able ships to the
      next planet.<br></li><li>Resources are automatically gathered, but the ships
      in your fleet influence your gathering rates and capacity -- as do different
      planet types.<br></li><li>Use your resources to upgrade ships, manufacture weapons,
      and make critical repairs.<br></li><li>Hope you have the right ships and enough
      resources when the enemy finally closes in.</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Triage</h2><br>You
      won''t be able to save everyone. As fleet commander, it''s your job to make
      the call: do you save the damaged military destroyer to add more firepower to
      your fleet, the tanker that will extend the fleet''s range, or rescue the farmship
      capable of producing enough food to keep your people alive?<h2 class="bb_tag">Events</h2><br>You''ll
      encounter ships under distress, desperate refugees, greedy merchants, pirates,
      wreckage and caches to loot, shipyards and stations, enemy traps... and much
      more in over 600 hand-crafted events.<h2 class="bb_tag">Politics</h2><br>You
      are faced with a fractured political landscape where five factions squabble
      and fight.  Your actions will have a direct impact on the relations between
      the factions.  Do you try to unite them all, take sides, play them against one
      another or shoot first and ask questions later?<br><br>Each situation you encounter
      will require thoughtful leadership. Demands, urgent calls for help, and interesting
      opportunities will present themselves, often at your most trying moments.<br><br>Faction
      leaders provide you additional political tools including intimidation, diplomacy
      and haggling.<h2 class="bb_tag">Combat, Weapons and Movement</h2><br>The action
      takes place in close orbit around planets.  Ships fly on a 2D plane; inertia
      acts against ships.  Acceleration/deceleration, turn rates and weapon ranges
      make a difference.  Custom formations allow you to make the most of your offensive
      and defensive capabilities.  Warships can be issued Rules of Engagement (ROEs)
      limiting their combat actions.<br><br>There are several types of weapons at
      your disposal, lasers, missiles, mines, shields and the devastating nuke.  <br><br>However,
      one does not enter combat lightly; weapons drain your precious resources and
      can even delay your ability to jump away.<h2 class="bb_tag">Resources</h2><br>Resources
      are plentiful; time, however, is not. In order to keep your fleet going, you''ll
      need water, fuel, and ore. Collection is automatic, but the time it takes to
      collect what you need may require the sacrifice of hundreds of brave souls.
      Wily and creative captains may also find these resources at space stations,
      depots, and aboard abandoned starships.<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>     <strong>Fuel</strong>:
      Easiest to find. Used for nearly everything, from laser weapons and shields
      to the powerful jump drives that fling you between stars.<br></li><li>     <strong>Water</strong>:
      Somewhat common.  Used primarily for factory foodships that feed the fleet.<br></li><li>     <strong>Ore</strong>:
      Slowest to obtain, somewhat rare.  Used for repairs, upgrades, missile-type
      weapons... and bribes.</li></ul><br>Your exodus will take you to many worlds.
      You''ll come across habitable worlds, gas giants, airless rocks, frozen wastelands,
      and hellish molten planets.  Each can be tapped for the precious resources you
      need to survive... provided you have the right ships in your fleet.'

    short_description: XO is a sci-fi real-time-with-pause strategy game inspired
      by FTL. Gather the remains of humanity, build a fleet, and try to stay ahead
      of the relentless Harvesters. Each ship you add to your fleet gives you powers
      but also reduces your dwindling resources. Who will you choose to survive?
