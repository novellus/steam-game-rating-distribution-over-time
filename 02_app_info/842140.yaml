    review: 'A highly enjoyable game. You can tell a lot of love went into this game
      and the developer took feedback and used it when adding new features etc.


      Its been pretty quiet over recent months, so it would be nice to have an update
      from the developer once in a while on what they are now working on.


      The store page really summarises the aim of the game, so I honestly don''t feel
      the need to go into much detail on this review as the info is already available
      to you. Honestly, the game is worth getting, its decent fun, and, after cleaning
      your own cats turds up throughout the day, you can relax in VR and clean up
      some more.


      My only wish is that we could name our kittens what we want, and not have it
      use our steam friends names.'
