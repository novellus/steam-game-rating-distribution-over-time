    review: I've been playing VR games for a few years now and this is absolutely
      one of the most fun VR games I've ever played! The beautiful open-world environment,
      boss battle style play, and tons of additional challenge levels will keep me
      coming back for more. The slingshot weapon is fun but the challenge and satisfaction
      of mastering the old school sling weapon is totally worth it. The sling mechanics
      are incredible! It's also a blast playing with a group, taking turns playing,
      and watching everyone's reactions. DvG is a definite winner and I highly recommended
      it!
