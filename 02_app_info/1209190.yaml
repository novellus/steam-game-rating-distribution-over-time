    review: "The game presents a so far unique environment to work in and puzzle solve,\
      \ with easy to understand controls. But that is where the positives stop. The\
      \ game is, in essence, unplayable. The game offers you very little tutorial,\
      \ never outright showcasing the controls. There are no settings or places to\
      \ see these controls. \n\nThe game is also unplayable because there is no form\
      \ of locomotion or teleportation. If you do not have a play area larger than\
      \ that of each car, you will most likely not be able to complete the puzzles.\
      \ I am unable to even complete the first car because I cannot reach the wall\
      \ opposite of the window. \n\nThe screenshots and videos on the store page show\
      \ an environment and possible story that I would love to explore, and would\
      \ likely be a 4 or 5/5 game. But physically I cannot play it. The game needs\
      \ to be updated with even a simple teleportation system."
