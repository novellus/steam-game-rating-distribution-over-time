    review: 'I sorely wish the game was longer, as I managed to get through it in
      the space of a few hours in my first playthrough. Nonetheless, this game is
      fantastic for those that share a love of history and reading. The period this
      is set in: The Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt and the Great Library at Alexandria-
      is a fascinating time, filled with intrigue, wonder and mayhem. The multiple
      potential endings mean this game has good replay-ability and as someone new
      to this genre of games i look forward to it.

      I do recommend this game to my fellow history buff gamers.

      Praise Zeus-Ammon!'
