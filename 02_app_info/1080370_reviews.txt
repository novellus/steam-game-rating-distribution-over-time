The whole experience is on-rails. The interactions consist of holding a flashlight, holding a gauge meter, and possibly scaring sea horses away. The experience is running on the Unity Engine.\n\nEach dive is supposed to be different and that may be technically true. However, I found that each dive was pretty much the same, with the big difference being that sometimes you saw the hammerhead shark and sometimes you didn't. The visuals are nice, but nothing spectacular (plus it's just a bit foggy). The sounds are pretty dull and uninspired. You can barely hear anything. The game runs fine on my 1060 GTX, at a steady 90 frames per second. \n\nThis game is overpriced for what it is. I can only recommend it for people new to VR or as something that you can easily showcase to friends or family new to VR. This is a pretty short experience that is not intense at all. \n\n[b]Rate 5/10. Completely mediocre.[/b]","timestamp_created":1593485874,"timestamp_updated":1593485874,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.553571403026580811","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtZrKgfMCfN/BkQI="}
