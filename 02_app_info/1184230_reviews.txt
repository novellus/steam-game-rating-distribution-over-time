There's so many issues with this game. First of all, you can only teleport. There is no smooth or snap turning. The game runs horribly on my 1060 GTX. I was getting frame rates anywhere from 90 FPS to 20 FPS. The frame rates were all over the place in this game. \n\nBut that's not all. The AI is horrible. There are so many bugs in this game, I can't even take the time to describe them all. The sounds are pretty awful as well. The same lines keep repeating over and over. \n\nThere are 5 different maps. They each have a different objective. Mostly, you're looking for treasure though. There's one underwater level where you just get moved around underwater and then just open a chest at the end to find your treasure ... a jar. Then the level ends. Seriously. On another level, it was telling me to climb a tree. I still have no idea why I climbed it. It didn't do anything and had nothing to do with finishing the level. Most of the levels you just shoot at dumb AI though. \n\nYou press grab to switch different weapons. It seems like you can just stand there like an idiot and take lots of damage. It doesn't seem to matter because I don't know if you can die. And your helicopter pilot's name is Bunny. Bunny is the second best thing, next to all the particle effects from the explosions which do look cool. It may also be the reason why the game runs so poorly.\n\nThere's not a lot of content. I think you can finish the game in 30-40 minutes ... if you can get past all the bugs. \n\n[b]Rate 3/10. It's really bad. It's so bad that even $5 feels like they are over-charging. Too late for me to refund my $4 USD though (sale price). At least I had a good laugh at how bad this game is. I'll always remember my helicopter ride with Bunny and shooting a wolf and see it keel over while howling.[/b]","timestamp_created":1583020291,"timestamp_updated":1583020291,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.602057278156280518","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u5bXyfACe+yw9QE="}
