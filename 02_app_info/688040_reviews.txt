The artbook perfectly shows off the process on how these stunning and creepy locations, weapons, fiends, and classmates were created. The artbook shows early versions of fiends like the slasher and giant, weapons that were planned and designed, classmate outfits and skins, and the beautifully terrifying locations which these classmates are doomed to roam. I recommend this for those who have Last Year The Nightmare and want to see the process on how this beautiful game was made.","timestamp_created":1609815591,"timestamp_updated":1609815591,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hZGf6PYCfOPKwAI="}
