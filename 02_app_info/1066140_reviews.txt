It's impossible to proceed through the game without a detailed walkthrough, especially if you want all of the achievements. The story is just Texas Chainsaw Massacre with less steps and nothing added. But it's pretty at least. Really not a fun game though.","timestamp_created":1605222675,"timestamp_updated":1605222675,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o8au3/UCfK+CrgI="}
