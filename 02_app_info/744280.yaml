    review: 'It''s another cheap 2D Shoot ''em up game but not worth pay 99 cents
      for. Level design is uninspiring. Enemies move too fast and their attack patterns
      are too fast to memorize. And the controls feel broken especially with the default
      key settings. No extra lives and no continues. I Can''t get past the 1st stage.
      Weapon power ups are disappointing and the music is not the worst I''ve heard
      but compared to games like Zed Blade and Gradius, it''s nowhere near the level
      of those 2. And in terms of challenge, it doesn''t come as close to games like
      Radiant Silvergun or Ikaruga.  My final rating for AF-Zero is a 4.75 out of
      10.


      If you REALLY want a good 2D Shooter here, Try Raiden III or Raptor: Call of
      the Shadows. Or for consoles, try R-Type Dimensions on Xbox 360, PS4 & Nintendo
      Switch, Galaga on any device, or Star Soldier: Vanishing Earth for the Nintendo
