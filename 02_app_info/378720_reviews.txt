Also expect to get beaten around several times, and have some occasional painful restarts.  I think a great description of this game is the first few turns of Civilization, where the world is in fog and everything is more dangerous than your technology level can handle.  I love it. \nGradually you'll grind for better materials to craft into better weapons and equipment, grind for better equipment drops, and eventually build a team of warriors who can overcome more powerful opponents than you had ever though possible.  There is also a surprising amount of depth to the combat options.\n\nThe combat mechanics were a bit confusing at first, without a foundation of deck battles.  The tutorial wasn't enough, I had to YouTube a couple battles.  After that, no looking back and I've got hundreds of hours in it now.","timestamp_created":1609766695,"timestamp_updated":1609766695,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hc7k5vYCfs6xwAI="}
