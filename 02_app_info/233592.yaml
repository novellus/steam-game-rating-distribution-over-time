    review: "This dlc adds a lot of loot for your heroes (33 new items). \nDo you\
      \ really need all that loot? No. It Isn't a game changer in any way.\n\nBut\
      \ if you play the game a lot it gives your heroes more diversity and that's\
      \ always a nice thing in this kind of games."
