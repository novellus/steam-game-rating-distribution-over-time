It has quite a few new game mechanics and the well-constructed levels gradually ramp up to an intermediate level of difficulty. One minor quibble I have is the \"star\" system, and how it dings you a star if you accidentally place a tile in the wrong slot as you're solving. It just doesn't add much to the game. The game is very polished and relaxing.\n\nImportant note (maybe a spoiler?): The final level (\"D\") will drive you insane unless you realize that the puzzle has multiple solutions, and only one of them is recognized by the game.","timestamp_created":1608103030,"timestamp_updated":1608103030,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz52atfYCe7TRugI="}
