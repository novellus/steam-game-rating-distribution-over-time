    developer_response: Indeed there is no snap turning for the moment. Deeply sorry
      about that. It's an old game and I am working on something else. BUT I am not
      done with the game. I really want to update it with snap turning and simpler
      puzzles. I will keep you posted.

    review: game starts up and I can tell I will like it, now the but,I cant snap
      turn, I think ok I give it a try and deal with my cable rapping around me but
      thats no good, I am now trying to work out the order of doors, unfortunately
      its stressing me out,not the puzzle it self even though I haven't worked it
      out yet, my neck hurts and my brain and I loose the will to carry on, just finished
      the room VR and loved it, Im quiet happy to play a game with teleport but no
      snap turn just makes it to much of a pain, same as seem like a good game. Oculus
      Rift S im using.
