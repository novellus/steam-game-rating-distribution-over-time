Actually, who am I kidding, there is no long story, the whole game is just few minutes long. \n\nThe whole content of this game (this term is used generously) is an idol group consisting of anime girls standing in front of you and singing one song (that's the good part) and you playing a wannabe rhythm game (that's the worse part). Actually, I'd prefer this without having to play the clunky game and instead just watch the performance in peace.\n\nOveral, this would be okay as a tech demo or a free game, but as something you have to pay for it just doesn't hold up. It's not offensively bad, but it's just not good. 4/10","timestamp_created":1577318693,"timestamp_updated":1577318693,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570707082748413086","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iKfhn+8CcPCB5wE="}
