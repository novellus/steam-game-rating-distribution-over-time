The game is dying, the devs don't know what to do. Simple, make it pve focused again. If they don't want to, ok. Game is dead.\n\nAn MMORPG PvE game based at it's core...however.\n\nDoing dungeons are one of the main sources for getting gold and gear. Gear however is on a certain %. Recently their update has a new class. with that came new items and the % from dungeons has been reduced. Before the update the chances was 1/2/5% from a certain levels of that specific dungeon. Now they're halved in %, making them twice as hard.  Losing doesnt reward you with anything as well, though you will be assigned with someone else during dungeon/raids.\n\nPVP:\nFor a PvE game at it's core, the game is more rewarding through PvP. This isnt the most friendly way to obtain items/gold as the chances to be to be in an entire CC CHAIN is high. As a result from most likely vsing people with a high playtime and skill level than you. They do have a feature now to break out of the CC Chain, however it ends up being a 50-50 to be locked into another chain, only this time your break out of chain cc is on a cooldown.\n\nCosmetics, high price ofc. The game is still fairly new, it's their main source of keeping the game alive. \n\nAre the DLCs worth buying? \nA: They provide you with a new class, new weapons and a short campaign. For the price it's worth, it really depends on your currency. (For me looking back at it, it wasnt worth it. It costed $15 for me)\n\nScore Update\n\nGameplay (Animation, Cutscenes etc) - N/A ( Removed)\nMusic - 4/10\nCharacters - 6/10\nDialogue - N/A (Removed)\nStory (Quests/Campaign)- 5/10\nControls - 5/10\nArt (Colours) - 9/10\nLoot (Drops)- 1/10\n\nOverall: 4/10\n\n\nFurthermore, from my experience I don't recommend. Extremely grindy start to finish. If you want to look 'amazing' check your wallet for the money. If you want to keep up with the game but are not ready to play, I advise sticking to Youtube. I really dont understand why have so many items to makem WHICH REQUIRE an insane amount of drops...when the drops are just absolutely non-existent.","timestamp_created":1575733066,"timestamp_updated":1604386591,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4kZK5xvUCcM7Z4gE="}
