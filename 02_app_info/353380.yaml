    review: 'Plug and play. Really happy that I bought it. No cabels from pc to tv.
      It works well. I have sometimes frame drops, but you need to set up priority
      in your wi-fi router for smoother stream.

      I recommend 5GHz wifi and everything will be okey.

      Today I got this as a part of Samsung TV (steam aplication), totaly perfect.'
