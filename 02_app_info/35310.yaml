    review: 'Some things better stay in the past...

      Now I sure do love me some oldies from the early days, don''t get me wrong,
      but even the nostalgia factor can''t defeat the fact these kind of games don''t
      live up to modern standarts.

      Clutch (also known as Armageddon Riders) is an arcade racing wannabe with a
      strong Carmageddon vibes all over it. Although it''s simplistic nature - you
      race around collecting colored upgrades for money, nitro and even weapons, smash''n''drive
      through plethora of brainless zedies and finishing pretty simple racing missions
      a-la NFSU2 (even open world reminisce the latter) - it can''t offer much more.
      As soon as you play Clutch for an hour and grind for car upgrades you eventually
      end up bored with obesity and monotonous nature of this game. Everything it
      tries to do Carmageddon did it much better.

      And I know Clutch was made by a russian developer team back in 2009 (had been
      playing it then for some bizarre period of time). But even then you could find
      other mindless racing titles a-like (Zombie Driver, DIPRIP or even Carmageddon
      TDR2000) and it would be more fun.

      The music is another subject I want to point out: it''s trash. As far as I remember
      I was playing the game with it tuned off, better off launch Winamp or some other
      player that you have with your own choice of tunes.

      P.S.: the game doesn''t support Dualshock 4 natively even after installing DS4Win
      or changing Steam Controller Layout so the gamepad could be used as an Xbox
      ones - it only imitates keyboard usage.'
