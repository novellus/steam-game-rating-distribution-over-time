Overall I did enjoy the 15-30 minutes I did play it and I think it would fun as a first game, VR demostration, for new VR players. Although for return play value I believe there should be something like more waves, different game modes, different scenarios, etc.  An issue I had was I could not get the smash with the grip buttons to work. I think a better tutorial with images or video than just text would help with that. Overall for 99 cents this not a bad deal and I hope there will be future improvements to this game.
