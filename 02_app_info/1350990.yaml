    review: '16 cover art characters.


      Cover art characters are usually good, just like MV. Infact, it''s what default
      asset should be.

      The art style is kinda different from default asset though, so it will looks
      weird if used along with default one.


      The only reason you bought this for serious project is only for the music license
      and character design license.

      Problem is.. In this DLC there''s only 6 character music theme, it means there''s
      10 characters doesn''t have their music theme.'
