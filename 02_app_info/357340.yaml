    review: "By far the best combat game I've played, and the most underrated game\
      \ I've played. This game is better than almost anything I've experienced and\
      \ I have no clue why it's so underrated.\n\nSeriously, it throws almost all\
      \ the flaws of other combat games out of the window, making strategy a big part\
      \ of the game. \n\nForget having to react quickly, cobalt lets you slow down\
      \ time and kick a grenade back into your enemy's face if you know what to do,\
      \ or smack an unsuspecting predator mech with a chrono rod a billion times to\
      \ slow it down, then fire a storm of bullets at it... or even fire a bullet\
      \ at a bouncy pad to redirect it back up to a plug to hit it exactly the right\
      \ way so that it will bounce into the goal...\n\n(of course, stuff like time\
      \ dilation and available weapons can be messed around with and changed based\
      \ on your preferences)\n\nOh, and there's tons of maps. Not all of them are\
      \ masterpieces but some of them are total classics. Not to mention the giant\
      \ list of community-made maps and the pretty easy-to-learn level editor.\n\n\
      \nSeriously, every single time I fire up this game and play a survival match,\
      \ a combat challenge, or whatever it is, crazy things happen that would never\
      \ be experienced in any other combat game.\n\nThe soundtrack is also a banger.\n\
      \n\nThe only cons I could think of were:\n\n- Barely anyone in the online servers\
      \ (playing with friends via remote play or locally is more fun anyway)\n\n-\
      \ Local profiles are a little bit buggy and sometimes copy names\n\nTL;DR Best\
      \ combat game I've played so far, extremely underrated. Get a friend or two\
      \ and do remote play, you won't regret it. Just don't try to find online matches"
