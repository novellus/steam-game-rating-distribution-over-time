    review: "How to sum up this game quickly.\n\nhave you ever bought a thing, and\
      \ that thing was great but you used it so much you wore it out/broke it? That's\
      \ FTL\n\nSo then you go out and buy a new one, from a slightly different company.\
      \ \nIt's the same price, looks the same, feels the same, but it breaks worse\
      \ then the first one did after the fifth or sixth use? That's Starship Inspector.\n\
      \nIn truth, it has a lot of promise, but still needs some work. \nShielding\
      \ needs to shield. \nThe price of some of the early upgrades need to drop.\n\
      Fire needs to not spread weirdly fast in an all metal vessel.\nThe UI for shops\
      \ basically needs an overhaul, don't make me 'check out' stuff just let me hit\
      \ the stuff and do it and go.\nThe quests probably need some fleshing out but\
      \ the game is early access.\nThere needs to be a clear UI on the map for quests\
      \ and the like."
