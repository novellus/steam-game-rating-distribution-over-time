      /><br><br>FIREWORKS MANIA is an explosive simulator game where you can play
      around with fireworks.<br>In various low-poly environments you can go nuts with
      all the fireworks you want. <br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1079260/extras/ShowOfFireworks.gif?t=1608471519"
      /><br><br>Eventhough the game is created to be a casual game where players just
      have fun for a short while, the game can easily entertain creative players for
      hours, as they setup a firework show or explore the environments in the hunt
      for things to blow up.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1079260/extras/MessengerInTheHouse.gif?t=1608471519"
      /><br><br>Not two play-sessions are the same, as the game is heavily physics
      based, resulting a different outcome every time. This often leads to fun moments,
      when things are not going as planned.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1079260/extras/HouseExplosion.gif?t=1608471519"
