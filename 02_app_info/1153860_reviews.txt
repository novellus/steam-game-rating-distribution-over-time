There is no way to reset the floor within the game. Resetting the view from the Oculus menu does nothing. Other VR games have the floor in the right place, with the user standing on it, not below it. Hopefully an update fixes the problem or at least adds the ability to reset the floor within the game. As it stands now I cannot recommend it.","timestamp_created":1575165096,"timestamp_updated":1575165096,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhP7J3+4CcLi04AE="}
