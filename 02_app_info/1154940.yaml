      You Be?</h2></h2><br>Manage your team as a fair (or ruthless) football manager
      and swipe your fingers either left or right to impose your will upon the team.
      With this tongue-in-cheek football management game you must navigate the seemingly
      never-ending stream of problems and demands from the people around you - coaches,
      players, the press, the board of directors, your family and many more. Keep
      them all happy or disaster awaits, and keep your players well trained to secure
      wins each week and earn your place at the top of the league table.<br><br>As
      the season progresses your decisions become ever more important so think ahead
      to avoid being ousted early from your job. Everybody needs a piece of you, everybody
      needs to get paid and some just want to bring you down into the relegation zone
      or, worse, to the unemployment lines. With over 60 ways to get fired (or worse)
      can you handle the stress and navigate your motley crew of spoiled superstars
      to victory?
