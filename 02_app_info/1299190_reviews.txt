Can't really get enough of it for some odd reason. This DLC, on the other hand, is a let down:\n\nIn the first screenshot you see the three mercs that come in this dlc. This was an easy purchase because the screenshot displays a legendary quality Lili and a legendary quality Moss. You do not receive a legendary quality Lili. You do not receive a legendary quality Moss. I wonder if it would be possible to retroactively fix this mistake? It would be nice to receive what I was led to believe I would be paying for.\n\n","timestamp_created":1598631398,"timestamp_updated":1598631398,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561572551727294922","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwp+n2mvQCf/erngI="}
