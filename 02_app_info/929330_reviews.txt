I played it a bit yesterday evening. It's definitely more challenging than PvZ lol. Have a lot of fun playing the game, also i really like the change up in level 4. The game says: \"A huge wave coming, Pay your attention.\"  you probably mean --> A huge wave is coming, pay attention. An annoying thing is when enemies get passed the archer you can't shoot them anymore it would be cool if they would turn around and atleast try shooting? don't know if plant vs zombies fixed this but should be an easy thing to give a try maybe? Anyway goodwork!","timestamp_created":1539842520,"timestamp_updated":1539842520,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvIbxwuYCdOjwrAE="}
