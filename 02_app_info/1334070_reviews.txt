Effort can be seen in the game made by developers but they need to fix some bugs and dropping frames especially in the forest and sometimes the character cant climb a slope, he gets stuck lol. Overall I enjoyed the game but price of this game could have been lower as the game looks still in development. Heres my gameplay for this game.","timestamp_created":1599615202,"timestamp_updated":1609361141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.5","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40MXZ2vYCe5fXoAI="}
