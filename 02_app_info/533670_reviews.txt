This means it's written in script format, not novelised and certainly not 'a movie' as a friend of mine assumed haha.\nThat aside, I am more than happy to purchase this to say thanks to the Brotherhood for the fun I got from the game.\nNice to have the backgrounds, but I have to confess, I was hoping for a little more...
