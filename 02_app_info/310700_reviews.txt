It's a nostalgic trip back in several ways, where you would play in front an old CRT screen and its glow during the night. The presentation and control set complement this quite well, keeping things simple but still engaging. Now granted, if you're expecting a NES hard platformer, Super Win is not the game for you, as the difficulty is a bit on the easier side in most cases. Sure, once in a while you'd get a difficult section, but this is more of a walk in the park to remember the old days then a controller throwing affair. The soundtrack is a good mixture of the old 8 bit classics, and its clear that the developer remembers those days fondly. For me, it's the perfect sale title: while you won't be blown away by any one of the game's elements, it's solid across the board, and a mostly relaxing experience. A good sale title. \n\n[b]Video Review: [/b]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X42Xsth7QKc\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Captures the nostalgia and retro feelings of sitting in front of CRT TV. The graphics may look “bad”, but it's used to capture the era of the games its trying to represent, and it succeeds. \n[*] Catchy 8 bit sound track. \n[*] Despite the title, smart level design and gameplay that takes you back to the era of the NES. \n[*] Controls work for the most part. They are designed with precision in mind, but not being too flexible. It will punish mistakes, which I want.\n[*] Powers and the overworld allow you some good flexibility in terms of your adventure. Good mixture of difficult and easy gem gathering, and that sweet spot where an item that you got would make it easier, but you can get the gem if you use your skills.\n[*] Good variety of hazards put together in different ways.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*]  KO punch. There's no oompf in the end, nothing that knocks you out. It's solid in a lot of ways, but nothing that screams “you have to play this”. \n[*] While you can go to the fortune teller at any time to get a hint, there's a lack of direction as a whole that can get annoying. \n[*] The ice in the ice levels needed to effect you more. If you're attempting to go for slippery, this wasn't it. \n[*] Wanted more difficulty in several ways. It didn't capture the NES hard. \n[/list]\n \n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.
