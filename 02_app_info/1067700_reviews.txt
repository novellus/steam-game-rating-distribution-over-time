Only buy if it's half price or you want to play through a very rudimentary Minecraft clone.\n\nIn just 20-30 minutes (using a controller):\n\n1) Can't invert the Y-axis view - that makes it almost impossible for me to play. \n2) You can't tell what anything is, there are no tooltips for things in your inventory and no indication of what you're looking at.\n3) Basically I figured out how to dig up the ground but that was the only thing I could figure out how to do other than wander around (looking up when I meant to look down :) ).\n\nOn a positive note, the graphics are nice and this may be the foundation for a good game. But in my opinion, they've made it public too soon. If nothing else, they need to provide some rudimentary quality of life upgrades ASAP.\n\nI'll revisit the game in a few months and hopefully I'll be changing my review when I do!","timestamp_created":1587604668,"timestamp_updated":1587604668,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.566848218441009521","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw5pen0vECcO7oggI="}
