    developer_response: 'Hi loof.


      Thanks for leaving a review.


      We put out a new update yesterday, which includes some tweaks and performance
      fixes. We''re also still constantly updating the game on all formats.


      Spaceteam VR isn''t directly related to the mobile app (different developer),
      which is why our local mobile connectivity uses the free browser client instead.
      The mobile connectivity was added as a way for people to play a game locally,
      with many households only having 1 VR headset. However, the game is primarily
      designed to be played between players on VR platforms.


      We do have some more updates coming in the early new year which will offer greater
      platform support and even more ways to play with your friends and family.'

    review: 'It''s a super cool concept but not especially well implemented. Playing
      with people on their phones is a cool idea but it uses a browser instead of
      the Spaceteam app which was disappointment #1. Some of the phone players weren''t
      able to see all their controls.  We also had trouble getting games to start
      and often had phone users get dropped out of the game or spawn on top of a VR
      player causing them to have two sets of controls. Maybe it''ll be better after
      a few more updates.'
