I did find it moderately entertaining but, this is a game that if I were rating with stars I'd probably only give 3.  STEAM only allows me to recommend or not and as is this game barely makes the recommended list.  However, if you love Point & Clicks and get this on sale it's worth trying, I just don't see too many people falling in love with it and revisiting it for subsequent playthroughs.\n\nThe graphics are fine for a retro style game like this.  They are quite pixelated and often more simplistic.  It's interesting to see some of their more simple artwork paired with their more complex artwork.  They put like a lit of detail into the beanstalk for example.  It doesn't look quite as good as the pictures here look when full screen on a typical monitor setup. \n If you are a fan of 80s-90s P&C's you'll probably find the artwork and style nostalgic.  If you aren't into that... well, you probably won't enjoy it as much.  I will say that the animations are well done for example when Alfred climbs up from something it's surprisingly detailed for an animation.  The walk paths are pretty good too.\n\nThe story is ... okay.  The premise of traveling through stories (Tales) is actually something I find interesting but, the story here is perhaps a little too juvenile and underdeveloped.  The writing is off in my opinion.  You're traveling through stories like Gilgamesh or Ancient Greek myths and the characters call you dude and say things like \"hey, man\".  The vernacular is just really out of place and out of character for many of the characters portrayed.  The stories aren't woven together or anything so they just tell a tiny portion of the original stories.  You go into a story to get one or two things by completing some small part of the story then pop back out to go to another story.  The overall arc of saving human knowledge and stories from Oblivion is the only thing tying them together and the connection feels a little weak.\n\nThe background music for the game is pretty decent.  I wouldn't be looking to play the soundtrack separately but, it matches most of the game well.  The voices were well recorded for the most part and are consistent in sound quality but the voice acting... well, it leaves something to be desired.  Though there's characters from the Middle East, Europe, Mayan South America, etc... most of the characters re voiced with very white American accents which doesn't lend to the feeling of being transported to the lands of these tales.  One odd example is the Mayan woman who sounds Irish.  The voices in that sense are just not right for most of the characters in my opinion.\n\nThe interface for the game is actually pretty simple.  You can right click to look at something and left click to interact with it.  The inventory is accessed by mousing over top of the screen.  My biggest pet peeve is the inventory though.  In the game you travel into and out of several stories but you can only take one item out of the story at a time using a magic bag you get shortly you begin playing.  I hated having to remember where dozens of items were and going back and grabbing one item and transporting it into a new are.  Why couldn't you just have your inventory be a magical bag and let it hold everything you want to collect?  Other than that the system seemed to work fine.\n\nThe puzzles in this game were actually a little challenging... well most of them.  Not just the puzzle, puzzles but, the using inventory items to complete story progression type puzzles too.  The advice given is often too vague and some solutions are not very logical to me as to how you would arrive at that conclusion.  This was actually a little more challenging than I find most P&C games to be.  I don't know if I'd call any of them \"moon logic\" but with little direction on what needs to happen you often spend a lot of wasted time just trying random items.  Sometimes the action/discussion needs to be repeated in order to move forward but, it doesn't make it obvious that that is what is required.  I did have to use more hints on this game than I usually do.  The puzzle, puzzles are a little difficult to figure out on first try (if your going for the related achievement be sure to save before the puzzle then fiddle around with it and reload your game to use your solution and get credit towards the achievement).  They often require some effort to figure out.\n\nThe game does have a fair amount of achievements.  Many are story unlocked, several require solving puzzles on the first try, and a few are for extra things such as exhausting all chat dialogues, looking at everything, not asking Merlin for extra advice, etc...  I got all but four on my first playthrough.  I think it might be near impossible to get them all in one playthrough but you should be able to do it in 2.  There is one for completing the game without autosave or save games.  This would be extremely difficult on a first play.  Apparently a second run through theoretically takes around 45 minutes(I've not yet tested that) which wouldn't be too bad.  However, that's if you speed through dialogue and cutscenes.  If you missed the chatty achievement (don't know how since I thought I talked to everyone a lot exhausting all options) then you'll probably have to take longer.\n\nI played through in about 11 hours though I'm not sure that's accurate as I had some performance issues with the game freezing and crashing.  It happened quite frequently actually which is one of the reasons I rate this game a little lower.  I believe that 10-12 hours is probably pretty accurate. That makes it about $0.67-$0.79/hr of gameplay.  I don't think it has much replay ability but, that's a pretty decent price point even at full price.  I do however recommend waiting for a sale.","timestamp_created":1606991625,"timestamp_updated":1606991625,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.604350447654724121","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sseKlPYCcaj7tgI="}
