As a fan of monsters, I love their design.\nI'm not too good at these kinda games, and still need to practice more, but I'm enjoying it a lot; it's very fun and quite difficult. I recommend it to anyone who's looking for a challenge. :)\nI've also encountered no bugs so far, and that's a huge plus.","timestamp_created":1594323296,"timestamp_updated":1594323296,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526252508163452148","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw8NvEmvMCduqQlAI="}
