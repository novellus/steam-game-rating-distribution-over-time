    review: "Unlike some of the longer games from this developer, the sea eternal\
      \ is a more linear and focused story. \nThere is still room for character development\
      \ however, and this development is perfectly matched with it's themes of alienation\
      \ and marginalisation. These can be heavy and upsetting topics, but the game\
      \ is never unkind, it doesn't revel in oppression like a lot of other games\
      \ that try to approach the same topic. Most of the people living in this world\
      \ aren't overtly bigoted, they aren't trying to hurt other people, they just\
      \ make mistakes. This seems to be the main problem for a lot of readers who\
      \ didn't enjoy the game, they want to play as the overt bigot, but that is not\
      \ what the game is about.\n\nThe world building is another strong point, it's\
      \ an interesting and honestly horrifying setting, and another example of how\
      \ careful the writing can be.\n\nThe stat system, however, can feel kind of\
      \ finicky at times, but I do appreciate some of the ideas behind it. Alot of\
      \ the options that require you to have a certain number are usually pretty lenient,\
      \ but even with that it can be hard to go for what you want. Maybe that's a\
      \ more a reflection of my personal choices in game however.\n\nSpeaking personally\
      \ most depictions of trans people in games only manages to remind me of the\
      \ general background anxiety that is almost always there, but this game actually\
      \ felt very reassuring. I think that's worth celebrating on it's own, even if\
      \ you don't believe that this is particularly special writing otherwise.\n\n\
      Closing thoughts: The game is very sweet. It does what it tries to do well,\
      \ and if that's a serious problem for you, it's not the fault of the author."
