Supporting the developers is just gud.\nEspecially when the base game is so cheap.\nAnd even this soundtrack is kind of cheap.\nIt doesn't cost much to own all the DLC's.\nAnd that's why I decided to buy them all.\nReigns is a great game and it deserves it.\nThe music is enjoyable and that's great.\nI have to give it a huge positive review.","timestamp_created":1609076405,"timestamp_updated":1609076405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.458265155553817749","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sK6b0vYCf67gvQI="}
