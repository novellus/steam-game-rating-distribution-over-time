Many seem related to user error. \n\nHere's a tip for people stuck on 1-player: After you click \"Play online\" and before you click \"Start\" use the little arrow above your user photo in the middle of the screen to change the game setting from \"1 Player: The Automa\" to however many you want. Now others can join.\n\nI've played the physical game of Wingspan many times and this is a great digital version. We played through a full 4-player online game, while teaching 2 totally new players, without a single issue. Worked great. Big thumbs up. Great value for $5 or whatever.","timestamp_created":1609896570,"timestamp_updated":1609909322,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkdiE6/YCfvbvwAI="}
