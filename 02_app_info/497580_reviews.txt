Just from looking at the title, I had assumed that the game was about a secret agent going around in modern times to try and solve a mystery, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this took place during WWII.  \n\nThe game follows Agent Walker as she goes around trying to find a particular magical item that could change the course of the war.  Of course the Axis is there, trying to get the Spear from you at every turn in the game, but then again, if they weren't there, there would be no opposing force to get it from you.\n\nI really enjoyed how the setting took place during this time period, and how each of the settings were incorporated into each other, like the magical cave in the beginning was hidden away near a mineshaft.  All the artwork and the designs were done beautifully and it is easy to tell a lot of time went into making them.  The environments and settings were broken up into different sections, and there would be sections to the game where you can't back track.  It would make it much easier to focus on just a few different areas instead of a plethora of places you can backtrack to and keep track of. \n\nOf course that meant that you had to be vigilant about the collectibles in the game since there would be parts you couldn't return to, but it made it all the more worthwhile to get them all.  I really enjoyed how there were figurines, items like the boats and the airplanes you could collect, and you could find different pieces to the actual uniforms.  That made it very unique, and I actually really enjoyed getting to see what each uniform looked like when they were completed.  \n\nThe actual Hidden Object games also had variations as well.  Like in the beginning, the first Hidden Object game had you click items to gather crystals to get the Spear, but sometimes it would have you collect pieces of a puzzle or something similar.  The variation definitely helped to make things seem less monotonous, and added a bit more to the plot and the difference in setting.  \n\nThe ending to the game was definitely surprising.  Everything went well and the mission was completed, but this is the first time I have ever come across a game where the main character's safety wasn't guaranteed, and it is implied that she had given her life to destroy this item.  Given the time period, it is very likely to have happened, and made this much more different than other games since most games end on a happy note with all the characters surviving.\n\nOverall, it is a very good game and I would recommend playing it.  Well worth the price you pay for it.","timestamp_created":1609480299,"timestamp_updated":1609480299,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4n4yg3vYCfO+nvwI="}
