Quite an interesting match that really holds. The game itself is more of a book. Generally you read. There are some choices and they are meaningful ones but they are really rare in comparison to the development of the story. I think the use of communication technologies as a way to create narration through spekaing in chat in this visual novel was a good idea. It gave at start necessary ignition for the story to unravel. After that there were many unnecessary repetitions of the same phrases and questions. It made just the novel more lenghty. \n\nAs to the philosophical themes - they are basic. It is not a critique, rather a statement because I have decided to play this game mostly because I am interested in the relation between different worlds mediated through technology and searching different media to check how this problem is addressed. So although there are no new ideas here I found the world convincing and interesting when it comes to showing different aspects of technology. There is potential here so extenting the ontology of this world would be interesting as a subject. The ideas are basic but there are so much ways they could be extented! As as story it was nice. I haven't got new ideas concerning subjects that I am interested in but it was a good effort on the writer to try to create convincing relations between the worlds without being to rationalistic on one hand and on the other to dependant on fantasy cliches. Good basic philosophical themes (of course from my perspective). Many questions were unanswered like for example what happens to the bodies of people (I won't say more to not spoil the plot or at least one of possible plots). The novel has it's emotional moments but mostly it was done through rational discussion! I really liked it. Even if that for some people could be considered boring, for me personally was a quite interesting way in incorporating arguments. Generally, people in \"Reality\" are communicating by giving reasons for their decisions, behaviors and they are thinking. So if somone is looking for a tearjerker then it's not the right place. It had interesting feel because all of the characters were really concious about themselves and this made the repetetiveness of some of the material more endurable. \n\nAlthough I haven't checked all the endings I would say that the story revolves around 0 and 1 choices. It is not niuanced but this is good. You choose to this or that. The game is very straightforward in that regard. And they are relatively rare. You read, read and read. The animations are rare too - rather few images portraying different emotions and some animations that are placed in key moments of the plot but generally they are rare. So generally if you are not concerned that much with moving pictures, animations and could accept the slow pace of the plot here, then the game is worth the try. \n\nI would seriously consider a continuation if some in-world issues were extended, especially the relation between different worlds and some other things that I won't spoil.","timestamp_created":1609803832,"timestamp_updated":1609803832,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrKPy5/YCdOzFwAI="}
