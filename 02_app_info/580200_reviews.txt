The story is nice, but it's pretty short and simple; although that's a given as Yonder is aimed at a younger audience. For the first 2-3 days of buying it I played it for hours on end - it's addictive. The crafting system is excellent and is properly balanced. You can even get around crafting - to a degree - and just buy items from traders. Fishing was done well and is actually fun to do. Achievement hunting is one of the best parts, but that's all that keeps you playing after completing the story as there isn't much else to do at that point. The world is decently sized, though I feel it could have done with at least 2 more zones. All in all, you can tell that there was a lot of love put into this wholesome game, and it's well worth the price. Definitely worth picking up if you want chill vibes and enjoy crafting games.\n\n\nPros:\n+ Cute & simple\n+ Easy to pick up & put down\n+ Fun to explore & find hidden chests\n+ Good stylised graphics & generally runs well\n+ Nice story, great for kids\n+ Actually balanced crafting & fishing\n+ 2 forms of fast travel: sage stones & traveller's knots\n\nCons:\n+ Story is pretty short, not much to do afterwards\n+ World could be bigger\n+ Only experienced lag after fast travelling around the map a bunch in a row - restarting the game fixes that","timestamp_created":1610079138,"timestamp_updated":1610079138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjb6M8PYCc+q5wQI="}
