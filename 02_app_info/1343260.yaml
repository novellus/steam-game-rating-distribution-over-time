      puzzle.<br><br>There are no spoken lines or written dialogue in the game: Everything
      is communicated through speech bubbles, symbols and emotions.'

    reviews: "\u201CThe developers have intertwined the symbology beautifully, allowing\
      \ gamers to interpret the story differently.[...] The dreaming about eating\
      \ an ice cream cone and knowing what this dream can be interpreted as meaning\
      \ further shows the developers brilliance that brings this game to life. Two\
      \ thumbs up from me to the developers for adding that extra layer to this game\
      \ other than relying on what could just be the rote action of solving a bunch\
      \ of puzzles.\u201D<br>9/10 \u2013 <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.hookedgamers.com/pc/i_dream_of_you_and_ice_cream/review/article-2164.html\"\
