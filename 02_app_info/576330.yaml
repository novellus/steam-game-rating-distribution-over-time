    review: "In its current state, I would not recommend this game - BUT I have very\
      \ VERY high hopes for it when it is completed. \n\nI downloaded the free demo,\
      \ and it took 3 attempts to get the game to even load because it kept freezing\
      \ on a dodgy looking splash screen, but I was determined to try it.\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\
      The graphics are on the verge of being quite good for an equine game when you\
      \ are stood still, but when you are moving everything blurs an a way that caused\
      \ me to feel nauseous after a while, which is a darn shame. The horses look\
      \ pretty decent, probably the best constructed bit in the game, though on close\
      \ inspection the fur texture looks a little more like chipped stone in certain\
      \ light. The environments were actually not too bad either, though there are\
      \ some inconsistencies in style and quality. - But again, still better than\
      \ some horse games.\n\nYou are able to change the graphics settings between\
      \ Low, Medium, and High. These seem to just alter how much shadow everything\
      \ has. \n\nSTORYTELLING:\nThe quests and story line seem okay at the moment,\
      \ though talking to people can be a little difficult. The game actually would\
      \ not let me speak to Stephen at one point when he was the main quest. I had\
      \ to restart the game and he generated at his house, not the paddock where he\
      \ was supposed to be, but it finally let me talk to him.The text boxes look\
      \ like place holders, I hope they will be updated for the full game as it is\
      \ hard to read at times, with some typos. But to be honest it is nice to see\
      \ a horse game incorporate quests beyond \"win this comp, brush, feed, go to\
      \ bed\" so I do still like that they have tried to make a story!\n\nCONTROLS:\n\
      These are not the easiest controls to use and get used to. I did experience\
      \ some trouble with them, and at times if I was too near something else, certain\
      \ controls wouldn't work. I feel like they are a bit all over the place, using\
      \ the mouse, arrows AND other keys. The method could do with being tightened\
      \ or allow the user to define their controls? My horse also ran off at one point\
      \ when I was chattin' trade with the mayor and I had to wander around the town\
      \ to find it and had to literally chase it down when it was running about like\
      \ a lunatic. Could have done with a map or option to call your last ridden horse?\
      \ Or perhaps clear instructions on how to tether it somewhere even?\n\nPLAY-ABILITY:\n\
      It is ALMOST playable. I had a lot of trouble with objects phasing through walls,\
      \ things disappearing, characters being inaccessible to talk too when I needed\
      \ to, and after a while the nausea was a bit too much and I had to stop from\
      \ that and frustration with the bugs (and I hasten to add I do not normally\
      \ experience motion sickness when playing games, it is rare) What I will say\
      \ is that they have included a feature that allows you to debug your character\
      \ if you get stuck anywhere.\n\nSUMMARY:\nI am 100% behind this game. I want\
      \ it finished, because it's got SO MUCH potential to be a seriously well rounded\
      \ horse game. (The market is desperately lacking in one that ticks even most\
      \ of the boxes for me) but in its current state I simply can't recommend it\
      \ and I'm glad I got the demo first! When it's finished though or even updated\
      \ further, I can guarantee I'll want to give it another good go because it really,\
      \ really does have so much potential and I can't fault them for what they are\
      \ trying to accomplish. An open environment, story-driven, horse game with decent\
      \ graphics, characters, quests and building application alongside riding horses\
      \ and caring for them? You just don't get that in horse games. Last thing close\
      \ to this I've seen is the old Pippa Funnell games, some of which don't even\
      \ run on Windows 10 they are that old now. \n\nIf you are stuck for something\
      \ in the meantime while we wait for this to be completed I'd recommend \"My\
      \ Riding Stables: Life with Horses\". It doesn't really have any story but it\
      \ is surprisingly addictive. That being said, PLEASE, PLEASE FINISH THIS GAME.\
      \ I AM VERY EXCITED FOR IT!!!!!!!!!"
