      With a GBA game visual, don't get carried away by the apparent simplicity of\
      \ the game. Just a closer look is enough to notice the incredible amount of\
      \ love that this game has in all points, even though it is a pixelated game,\
      \ the sprites are of very high quality, the game backgrounds are also very well\
      \ elaborated. The gameplay is also very interesting with each character having\
      \ a different style of shooting, one being the classic \"fast and line shot\"\
      \ and the other being the \"slow and spread shot\" each one also has a different\
      \ type of bomb and a full screen and a more powerful short shooting mode, the\
      \ game's OST is very good! I'm very happy that OST is available on Steam too!\
      \ And the most amazing thing, despite being a Shmup the game has a simple but\
      \ engaging storyline, I was really interested in knowing what would happen at\
      \ the end of each stage and I really cared about the characters! The difficulty\
      \ of the game is good, nothing too easy or too difficult and its duration is\
      \ good for a game of the genre too. Of course, there are downsides as the game\u2019\
      s hitboxes are kind of confusing, but for the most part it will benefit the\
      \ player and although the game is compatible with controls, setting one up is\
      \ so confusing and the buttons never match what you determine, so I recommend\
      \ playing at keyboard.\n[u]Note: for full screen just press Enter, the controller\
      \ configuration is in the game installation folder.[/u]\n[b]For sure, this is\
      \ one of the best Shmups available on Steam, if you are a fan of the genre or\
      \ want to try a different game, please give this game a try and check out the\
      \ love it has in its production![/b]\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]Um Shmup que transborda\
      \ amor [Eng and Pt-Br reviw] [/h1]\nCom um visual de um jogo de GBA, n\xE3o\
      \ se deixe levar pela aparente simplicidade desse jogo. Basta um olhar mais\
      \ atento para notar a incr\xEDvel quantidade de amor que esse jogo possui em\
      \ todos os pontos, mesmo sendo um jogo pixelado os sprites s\xE3o de alt\xED\
      ssima qualidade, os backgrounds do jogo tamb\xE9m s\xE3o muito bem elaborados.\
      \ O gameplay tamb\xE9m \xE9 muito interessante com cada personagem possuindo\
      \ um estilo diferente de tiro sendo um o cl\xE1ssico \"r\xE1pido e tiros em\
      \  linha\" e o outro sendo o \"lento de tiro espalhado\" cada um possui um tipo\
      \ de bomba e um modo de tiro de tela cheia e outro curto mais poderoso, a OST\
      \ do jogo tamb\xE9m \xE9 muito boa! fico muito feliz da OST est\xE1 dispon\xED\
      vel na Steam! Mas o mais incr\xEDvel, apesar de ser um Shmup o jogo possui um\
      \ enredo simples mas envolvente, eu estava realmente interessado em saber o\
      \ que iria acontecer ao final de cada est\xE1gio e realmente me importava com\
      \ os personagens! A dificuldade do jogo \xE9 boa, nada muito f\xE1cil nem muito\
      \ dif\xEDcil e a dura\xE7\xE3o dele \xE9 boa para um jogo do g\xEAnero tamb\xE9\
      m. Claro, h\xE1 pontos negativos como os hitboxes do jogo s\xE3o meio confusos,\
      \ mas na maior parte isso vai beneficiar o jogador e apesar do jogo ser compat\xED\
      vel com controles, configurar um \xE9 t\xE3o confuso e os bot\xF5es nunca correspondem\
      \ com que voc\xEA determina, ent\xE3o recomendo jogar pelo teclado mesmo. \n\
      [u]OBS: para por tela cheia \xE9 s\xF3 apertar Enter, a configura\xE7\xE3o do\
      \ controle fica na pasta de instala\xE7\xE3o do jogo.[/u]\n[b]Com toda certeza,\
      \ esse \xE9 um dos melhores Shmups dispon\xEDveis na Steam, se voc\xEA \xE9\
      \ f\xE3 do g\xEAnero ou quer tentar um jogo diferente, por favor, d\xEA uma\
      \ chance a esse jogo e corresponda ao amor que ele possui na produ\xE7\xE3o.[/b]"
