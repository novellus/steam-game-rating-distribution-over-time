The gameplay is not fun in any way. Rather than using reasoning, there's a focus just on the end state and enumerating the possible permutations to get there.\n\nIt's a 2D grid of rectangles and clicking on one affects the neighbors. Big whoop.\n\nThe visuals are just a gimmick that gets old in 1 minute, then just makes everything hard to see. UI has artificial slowness. Music is pretty bad.\n\n★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆☆","timestamp_created":1584312479,"timestamp_updated":1584312758,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.634441137313842773","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw78WZ8PACctSy+AE="}
