    review: "Highly recommended HOPA game! In this game, you're a doctor returning\
      \ to practise in a small town with a mysterious past.  Things have gotten stranger\
      \ since you were last here, and you're plunged into the mystery immediately\
      \ upon your arrival.  Note that the game begins with a chase scene from the\
      \ POV of the scared young woman trying to locate the doctor; this is actually\
      \ the prologue and tutorial. \n\nPros:\n- excellent length with lots to do\n\
      - interesting story to draw you in (one or two confusing transitions, but minor)\n\
      - lovely art (atmospheric too - I like the glistening rain-damp streets etc)\n\
      - wide variety of puzzles (mostly moderate level, a couple a little harder)\n\
      - wide variety of HO scenes (with one exception, well-crafted; one scene didn't\
      \ accept a large bicycle wheel for \"wheel\")\n- two sets of collectables, both\
      \ used to decorate your new home (for once, this was an enjoyable feature, not\
      \ just rather confusing):  (1) black/gray pearls for buying new furniture and\
      \ upgraded flooring etc; (2) fish tank items (um... for your fish... as you\
      \ might guess ;)\n- decent music and voice acting\n- fully interactive map that\
      \ manages the quasi-3D concept *well* (most are awful)\n- very good bonus chapter\
      \ (note that there are more collectables here)\n\nI could go on, but there's\
      \ a lot to recommend this game, and very few cons.  I suggest getting it on\
      \ sale only because the Steam prices for the Big Fish games are very high, and\
      \ there will be a sale eventually.  Either way, it will be money well spent.\n\
      \n~Imp"
