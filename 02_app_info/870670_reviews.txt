The interface is OK though it has some quirks. Best part about it is the words selections are actually fun - it's hard to describe how that is so. Let me try ... sometime some of the words on a particular puzzle are related, and sometimes if you're really lucky you can figure out the common theme from that particular puzzles title.  I bought this game for 49 cents on sale and have spent many hours on it. It must be one of the best gaming values I've bought on Steam. It's a great game to fire up if you just want to kill a few minutes.  I've completed most of the puzzles in under 5 minutes each. Occasionally I come across a puzzle that takes up to 20 minutes because it's hard to start it when the board is mostly blanks.","timestamp_created":1607587878,"timestamp_updated":1607595052,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvrmIpvYCcazPuAI="}
