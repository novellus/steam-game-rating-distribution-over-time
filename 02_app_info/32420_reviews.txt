The missions are short and in each mission they play more often for a different character in terms of characters, so I'm sorry that we can't change characters in the main story. As for the Jedi, the control is simple, one way to control the force, the other with a sword attack, the third you jump. Clones shoot a little worse, although there are two shooting options. For fans of Clone Wars and for them very demanding players on the story, the game will fulfill what you expect. As for people who like a good story, the game will not appeal. Personally, I enjoy the game and recommend it to all Clone Wars fans.\n\n+ Characters\n+ Optimization\n+ Multiplayer game on one device\n+ Gameplay\n+ Steam Remote Play support\n\n- A story\n- Worse graphics\n\nOverall rating:\n7.5 / 10","timestamp_created":1593089478,"timestamp_updated":1609611663,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46ZqV4vYCf5KIkAI="}
