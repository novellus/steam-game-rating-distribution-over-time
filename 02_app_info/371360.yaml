    about_the_game: "Once upon a time all was peaceful and serene in the far off land\
      \ of Camalon, but the silence has been broken as the Orc hordes have returned\
      \ to the peaceful kingdom to claim the land that they once held most sacred.\
      \ The only thing stopping them from conquering the innocent people of Camalon\
      \ is your arsenal of weapons and advanced research towers.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nProgress through various waves and stages of Orc and Goblin invasions on both\
      \ paths and open room scale battlefields, all along developing an increasingly\
      \ sophisticated tower system to take down even the most powerful of Orcs enemies.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor a truly unique experience, you can now enter the world\
      \ of Orc Assault exclusively with the HTC Vive VR headset and oversee the entire\
      \ playfield. Once you play tower defense in virtual reality at room scale, you\
      \ will fully understand the complete immersion that VR provides a wide range\
      \ of gaming experiences. The fully animated characters and detailed animation-inspired\
      \ world immerses you as you plan your final tactics and use fully tracked controller\
      \ wands to plot your strategy and defend both the town on Camalon and riches\
      \ beyond."
