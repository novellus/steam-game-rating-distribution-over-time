I was expecting something a bit better than this arcade endless runner with historical elements.\n\nFirstly though, I aplaude the dev's guts for attempting to make this a fun experience, but ultimately it came off feeling somewhat rushed an also a little disrepectful, historically.\n\nCompared with the sinking scene in Titanic VR which was treated with care, in this, the training and any sense of comradery between the crew is all rushed through to drop us into the action. \n\nI would have preferred to have a high quality version of the Arvo Lancaster to walk around and familiarise myself with. And even the ability to use a grip and pull locomotion method to get into each of the positions on the plane, it would have helped give a sense of scale and presence which is lacking when you're just stuck in a seat.\n\nWhile the cockpit looked quite nice, the external detail of buildings and forests was entirely lacking.\n\nAnd all the little gamified elements, recycled assets of trees buildings etc were repeated ad nauseam on the journey to the dam. And while I do appreciate the difficulty of re creating the actual flight to target, as well as the periods of \"boredom\", at the same time I would have loved it there was a simplified version of night navigation, trying to spot navigation landmarks etc.\n\nI had a lot of difficulty with the controls of the plane. I was using my Rift S controllers, and never really found a satisfactory way to ensure that I was always in control of the plane. I'd be flying for a while, manuvering, then suddenly I'd have no control over my pitch, I'd glance down and my hand wasn't on the yoke anymore. \n\nAnyway, I'm still happy that this exists. But it's purpose for existing leaves me scratching my head a little. \n\nWhy go to all the effort to create \"Immersive Vr Education\" if you're going to simply gloss over some of the more incredible parts of the story. \n\nBut I guess, at the end of the day, it was probably the same with Apollo 11 HD and Titanic VR. Needing to cheat the realism in order to still have a \"game\" \n\nSo yeah, those are my thoughts. \n\nI'm very interested to see what Immersive VR Education come up with for their next project.\n\nBut for Lancasters, I'll be keeping my eye on the development of Valiant Effort, (and the Mighty Eighth)\n\n","timestamp_created":1602636410,"timestamp_updated":1602636410,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyd2kkvUCcoLepwI="}
