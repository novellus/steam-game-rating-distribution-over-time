Well, I got this game in a bundle. I would not have paid any money for this game. I had already tried the demo so I wasn't expecting much. And yeah, I think I got even less. This game is basically broken. \n\nTeleportation doesn't really work in this game. You have to keep trying several times to move. It will show you places you can and you can't go (yellow or red). However, sometimes you try to teleport to a place you have just been and it says you can't teleport back there. I had more difficulty trying to teleport than I did with the orcs.\n\nWhich brings us to the second problem, combat is awful. Now, the bow & arrow felt fine. But the sword / melee combat is just terrible. You basically just wiggle your wrists in front of you. There's no skill involved, other than not being flanked by the orcs, which can happen because you can't teleport properly.\n\n[b]Rate 3/10. Looks nice, but the broken teleportation and the basic melee combat just makes this a poor game. Avoid. Should be free to play because that's what level of effort this game is. It's like someone learning to code in VR. You can't seriously ask money for this.[/b]","timestamp_created":1544555685,"timestamp_updated":1544555685,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53271031379699707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yKysz+cCecKJtQE="}
