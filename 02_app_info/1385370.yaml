    about_the_game: "The main focus of this program is not to be only a stand-alone\
      \ game. We intend this game to work with other pen and paper role playing games\
      \ to provide a more immersive role play environment. Our second goal is to provide\
      \ as much open customization as possible to allow you to enjoy every experience\
      \ you have with us.<br><br>Chat<br>This is the most important part of our game.<br>We\
      \ have a chat system that is built to work differently with every language you\
      \ choose to use. You are  able to type in Common (or whichever language you\
      \ speak), and have your written words translated into any language we include\
      \ in this program. This feature will also allow the &quot;GM&quot; to set a\
      \ custom actor requirement on the languages. This means you may need to have\
      \ a character that knows how to speak the language of your choice before using\
      \ this language, and it can also mean that when you send the message you send\
      \ it out as if you are the selected character. Everything posted in chat will\
      \ be based off the character you currently have selected. If you roll dice,\
      \ post information about abilities or quests, or simply type a message then\
      \ these all will be sent to your friends based on your selected character.<br><br><img\
      \ src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1385370/extras/Chat_message.jpg?t=1607623418\"\
      \ /><br><br>Questing<br>There is a special section where players can review\
      \ their quests and in the spirit of RPG we even allow the &quot;Game Master&quot;\
      \ to create, update, and delete quests on the fly.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1385370/extras/Quest_log.jpg?t=1607623418\"\
      \ /><br><br>Journal<br>There is a section that is easy to use where you can\
      \ write notes about your adventuress, and save these notes to either your players\
      \ own journal or save them to one of your controlled characters journals.<br><br><img\
      \ src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1385370/extras/Journal.jpg?t=1607623418\"\
      \ /><br><br>Dictionary<br>The dictionary we provide will be set up to be used\
      \ for you to learn the language without the need of translations. We feel languages\
      \ are more than just images you read. We want to offer the full experience of\
      \ speaking like an Orc or an Elf. We have the dictionary set up so that each\
      \ letter and each symbol not only have a name, but they have a sound. More importantly,\
      \ each one has a description and a proper way to be used. So, when you type\
      \ a word like &quot;friend&quot; into our system we search for the correct spelling\
      \ of the word in the dictionary under the language of your choice, and then\
      \ we post the correct word for everyone to read. We also attempt to correct\
      \ spelling of the users so that when typing words that don\u2019t exist in the\
      \ language the word is still written in a similar fashion. For example, one\
      \ or more of our languages never use double letters such as in the word &quot;ball&quot;\
      \ so when using that language it will automatically remove the second &quot;l&quot;.\
      \ We also plan to set up an auto read feature where it enables our system to\
      \ read what other people post so you hear the words the way they are meant to\
      \ be read.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1385370/extras/Dictionary.jpg?t=1607623418\"\
      \ /><br><br>Dice<br>We offer a dice rolling system in both the cases of simple\
      \ randomized numbers, and actual 3d rolling dice. Our 3d dice system offer different\
      \ cameras for watching from different views as we drop dice in towers, pour\
      \ them from cups, or toss them from hands, each meant to get the best roll for\
      \ each player. We will also offer in the future special weighted dice and many\
      \ colors, materials and designs to choose from. All rolls and totals will be\
      \ exported to the chat system as public or private rolls.<br><br><img src=\"\
      https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1385370/extras/steamdice.jpg?t=1607623418\"\
      \ /><br><br>Character Sheets<br>We offer custom character sheets built not only\
      \ for our game, but we plan to offer them for other games as well. Do you want\
      \ to build an Orc Battle Mage but dislike the rules created within Midget Kricket\
      \ Fantasy Chat? Well, we plan to offer the ability to fill out and use sheets\
      \ from some of the most popular games out there. <br><br>Items<br>Items are\
      \ the most important part of any game! We are going to build items for Midget\
      \ Kricket Fantasy Chat, but why not allow you to build neat items for other\
      \ games? This system will handle different items such as general items that\
      \ do nothing or complex items that you can equip. With just 1 click have your\
      \ 1 handed (Holy Ax of Lightning Damage) swing and miss but still call for its\
      \ area splash damage of fire and acid that rain from the sky! On a small note,\
      \ each item will also have a &quot;weight&quot; and a &quot;currency value&quot;\
      \ that you can fill in to use for other games as desired.<br><br><img src=\"\
      https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1385370/extras/Item.jpg?t=1607623418\"\
      \ /><br><br>Interactions<br>This is a complicated feature. We will have a form\
      \ of trade menu, but we cannot promise it will work for every game at this time.\
      \ We also plan for a store screen to allow the GM to post items in and set custom\
      \ currency values for each item. This is only meant to speed up the game so\
      \ that the GM does not need to find each of his custom created items and decide\
      \ what to sell it for and place it in your inventory for you. The idea for each\
      \ of these systems to allow players to be able to view, trade, and buy items\
      \ quickly.<br><br>This is a preview of what we currently hope to offer. We do\
      \ plan to offer more stuff as people join us in our adventures!"
