I'm only just starting to get a better handle on how to make good combos, but thanks to the many great customizable modes, I can get practice in on an easy setting.\n\nThe style is meant to evoke those arcade puzzlers from the 90s, and the gameplay reminds me a lot of Rollin' Rascals on the DS, but it's still fresh enough that the challenges feel brand new. I'm definitely sinking several more hours into this!","timestamp_created":1609652873,"timestamp_updated":1609652873,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ48rSy4/YCcdD8vwI="}
