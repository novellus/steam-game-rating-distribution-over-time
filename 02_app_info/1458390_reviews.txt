Yes. But in it's current state I'd like to see it improved before I put more time into it.\n\nSome things that stuck in my craw:\n[list]\n[*] The game booted into 1920x1200. My monitor is 1920x1080. However, the game does not permit you to change the resolution if it is running in fullscreen.\n[*] The game doesn't have extra keybinding slots for keys, it's one only, so if you want to add an alternative, you replace the original, which mostly is fine, but I wish you could have extras to help with when you knee-jerk based on muscle memory.\n[*] For a game where you are being assaulted on all sides but ghastly floating polygons, the game does not really provide any kind of situational awareness. I know that the  things don't really touch the ground, but if something is directly behind you, you don't hear it, there is no indication that it exists, it's just there, and this is super difficult to work with in a game like this.\n[*] The amount of ammo that guns can hold is very small, but I honestly question reloading as a mechanic at all. For a game like this, if you think of like say a Geometry Wars or a Super Stardust HD, you have different weapon types for different purposes, but you don't 'reload' and for a game like this, I just question why this has been placed into the mix. It feels like playing something like Space Invaders where you have to stop and reload. At the very least, providing an option for auto-reload once empty would be very, very appreciated!\n[*] Similar to above, there is a key to collect all drops. It seems to be AoE and grab anything on the ground. In a game like this again, make pickups automatics. I don't see why this is an extra step.\n[*] When you die, you get a \"Continue?\" screen...... there is no option other than continue. Nothing you press does anything other than start over again, and then you can exist from the menu. This is kind of superfluous, I don't see why it exists if it can't be used for any purpose other than continuing.\n[*] The physics can be irritating sometimes. The special boxes for example fly straight up into the air when you shoot them with the shotgun... I really want the surprises inside and not for it to fly straight up into orbit when I shoot it.\n[*] I love the different game references. \"I live again!\" Don't get me wrong, this is mostly critical, but the game has charm and I am not requesting a refund because I wanna see this continue to grow. The music options are also dope and very much appreciated.\n[/list]","timestamp_created":1609109386,"timestamp_updated":1609109386,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.504504501819610596","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609225466,"developer_response":"Volatica,\n\nI must Thank You for your review and also say that it was pleasantly critical, to the point and especially devoid of insults -- I wish that I could say that all reviews display the tact that yours does, but unfortunately I cannot, so this too is appreciated!\n\nYou cleverly touched on many things that we are aware of and some that we have already rectified in internal builds and are forthcoming fixes in the next patch!\n\nWe appreciate you sticking with us a great deal to see just where this thing goes and we also hope to sometime earn your changing your review to 'recommended' at a future time!\n\nThank You, again!\n\n: )"}],"cursor":"AoJwsZaZ0/YCca70vQI="}
