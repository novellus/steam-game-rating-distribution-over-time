Boring romance options--it is the first time I didn't care about who I would romance--boring world, and a boring story that jumped from one event to the other at the snap of a finger. It felt like several different stories sloppily put together rather than one coherent and well-written game.\n\nBarely got 2 hours of gameplay. Not worth the high price it is asking.","timestamp_created":1529152970,"timestamp_updated":1543411622,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494204431772232056","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh4ygrecCdreQowE="}
