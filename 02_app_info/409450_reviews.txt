I came across this title and decided to buy it.  This game is fantastic!  Haven’t had this much fun in a long time.  At first, I skipped the “Treasure Hunt”, however, in Level 4 I decided to go way back to the first level and try to achieve it.  I still have a long way to go, but a “Big Thanks” to the developers for making this jewel!","timestamp_created":1609985731,"timestamp_updated":1609985731,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4m5Wo7fYCf6uVwQI="}
