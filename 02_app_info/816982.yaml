    review: "Purchased during a sale for $3.99. It's very visually interesting, though\
      \ I'm not quite seeing what makes it 'Russian folkart'. Not that I know anything\
      \ about Russian folkart anyway.\n\nIt might be [i]too[/i] visually interesting\
      \ ... totally messed up my first game with it because I was paying more attention\
      \ to how the pieces looked rather than where the pieces were on the board. That's\
      \ not a mark against the set, though, but against my concentration.\n\nThe textures\
      \ are of good quality - closely examining the pieces, it really looks like they've\
      \ been hand-painted. It's fun to play with these.\n\nJust know that you're only\
      \ getting one skin on a Staunton set, and no environments. \n\nI'm guessing\
      \ that Purling had a lot of sway in the pricing of these pieces (it being their\
      \ licensed material); or perhaps the license cost the devs so much that the\
      \ devs need to charge this much to make even a modest profit on sales ... but\
      \ from a consumer standpoint, the base $10 asking price is absolutely ridiculous,\
      \ and shows how little Purling understands the digital DLC market.\n\nIt's not\
      \ bad for $4, though even then it definitely feels like you're not getting good\
      \ value for your money, considering $4 can get you much better DLCs in Chess\
      \ Ultra. At $10, it's not worth buying."
