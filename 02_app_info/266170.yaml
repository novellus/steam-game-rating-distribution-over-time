    review: 'I absolutely love this game. I like the completely destructible environments.
      I like the ability to quicksave in the middle of a fight to force the rng in
      my favor. I like that if I want, i can hang out near the very first town and
      max out my ship and a lot of my stats just by scavenging for resources in the
      islands nearby and/or stealing enemy ships and selling them for parts.


      I love games where I can be level 30 levels ahead before I do the first mission
      and feel like I''m on top of the world.


      I like how there are many boards out on the internet with passionate people
      like me that can tell me where important things are.


      The reason why this game has mixed reviews, in my opinion, is not the game or
      the gameplay, but that it has a few bugs and the developer has decided to stop
      updating the game.


      The biggest problem in my experience is that sometimes the game will crash when
      going from one zone/square/island to another. It seems to be at random, but
      when the only autosaves are changing of zones, you just spent half an hour grinding
      [spoiler] meteors for heartstone [/spoiler] or whatever other resource, it is
      disheartening to see all that go to waste when you try to leave, the game crashes,
      and your last save is the autosave of you entering the area. It happened to
      me only every couple of hours and, on my first couple playthroughs, I never
      encountered the problem.


      The second biggest problem is when I try to go to one of the end-game areas
      before I''m supposed to know about it... but that''s more on me, I guess.


      Can this problem mostly be solved by doing regular quicksaves? Yes. But it can
      still be annoying to know that you need to save before leaving somewhere when
      the game shouldn''t force you to mistrust it.


      I still do recommend this game because the problems I have found have only caused
      major problems when I haven''t saved recently and I do very much enjoy his game.
      I don''t know if the bugs will ever be fixed, but I do hope so.


      If you''re willing to save after major works and don''t mind rebooting the game
      every couple of hours (or however long it is), get the game.'
