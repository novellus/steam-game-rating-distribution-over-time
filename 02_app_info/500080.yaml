    review: Adds a few new bases and ships that add variety; though I'd rate this
      addition lower than 'Bases and Battleships' expansion; the cards are okay, but
      seem underwhelming compared to cards of similar cost - though I do highly favor
      the blob 'Death World' (4 Combat; and may scrap non-blob card to draw 1 - helpful
      if you can grab a cost-1 card off the lineup and scrap it immediately) and the
      Trader 'Capitol World' (Outpost-6, +6 authority, draw a card - what's not to
      like?). But the rest of the cards are usually just things you get if there's
      nothing better on offer.
