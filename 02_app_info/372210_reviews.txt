Only half of the control mechanics are explained if that and the game does a terrible job with darkness.  Half the platforms are black, which results in a lot of blind jumps and when you activate a switch, you have to go all around trying to figure out what to do.  The final boss is also very poorly implemented with zero concept explanation prior.\n\nAvoid this one.","timestamp_created":1609616048,"timestamp_updated":1609616048,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+Pel4vYCdIXqvwI="}
