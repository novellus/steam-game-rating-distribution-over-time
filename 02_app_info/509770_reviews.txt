I forced myself to play for an hour at minimum. Here's the thing: If you're not going to do Post apocalypse with zombies or robots or something to build tension, then you really need to ace the graphics and depth of the survival experience. This does none of that. Useless day night cycle, minimal skill depth, forgettable scenery and third-rate graphics make this a bit grueling. I would live to see a game with this premise really get into detail with crafting/building. 7 Days to Die has far more depth.","timestamp_created":1609873171,"timestamp_updated":1609873171,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4o+T66fYCfuPkwAI="}
