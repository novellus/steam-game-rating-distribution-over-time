      \ /><br><br>The Depths is a Semi-realistic Prehistoric Survival MMO game, where\
      \ the player can become a prehistoric creature of their choice from different\
      \ environments such as swamps, oceans or plains. The Depths will heavily focus\
      \ on aquatic creatures and their interactions with other creatures in their\
      \ environment. The game will feature 20 creatures at the start, from full aquatic\
      \ creatures such as the Mosasarus or the Semi-aquatic creatures like Spinosaurus.<br><br>We\
      \ are focusing on a quest system based on semi-realistic adventures and a growth\
      \ leveling system that will impact the characters stats. <br><br>We will be\
      \ introducing different works of mating, such as mating dances and bringing\
      \ gifts. Nothing is better than seeing your mate do a dance! <br><br><br><img\

      \ will have a choice of creating their own groups or joining existing groups,\
      \ these groups will be organized in some sort of simple hierarchy that players\
      \ can use as coordination or organization in their groups. Players will be able\
      \ to prove themselves as The group leader (Alpha), which will grant buffs and\
      \ a title to the player. Some creatures will be in Alpha pairs (Alpha female\
      \ and Alpha male). Alpha title will not be easy to keep, other players can challenge\
      \ the alpha to take the spot, be careful!  <br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1426350/extras/forestshot2.jpg?t=1609927441\"\

      \ </i></strong></h2></h2>The stat system is a randomly generated stat system\
      \ that will start when your creature reaches adolescence, these stats will randomly\
      \ generate and it will affect your play style, this can cause you to have lower\
      \ speed but higher bite force. Don't worry the system will be set up in a way\
      \ to always have a stat lower if one is higher. You can also birth in your friends\
      \ and the stats of the parents will mix and affect the child's stats. The Depths\
      \ Also features Large Intelligent AI that will attack and try to kill you along\
      \ with smaller base AI to keep you fed, these will spawn more when the server\
      \ is low and they can be any creature in the game.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong><i>Dismemberment\
      \ and Natural Based Quests</i></strong></h2><br>Ever play other survival games\
      \ and wonder why models were not more damaged? Well, wonder no more. The Depths\
      \ will feature dismemberment of all creatures. This is based on how creatures\
      \ attack in the ocean, we want to create an interesting shift in pvp by including\
      \ the ability to rip parts off of your enemy with your creature if its big and\
      \ strong enough, this will be balanced and properly looked at when it comes\
      \ to multiplayer pvp, for ai this will be more common.  <br><br>We also want\
      \ to make this game enjoyable and entertaining, The Depths will have a natural-based\
      \ quest system for instincts creatures would normally just do, such as migrate,\
      \ explore, build a nest, hunt, create a family, find a mate, etc. These quests\
      \ will progress and become more difficult the higher level your creature becomes.\
      \  Quests will also include unique rewards such as skins.  <br><br><br><br><img\
