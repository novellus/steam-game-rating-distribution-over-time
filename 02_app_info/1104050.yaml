    review: "Save me from the default controls.  Seemed like a good idea at first...\
      \ when i first swam forward it felt great.  But everything beyond that is not\
      \ intuitive and feels horrible. \nThe game looks good.  Objects that you can\
      \ interact with seem repetitive. It seems like an interesting idea. Pick it\
      \ up on sale and give it a shot, but I definitely don't recommend picking up\
      \ at full price.\n\nWill recommend for sale price. Can't bring myself to put\
      \ in a bad review for VR games that seem to have heart.... Hopefully they make\
      \ improvements."
