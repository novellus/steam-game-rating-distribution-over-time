      notes: "The characters in this game are all over 18 years old.\r\n\r\nIn the\
        \ game, the player will play a Pixiv painter, he mainly creates Guro paintings.\r\
        \n\r\nOne day he met a Fuli Ji (a woman who sold her pornographic photos for\
        \ a living on the Internet), and the story unfolded.\r\n\r\nThe game plot\
        \ mainly revolves around these two professions, so there will be related plots:\
        \ for example, the male protagonist (player) can choose whether to create\
        \ paintings with adult themes, and will also receive commissions from various\
        \ aspects; The female protagonist will update her Twitter feed from time to\
        \ time (selfie with her legs, etc.) to attract more male users.\r\n\r\nIt\
        \ should be noted that this is not a porn game, and the above content will\
        \ only be displayed lightly."
