    review: "TLDR: A sweet little 3D platformer game that's rough around the edges\
      \ but full of heart.\n\nNewt One is pretty interesting. It's music-based in\
      \ that as you go through the level, the music gets more complex, but for the\
      \ most part it's just a platformer. There is no combat or death - if you fall\
      \ off the level you will be reset to your last point. There are 6 levels in\
      \ every world, and 4 worlds, making a total of 24 levels [spoiler]plus one secret\
      \ level you get for rescuing all the parrots[/spoiler]. \n\nFor a small team\
      \ working on what appears to be a passion project, I'd say Newt One is outstanding.\
      \ The concept is sound, the controls are decent - very slide-y and float-y -\
      \ and the world is unique and colourful. Playing this makes me wish they had\
      \ a few extra hands and funds to really polish it and push it from an interesting\
      \ project to a fantastic game. As it stands, Newt One does have a few minor\
      \ glitches here and there, the graphics are simple and the cutscenes are essentially\
      \ a slideshow with meh text boxes. The grand majority of the characters actually\
      \ have no hit boxes - this includes [spoiler]Curno, the Parrot King, and all\
      \ three of the Elders[/spoiler]. \n\nBut for all its faults, I can't criticize\
      \ Newt One's gameplay, art style or story - what I'd call the main components\
      \ of any good game. The gameplay is satisfying with several achievements attached\
      \ to each level for replayability. The art style is cute, cheerful and sweet,\
      \ and sticks to the theme regardless of which world you're in. The music is\
      \ nice - key in a music themed game like this one - and the story, while simple\
      \ and too young for most players on Steam, is cute and wholesome. With animated\
      \ cutscenes and a bit of rearranging, it would remind me a lot of the sorts\
      \ of stories you'd find in Kirby, which I believe is what they were aiming for.\
      \ I'd say it has about 3-6 hours of mindless fun to offer.\n\nOverall while\
      \ Newt One is unpolished, I'd call it a little gem. It's short and sweet and\
      \ while unpolished, I enjoyed playing it."
