    review: "Having been introduced to this genre by the delightfully entertaining\
      \ [i]Detective Jackie: Mystic Case[/i], it was only a matter of time before\
      \ I started looking into Gamehouse's earlier productions, and as an enthusiast\
      \ of clothing in games, the [i]Fabulous \u2013 Angela[/i] series was an obvious\
      \ place to start.\n\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\nAngela has recently lost her job [i]and[/i]\
      \ been cheated on by her husband; and is at a low ebb in her life.  She is offered\
      \ a job at a local boutique, which is where we come in, and the game offers\
      \ a nice introductory level to help us get started if we are not familiar with\
      \ what we need to do.  Soon afterwards, it transpires that Angela's heroine,\
      \ the fashion designer Truly, is holding a televised competition to find the\
      \ most talented, exciting new designer to ultimately replace her - which will\
      \ take place over 5 exotic locations (in addition to the starting point of the\
      \ boutique) containing 15 levels each.  Of course, Angela is hopeful of being\
      \ selected to appear on the show.  Will she get there?  And if so, what will\
      \ happen?  Life is never that simple..\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nIs exactly what\
      \ you would expect from this type of game: serve a series of customers with\
      \ the item(s) and/or service(s) they want within a timeframe that keeps them\
      \ happy, in order to earn points which you can then cash in for additional features\
      \ to make your efforts quicker and/or more efficient as the levels progress.\n\
      \nIn this game, those bonuses can be purchased for the duration of each location,\
      \ such as an extra changing room or additional make-up table so you can serve\
      \ more customers concurrently; or be repurchased one level at a time, like the\
      \ magician who performs a trick and improves everybody's mood, which effectively\
      \ boosts their patience timer and gives you longer to serve them before they\
      \ leave in a frustrated rage.\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\n- The story is told via\
      \ cutscenes between each of 90 playable levels, and it is this which really\
      \ holds the game together and maintains player interest.  It is very well written\
      \ and you will find yourself cheering on certain characters whilst pantomime-jeering\
      \ others as their true natures become apparent.\n- Aurally the game also performs\
      \ well, there is a lovely cheerful introductory song and respectable accompaniments\
      \ throughout.\n- Graphics are right up to scratch for the type of challenge,\
      \ clean and quickly identifiable as they need to be, whilst remaining colourful\
      \ in keeping with the overall theme; and some of the dress options are gorgeous.\n\
      - Responsiveness to clicking appeared to be flawless.  Even during my most frenetic\
      \ activity, I never had to click the same thing twice to be sure that Angela\
      \ would respond accordingly.\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n- There are a number of\
      \ additional \u201Cchallenges\u201D thrown in to many of the levels, such as\
      \ having supplies delivered to the wrong place and having to move them across\
      \ the room in between serving all the customers; or having to prevent an underhand\
      \ competitor from sneaking in and sabotaging your work.  These are fun at first,\
      \ but are very limited in variety and the same ones repeat over; which makes\
      \ them increasingly tiresome as you progress further.\n- While crediting the\
      \ developers for throwing in little extras to challenge the player, I feel that\
      \ some of these additions simply don't work well.  There is a mouse in the majority\
      \ of the levels which you need to find and click on; but it is very small, often\
      \ hidden behind other scenery so you can see only part of it, and it doesn't\
      \ stay visible for very long.  When you are really busy keeping up with demand,\
      \ unless you are very lucky and just-so happen to look in the right spot at\
      \ the right time, you are likely to miss it altogether.\n- Most of the achievements\
      \ in game are fun to get, but one of them demands you score 500,000 points in\
      \ total; and you are not going to get very near to that when you have played\
      \ right through the game, which effectively forces you into grinding some levels\
      \ over and over to get there.  An avoidable introduction of grind is [i]never[/i]\
      \ a smart move.  Throw in the likelihood of mouse-spotting adding to that inevitability,\
      \ and you have some player frustration in a game which could have easily been\
      \ completely free of it.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nOverall, the negatives in the\
      \ game are pretty small and pale in comparison to the fun that you should have\
      \ from playing it.  There is a lot of repetition \u2013 as is the nature of\
      \ the genre, I suspect \u2013 but the gameplay levels are split by delightfully\
      \ enjoyable cutscene story updates, and a desire to see how everything pans\
      \ out should be comfortably enough to keep you invested until the conclusion.\n\
      \nAt full price, this game costs \xA310, which might be a touch above fair value,\
      \ but on offer (and at time of typing, it is less than half price), it becomes\
      \ a bargain.  If you like time management games, or fun stories, or simply fashion,\
      \ then [i]Angela's Fashion Fever[/i] should appeal; and if you like all three\
      \ of those, then the question is, why haven't you bought it already?\n\n\n[quote]\
