    review: "This game WAS a good game in 2014... but now probably it must be removed\
      \ from Steam due to the missing support and huge problems with a new Windows\
      \ 10 OS and hardware. \nI do believe Valve must be involved as a seller in such\
      \ situation and act by the some way to protect customers, at least not to allow\
      \ 2K to sell its not working digital scrap without making a well visible written\
      \ notice which must mention: \n1. Compatibility issues with Windows 10 (game\
      \ usually not working after install and require some skills to try to make it\
      \ running), \n2. Incompatibility with a new hardware, \n3. Game's out of support\
      \ state. \nSo basically, that means you are buying it on your own risk without\
      \ any warranty.\n\nUpdate: I appreciate your comments. Just have to say what\
      \ I do not have a huge problems with mentioned game on my desktop PC (compatibility\
      \ mode fix only), but I have problems with this game on my laptop which has\
      \ an integrated and discrete graphic. Problems was unsolvable  by using compatibility\
      \ mode. This is a workstation grade laptop which I can not reinstall or play\
      \ with drivers so easy. So yes, I still think it is unacceptable to ask 40 euro\
      \ (+30 euro for Rising Tide DLC) for a game which is not supported anymore and\
      \ which you are buying by relying only on steam community support. \nI would\
      \ strongly recommend to avoid this overpriced junk or at least to try it by\
      \ using Demo before making purchase."
