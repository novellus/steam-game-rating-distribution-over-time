By the time your quest is complete you'll have explored several cities, gained the support of dwarfs and elves, traveled the elemental planes, and saved the world.\n\nThe game is heavily influenced by the first two [i]Might & Magic[/i] games and the classic [i]Wizardry[/i] games.  It takes the combat and character advancement from [i]Might & Magic[/i] and combines it with the overall structure of [i]Wizardry V[/i].  That means the structure is generally linear as you explore one dungeon after the next, but will have to backtrack often to reach previously inaccessible areas or handle your typical town chores (leveling up, healing, shopping, etc.).\n\n[b]An addictive experience[/b] \n\nLike with the best classic RPGs, I found myself having difficulty tearing myself away from [i]Swords and Sorcery[/i] once I gained a few levels and started to get into the swing of things.  The game never requires grinding levels to proceed and you'll typically be at just the right level at all times.\n\nThe game can be played with keyboard, mouse, or a combination of the two.  I was pleased to see that the game can be controlled entirely by keyboard, with intuitive hotkeys for casting spells and even for shopping and moving equipment around!  It was easy to get used to the keyboard controls, and once I did it was a pleasure to play.\n\nThe level design is absolutely fantastic.  Each dungeon has its own unique theme with interesting monsters to slay, quests to solve, and puzzles to figure out.  There are even some optional but very powerful artifacts to find throughout the game that are a joy to discover.\n\nThe artwork for monsters and other characters is done in a comic book style and is quite good, although I personally am not a fan of the style.\n\n[b]It's a great game but could use a bit more polish[/b] \n\nI very much enjoyed the 15 hours it took to complete [i]Swords and Sorcery[/i] and ended up with very little to complain about!  Although the 2D artwork for monsters and characters is fine, I found the tile artwork on walls and floors to be a bit too simple and dull.  Likewise, although the interface is fantastic when it comes to usability, it lacks character and looks a bit amateurish.  Finally, the artwork seems to have been scaled somewhat awkwardly up to 1920x1080 and has some scaling artifacts.  A cleaner look would have been nicer.\n\nThe combat sound effects are actually quite satisfying, but music is limited to a few pieces here and there.  The music that's in there is fine, but I would have liked more of it!\n\nFinally, I ran into some minor bugs.  There were a few times where defeating the last enemy during combat didn't trigger the end of the battle... I had no choice but to terminate the game and relaunch it!  Still, this only happened a few times over 15 hours, so it wasn't a big deal at all.\n\n[b]Final thoughts[/b] \n\n[i]Swords and Sorcery[/i] is just fantastic.  It's been a long time since I became so addicted to a game, and while it's a bit short at 15 hours, it also ended just as the structure began to feel routineâ€”having said that, the final few areas of the game are far more puzzle-centric with much less combat, so it was a nice change of pace during the final hours.\n\nI know the sequel has been in development for some time, but I am eagerly looking forward to it, and will definitely buy it when it eventually (hopefully) does come out!","timestamp_created":1603987769,"timestamp_updated":1603987839,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52702707052230835","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gYPIuvUCcobvqgI="}
