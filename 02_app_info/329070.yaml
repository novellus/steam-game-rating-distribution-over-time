    about_the_game: <strong>SpyParty</strong> is a competitive espionage game about
      human behavior, performance, perception, and deception. While most spy games
      have you machine-gunning stuff, blowing things up, and driving fast, <strong>SpyParty</strong>
      has you hide in plain sight, blend into a high-society cocktail party, deceive
      your opponent, and detect subtle behavioral tells to achieve your objectives
      and not get shot. Finally you can be like the suave and confident spies you
      find in films or books, risking it all by doing the final mission right in front
      of the sniper as the clock runs out! There are plenty of games that explore
      being a super-powered commando with an infinite supply of ammunition and no
      brains; <strong>SpyParty</strong> is a new and quite different game about the
      more interesting, deeper, and more subtle aspects of being a spy.<br><br>The
      current main gameplay mode is 1v1 Spy versus Sniper online multiplayer, although
      there is limited single-player Sniper play right now, and a single player Spy
      and Sniper practice mode for trying out missions and whatnot.<br><br>See the

      \ game. \u2026 Despite being two years away from completion, the early version\

      \ multiplayer games I\u2019ve yet played.\u201D<br><a href=\"http://www.destructoid.com/why-you-need-to-be-excited-about-spyparty-167171.phtml\"\

      \ what is so exciting about Spy Party is the stuff that happens around the game.\
      \ Hecker has seen the game trigger strong emotional responses. I even felt it\u2026\
      \ guilt of all things. I\u2019ve killed thousands \u2014 millions? \u2014 of\
      \ enemy characters and even some friendly characters in video games with none\
      \ of the pangs of consequence. I shot one innocent partygoer in Spy Party after\
      \ tracking them for a few minutes, after being sure they were Chris Hecker\u2019\
      s avatar and up to no good, and then, as they lay dead on the floor I realized\
      \ I was wrong. I felt bad.\u201D<br><a href=\"http://kotaku.com/5500968/the-next-smart-video-game-only-lets-you-kill-once\"\

    short_description: SpyParty is a competitive espionage game about subtle human
      behavior. A Spy hides in plain sight at a fancy cocktail party, trying to accomplish
      missions while blending in with the other guests, while a Sniper with a single
      bullet looks inward, searching for the Spy.
