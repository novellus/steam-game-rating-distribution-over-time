    review: I've had zero experience with a platformer game like this. Launching it
      for the first time, I was shocked by how visually appealing and creative every
      small detail was. I expected that the loss of progress would be common and frustrating
      and I was right. But that's what makes games like this one so much fun. Not
      only that, but the style and unique map design each level has makes all the
      pain and torment worth it to see what stunning display awaits for you beyond.
      I definitely recommend this title to fans of this style of game and newcomers
      alike.
