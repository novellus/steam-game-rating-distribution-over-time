    review: "I haven't managed to get all the endings yet due to some of them not\
      \ being overly obvious.\n\nThere is a lot of thought put into the mechanics\
      \ and handling of objects. Pretty much anything you do will lead to a different\
      \ ending. Top notch work done here, except for the fact that the ropes in you\
      \ have to cut in the very beginning are just luck based. Frustrating. Please\
      \ anyone comment if there's something I haven't realized.\n\nThe graphics side\
      \ is a bit lacking with the main area being just a huge hollow stone cube with\
      \ nothing to look at. Well positively thinking the lack of clutter makes objects\
      \ of importance stand out and the game gets a cozy jam feel.\n\nAt the sale\
      \ price of 0.65\u20AC It's probably worth it. There's about an hour or so of\
      \ content if you try to 100% the game."
