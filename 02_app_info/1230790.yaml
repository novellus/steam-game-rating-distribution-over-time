    review: 'An unfortunate mess of a game.

      The guns make weird, cut off, sounds and have very little other feedback.

      The drones spawn and insta hit you with...lasers? I guess.

      The mouse pointer remains on the screen, even in their own trailer.

      Why are there choppers in space?

      Avoid.
