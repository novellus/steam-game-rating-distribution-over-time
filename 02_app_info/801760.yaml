    review: 'If your looking for a Rampage Style Arcade Game, this is certainly one.  I
      enjoyed my little playthough of this game.  My Goals were simple.  Destroy buildings
      , cars, and People I think in a quest to find the Golden Coins, to set free
      my other Giant Monster Friends to Wreak more Havok.  This game all though Realtively
      short is still fun and worth the buy.  But I do feel it could go further.  Maybe
      More Monsters?  If the Deloper is up to it.  I request I giant Werewolf, Giant
      Vampire, and well we need a Giant Woman in there too.  Just to round it out.  I
      highly Recomend this game for those itching for a bit of Nostalia and well City
      Mayham and Destruction.
