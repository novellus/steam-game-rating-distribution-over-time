The English patch was finally delivered and it is machine translated crap, completely unlike other versions of this game. What a slap in the face. I still like this game, but I cannot possibly recommend supporting this release.\n\noriginal review:\n\n[h1]about the price:[/h1]\nIt is insane. A port of a year-old super niche indie game should absolutely not cost this much.\nWorth 20 bucks if you're a fan of the series, maybe? Hopefully this gets a permanent price cut along with some good discounts, otherwise it's a REALLY tough sell.\n\n[h1]about the port:[/h1]\nObvious Switch port - the on-screen button prompts will not adjust if you use a Playstation or Xbox controller.\n720p windowed or fullscreen only, rebindable controls, no issues with performance on my end, much faster loading times than other versions.\n\n[h1]missing content:[/h1]\nthe English language Curly and her quests (fun fact: they are in the game files, just not accessible)\nIf the missing content is added, this will be the best version of this game (though the leaderboards are likely way more populated on Switch if you're into time trial competition)\n\n[h1]about the game:[/h1]\nThis is the most accessible game in the series yet. \nIf you find any of the main quests too difficult you can resort to using food items which give various boosts (such as longer rope or higher jumps) or playing as Cotton - she can fly on her broom briefly in addition to having Kawase's hook.\nIn my playthrough I felt that the quest mode didn't have any major roadblocks, like every other Umihara game seems to, even without food boosts or Cotton this is the easiest set of levels in the franchise.\nThe quests do get pretty repetitive, and some are so short they're over before they start.\nThe hunger system is really just a disguised timer, so I did not mind that as much as many other players have.\nThe open world here isn't that interesting... I don't think this is the direction the series should go in (if it will go on at all, considering no one bought this). The tighter level design of the previous games was definitely a much better fit.\nThe story is a total mess and you will not be missing out if you skip all the cutscenes.\n\n[h1]tl;dr:[/h1]\nif you've enjoyed the Umihara games, try this one out if it gets a serious discount (or get it on Switch, much cheaper there). Keep in mind that it is pretty different, though. If you haven't played a Umi game before, you probably shouldn't start with this one - the other ones are both cheaper and better in my opinion. If Steam had a neutral option I would've picked that instead - the game is good, but some aspects of the port and the pricing are unacceptable.","timestamp_created":1598109925,"timestamp_updated":1608787647,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.601226985454559326","comment_count":15,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oevNyfYCcdSInQI="}
