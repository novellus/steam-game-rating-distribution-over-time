In plain speaky: they doesn't work ;)\nI don't recommend this if you really love gates that open and close. However, the items are beautiful, so I would say: buy this when on sale, because you do get some pretty walls and things to go with. So instead of thumb up or down i say 50/50.\nOh and: try the Gameguru store; it is waaaay bigger than the limited and expensive list of official dlc's here, even when they are greatlooking. I shop both places.","timestamp_created":1595806086,"timestamp_updated":1595806086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwt47dxvMCecbflwI="}
