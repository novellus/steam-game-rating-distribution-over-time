    review: 'i really like SE and i purchased this dlc to support the game.

      i have been looking into the conceptual art and talking about it with friends
      and we agree that it would be great if many of the conceptual art like the different
      astronauts skins and models that already have textures following what we see
      in those pictures were released. it is really cool stuff and would give more
      deep to have access to different shapes of astronauts. it would be great to
      access to the type of astronaut at the character type selection and have the
      skins that people has already bought adapted to the different shapes.'
