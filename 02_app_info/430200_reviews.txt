However, I definitely recommend picking up the dlc when it is on sale!\n\nAs for the actual content Nameless ~Black & White Christmas~ which focuses on the secret character, there is no words for how emotional the feelings that are being conveyed. You feel a greater sense of understanding of the character and closure that is being convey to the main character. Not to mention the bgm blended perfectly with each change of scene or mood. It was nice the developers decide to release the translations to the audio book in pdf format along side with the cover scans.\n\nThe only downside is that the translations for commentary track from thevoice actor(Taeyeol Jeon) was omitted from the pdf. Regardless, the overall feel of the audio tracks and OST is well polished.\n\nI grew to love the character a lot more through the DLC, so please give this DLC a chance to amaze you.\n\n","timestamp_created":1531107365,"timestamp_updated":1531107365,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iIrHvuQCfNTOpQE="}
