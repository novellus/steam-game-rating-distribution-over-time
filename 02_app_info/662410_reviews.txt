The pathing puzzles are consistently very nicely put together, and blocks tend to be used sparingly as part of those pathfinding puzzles in a way I haven't really seen done in other games. The way blocks interact with turning doors and teleports is unintuitive to me, but that's not a big deal. There's no undo button which might be a dealbreaker for some, but I've played far too much Chip's Challenge for that to really bother me. The biggest drawback, however, is that many animation times are far longer than they need to be which makes executing a known solution, or returning to a previously attempted state take longer than it needs to. Pushing a block has a short animation every single time, plugging in the last chip has a several second animation of the exit activating every single time, restarting a level takes several seconds of nothing (this is to prevent accidentally restarting, but I think having to hit the button twice in a row would do this just as well to confirm), while anything is on a conveyor belt you can't move...\n\nBut all that said, I have to go back to the quick fix and addition of a very well put together new level and 100% recommend this game. We need more developers with integrity!\n\n\n\nLevel 80 takes the first level of Pocoman without any alteration. I don't support plagarizing puzzles.\n\nCircuit Dude also has only one music track for the entire game, and everything is needlessly slow. Pushing blocks has a second long animation for a push, restarting a level takes several seconds of waiting, and on placing the last item in a level there's a several second jingle and animation before you can move again.\n\nThe pathing puzzles are generally quite nice, so even with the above complaints I'd be torn on a recommendation or not. But again: I don't support plagarism.","timestamp_created":1594434100,"timestamp_updated":1594575690,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56011730432510376","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1594685107,"developer_response":"EDIT 2:\n\nThank you so much for updating your review! Hope to get some of these changes in at some point! :)\n\nEDIT:\n\nHello, again! I have pushed an immediate patch to be live for both Windows and macOS. This change includes a completely new level 80, which mechanically fits way better than the Sokoban level before. I would love for you to attempt a playthrough of the level and let me know what you think of this change!\n\n- Jonathan Holmes (crait)\n\nORIGINAL RESPONSE:\n\nWow, you are absolutely correct. I have never played Pocoman, but looking at a playthrough, I see that level 80 does, in fact, appear to be completely plagiarized. I pride myself in the levels that I have created for Circuit Dude, so it is needless to say an embarrassment that this was left in to the final game. I cannot remember the exact circumstances of how this level came about, but I do know that when I found a handful of other games to inspire the design of the levels in Circuit Dude, I was sure to include at least one twist that could only exist in Circuit Dude, such as using a new mechanic, that would completely change the solution, feel, and look of the level. Among the games that I found inspiration from was a Sokoban clone that I played on my phone.\n\nI can only imagine that one of two things must have happened: 1) I recreated a level from the Sokoban clone in order to play through it with the intent of playing with the design/solution until it was a completely different level and I marked it in my notes incorrectly as being a final design. (I did launch the game with a level or two in incomplete states and had to release a bug fix. I think this was because I re-arranged the level order so many times and had several design passes through certain selections of levels based off of the notes I had made.) With the incorrect notes, it made its way into the game, getting mixed in with the other, genuinely unique and self-made levels. Or, 2) I actually did go through the entire process of creating a new puzzle using the Pocoman/Sokoban level as a base and saved it into an older stash of level data files that I had and did not include it in the most updated set of levels. This means that the new level may have been lost as I purged the older placeholder levels in favor of the (what I thought were) most up-to-date levels.\n\nRegardless of what happened, I'd like to reiterate that I completely agree that plagiarism is wrong and I must try my best to rectify this problem as it was definitely not my intention to steal anyone else's creative works.\n\nThis weekend, I'm absolutely making it my purpose to do the following:\n1) Go through and find any notes I've had with level 80 to determine what actually happened in the design process to see where my personal errors were.\n2) Go through every level that I have to review all of them for any levels that may also have this problem.\n3) I will either replace this version of the level with the level I find OR I will completely create a brand new level that will be 100% unique to Circuit Dude and can only exist in Circuit Dude, with the mechanics that I have available. (This includes any other level that I feel is not genuinely Circuit Dude.)\n4) I'm going to push this update out as soon as possible.\n\nI'd like to thank you for bringing this to my attention and I'd hate to think that I let you down, or anyone who purchased my game. I'm a solo developer and this is really the first project I've ever sold, so I'm trying my best to make sure that it's as genuine as I can make it.\n\nAs for your other complaints, I'd like to address:\n\n- 1 musical track: Part of the 2.0 update, I was able to pay my friend to produce another track for the game... The tracks alternate every other level, and, of course, the 'chill' track takes over when you finish placing the last chip. I know that music could be repetitive, but I unfortunately do not have enough funds to have more tracks produced. I tried to alleviate any repetitiveness by allowing the user to mute the music (while SFX still played) so they can play their own background music on YouTube or their own media player. If I come out with a 3.0, I'll try to introduce another track into the mix.\n\n- Waiting and speed: In retrospect, I do wish I could have balanced gameplay speed and animations a little better. With the exception of restarting a level (I want to make sure players can cancel a level reset so they don't accidentally restart) I think there are probably ways of speeding up certain animations or cutting down certain jingles to speed up the gameplay. Thanks for this comment and I'll take it into consideration for a 3.0 if I'm able to push that out.\n\nAgain, I appreciate your comment and I'll make sure to follow up whenever the patch is out for the updated level(s).\n\n- Jonathan Holmes (crait)"}],"cursor":"AoJwkcOHovMCeu+6lAI="}
