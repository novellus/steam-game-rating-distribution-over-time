If you dont mind those lights not working and im searching for the fix, then i think its a good buy if its on sale, if it wasn't i would not buy it.  But it is a fun plane, flys well and smooth.  Hope this helps.","timestamp_created":1608966519,"timestamp_updated":1608966519,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jZf4zvYCe86mvQI="}
