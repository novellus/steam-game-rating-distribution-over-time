After plane crash Stanley try to find her wife and fight against hypothermia.\n\n+ Beautiful graphics \n+ Okey story\n+ Good music\n\n- Game guides you so there is no challenge.\n- Puzzles are too easy and repetitive.\n- There is no replay value.\n- Boring\n\nSo another walking simulator.. Very linear, boring and no challenge makes this average-bad game. But... These beautiful graphics, music and okey story is reason why i ll give it positive review and guess its worth to try.., but only with heavy discount!\n\n6/10","timestamp_created":1607821159,"timestamp_updated":1607821159,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pf3mrPYCeMfVuQI="}
