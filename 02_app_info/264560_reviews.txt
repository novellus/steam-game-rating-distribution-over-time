The player's character goes \"This guy's clothes are so effeminate, what a sissy!\". All right; I guess the main character isn't just an antihero but also sexist garbage.\n\nMaybe the devs think that sexist/transphobic slurs are funny. Or maybe the devs wanted to immediately show how disgusting the main character was. Either way, I feel gross interacting with the game now.\n\nRefunded.","timestamp_created":1609318105,"timestamp_updated":1609318105,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.401459872722625732","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+q+12fYCf+jbvgI="}
