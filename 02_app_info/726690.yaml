    about_the_game: "The Su-33 has been the backbone of Russian aircraft carrier aviation\
      \ since the late 1990s and is an all-weather fighter capable of engaging both\
      \ air and surface targets. Based on the powerful Su-27 \u201CFlanker\u201D,\
      \ the Su-33 is a navalized version suited for operations aboard the Admiral\
      \ Kuznetsov aircraft carrier. Changes to the Su-33 include strengthened landing\
      \ gear, folding wings, more powerful engines, and the very visible canards.<br><br>The\
      \ Su-33 is equipped with a powerful pulse doppler radar and an Infrared Search\
      \ and Track (IRST) for engaging aerial targets with a wide range of radar- and\
      \ infrared-guided missiles and its internal cannon. For air-to-surface attack,\
      \ the Su-33 can be armed with many types of unguided bombs, rockets, and cluster\
      \ munitions.<br><br>Despite its large size, the Su-33 is very capable in a dogfight\
      \ when combined with its integral helmet-mounted sight and off-boresight missiles.<br><br>NOTE:\
