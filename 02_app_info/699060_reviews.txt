People may not know how to use a DAW like this.  It should be a workhorse computer with NO frills or games on it.  Seriously.  NO GAMES.  DAW no like share.  Live performance is intensive.  Your work computer should be for WORK only.  Take your music seriously.  Here's how to make it work:\n1. Disable system sounds\n2. Adjust your processor scheduling to Background Services\n3. Adjust your PC’s power options to high performance\n4. Make sure your PC doesn’t suspend your USB devices\n5. Disable Windows Background Apps\n6. Disable Windows Updates\n7. Turn of Windows Firewall and anti-virus apps\n8. Switch off animated windows\n9. Switch off your screensaver\n10. ~ 12. Update Drivers!  Reset and double check.\n13. Turn off USB power management\n14. Optimize hard disk\n15. Disable user account control\n16. Disable Fast Boot\n17. Close all programs you’re not using\n18. Disconnect any USB devices you’re not using.  Sometime the controller can be the issue.\n19. Try not to use USB hubs\n20. Run your DAW as an Administrator\nTY to Bandzoogle for that quick list of basics.  There is a lot more you can do with overclocking, etc. but I'm not getting into that.\n\nRytmic Live is good.  It deserves better than the other review here which sound inexperienced.  I've played electronica live with Acid / Sound Forge, Ableton and got so sick of it.  I got a DS-10 KORG on my phone to use instead & it was more reliable.  Thus far I find Rytmic to be about as reliable as Ableton, and for the price difference that means a lot.  Ableton seems to have more bugs and be more complex that needed unless doing in-house production.  Ableton Live is a scam.  It fails live, too!  Want reliability?  Get a computer and dedicate it to ONLY music.  This issues are not with the software as much as the OS.  This is why so many use Apple, but as it's basically become a company sympathizing with the culling & genocide taking place in China, they won't be around much longer.  Rytmic is a great alternative to having physical instruments, but I would still use both playin live.\n\nIf I ever play a show again I will post how it goes.  For the time being, it sure sounds sweet live from my living room.\n\n","timestamp_created":1561646529,"timestamp_updated":1561646529,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563225209712982178","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nt/YzOsCeO65xAE="}
