The controls are responsive and easy to pick up and the graphic style suits this game to a tee. Definitely worth the price if you are a fan of old arcade games and are looking for something with that kind of style to it.","timestamp_created":1605374390,"timestamp_updated":1605374390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw76Xx4/UCcpKurgI="}
