    review: '*Updated Review as of 7/7/20*

      v2.3.5

      There''s really only 3 VR Moba style games currently battling.

      Cradle of Sins/Megalith/Dead Shot Heroes.

      CoS came out of the gates swinging and promising the world and in the last 6
      months haven''t heard a peep or an update and their game is still really early
      access. Megalith had the big guns behind them being made from developers with
      AAA experience... launched their game, patched it a couple of times and continue
      to ignore the community. DSH has done nothing but get better.

      -Bots with varying difficulties

      -Crossplay with flat screen, pcvr and quest

      -Leaderboards

      -Achievement system

      -Store to buy new guns/skins with the credits you earn in game

      -One of the few games that you can run at 144hz, max settings on index no problems

      -New map with multiple lanes

      -New Heroes added that play with some of the fun things that VR brings to the
      table and different play styles.

      -And after following this game for over a year, a crazy passion from the dev
      to take all the feedback they can from the community and continue to make DSH
      better.


      *v1.0 review*

      Great foundation to work with.

      Love to play a Moba in VR.

      Multiple classes to pick (and he plans to add more!)

      Lots of ways to approach a battle.

      Dev listens to feedback and the game is only getting better.

      Really requires communication like a real Moba should

      Oculus support is getting better (snap turn added on joystick).

      Keep the udpates coming!'
