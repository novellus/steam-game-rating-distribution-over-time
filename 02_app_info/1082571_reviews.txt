If there were a skill to be gained from the DLC or a decent stat boost I might say they were worth it, but as it stands by the time you reach the second shop any MINOR stat gains are eclipsed by other gear.","timestamp_created":1561832816,"timestamp_updated":1561832816,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.62711864709854126","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2K+f0usCevTpxgE="}
