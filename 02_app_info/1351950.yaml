    short_description: Have you ever said to yourself &quot;This FPS game is really
      good, but you know what would really put it over the top? If my gun barrel would
      flap around like a nude skydiving man.&quot;? Well, we got your back; It's a
      regular multiplayer FPS, but all the guns are floppy.
