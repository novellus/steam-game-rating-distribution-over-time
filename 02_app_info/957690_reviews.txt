If you don't (you either only have the free stuff or just some chapters) then it is recommended to get those. However, probably the best and cheapest way is to get them in the Gold Edition which contains all Hitman 2 content (EXCEPT the Legacy Pack). This game is a prime example of having too many editions and bundles...\n\n[b]P.S.:[/b] This [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1131050/HITMAN_2__Silver_to_Gold_Upgrade/]Silver to Gold Upgrade DLC[/url] is ONLY for those who own the full Hitman 2 base game ([url=https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/11358/HITMAN_2__Standard_Edition/]Standard Edition bundle[/url]) AND the Expansion 1. This is also known as the Silver Edition. So the only missing stuff is Expansion 2 which this upgrade DLC provides. Don't worry though, while it does let you add it to the cart, Steam WILL NOT let you buy this upgrade unless you own the Silver Edition.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this DLC review you can find more in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]","timestamp_created":1609795701,"timestamp_updated":1609871329,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.560975611209869385","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47uDz6fYCefPBwAI="}
