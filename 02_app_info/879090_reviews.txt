While it starts out interesting and isn't too bad overall, I don't like how long the fights take, the music feels a little watered down, the controller acts even more janky and the SPAG needs even more work. Also less random bizarre names for things.","timestamp_created":1531014373,"timestamp_updated":1531014373,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.564661204814910889","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46Kvku+QCebfCpQE="}
