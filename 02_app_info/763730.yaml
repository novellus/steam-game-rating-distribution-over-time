      /><br><br><i>Ragtag Adventurers</i> is a Boss Rush game that pits 4 heroes against
      terrible monsters in Shared Screen Multiplayer. Take on challenging bosses that
      will test your skills and cooperation to the maximum. Made with a strong &quot;gameplay
      first&quot; attitude, the game aims to deliver a fun experience that will challenge
      even the most seasoned gamers.<br><br>Choose to take on the challenge as a tank,
      a paladin, a mage or a demoness fighter. Each character has a unique play style
      that is easy to learn yet still has a high skill ceiling.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/763730/extras/Boja_03_(1)_(1)_(2)-Recovered-Recovered.jpg?t=1523621724"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Tank</h2><br>The tank has perhaps the most crucial role
      of all - his job is to make sure the various monstrosities don't turn his team
      mates into vaguely shaped mounds of pain. The tools in his arsenal include a
      taunt, that will force enemies to attack him for a period of time, a movement-slowing
      smash and a damage-absorbing shield that can be used more often the more damage
      it absorbs, so timing it is crucial.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/763730/extras/Shield_Glave.jpg?t=1523621724"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Paladin</h2><br>For those who like to provide support to
      their team mater while they do the dirty work... well... the Paladin is probably
      not what they expect. The Paladin is the designated healer of the team but in
      the proper hands he can still dish out respectably, as his holy spells damage
      enemies. Aside from the standard heal, his main tool is a an orb of holy energy
      that can either hit an enemy and heal surrounding allies (providing them with
      a stackable heal over time effect in the process), hit an ally and damage surrounding
      enemies or, if the orb is hit by an auto-attack projectile, explode and heal
      allies in a large radius while also damaging enemies. <br><br>Of course he can
      also create a healing zone on the ground then proceed to get angry because no
      one bothers to stand in it, opting instead to get their face remodeled by an
      angry dragon.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/763730/extras/Medic_conceptArt_Final.jpg?t=1523621724"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Mage</h2><br>When he was young, the Mage's favorite magic
      trick was pulling a rabbit out of a hat. As a matter of fact, it's probably
      better to say that that was the only magic trick that the Mage knew. This didn't
      stop him when the call to adventure came though as he successfully repurposed
      that one trick to fight the hordes of evil. Now he can attack his foes with
      fire rabbits, ice rabbits, rabbit turrets which also serve as redirectors to
      enhance his other rabbilities (sorry). Be careful though - attacking with the
      same spell repeatedly increases its potency, but it also increases its cost.
      You have to make sure to balance damage with mana recovery if you want to last
      to the end of the fight.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/763730/extras/Ranged_01.jpg?t=1523621724"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Fighter</h2><br>How or why a demoness chose to fight among
      our heroes is a mystery but they should sure be glad she did. This is the class
      for people who want to dish out large numbers and not care about much else,
      except maybe larger numbers. The Fighter builds up a combo counter with each
      attack that increases damage, but is lost if no attack lands for a short period,
      meaning that constant pressure is key. When the time comes to really punish
      the enemy, the demoness can use her ultimate ability to summon a shadow copy
      of herself; because when it comes to hard-hitting burning demonesses, two is
      always better than one.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/763730/extras/Melee_Ver_3.jpg?t=1523621724"
