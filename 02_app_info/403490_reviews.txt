There is a lot to do, sometimes it feels like too much. As well as the general main quest progression with associated side quests you have challenge areas and player dungeons, most of which dynamically match the player’s level. Combat and quests are relatively simple. Combat is turn based and quests usually follow along the lines of kill x monsters or get y drops from monsters. There is a good crafting system in place and various standard to decent loot drops from mobs. You are able to spend skill points to not only learn new active powers but also new base skills – these new skills are available to anyone no matter what class you pick to start out. \nThe thing that most people seem to not like about this game is the in app purchases/micro transactions. Thing is they are not really necessary to make. Yes some of them can be of use, especially in the early game, but most of the really good stuff I have has come through game play not purchases. \nThis game is well supported by a very dedicated Dev how always seems to be around, unlike many bigger, more expensive titles. Yes there are issues such as limited customisation regarding you look etc, but for a game that costs less than £2 I don’t see that as an issue!\n","timestamp_created":1446133245,"timestamp_updated":1446133245,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.47413790225982666","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xMSQ2tACe6vARw=="}
