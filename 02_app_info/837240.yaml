    developer_response: "Hello,\n\nI just wanted to point out that the issues with\
      \ losing hands functionality and the buy buttons have been addressed in the\
      \ latest update:\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/gid/103582791462173953/announcements/detail/1794026904642652998\n\
      \nIn summary, controlling the notebook has fundamentally changed in that you\
      \ don't touch the buttons anymore but use a finger pointer to select buttons.\

    review: "Hello,\n\nLet me start off by saying that is is a neat concept for a\
      \ VR game. In game you manage a store by setting prices on your goods and then\
      \ selling those items to customers who come in with a preset list. As the game\
      \ progresses you can buy additional equipment to help you out. The game is simple\
      \ to learn and easy to play. \n\nThe only issue I have come across is after\
      \ day 1 the \"hands\" that you control seem to shutter and you lose a bit of\
      \ functionality when operating the buttons in game. for example if I were to\
      \ buy a tomato I would click the buy button once and yet the game registers\
      \ that I bought 4 or 5 of them.  But I can't be to harsh the game was less than\
      \ $10. Hopefully they fix these issues soon rather than later.\n\nEdit: So the\
      \ developer reached out and said that the issues that I ran into have be resolved.\
      \ I will change my recommendation to YES."
