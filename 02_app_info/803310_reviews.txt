The minigames are kinda boring, and the controls don't work great which can get frustrating fast. Additionally, the map doesn't have the minigame places marked so you end up walking aimlessly trying to find them. Additionally. you spawn in near houses, so you start buying houses to rent, but you have to travel and try to find the apartments on the unmarked map. Maybe try a different game, but unfortunately there just isn't any good Landlord simulators out there right now.","timestamp_created":1590765881,"timestamp_updated":1590765881,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ46qDCsPICe8iCiwI="}
