It has a few interesting ideas (particularly the way the weapon functions, some of the boss designs, the fire effects and shard system) and uses a lot of established mechanics fans of the genre will be immediately familiar with, such as gaining abilities from bosses. The gameplay is on the short side at around 2-3 hours but is a bargain for the very low price.\n\nAreas where it could improve include the writing (there's some awkward phrasing and a few spelling mistakes) and the controls (wall climbing could use a little work, as could the direction of dashing when using an analogue stick) but these feel like relatively minor points in what is otherwise a very strong game.\n\nOverall, Firework has a lot of heart and really feels like it was made with passion. I'm hopeful that more people take the time to experience it as it deserves way more attention.","timestamp_created":1598292683,"timestamp_updated":1598292683,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j93qkPQCfsXDnQI="}
