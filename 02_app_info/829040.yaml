    review: '[i]Light Borrower[/i] is a respectable, mostly casual puzzle game in
      which you twist and slide stuff around to try to shine light in the right spot(s).
      The trailer gives a very good indication of gameplay. It''s pretty straightforward.
      Nothing epic, not bad for an afternoon.


      34 levels, first playthrough will probably take >1h but <2h. Then there''s some
      more abstract/tedious hidden stuff to keep you going for another 1h or so if
      you have the patience: there are actually 2 ways to "beat" each level, there''s
      an alternate ending, and you''ll have to scour the post-apocalyptic cult narrative-text
      to find some hidden info. The main challenge on a level is that most slidey/rotatey
      bits are locked until you manage to get light onto them. So you start with one
      light, need to shine it onto the next control-point to activate that, then need
      to reconsider the level now that you have more control over it, etc. And you
      can''t see what''s going on in the dark, of course.


      Backing out of a level resets it, functioning as an "Undo" though it isn''t
      really necessary. Click-and-drag controls are sensible, but there''s some weirdness,
      like when you have a note or the settings screen up, clicks can still register
      [i]behind[/i] them on the non-visible gameplay screen. Standard fare for small
      Unity devs, not too frustrating here. [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2184769255]Very
      minimal settings[/url][/u], as you might expect from a Unity game.


      A few Steam achievements are a little wonky (though Steam isn''t counting them
      -- "Profile Features Limited") but you can poke around the dead Discussion Boards
      for old but useful hints.
