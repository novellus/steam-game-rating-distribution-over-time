On short rides - approx 3-5 mile long it behaves similar to other mid-low-power freight mainline steam locomotives like 2MT or Fowler, taking in account \"normal\" weight (15 loaded 2 axle cars), but on long runs (>10 miles) it may lose the speed on flat profile with small grade due to higher consumption of coal and water at these speeds (tried on Riviera coastal part and speed slowly decreased to 45-47 mph in some places). I easily accelerated it to 50 mph, but it seem other speeds more than this are achievable but with big overusage of steam power or using extra motive power or decreasing load (I'm not an expert, but it seem challenging to me). On the other hand, the regulator and reverser (in simplified HUD mode) give a lot of control over speed and acceleration (same can be said about brake system), so it looks more powerful than it looks on the first glance. In overall I can underscore that this is well modeled locomotive, not having bugs in simplified (HUD) control in freeroams (however this problem happened to me few times in career scenarios) and can fit your collection in shunting, yard-to-yard, mixed freight and slow suburban traffic, I can recommend to get it, but with some limitations I described above\nP.S. Tried this locomotive in free roaming mode, however the experience is quite big to figure out the possibilities of the locomotive.","timestamp_created":1579979889,"timestamp_updated":1579983317,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gIWW7+8CfMWF7gE="}
