    review: 'This 3D simulation concert and PC benchmarking tool features 1 anime
      girl and 2 girls as backup dancers singing and dancing with a choice of 2 Japanese
      songs with vocals and lyrics in the free to play base game. With the Encore
      Pack DLC, it features up to 5 anime girls with further customization options
      to feature any of them in a solo concert or group dance concert of 3 characters,
      10 additional songs and additional costumes and headgear with fanservice. The
      frames per second(FPS) counter and score given to your computer will be shown
      while playing and at the end of each concert performance.


      After playing through all 12 songs, I have decided to recommend this 3D simulation
      because among the 8 Japanese songs with vocals(the other 4 are remixes of their
      respective original songs), all are fast, lively and catchy and have lyrics
      in Japanese and English language and approximate pronounciation in English displayed
      as subtitles while playing the concert. Recommended with DLC for fans of Japanese
      pop music and for those who would like to learn a bit of Japanese or English
      along the way while listening through each song.'
