    review: 'The songs itself for this game are truly amazing. It''s fun to listen
      too, and fits gameplay perfectly, but whilst playing the game I got so hooked
      to the game I wanted to listen to them on my phone, so here I am. After buying
      It I thought where the soundtrack was saved too, and if your wondering the directory
      is: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Rubber Ducky and the Rainbow
      Gun\Soundtrack". The music is great and I recommend buying this, and the game.'
