    about_the_game: 'In 2082, the human species lives in peace, and its technological
      and societal evolutions<br />

      are exponential.<br />

      <br />

      This game series consisting of a season you must be through the eyes of Antoine
      Harris to a whole future universe of rich science fiction and composed of several
      stories from the past and the future.<br />

      <br />

      In this episode, Mr Harris will learn more about the past of the man with the
      headset, in particular the difficult decisions he took in the past which inevitably
      led to the dangerousness of knowing his identity. will also learn much more
      about the technological advance that the laboratory has in the field of quantum
      computing as well as in the mastery of advanced communication.<br />

      <br />

      Gameplay: The gameplay of EXOTIUM games is reduced to the strict minimum like
      a walking simulator, so don''t expect to play an action game, you will play
      to discover the history of the characters, through their dialogue and some kinematics,
      and you will be able to understand the path that humanity took to get to where
      it is.<br />

      <br />

      Duration: each episode lasts about 40 minutes like a television series.'
