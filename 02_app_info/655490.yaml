    about_the_game: During the assault on a mysterious facility, a genetic experiment
      called Rane gets the chance to escape. However, to make it outside she'll have
      to pass through all the dangerous areas of the facility, fight hostile genetic
      experiments, and defeat the ones who've held her captive.<br><br>Though, having
      been trapped and experimented on for years, she'll use the full extent of her
      abilities and stealth skills to make it out in one piece.<br><br><strong>What
      is Geneticognito?</strong><br><br>Geneticognito is a 2D platformer with combat
      and stealth mechanics. Levels consist of hazards that can either damage Rane
      directly, or detect her. If Rane is detected, security robots will appear through
      doors, and the exit door to the level locks itself. Rane may fight the security
      robots and shoot them down, but unlimited amounts of robots will continue spawning
      while in Alert state. So stealth is important!

      it a go if you like playformers :D


      I had a little glitch during the final boss though. I somehow went into the
