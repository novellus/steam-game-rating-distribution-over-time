    short_description: Naruto remains silent after learning of Nagato's painful past.
      Nagato claims true peace cannot exist in this cursed world, dismissing Jiraiya's
      ideal as nothing more than wishful thinking. Having heard Nagato's side of the
      story, Naruto gives his own answer to the quest for peace.
