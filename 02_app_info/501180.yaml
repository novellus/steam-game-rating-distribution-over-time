    review: "Positive :\n- Great atmosphere (including high quality graphics and sound).\n\
      - Fun sword/shield mechanics.\n- Short but very promissing Act 1.\n\nNegative\
      \ : \n- Teleportation mechanics only, and a bit outdated ones too.\n- You can't\
      \ pick up the shield with Oculus Touch controllers, but you can still try out\
      \ the sword (which is only half the fun).\n- The developper is kept busy on\
      \ other projects, so Acan's Call isn't getting updated or even fixed.\n\nI no\
      \ longer recommend this title even as a free demo because the shield mechanic\
      \ is broken, act 2 is nowhere in sight, and it looks like it's going to stay\
      \ that way."
