    review: I enjoyed the puzzles.  The hints were useful if you weren't sure where
      to go next, but maybe gave away too much information, so use with caution.  I
      enjoyed the nod to the original two-word command dos games, which I started
      on.  I could have wished for a longer game.  There is plenty of room for an
      expanded mystery storyline and additional exploring.  I would have enjoyed a
      longer game.
