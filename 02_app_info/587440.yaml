    review: 'A fun little game. I love the art and the extra little bit of text description
      here and there. The combat is good and i like how you can place items you found
      into a container that you can access in another play through. Eg. you might
      have a bot character who cannot use certain heal items so placing it in the
      container for when you play with a human character for example. If you are into
      these sorts of games, give it a go. (note: it seems the devs have abandoned
      finishing the game, sadly. The game had a lot of potential.)'
