    review: "We call the game \"laser chess\". I discover the game when students from\
      \ neigbour institution invited us to play after conference.\nThe rules are easy\
      \ so it is not necessary to look in the rulebook before every step.\n\"Classic\"\
      \ board is the easiest even on the medium level. \"Osiris\" board is the hardest\
      \ even on \"Anoobis\" level. \nI think that the strategy of computer on all\
      \ levels is the same but on levels like \"anoobis\" the opponent does not attack\
      \ afte some steps. So if I can predict the strategy of computer, I can win easily\
      \ even on the hardest levels. \nThe game with beamsplitters is more interesting\
      \ but not all of opponents can play with you.\nIt is difficult to find an opponent\
      \ on cloud, but you can make a first step in game and expect for appearance\
      \ of opponent.\nThe interesting plus of game is that you have 7 days for your\
      \ step so if you and opponent play in different time, you can play together\
      \ despite of this.\nThe offline version is great so I can find the opponent\
      \ even if he has not his game.\nIt will be good if the android version of game\
      \ will appear.\nAchievements are interesting, but it will be better if the number\
      \ of achievements increases.  \nBut I can't understand why I did not receive\
      \ an achievement when I killed a figure with two beams."
