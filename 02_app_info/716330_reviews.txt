Based in (a fictional) reality with just some light sci-fi elements. Story is engrossing and since all the characters goals are predetermined, it doesn't drag on and on like some others. Kind of plays out more like a movie where many VN's try to do a seasonal TV show. Only a handful of choices but they do drastically affect how the story plays out. While there is a romance element to the game it takes a it takes a backseat to the main plot. May be the first Ren'Py game I've come across that has actual action sequences. Like the artwork, music is good and fitting though not necessarily memorable.\n\nReading casually and mostly just left on auto, all ending took ~10 hours; skipping where possible. Very few games do I even try for 100% achievements but I found it was worth (the minimal) investment in this case. [spoiler] And it is one of those games where the true ending is locked behind the others. [/spoiler] Retail $ isn't bad given it's length but on sale this is a definite good buy.","timestamp_created":1604377941,"timestamp_updated":1604377941,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4wJKYxvUCf776qwI="}
