An examples: the gun doesn't have the viewfinder and the old sprite had it and when you started to shoot you could see the used bullet coming out of the up hole and the new one does not have that. The old sprite explosion had a cool animation before he exploded on the new one its just a image and thats it. The devs didn't really care about the design and just put crap on the new one which it makes me angry on it. I hope that they add a option that let you use the old sprites of Clunk becuase the new sprite completely ruins this skin. And the old one you could see the chain of the ammo attached on the gun and for some reason the new one does not have that. I'm dissapointed in you Ronimo.","timestamp_created":1593975821,"timestamp_updated":1593986852,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyqTBkPMCc6OLkwI="}
