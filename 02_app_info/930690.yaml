    review: '[h1] Experienced on the Oculus Rift with Touch Controllers [/h1]

      [i] Note for Oculus: if you''re on Windows 10, you have to do a Windows 7 compatibility
      fix or else your head will be barely above ground [/i]


      i got this on sale last week for $2.99 USD and I can recommend this game at
      that price. I would have trouble recommending this game at the full price of
      $4.99 USD basically because of the limited content & quality of content. Don''t
      get me wrong, this is a nice game for what it is, but it''s just that ... nice.


      What is this game? It''s honestly hard to describe. I hate to say it but a trial
      challenge is the best way to describe it, even though that''s kind of vague.
      Maybe it''s best to describe it as a challenge puzzle game. Meaning, the puzzles
      are not difficult to solve, but you have to learn the trick to beat the levels.
      Most of the challenging levels just come from having the correct reflexes, which
      means having the correct anticipation which usually means trial and error.


      You have a wand in each hand and you teleport around the challenges and that''s
      actually part of the challenge. You have to have certain spells ready as soon
      as you teleport. There''s even gesture based spells. However, the main spell
      is the fire spell and you have to physically throw the fireball and you do have
      to throw it very hard to throw it any kind of long distance. Your arm will get
      tired .... BTW, are you ambidextrous?


      I did enjoy the challenge. Most of the levels are well-designed, but a few just
      felt like they went on a little bit too long. The water named level took me
      many attempts before I finally got it. The graphics were okay, the voices were
      subpar, and the game ran fine for me. Ultimately, I''m not really motivated
      to finish the game though. I think I would have enjoyed it more with full locomotion
      and smooth turning with a better throwing mechanic.
