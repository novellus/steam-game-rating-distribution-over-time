    review: 'THIS REVIEW IS BEING TYPED IN ALL CAPS. LISTEN. THIS GAME WAS AMAZING.
      IF YOU HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OF STEINS GATE, STEINS GATE 0, AND EVEN CHAOS HEAD
      AND CHILD, YOU WILL LOVE ALL OF THE REFERENCES, CALL-BACKS ETC. I WAS GENUINELY
      SMILING FOR ABOUT 75% PERCENT OF THIS GAME. IT''S SO GOOD. IF YOU''RE A FAN
      OF THE SCIENCE ADVENTURE SERIES, THIS GAME IS BEYOND PERFECT. PLEASE PLAY. THANK
      YOU.
