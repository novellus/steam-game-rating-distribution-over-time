Outwardly, it reminds me of the game The Final Station, probably with art. Tower Defense mechanics are well done and add a lot of variety to the game. I liked it, however, sometimes it crashes. The developer updates the game frequently, so everything will be settled.","timestamp_created":1607882791,"timestamp_updated":1609668851,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.616824865341186523","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4067v4/YCct7zuQI="}
