      \ many in the video game industry. <br><br>Alexey Pajitnov, creator of Tetris,\
      \ said of the game, \u201CMy favorite for many, many years. Every level was\

      \ design.\u201D <br><br>In a tribute to Smith after his death in 2014, US Gamer\
      \ editor-in-chief Jeremy Parish commented, \u201C[He] created one of the most\

    review: 'This is no cheap knock-off: Tozai Games is co-headed by the guy who brought
      Lode Runner to arcades in 1984. It shows - this game has deeply thought out
      gameplay challenges, graphics and sounds. The original version is unlockable
      and has some subtle improvements of the original, while keeping the gameplay
      and vibe intact. A must-have for Lode Runner fans for for those who are wondering
      what makes this game a classic. 10/10.'
