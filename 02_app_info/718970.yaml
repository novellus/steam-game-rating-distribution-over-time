    review: "I enjoyed it up until the enemy you encounter.\n\n Solid atmosphere and\
      \ weird design.\n\nThe flaws in this game are the very hard to read notes you\
      \ collect, not being in full screen and the creature you encounter because it's\
      \ goofy as hell. Still a solid indie-horror game for the price."
