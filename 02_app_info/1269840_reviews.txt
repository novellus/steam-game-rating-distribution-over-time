In the last puzzle pack, the quotes were very pretentious, on the order of \"Are you reading this quote, or is Obsidian a number that can be divided by zero?  When a tree falls in the forest, does an angel get its wings?  Why is a beer can?\"  And so forth.  This time around the quotes sound like they are directly lifted from the Cthulhu stories.  \"Prof. Arkham was walking down the street when I saw him.  HE HAS AN OCTOPUS FACE!  AAAARGH!\"\n\nThat being said, I have to agree that monochromatic gaseous clouds do not make interesting puzzles.  Still, for two bucks, you get 18 puzzles (9  base times 2 variations), and as usual the GUI is solid and useful.  The color of space is a thumbs up.","timestamp_created":1607803536,"timestamp_updated":1607803536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.698204994201660156","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqOCjrPYCc+7MuQI="}
