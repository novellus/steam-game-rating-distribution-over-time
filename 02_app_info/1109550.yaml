    review: "This is one of the worst games I have ever played. \nWhere to start?\
      \ The commentating is AWFUL. And there is no way to turn it off. It is thickly\
      \ accented, way too loud and spoken in broken English. There are about 15 infuriating\
      \ phrases, one of which plays about every 10 seconds. The only tolerable way\
      \ to play it is with the sound on mute. The physics are mediocre. \n\nYou have\
      \ no choice but to watch the bowler slowly walk back to his mark between balls.\
      \ And it takes about 10 seconds. EVERY. BALL. \n\nFor some reason all the character\
      \ models are complete giants, approx. 8ft tall. And when I say 'all the character\
      \ models' - there is 1 model. So every player, keeper, bowler, and all the fielders\
      \ - are completely identical. \nThe game basically feels like it was made by\
      \ 1 kid in his bedroom. Thats certainly where the audio was recorded! \n\nI\
      \ only recently learned about Steam's refund policy - if I had known about it\
      \ when I bought this I would have instantly applied for a refund (a fact Steam\
      \ didn't seem to care about when I wrote to them recently - disappointing..\
      \ even though I've never ever asked for a refund before and been a loyal customer\
      \ for years) \n\xA311.39 is SO overpriced, this is not as good as a free game."
