    review: 'I haven''t finished the game - as it''s procedurally generated one might
      also ask if it''s actually possible, if you want to go the philosophical route.


      What is it?

      It''s a silly, quite relaxed game that reminds me a bit of assorted games but
      I can''t tell you why it reminds me of those games as the features in and of
      themselves aren''t what made those games or this...

      If I were forced to make this game by compiling existing games I would say that
      you should take "Toe Jam and Earl" - for the presents and silliness and combine
      it with Minecraft peaceful mode - for the exploration. (maybe sprinkle the loot
      of The Division 2 multiplied by 2 over it as well...)


      The basics of it is;

      Gather loot, use loot to craft useable things and occasionally be forced to
      create an item as the story demands you have that specific item.


      Things I didn''t like, quite minor problems:

      The inventory could have info on "hover-on" - as there are "loot boxes" in the
      game - only in game currency so don''t worry about it, it''s from a vendor as
      well so they aren''t really loot boxes, you''ll get some random item(s) by spending
      30 buttons. (the game doesn''t tell you what they are, I thought the "milk carton"
      would heal and it did, would''ve been nice to know though...)


      That you have to stop running to be able to trigger the ability to "press X"
      - I''m referring to a running puzzle, you have to use a pair of shoes to run
      - they are triggered by the right trigger, you''ll run toward the place you
      need to press X - to flick the switch - the ability to press X to flick the
      switch isn''t triggered as long as you press the right trigger.


      The settings for sound, what is a VO/V0? (music, voice, effects and similar
      clearly stated things would be better, the amount of things are good, 4 plus
      master volume - at least, they''re just not clearly defined so I''m nitpicking...)


      Things I liked:

      The silly story, the cute and odd characters, the very relaxed state of mind
      you can be in while enjoying the game, it should work for old people (as I''m
      prrof of) as well as quite young kids.


      Had I been the kind of bloke that makes list of the "game of the year-kind",
      this wouldn''t be on the list, it would however, much like Trials Evolution
      and Minecraft, be on the list of games I''d always have installed as I know
      I will have a good time whenever I start it up. (I do believe that''s a higher
      praise than "best of the current year"...)


      Give it a go, you can always refund it, 2 hours of gameplay in this game should
      be more than enough to give you an idea of whether it''s for you or not.'
