It's got a good arcadey pace to it, with things happening all over that you have to react to and lots of mode switching to different kinds of action sequences. The main 3D shmup sequences are intense but tightly controlled with lots of shooting.\n\nHowever: the constant mode switching means that they've implemented a bunch of different little action games, and I don't like all of them equally. The combat on foot part is by far my least favorite, and the most common. Turning around and shooting enemies feels like driving a drunk pig, and it seems like they think that this mode is a good way to show you new character models, with little introductions each time a mechanically indistinguishable enemy is introduced, but this game isn't good- or strange-looking enough for that to entertain me much at all.\n\nThere's a bit of a theme-mechanics disconnect in the minigames too, you're flying along powerfully, shooting down helicopters in the depths of space, and then suddenly your robot lands to have a fist fight brawl with a pack of velociraptors. You're trying to get to an 80 foot tall Kaiju so you can kill it and save the world, why are you stopping to fight velociraptors who don't even have guns and can't even threaten any civilians because there aren't any civilians in this solar system?\n\nI'm also pretty bothered that you can't hold down the attack button to shoot.","timestamp_created":1574220670,"timestamp_updated":1574220670,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.542175352573394775","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww6S3w+4Ce/2w2wE="}
