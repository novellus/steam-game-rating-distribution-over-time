    review: "This game has surprised me positively! I really like it :) The graphics\
      \ are great, there are tons of characters to talk to and the idea of the game\
      \ is very refreshing. I like doing puzzles and wondering how to move forward\
      \ in the game. I also find myself nodding my head to the beat of the music time\
      \ to time, ha ha :D \n\nFor me this is the best game I play at the moment. I\
      \ wish I could say more about the game but I don't want to spoil it. See for\
      \ yourselves ^_^!"
