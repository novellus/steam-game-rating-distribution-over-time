    review: "I wanted to like this game, I get the whole exploration thing but I still\
      \ gave up after spending copious amounts of time running around in some convoluted\
      \ tunnel system like a headless chicken, after that I never touched this game\
      \ again. \n\nYeah... It's is one of those 'Where the f**k do I go?' type of\
      \ games, where you easily get lost and quickly lose interest like I had. I know\
      \ I'm being too harsh on this small indie game, but what makes a horror/exploration\
      \ game engaging is to have more stuff happening, in a slightly more linear,\
      \ slightly branched-out level design. I'm no game designer or someone who's\
      \ patient, but at least give the player some direction and a reason to keep\
      \ going on, because I like to see more of this game's '1950's Manhattan experiment\
      \ site' type of setting, idk."
