    review: 'Cute mobile port of a simple park building game without any pesky microtransactions.

      It''s not hard at all, easy for kids to play.  Very casual.

      Cute sounds and graphics, although the sounds might get annoying after a while.

      Very mobile-based gameplay (click on the coins above the buildings)

      No micromanagement other than setting ticket prices and making sure you''ve
      got enough power, wifi, and pyrotechnics to go around.

      Upgradeable buildings, but a limited selection.

      Over 50 unique characters to unlock through regular progression.

      Didn''t find any bugs.

      I think I paid less than $1 for this game, and I recommend getting it for under
      $2 if you are into easy, casual games that look nice and don''t take much brainpower.'
