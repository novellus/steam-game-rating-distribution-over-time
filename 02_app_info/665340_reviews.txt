Over the years the developers have added numerous characters and gameplay mechanics that make this rather \"simple\" game quite engaging. There is a lot of replayability here. Again, a simple concept that's just fun and surprisingly challenging and rewarding.\n\nAs others have said, the polish is really evident in the mechanics and gameplay. Where similar VR games have developed to the point where they're simply playable... and development has stopped, these developers have really invested in the intro animations, graphical menus, environments, and updates to gameplay. It's really a well built game with attention to detail. Graphics and models are nicely stylized... character movements and animations are varied... it's well worth the spend to me.","timestamp_created":1604486979,"timestamp_updated":1604486979,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ424u4yfUCfNucrAI="}
