    about_the_game: '<strong>Lord of the Dark Castle</strong> is a casual turn-based
      retro style roguelike dungeon crawler with elements of strategy. Move/attack
      in Your turn, and the Monsters move/attack in their turn. Each level is randomized
      and will introduce new monsters as the Hero reaches deeper down into the dungeon.
      The game is played in Hardcore Mode, meaning no Save Game - death is permanent!<br><strong>The
      Demo version is limited to 750 turns of game play and limited to 3 character
      portraits.</strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Creator''s Visions and Goals with the
      Game</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li> In this game, the monsters are alive: they loot
      items, use EXACTLY the same armor, weapons and spells as the Hero. Monsters
      that have gold even go into the shops and buy gear before your Hero gets the
      chance! <br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Casual, Fast &amp; Easy to get started. Give
      it a go, and see if you get a good start with Fat Loot! <br></li><li> This is
      STRATEGIC dungeon crawler - NOT a no-brain-dungeon-brawler! Casual does NOT
      mean easy! Normal mode is pretty difficult, and you may have to try many times
      before you win the game.<br></li><li> Hand painted 2D art in high resolution,
      using Dark Gothic style.<br></li><li> Big replay value! Every new game is a
      new experience. Level randomness, monster spawns and different skill choices
      makes up for lots of variety.<br></li><li> No Skill Dependencies - Experiment
      freely! Each skill provides an important strategic advantage on its own.<br></li><li>
      Every hit counts! Making a move that ends next to a monster will let the monster
      hit first! Don''t let that happen.<br></li><li> All monsters have unique strengths.
      An &quot;ordinary thief&quot; may even be worse than a dragon! (Yes... you will
      see...*evil*)</li></ul>In this game monsters are alive. Fewer, harder, more
      intelligent mobs to provide an interesting challenge.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/358110/extras/Screen_Gameplay_Graveyard.jpg?t=1447371182"
