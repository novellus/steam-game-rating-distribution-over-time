The rhythm mechanic was cool and unique. The story was engaging. I was able to get through the game in a little under 3 hours, which was about perfect for me, since I don't have too much time to pour into games these days. Definitely worth picking up if you're looking for a quick and interesting game!","timestamp_created":1567895425,"timestamp_updated":1567895425,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4/rH2hu0CfYrs0QE="}
