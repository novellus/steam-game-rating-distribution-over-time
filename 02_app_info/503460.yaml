    review: 'Think of this as a kid''s set of fitting blocks, on steroids. Don''t
      get me wrong, this game is HARD and will test your geometrical/tridimensional
      perception to the limit.


      Don''t be fooled by the game''s first trailer, as it is very misleading. The
      second trailer is more accurate to what you get.


      I won''t lie to you, the game concept is all about testing your geometrical/spatial
      ability by passing 3D objects through a hole (no, there''s nothing dirty in
      that sentence). There is some variation to that theme, though. Sometimes you
      have to do it within a time limit. Sometimes you have to move the object as
      little as possible but can take as much time as you want. There''s also a mode
      that shows a blank object with no shadows or other indications of perception
      and you''ll have to find the matching object from a set of 4 options. On top
      of that, each object is composed of smaller units, and these units vary through
      the game--you start with cubes, then you see dodecahedrons and other units,
      for a total of 6 different units which you fry your brain while you get used
      to each of them.


      While the game starts off easy, the difficulty level goes up as you make progress,
      and it can get really hard at times.


      On the downside... (1) I understand how this can get repetitive for most people,
      but it felt like good fun for me through the entire game, which has between
      150 and 200 levels in my estimate. (2) Levels are randomly generated, and sometimes
      passing a level and/or getting a high score (if you care for leaderboards) can
      be entirely luck-based (3) some complex shapes have weird generation procedure,
      and sometimes you can find easier fits that were not intended, but those were
      very rare occasions.


      And there''s a decent-ish story to kick.


      I never thought I''d ever hate tetrahedrons, but I do recommend this game a
      lot if you find the concept interesting enough.'
