    reviews: "\u201CThe mystery was amusing, and the game itself was the first ever\
      \ attempt to incorporate 256 colors into an adventure game (sorry, Sierra).\
      \ I loved this game!\u201D<br />\r\n100 \u2013 Techtite<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201C\
      The premise behind Mean Streets is simple. What can be better than a modern\
      \ sci-fi story like Blade Runner or an old-fashioned Agatha Christy murder mystery?\
      \ The answer is obvious\u2014the two combined! Take a post nuclear war Earth,\
      \ a classic detective noir, a mysterious foe, a femme fatale, and an evil plot\
      \ to destroy mankind; mix the ingredients, stir, and voila, you have a fantastic\
      \ adventure game called Mean Streets!\u201D<br />\r\n80 \u2013 Adventure Classic\

    review: 'The story is alright, I guess.

      But the travelling is so tedious you rip your hair out.

      And it''s also partially a text adventure which means you have to type in commands
      in order to do things, yuck.


      I know I am being lazy with this review here but I don''t even care.

      Have a nice day.'
