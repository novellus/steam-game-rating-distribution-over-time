I have, this is the sequel to a game that did pretty much exactly the same thing, in fact, it's so similar that I'm going to copy & paste that review here with a couple extra notes after it:\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe store description is basically accurate, this skips everything that would normally be in a game and just gives you the space battles. If you like designing spreadsheets and broad strategy concepts, you might get some value out of this.\n\nUnfortunately for me it feels a lot like work and with very little to show for it. The entire \"game\" is the planning stage, pick and/or design some ship layouts, pick and/or design what ships will be in a formation and then just watch as the game shows you a predetermined outcome based on your choices.\n\nI won't complain about the complexity level, there is a lot to learn and if this something you want you'll get some value out of that complexity. But what you spend all of that effort to accomplish amounts to very little pay off. You could spend hours painstakingly pouring over every little detail of what ships to use and where to place them in formation and then it's just a few minutes of watching ships shoot at each other (that you don't control) and there's no larger context or purpose beyond that since there's no story or narrative elements.\n\nOh, is the battle over? Better go design another formation of ships for another meaningless battle... why?\n-----------------------------------------\n\nNow that we've covered what's the same from the previous game, let's cover what's new:\n\n1. Less content\n2. Less choices\n3. Nothing that the DLC added to the previous game\n4. Lots of more bugs and crashing issues\n5. Abandoned by the developer before it was polished\n\nSo yea, if you want more of the same in a buggier less polished version, go for it. Or you know, don't.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]","timestamp_created":1597467990,"timestamp_updated":1608680619,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548942685127258301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v8e1xvYCeYzGmwI="}
