    review: "The concept is very intriguing and some of the cases are fun. However,\
      \ major weaknesses:\n- English voice acting is poor, with exaggerated fake accents.\n\
      - Writing is also fairly poor and reads like a very stereotypical detective\
      \ novel. \n- No subtitles for a dialogue-heavy game.\n- Fifth level is frankly\
      \ offensive to the mental health community, casually uses slurs against people\
      \ with mental illnesses, and distorts real-world concepts to the point where\
      \ it's hard to tell who are supposed to be the 'real patients' (the puzzle in\
      \ that level) since the writers so clearly did not understand mental health\
      \ and misrepresented real-world concepts to make them fit their plot twist.\n\
      \nThe most fun part of this game is making fun of it MST3k style."
