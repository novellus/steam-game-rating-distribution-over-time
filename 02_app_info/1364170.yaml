      /><br><br>  This is an adaptation of a board game for two players.<br>  The
      game takes place on one playing field. In turn with the enemy, you make moves
      with your cards or use objects. To win the game, you need to destroy the main
      card (Place of Power) of the enemy. There are no pre-prepared decks here - all
      cards and items are selected in turn from the general list. Already at the stage
      of choosing and placing cards, you can get a significant advantage over the
      enemy by blocking or taking the cards he needs.<br>  All cards in the game (Heroes
      and Places of Power) have basic characteristics (attack, defense, health) and
      2-3 unique skills. Items play a supporting role. They can both enhance the basic
      parameters of your cards, and inflict direct damage to enemy cards.<br>  For
      a comfortable game, it is better to start playing with a friend, gradually learning
      the abilities of different cards and objects, their strengths and weaknesses.
      There are currently 35 Hero cards in the game, 6 Power Place cards and about
      30 items.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1364170/extras/------------------iii2.jpg?t=1609874974"
