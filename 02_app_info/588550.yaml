    review: "Cheap and good but don't expect much more than magic versus zombies.\n\
      \nWell this could easily be deemed a negative for the lack of content and the\
      \ rail game play. Kind of a bite off HordeZ. But I am going to say this is a\
      \ buy to play once or twice or if you just want to blow off steam and kill some\
      \ Zombies. This is good for showing off to those new to VR, those who easily\
      \ scare and at parties. For $.99 you really can't complain a whole lot. The\
      \ graphics look good, the attacks work, there were no bugs that I noticed, and\
      \ instead of using guns you use magic attacks,i.e., the \"High Templar\" name.\
      \ There are temporary items like a shield and hammer that can be used upon recharging.\
      \ The rail play may still make some over sensitive to sickness a little queezy\
      \ but it should be tolerable. The game play is slow. There is a video below\
      \ to show the first and only level. If the developer can add more interesting\
      \ levels and bosses than this could be a nice rail shooter like HordeZ. My rating\
      \ for what is there is a 5/10. \n\nVideo here and in 4k after processing. Enjoy.\n\
