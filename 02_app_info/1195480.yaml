      \ His intense, sprawling creation is the perfect complement to the soul-crushing\
      \ first-person shooter, offering gripping heavy metal guitar riffs (\u201CRip\
      \ &amp; Tear\u201D), relentlessly pounding drums (\u201CBfg Division\u201D),\
      \ and terrifying industrial synths (\u201CHellwalker\u201D). The world evoked\
