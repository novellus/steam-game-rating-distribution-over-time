      \ durch ein Portal auf die Erde kommen, das m\xFCssen wir verhindern indem wir\
      \ ihr Portal schliessen\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1] Ein simpler Pac Man Klon. Wir\
      \ laufen umher und m\xFCssen alle Sumpf/Gras Felder entfernen indem wir einfach\
      \ dar\xFCber laufen. Es gibt verschiedene Aliens die uns daran hindern m\xF6\
      chten, manche sind schnell, manche verfolgen uns gezielt. Wenn wir 3 mal getroffen\
      \ werden, heisst es Game Over und wir m\xFCssen von vorne anfangen bzw. das\
      \ Level wiederholen. Es gibt nat\xFCrlich auch power Ups die uns helfen z.B.\
      \ um schneller zu werden, um Aliens zu vernichten oder um uns zu Heilen. Nach\
      \ gut 20-30 Minuten hat man es dann auch schon durch gespielt\n\n[h1] Pro/Contra\
