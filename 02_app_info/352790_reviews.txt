All controls are static and cannot be changed, and all button prompts are for a controller. The gameplay isnt terrible, and the music is awesome. I have to give this game a thumbs down because without a controller it is not enjoyable to play KB controls are not intuitive. If these get fixed I may come back an update my review.","timestamp_created":1559189465,"timestamp_updated":1559189465,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56603771448135376","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+uS7g+sCcvStwgE="}
