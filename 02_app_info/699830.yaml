    review: 'This game is aesthetically pleasing with emotionally charged music to
      pair with. It brings that first time of playing a new IP that is certainly exciting
      by virtually imprinting a strong sense of a space base environment as the main
      theme of the game.


      Gameplay is much more forgiving compare to grand titles like portal 2, its less
      fustrating as it challenge first timers with interesting puzzle but not to a
      point you really stuck or have to search for youtube playtrough for it. The
      game has a solid average 2hr+ play trough time for those who speed run and up
      to 5hrs+ for regular and casual players.


      The game mechanic utilize refreshing "body transfer" ability much similar to
      the game soma in theory except that you can instantly experience different perspective
      at an instant, with that it would be up most interesting to see if the game
      would use this feature to its advantage for any possible dlc or a sequal with
      this as its intention.


      Story isn''t a strong point of this game, its kept simple which is most likely
      the developer''s intention but basic enough to follow trough breadcrumbs of
      each section to unfold the story as it goes along.


      Controler is left much to be desired. At first its disorienting to not have
      total camera freedom by just binding the free view on to a mouse, having to
      constantly hold right mouse is a bit of a tiring option especially when the
      game encourage viewing around for potential interactive object. The need for
      an option to change control bindings is desperately needed. On a side note the
      game is thoughtful of allowing players to review the key function option just
      at the bottom left corner.

      On a possitive side note the key is real time responsive and the transition
      and move around is very smooth.


      Option to be able to switch between windows screen and the game is instantaneous
      and best of all it doesn''t lag which is always a welcome option as I multi
      task a lot of stuff and most of the time I would get load lag even when modern
      games offer "window screen"


      Overall I give this game a solid 7/10 among most of the other game that is most
      likely coming from indie studio base on graphics, audio, control, presentation,
      story and potential. Its one of those hidden gems that isn''t discovered due
      to tons of games bombarding the steam store everyday and just so happens that
      this game pop up a brief moment on my store page. Worth supporting for the product
      it delivers with that price tag.'
