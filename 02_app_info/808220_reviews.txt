Sadly, that excitement was very short lived. I came into this game with very minor expectations with very little content, which is what I received. I was more than okay with that though, because I knew how early it was in development, and that it was going to continue to get updates. The game slowly got less and less support, until none at all. The discord became quieter and quieter from the creator, until completely silent by him and everyone else. This was the type of vr game I really wanted, and was looking forward to watching it grow, but instead, I was forced to watch it die. Do not buy it and do not support it. This game hasn't had support for more than a year. The last message from the creator was on 8/11/2019. I wish the supporters weren't fed false hope, and I hope that maybe one day this game will get support again. Until then, don't even bother.","timestamp_created":1598475450,"timestamp_updated":1598475450,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.667402505874633789","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw6fajlvQCcvv5nQI="}
