    about_the_game: "The iconic Class 180 \u2018Adelante\u2019 speeds into Train Simulator\
      \ in distinctive Grand Central Trains livery.<br><br>The five-car sets were\
      \ built by Alstom at their Washwood Heath plant between 2000 and 2001 for First\
      \ Great Western, who wanted to increase the frequency of their express services\
      \ between London Paddington and South Wales, and became part of the Coradia\
      \ 1000 family, alongside the popular Class 175.<br><br>Nicknamed \u2018Adelante\u2019\
      \ by First Group, the Class has had a chequered career, being late into service\
      \ in the early 2000s and returns to their leasing company, Angel Trains, ahead\
      \ of schedule in 2009. Subsequently, they were assigned to other train operators\
      \ and in 2012, five sets were refurbished by First Great Western.<br><br>In\
      \ total, only 14 sets were built and despite their reliability problems, are\
      \ still in operation today for Grand Central Trains, First Great Western and\

      \ to a Cummins QSK19 diesel engine, identical to the engine fitted to the Class\
      \ 220 \u2018Voyager\u2019. The \u2018Adelante\u2019 is also unique in being\

    review: It's an okay DLC. It used to make my game crash whenever I tried putting
      it into a scenario in editor mode. A lot of people are right about the kettle
      sound after 20mph. Do I recommend this? I would only recommend this if they
      removed the kettle sound.
