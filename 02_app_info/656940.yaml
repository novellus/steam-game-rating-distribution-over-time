    review: "The Theodore Adventures is a platformer that unfortunately feels unfinished,\
      \ and is both short and extremely long...\n\nYou can find about 10 minutes of\
      \ gameplay amd commentary here:\n[url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzGVhEOnEGE]\
      \ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzGVhEOnEGE [/url] \n\nYou play as Theodore,\
      \ who wants to fly to Juicy island - an island full of fruit - but he needs\
      \ to buy a plane to get there. The goal of the game is to trade 100 coins per\
      \ stage for gold ingot and when you have enough ingots, to buy the plane. \n\
      \nLets begin with the positives and work our way down. Art wise, I feel the\
      \ game is done well. To overcome flat looking stages in a 2D style, the stage\
      \ backgrounds are drawn in layers, allowing for depth in in the levels that\
      \ it would otherwise be missing. This detail can also be seen in the enemy types\
      \ which vary in look and are in line with the level environment. They all move\
      \ in set paths and are destroyed by jumping on them (except one type that cant\
      \ be squashed), but this variety keep the stages interesting during the initial\
      \ run through.\n\nThe music is an 8bit synth style and is fine to listen too\
      \ while playing. There is no way lower the volume of the game music or turn\
      \ it off that I have found, so hopefully you enjoy it if you buy the game. :)\n\
      \nControl wise, it is a simple platformer, with left - right and a jump key.\
      \ It can be controlled by either keyboard or a gamepad, but for some reason\
      \ the game has been designed that you need to press a button to transfer control\
      \ from a gamepad to keyboard or back again. I don't understand why it was designed\
      \ in this way, and initially I did not have my controller connected so when\
      \ I ran the game I could not actually start it. It wasn't until I reloaded the\
      \ game with a controller attached that I found I needed to press the enter key\
      \ to move controls to the keyboard. \n\nIn game physics is a bit off, on early\
      \ stages if either foot is not on a platform you fall off, but as the game progresses\
      \ you can stand with one foot off a platform and stay on it. Also enemy hit\
      \ boxes are noticeably larger then they are drawn, so you can take damage if\
      \ an enemy has not touched you or you can destroy an enemy sometimes by landing\
      \ next to it. Inconsistencies like this don't make for an enjoyable playthrough.\n\
      \nFinally is the game length. There are a total of 10 stages, each of which\
      \ can be completed within 3 minutes provided you don't die and have to start\
      \ over. This means you can see all the content in half an hour, but you get\
      \ one gold bullion per level and need to buy the plane for 600 ingots. Going\
      \ for this final goal would result in repeating each of the 10 stages at least\
      \ 60 times, at 3 minutes a stage you would be looking at doing the same levels\
      \ for 30 hours. I cannot understand why the plane is so expensive, or why anyone\
      \ would play the same 10 stages for that long just to get it.\n\nAs it is on\
      \ release, I cant recommend this game as I while feel it is an OK platformer\
      \ in gameplay (putting aside the few game bugs) it comes across as unfinished\
      \ in design."
