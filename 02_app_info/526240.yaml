      Silicon Storm! We've had a lot of fun making this game, and we're excited to
      hear what people think! If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions
      for what you'd like to see in CloudBound, please let us know! <br><br><strong>A
      Virtual Reality Grappling Hook!</strong> <br><br>CloudBound is a VR platformer
      where the player uses a Grappling Hook gun to swing, climb, and fling their
      way to the top of each level. Using our DFoV System (&quot;Dynamic Field of
      View&quot;) we've managed to dramatically reduce simulation sickness to the
      point that users can move comfortably at high speeds! Don't take our word for
      it, let us know what you think! <br><br>This game is currently planned for Early
      Access, as we have many more additions currently in production; new levels,
      hazards, mechanics, graphics updates, and story elements will all make their
      into the game with each update.

    review: abandoned game. i brought it when the Vive first came out and its not
      had any updates since then, shame as the level that you do have is quite fun
      but very very short, i think you can complete the level in like 10 minutes,
      such a shame
