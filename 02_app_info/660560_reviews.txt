IMO i think it needs some good game pad control integration to make it easier to just fish and have fun as well as making the menu navigation easier also. Just my opinion though, regardless one of the better fishing games out there. Keep up the good work and updates sir! I would recommend this to novice plunkers and avid fishermen!!!","timestamp_created":1560268584,"timestamp_updated":1560268584,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwxKbQo+sCdYCcwwE="}
