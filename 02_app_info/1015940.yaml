      \ The stories are not one to one like you would experience in true crime for\

    review: Perfect game to play on a cold winter's night. While the meta storytelling
      convention can wear a bit thin at times, it's a rich story driven game filled
      with viscerally striking moments, beautiful illustrative art direction, quirky
      characters and charming music. If you're a fan of Night in the Woods you'll
      certainly appreciate this similar, albeit shorter and delightfully Nordic, effort
      (although with an antagonist cheekily named 'Leeroy Brown' there's still quite
      a smack of Americana - turns out the US hasn't cornered the market on post-industrial
      melancholy).  Have a feeling this one will stay with me for a while with its
      darkly humorous atmosphere of tragic tales.
