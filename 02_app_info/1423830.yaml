    about_the_game: Cave crawl is an action-packed first-person melee adventure where
      you navigate your way through chambers of enemies to hopefully climb out alive.
      On the way you may find mysterious merchants who sell strange and curious items
      to aid you on your journey. <br><br><strong>Game mechanics</strong><br>Fight
      your way through 5 levels containing 4 rooms with random layouts of enemies
      and objects. Use your sword to defeat your enemies with either a slower heavy
      attack dealing more damage or a quicker attack dealing less damage. Deflect
      incoming damage with a well-timed deflect to be able to buy you some time for
      your next attack.   <br>If your back is against the wall you can always try
      to escape with a rechargeable dash to increase the distance between you and
      the enemy.  <br>Buy upgrades from the store to modify your sword to be longer
      for reach, heavier for dealing more damage, more health, faster attack speed
      or faster dash recharge.
