Though the story again has some lapses. The HOG-Scenes are well rendered, and some of the puzzles included in this game are pretty well made. All are solvable, and there is a reset key if someone just botched up enough of a puzzle to make it harder to solve.\n\nThis game isn't on the unfair side of HOGs, where you need a magnifier attached to the monitor to find pieces of the Scene. Or you can't find items through odd coloration issues.\n\nThe story as a whole is okay, nothing too fancy. It's about the ghost of a witch, that wants to return to live by possessing the body of a living person, and you are the one who needs to get rid of her once and for all. The Bonus Content also is well made. One thing about achievements in Hidden Object Games... they are pretty superfluous, most of them you gain automatically. And those few that realls require some more drive are also the same that can utterly frustrate you. This is couterproductive in a \"meditative Playstyle\"  and devs really need to look deeper into the \"Is an Achievement required, or is it just a barrier to assess the motivation of the player?\" In HOGs the latter is doubtful, since HOGs often have no replayability - there is no alternative route to discover, or no open World to Explore... it is a storytelling medium, nothing more. IF for any case an achievement would make sense would be if the story within the HOG contains twists and turns, alternative endings and of course the option of choice. At the moment most HOGs don't offer this kind of Storytelling, most are pretty liniear, and often pretty restricted in the topic. Visual novels on the other hand often have shallow storytelling, and most often too many choices and therefore consequences - I have learned my piece about VNs as well, and I have to note, that not all VN are badly written scripts there are some precious pearls among them. \n\nSo would I recommend this game to a prospective buyer? Yes. This one is a bit better than the first of the series, it contains some logical lapses too, but don't bother too much about it... how is the Song of Queen back in the eighties? \"It's a kind of magic!\" and there are worse methods to waste your time actually.","timestamp_created":1572845132,"timestamp_updated":1572845132,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjoO4mu4CeJ6x1wE="}
