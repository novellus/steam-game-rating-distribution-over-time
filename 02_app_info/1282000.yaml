      \ Be careful though as sick people everywhere are coughing. The more unruly\
      \ patients have also been hiding toilet paper around the hospital. Collect 5\
      \ toilet paper rolls on each floor to unlock the next one, avoid getting coughed\
      \ on and make it to the helipad on the roof of the hospital. <br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nWhen your health gets low, wash your hands at the sinks on each floor. Be\
      \ careful though as you can only wash your hands every 30 seconds. When your\
      \ spray bottle is low,  go to the sanitizing stations to refill every 10 seconds."
