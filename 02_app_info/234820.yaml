    review: "Programma indispensabile se si aggiornano frequentemente i driver. \n\
      L' utilizzo pi\xF9 comune per il quale ne faccio uso e per la cancellazione\
      \ di tutti i driver nVidia prima di installare i nuovi onde evitare conflitti\
      \ e quel fastidioso messaggio \"i driver video sono stati ripristinati\" e tutti\
      \ i crash che ne susseguono. \nL' ultimo utilizzo risale a oggi per l' upgrade\
      \ alla versione 361.43 dei suddetti driver. \nNon ha mai sbagliato una volta.\
      \ \nForse il costo \xE8 un po' troppo per un applicazione del genere ma in saldo\
      \ e da prendere assolutamente, prima o poi torner\xE0 utile."
