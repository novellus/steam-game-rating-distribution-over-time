It is very very rough, with quite a collection of bugs and glitches and a translation that is not the best written English around, but the location is unique (though, and I risk it saying this without being from there, I feel a lot of anachronisms going on) and that actually gives a lot of interest to a point n click game that feels, again, like Still Life and Mystery of the Druids mixed together.\n\nMusic is nice but glitches make that two tunes are playing at the same time. The backgrounds and animations are ok but there are moments where the perspective is lost because the collision is not well designed. The investigation is interesting, though it is weird to have the cutscenes portraying a different main character than the one you have in the normal game. It is barely comfortable to play, but it has TWO hint systems plus the hotspot detection, something I consider really generous and nice.\n\nTo be completely honest, I would give a more clear recommendation, despite its bugs and translation, if it did not felt so much like a deja vu of so many identical adventures but spoken in Farsi. And this is the real problem of this game: so, so derivative. Nice to play, but derivative.","timestamp_created":1587335168,"timestamp_updated":1587335168,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgJCjyvECdrGJggI="}
