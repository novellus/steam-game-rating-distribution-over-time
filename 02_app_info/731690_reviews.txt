It'd be good to have a setting for single player that lets you turn off the timer all together to get true turn based not active battle system turn based.  The matches should last longer too I think as it progresses. A way to level up and feel like you're progressing is the most important addition this needs out of any that I mentioned.\n\n\nI can see this is early stages though since options are greyed out for now.\n\nIf you want to see turn based games evolve in VR, support these kinds of games that are experimenting with how the dynamics could work.\n\n","timestamp_created":1524273487,"timestamp_updated":1524273487,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544868350028991699","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yfPx8uICfc/WngE="}
