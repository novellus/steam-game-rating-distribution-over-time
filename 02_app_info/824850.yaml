    review: I got through the game in 2 hours & I won't lie, I expected it to be more
      action packed than story-based. Its a very simple, very quiet, enemy-less little
      click through game. But my GOD I'm so glad I stuck with it because the FEELS.
      THE FEELS, MY DUDES. *AND THAT ENDING*. MY HEART! Absolutely loved this little
      story. 10/10
