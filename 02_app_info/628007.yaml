    short_description: It's summer break for Sakura Nene, aka Nenecchi, but Suzukaze
      Aoba isn't getting any break from work as the game's closing date draws near.
      In fact, Eagle Jump is looking for part-timers to help out with the debugging,
      and Nenecchi may have something to say about that.
