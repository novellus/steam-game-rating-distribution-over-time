Each track is very short, and by the time you play enough of the game, the music will be so grating that you won't want to hear it again. Especially that main menu theme. I never want to hear that again.\n\nOtherwise, all that comes with this pack is a wallpaper of the game's main menu, some bonus concept art, an instruction manual (you can read it [b]in its entirety[/b] in this DLC's screenshots) and a pathetically-short \"anime\" of the main character [i]turning her head[/i] (no seriously, it's just three seconds long and you can watch it [b]in its entirety[/b] in the main game's store description).\n\nPlease don't waste your money on this DLC. Get the main game, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/recommended/444000/]I do recommend it[/url], but don't bother buying this DLC.","timestamp_created":1541466490,"timestamp_updated":1541466526,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56449127197265625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk5Kk8+YCdOyQrgE="}
