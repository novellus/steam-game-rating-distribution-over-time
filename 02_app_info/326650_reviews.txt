I loved party FPS games from the years of Aye Of The Beholder, Mensomeranzan and the Dangeon Manster games, so I tried to play on in order to reveal any hidden good attributes of Legend of Vandlewind... It didnt mabage to keep me playing, so many months later, I prefered to unistall it to get space for other games.,.. Thus, I would not recommend it to nobody, since there are much better same style games available nowdays (after LoG revived the gentre).","timestamp_created":1590265321,"timestamp_updated":1590265321,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44uLMofICcrXqiQI="}
