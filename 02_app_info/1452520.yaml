      Product History</strong><br><i>Night Below: An Underdark Campaign</i> (1995),
      by Carl Sargent, is a standalone Underdark campaign. It was published in November
      1995.<br><strong> <i>Origins (I): A Boxed Campaign.</i> </strong> By the mid
      ''90s, TSR was producing generic campaigns as boxed sets. Some were one-off
      campaign worlds, like <i>Council of Wyrms</i> (1994) while others were really
      big adventures like <i>Dragon Mountain</i> (1993) and now <i>Night Below: An
      Underdark Campaign</i> (1995).<br><strong> <i>Origins (II): The Return of D.</i>
      </strong> <i>Night Below: An Underdark Campaign</i> (1995) is clearly intended
      as a reinvention of Gary Gygax''s original series of &quot;D&quot; adventures.
      Like that primordial campaign, <i>Night Below</i> is set in a peopled underdark
      with monstrous cities and entire civilizations beneath the earth.<br><i>Night
      Below</i> even includes an Underdark ocean called &quot;The Sunless Sea&quot;,
      which is an obvious homage to the otherwise unexplored locale mentioned in D2:
      &quot;Shrine of the Kuo-Toa&quot; (1978) and D3: &quot;Vault of the Drow&quot;
      (1978). Given Carl Sargent''s past work as the main architect of Greyhawk, this
      has led some to speculate that <i>Night Below</i> was originally intended as
      a Greyhawk campaign -- or perhaps as a trilogy of adventures, for its clearly
      broken up into three equal parts. Unfortunately, author Carl Sargent would not
      be able to speak to this speculation.<br><strong> <i>Origins (III): The Mysterious
      Disappearance of Carl Sargent.</i> </strong> <i>Night Below</i> was Carl Sargent''s
      last work for TSR. Around the same time he was hired by FASA to become the new
      line developer for their <i>Shadowrun</i> game. He left Nottingham, to catch
      a plane to Chicago to accept the job ... and was never heard from again.<br>Various
      reports have speculated that he was in a car accident, that he suffered some
      other &quot;medical problem&quot;, or that he purposefully disappeared. None
      of this has been confirmed. Some reports suggest that even his family doesn''t
      know what happened to him. In any case, since 1995, Sargent has been gone from
      the industry (and from his professional career). Paizo editor Erik Mona made
      a new attempt to track down Sargent in the early ''10s and had one of &quot;Sargent''s
      most frequent collaborators,&quot; tell him: &quot;I''ve always thought that
      if people want to disappear, they should be allowed.&quot;<br><strong> <i>Adventures
      Styles: An Adventure Path.</i> </strong> <i>Night Below</i> follows in the footsteps
      of the &quot;D&quot; adventures in another way: it''s early adventure path,
      meant to bring players from first level to somewhere in excess of tenth. However
      unlike modern adventure paths, <i>Night Below</i> doesn''t really contain enough
      challenges to level the characters up. <i>Night Below</i> alludes to this by
      suggesting that players use &quot;side-plots&quot; and &quot;mini-adventures&quot;
      to flesh out the campaign and give it more verisimilitude. Online, <i>Dragon</i>
      editor Dave Gross was more adamant, saying, &quot;Don''t forget that it''s highly
      recommended, even necessary that you expand the Night Below campaign with short
      adventures&quot;. Of course, he suggested <i>Dungeon Adventures</i> as a great
      place to find those mini-adventures.<br><strong> <i>Adventure Styles: Locale-Based.</i>
      </strong> <i>Night Below</i> is largely a locale-based adventure. There''s a
      sandbox of a town for the first section, then a ruins crawl, a mine crawl, and
      lots of underdark crawls.<br><strong> <i>Adventure Tropes: Bringing Down the
      House.</i> </strong> The players must invade a few different cities. The attack
      on the kuo-toan City of the Glass Pool is a pure hack-and-slash. There''s even
      a &quot;Social Collapse Point system&quot; that describes what happens as the
      players murder-hobo their way through the city.<br>The invasion of the Great
      City of the Aboleth could be equally violent, but there are also suggestions
      for quieter infiltrations, which is more in tune with how players were expected
      to interact with the great underground cities of the original &quot;D&quot;
      adventures.<br><strong> <i>Adventure Tropes: Let''s Negotiate.</i> </strong>
      In fact, there are lots of options for negotiation in <i>Night Below</i> , trading
      in simple hack-and-slash for more meaningful interactions with these Underdark
      cultures. But it''ll all depend on the players ...<br><strong> <i>Not Necessarily
      The Miniatures Tie-In.</i> </strong> Wizards of the Coast apparently liked the
      name &quot;Night Below&quot; because years later they released <i>Night Below</i>
      (2007) as an expansion for the <i>D&amp;D Miniatures</i> game. It has nothing
      to do with Sargent''s adventure of a decade earlier.<br><strong> <i>Exploring
      Greyhawk.</i> </strong> Though <i>Night Below</i> is a generic adventure, the
      presence of a Sunless Sea has led many to place it in Greyhawk, beginning on
      the opposite shore from the &quot;D&quot; adventures.<br><strong> <i>Monsters
      of Note.</i> </strong> So who are the newest monsters filling the Underdark?
      Sargent begins with some classics like <i> illithids</i> , <i> kuo-tuo</i> ,
      and <i> svirfneblin</i> . He also highlights the <i> derro</i> , who were mentioned
      in early sources like the <i>Dungeoneer''s Survival Guide</i> (1986), but who
      had been most prominently featured in Greyhawk adventures. The drow are largely
      missing, but have been replaced by the new <i> rockseer elf</i> race.<br>However,
      the <i> aboleth</i> are the most important monster to rise to newfound Underdark
      prominence. Like the derro, they were mentioned in the <i>Dungeoneer''s Survival
      Guide</i> , but this was their first notable Underdark appearance. It would
      turn them into one of the major races of the under realms.<br><strong> <i>Monsters
      of Note: A History of Aboleth.</i> </strong> The aboleth were created by David
      &quot;Zeb&quot; Cook for I1: &quot;Dwellers of the Forbidden City&quot; (1981),
      where they''re described as &quot;an amphibious, fishlike abomination.&quot;
      They quickly became associated with Lovecraftian monstrosities, but fans have
      suggested that their inspiration could just as easily have been any number of
      weird fish, including agnathans or hagfish.<br>They were soon reprinted in the
      <i>Monster Manual II</i> (1983), then received a complete &quot;Ecology of the
      Aboleth&quot; in <i>Dragon #131</i> (March 1988), the &quot;Descent into Deepearth&quot;
      issue. There, Brandon Grist introduced even more powerful variants: the greater
      aboleth, the noble aboleth, the ruler aboleth, and the grand aboleth. Their
      only other starring adventure role was in &quot;Intrigue in the Depths&quot;
      in <i>Dungeon #12</i> (July/August 1988), which also introduced the saltwater
      aboleth.<br>The aboleth returned for AD&amp;D 2e (1989) in <i>MC2: Monstrous
      Compendium Volume Two</i> (1989), but only in its original form. That was it
      until the release of <i>Night Below</i> (1995), the most aboleth-y adventure
      ever, and also the one that introduced yet another variant: the aboleth savant.<br><strong>
      <i>About the Creators.</i> </strong> Sargent was the master of Greyhawk throughout
      the <i>From the Ashes</i> era, but this was his final release for TSR.<br><strong>
