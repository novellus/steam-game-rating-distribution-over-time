Never had a problem before, but now they start to launch, then go right back to \"Launch in VR\", as if nothing has happened. Now occurs with all 360 videos. \nFortunately, I've found, that if you shut down VR, then launch a 360 video from the desktop without VR running, it will start the VR and work normally.\nI like it. It's really short, but I like the lighting effects, colorful and cool.\n\nP.S. - 360 VR videos will not work off-line. When I try to launch one off-line it says \"Playback of a 360 video requires installation of the Steam 360 video player\", so I go into tools and there it is, installed. So I start the 360 video player and it says \"To watch a 360 video, find the video in your steam video library and click watch\". So I do that and it says  \"Playback of a 360 video requires installation of the Steam 360 video player\". Catch 22 nightmare. They work when on-line, so they should also work off-line. I will buy 360 videos again when it all functions properly off-line, but will not purchase anymore till that happens.","timestamp_created":1571612596,"timestamp_updated":1571704129,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43ri3+O0CdY671AE="}
