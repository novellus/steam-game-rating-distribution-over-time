The base game released with 6 races and, 7? classes, a plethora of biomes and maps and all the base content for 50$ so an asking price of 40 bucks for the DLC is a stretch. The first expansion had new battlemaps, a quest system, map structures and most importantly: A new minor faction (plus a few extra neutrals), a new Class + a new campaign and baseline planet to play with. \n\nFrom what I can tell, we'll keep getting balance updates for a long while, I bet two to three more races, two more planet types and one more class. Not to mention a dozen or so new neutral mobs (much needed, Hopperhounds are fun and all but MORE please) and whatever new ideas they come up with later.\n\nI.E, I think 40$ isnt a bad asking price for what we can expect to get + at least a year more of updating.","timestamp_created":1576022106,"timestamp_updated":1576022106,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.611456513404846191","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+ZuP+e4Cdf2+4wE="}
