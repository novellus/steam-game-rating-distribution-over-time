    review: "I unironically love this visual novel. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019\
      ve read something so bad that it actually flips over to being amazing, but My\
      \ Billionaire Boss has done it for me. Granted, the writing is juvenile and\
      \ riddled with typos and grammatical errors, and the characters all act like\
      \ they\u2019re in middle school, but its immaturity is part of what makes it\
      \ so dang entertaining to read.  This is clearly a teenage girl\u2019s fan fiction\
      \ of what it would be like to date a super hot billionaire executive; it's wildly\
      \ inaccurate as to what actual corporate life is like, but also really funny\
      \ in a way only a teenage imagination can be. So much of what happens in the\
      \ story is ridiculously silly and illogical, especially when it comes to its\
      \ totally clich\xE9 and melodramatic relationship drama, but I haven\u2019t\
      \ laughed so hard while reading something in YEARS, and I honestly need more\
      \ like it.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1813768130\n\
      The premise itself is ridiculously dumb. You\u2019re the executive assistant\
      \ to the CEO of a multi-billion dollar design firm. Through a string of contrivances,\
      \ you end up dating your boss\u2019s super hot brother, which is when your boss\
      \ realizes that despite working for him for 3 years, he needs to get into your\
      \ pants RIGHT NOW! Depending on your choices, you can either spend the rest\
      \ of the game cheating on your boyfriend with your boss (which is honestly the\
      \ only way to go), or try beating him off of you with a stick. Cheating and\
      \ grab-assing aside, everything else about the story is so outrageously unrealistic\
      \ that it\u2019s endearing. In order to drive home just how rich these characters\
      \ are, the writer continually tries one-upping their displays of power and wealth\
      \ with a ridiculous amount of name-dropping. And when they\u2019re not measuring\
      \  dicks over who\u2019s higher on Forbes\u2019 Top 10 List, they\u2019re bragging\
      \ about how incredibly handsome they are.  \n\nBut with as bad as the writing\
      \ is, the artwork is actually really freaking good for a Wattpad-novel-turned-otome-game.\
      \ Almost every single character with dialogue has a sprite, and they\u2019re\
      \ all really detailed and attractively drawn.  As for the CGs, they\u2019re\
      \ fantastic! It\u2019s too bad that the writing accompanying them is too silly\
      \ to be taken seriously, because this game has some of the best kiss CGs I\u2019\
      ve seen in a while. Unfortunately, kissing is about as much as you\u2019re going\
      \ to get out of this story, however. While there\u2019s a lot of teasing and\
      \ back and forth between the characters, the writing itself is pretty chaste.\
      \ Sure, there are a few desperately steamy encounters, but if you\u2019re expecting\
      \ much more than some vampire-like neck sucking, you\u2019ll be fairly disappointed.\n\
      \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1812869419\nThat said,\
      \ I do recommend My Billionaire Boss, but with the HUGE stinking caveat that\
      \ you not take it seriously as an otome game, because you WILL be disappointed\
      \ if you do. But if you can shut off the part of your brain that questions every\
      \ stupid thing that happens in the story and just enjoy the ride, you\u2019\
      re sure to find this insanely silly take on dating a billionaire to be entertaining\
      \ as all heck!\n\n[code][h1]Curated by: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32217440-Bad-Otome-Games/]Bad\
