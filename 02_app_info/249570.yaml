    about_the_game: The Castle Doctrine is a massively-multiplayer game of burglary
      and home defense.  It's 1991, and things are bad.  You're a guy with a house
      and family.  Other players are coming to take what's yours.  Build security
      to stop them.  Study their houses, buy tools, and break in to take what's theirs.  Everything
      you do is permanent.<br><br>I'm Jason Rohrer, and The Castle Doctrine is my
      10th game.  It's a bit hard to describe, because there's never been anything
      quite like it before.  It's a brutal game in terms of its perma-death and perma-destruction
      consequences, and it is turn-based, so it's rather Rogue-like.  But building
      such a brutal game in a multiplayer context, with absolutely no cushion between
      players to stop them from brutalizing each other, is quite strange and new.  <br><br>Everything
      is real in this game.  When you rob someone, you are actually hurting another
      player in a permanent way by destroying and stealing their hard work.  When
      someone dies in this game, they lose everything and start over.  If you devise
      perplexing security systems, you can perma-death other players when they come
      to rob you.  Watching those security tapes, where someone gets what's coming
      to them, is an exhilarating experience.  On the other hand, you just killed
      someone and perhaps caused them to lose days of their hard work.  And you've
      been on the other side too, losing everything because of some thoughtless move
      you made in someone else's house.<br><br>But there is no randomness in this
      game, so everything is fair.  When you die, it is always your fault.  When things
      get dicey, you can always retreat back out the front door to save your own neck.  Of
      course, human folly will get the better of you.<br><br>Here's what you get when
      you buy the game:<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>A lifetime account on the central
      world server that I'm running.<br></li><li>Access to the full game source code
      (after launching the game on Steam, go <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://thecastledoctrine.net/sg/server.php?action=show_download_link"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"  >here</a>).<br></li><li>Everything you need
      to run your own game server (requires a PHP/MySQL web server, download the source
      bundle to get started).</li></ul>
