Everything from artifacts and treasure chests to hero skills and spells are copy-pasted or as I said, reverse engineered from Heroes 2 and 3.\n\nIt starts off nice though, and it has a heroes-like atmosphere that I liked. \n\nLater the game goes to total troll mode; You basically cannot fight without ghosts, as the monsters on the adventure map will be around 10000 tier 7 units, like Titans or Dragons and such.\n\nI did finish the game, as it is not very long.\n\nI absolutely loved the adventure map graphics, they are well drawn. Too bad rest of the game is basically stolen.\n\nI want a new heroes game as much as the next guy, but seriously.. \n\nI don't know why or how they can sell this on steam, I think there should be lawsuits and such due to the fact it is so carbon copied from the early heroes games.\n\n============\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Good üëç\n+ Very good adventure map graphics\n\nThe Bad üëé\n- Rest of the game is basically stolen","timestamp_created":1522770301,"timestamp_updated":1593945086,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.570822715759277344","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg/uhj/MCc7CunQE="}
