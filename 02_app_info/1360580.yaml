      />.<br>The Fire is a difficult 3D platformer in a world that grows around you.
      You play as a reincarnated stone and try to piece together where you came from.
      As you move through the levels it becomes increasingly difficult and managing
      you're momentum and balance will become a challenge.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1360580/extras/art-style.jpg?t=1608636519"
      /><br>The Fire features a low-poly art style that creates a relaxing and serene
      environment to explore to contrast the difficulty of the game.  As you progress,
      not only does the world grow bigger, but the soundtrack will rise and fall with
      the world itself.

    review: This is a great game! I really enjoy the difficulty level and unique challenges/mechanics
      that I encountered while playing. I really appreiciate the devs constant updating
      of them game. For example, When the game launched it was pretty short with not
      a lot of features and content. Now there is a pause menu, main menu, saving
      and loading, and three new chapters. Overall, very fun and worth it.
