    about_the_game: This game is a full 3d in your face missile shooter game. We took
      an old arcade missile game and mixed it with strategy elements and created a
      wild missile shooter that will keep you on the edge of your seat.You set up
      your battlefield with 6 units consisting of 3 Surface to Surface missile launchers,
      1 Surface to Air missile launcher, a radar system and a command bunker. When
      both sides are ready you fire missiles at each other until all 3 SSM's are dead
      or you lose the command bunker.

    review: "This is a good game for those who like a casual missile defense game\
      \ but are tired of all the flash Missile Command clones. This game differs from\
      \ Missile Command in two major ways...\n\n#1 being that it's in 3D of course.\
      \ and you get to set the locations of your units before each match.\n\n#2 It\
      \ isn't all about defense. You have to take out your enemy to win. \n\nThink\
      \ of it sorta like the classic board game Battleship. You are the total missile\
      \ commander flicking between defense and offense as easily as you press the\
      \ space bar. The controls are simple enough, using your mouse to aim the recticle\
      \ and fire your SAMs as well as plot targets on the map for your offensive missiles\
      \ which depending on the map can come in 6 different flavors (3 standard 3 special)\
      \ \nNow there is multiplayer over LAN and IP but I haven't actually tried that\
      \ yet but for $4.99 it makes for a good singleplayer skirmisher, casual but\
      \ still fun."
