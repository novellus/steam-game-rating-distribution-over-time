    review: 'It''s a VR version of the 8-bit classic The Sentinel and as such it works
      perfectly. I love the immersion it achieves. Great to include a game mode that
      emulates the original, although, personally, I have discovered that I like the
      other mode better, because it is faster. Simple graphics, reminiscent of the
      original game. I wonder what the game would look like with better graphics,
      more elaborate trees and landscapes (this is a suggestion for you, dev). The
      gameplay, anyway, is great. Makes you want to move one more level forward.

      Played with Oculus Quest via Link and Virtual Desktop. Runs flawless in both
      ways.

      I really like this game.'
