    about_the_game: 'This pack contains the following items:<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Turret:
      Railgun<br></li><li>Hull: Hornet<br></li><li>Skin: Railgun XT<br></li><li>Paint:
      Clay</li></ul><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/639531/extras/2_GIF.PNG?t=1570494452"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Railgun</h2>A Railgun kinetic weapon and the &quot;X&quot;
      Tank are the ideal combination for waging battle in circumstances where any
      other weapon could fail. Huge open spaces proved to be excellent testing grounds
      for honing the performance properties of the Railgun. It is able to cut through
      several enemy tanks at once before they are even in range to offer counter fire.
      This weapon is perfectly paired with Hornet to create a devastating marksman
      build.<h2 class="bb_tag">Hornet</h2>It was developed by Antaeus to effectively
      promote their &quot;X&quot; Tanks on battlefields around the world. Hornets
      can appear right in front of the enemy''s nose at lightning speed and smash
      their position. This hull can withstand direct hits and still stay on track,
      but it is not good for performing quick maneuvers on a dime.<h2 class="bb_tag">Note!</h2>
      You can purchase only 1 Pack per 1 Tanki X account. Refund is not available
      if you purchase 2 different packs, which include the same weapons, hulls, and
      skins or you already have the items from the pack! The items will be granted
      to the account that you use to log into the game through Steam.'
