The B-roll footage is very beautiful and the dialogue scenes are well framed and well lit.\n\nDon't expect things to be explained to completion which again could be intentional but for me a tiny bit unsatisfying.\n\nI enjoyed the atmosphere and the setting which was enough for me to like this slow-building and cerebral movie. The relationship structure between the deifferent families seemed very real and starkly accurate compared to the vague setting of location/time period.\n\nWould recommend if you want a slower, more abstract story.","timestamp_created":1473123741,"timestamp_updated":1473123741,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41I3B/tYCecflYA=="}
