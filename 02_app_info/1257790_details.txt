It is provided in DLC form as a convenience for those users who wish to experiment with it. It is complicated to set up, not suitable for all purposes, with no guarantee of success. If you are not comfortable with experimental software, that requires a lot of tweaking, and may not be suitable for your purposes, then please do not use it. It is not, under any circumstances, to be considered as &quot;production level quality&quot; software.
