Unlike most reviewers it took me almost an hour to find all the birds. To me, spending a dollar for an hour of entertainment, is a good price, especially when a lot of games cost more than that per hour when averaged out so in the end, even though it's an extremely short game, I feel like it was worth the time and money I spent on it. However, I do wish there was more too it, and less achievements. \nThe only thing I didn't enjoy was the fact that every bird has an achievement to go with it so it was a little annoying having those constantly popping up and blocking the screen. For me, one at the beginning, and maybe one every 25 birds (at most) would have been enough, but that was just a minor annoyance to me. \nThe other thing I expected, was that there would be something at the end of the game, but instead clicking the last bird results in nothing more than it being colored in like every other and the number countdown disappearing from the screen so you will just have to congratulate yourself for finding all the birds.","timestamp_created":1609252116,"timestamp_updated":1609252116,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4tK51/YCd7y6vgI="}
