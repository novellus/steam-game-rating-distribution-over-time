Seriously, nothing else comes close to offering as little content as this DLC and it costs $15. $5 should be the price before sales.\n\nBasically all this DLC adds is the native government types and allows you to use them for customer nation shenanigans (notably with migration cooldown ideas). It's a good meme for custom nations but not good enough to cost 15 bucks.\n\nIt also adds the random new world option but the land in the new world is almost always disappointingly small and uninteresting. It's supposed to replace 2 continents but it's never enough.\n\nI bought this DLC through a certain morally questionable key selling website in protest of how absurd the price point is. I didn't even save money, I just made sure it didn't go to Paradox.","timestamp_created":1609289023,"timestamp_updated":1609289265,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.540636062622070313","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49q3H2PYCcMLPvgI="}
