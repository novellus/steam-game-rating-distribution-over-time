Gives a glimpse on Fushimi Inari Shrine site.\nNeed to adapt to walking part with knuckles a little bit, but it works. (great danger of motion sickness, because orientation is rasterized only, strange standard motion settings, not smoth enough. But hey, itÂ´s impressive. (The VR version tested) \nVideo shows much better resolution than standard VR environment, be carefull. I judge on, because PIMAX 5K+ shows enough details for comparison.","timestamp_created":1609436830,"timestamp_updated":1609436830,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwk6P63PYCe6WVvwI="}
