      \u4E01\u4E48\uFF1F\uFF09[/strike]\n\nA RPGMaker-based TTS(Tower of the Sorcerer)-like\
      \ game! The game has some unique mechanisms (skill point trading system, moving\
      \ monsters) and puzzle-solving part that require the player to be a big brain\
      \ in order to beat the game, and player even needs some predictions to dodge\
      \ the damage! The game currently has a bit bugs that just ruin the momentum\
      \ a little. BUT as long as the creator keep fixing them, this is a great game\
      \ to waste another 5 hours of your boring life! Worth the price, recommends\
      \ add it to wish list.\n\nPros:\n-Unique system, fun to play\n-Moving monsters\
      \ for you to dodge, sometimes can be challenging!\n-Some FINE anime art, girls\
      \ are cute\n\nCons:\n-Personally hate the \"stamina\" system, not working so\
      \ well in this game\n-No hints or skip for puzzle solving, which means small\
      \ brain like me will easily stuck for a LONG TIME\n-A few bugs, hate to see\
      \ it\n\nScore:\n7/10"
