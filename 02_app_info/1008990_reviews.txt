I wonder about the mental state of the person/s that developed what was released. All there is to do is throw around a box, break barrels and a few other objects and swing a staff or sword. Three minutes into it and you are done. There are two bowling lanes with pins at the end that you are unable to interact with, don't understand what this has to do with the premise of the game. There is also a duck like creature that bounces up and down leaving a trail of fire from its eyes. You are also unable to interact with this strange creature, so once again I ask what does this have to do with the game? And seeing that this was released approximately 18 months ago I seriously doubt there is going to be any further development. I would very much like a refund!","timestamp_created":1607025142,"timestamp_updated":1607025142,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwj7WKlfYCdYSJtwI="}
