    review: 'This game is not for everyone. Definitely a LGBT theme and its a point-and-click
      story. True to the Luke Miller brand, this game is loaded with innuendos and
      campy fun. Artwork is excellent for the genre that doesn''t disappoint.


      My only constructive feedback is that you will need to use a guide to get through
      the middle of the game to the end. Some scenes don''t explain what you need
      to do and I think it was intended for "discovery," but even that was too difficult.
      Major piece of advice is to save often.'
