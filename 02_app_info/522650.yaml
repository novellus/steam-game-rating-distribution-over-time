    review: '[b]NOTE[/b]: [i]As of 27th October 2016, this change is now in effect
      and you can play DLC songs in a special DLC dungeon to use your own customised
      party setups. Woo!

      Rating bumped up by 0.5, portions in the review that are no longer applicable
      struck out and edited.[/i]


      Picked this up as soon as I could - mere hours after its release. All great
      chiptune songs - I generally like that genre of songs.


      This pack comes with 3 songs and 3 associated arena challenges. I personally
      find them slightly more challenging than their similarly-rated counterparts,
      and the reason for this is [strike]twofold: one,[/strike] the note charts are
      a lot more technical, even though the songs are not really fast [strike], and
      two, you are restricted to using a specific set of abilities since you can only
      play them in Free Play[/strike].


      [strike]I do feel a bit disappointed, like a few others, that I can''t use my
      preferred party setup. But this [i]will[/i] be changed in the future - and even
      if not, on the flip side of the coin I relish in learning how to adapt and still
      nail the high score runs.[/strike]


      The arena challenges offer interesting equipment as rewards - not strictly overpowered
      enough to be essential, but still fun enough to spice up your game with new
      interesting item combinations.


      And, like the rest of the game''s base soundtrack, the songs in here (especially
      Flow Unlimited) are now stuck in my head.


      [h1]When to buy[/h1]

      If you like replaying for high scores you''ll definitely get a lot of mileage
      out of your 2 bucks. Just be warned, the more difficult songs will have you
      close to playing Twister with your fingers.
