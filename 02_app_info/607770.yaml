    review: 'Moonatees puts you in a quirky little VR world where you deal primarily
      with the effects of zero gravity and not having opposable thumbs. It''s weird
      enough to be interesting and there were enough things for me to poke at and
      figure out that I played it more than once. There are no enemies or time limits,
      so there is a non-competitive exploration vibe.


      As of the posting of this review I have just over 1 hour of gameplay logged.
      For five bucks, there are much worse VR games out there. I''m glad to have been
      able to support the devs before they released their game for free (as they said
      they eventually plan to) and hope they keep creating.'
