      sim set in the Roman Republic.<br><br>You get to see how life was in the Ancient
      Republic, participate in their various customs, festivals and Ludi / sporting
      competitions, while raising a family and moving up in the social and economic
      hierarchy in the Republic.<br><br>You can educate your children, marry them
      off, sponsor their elections and much more. You''ll usually play as the eldest
      of your sons once your character dies.<br><br>The game is open-ended without
      a set endgame just like in real life, but a grand goal for any ambitious Roman
      family was to land a Consulship of the republic. This could be your goal in
      the game as well, climbing the Cursus Honorum and becoming a &quot;New Man&quot;

      down from time to time and you might find all that you worked for being taken
      away from you in an instant, but the way things are set up you''ll almost certainly

      core philosophy of the game is that just like in real life, there''s no winning
      or losing, just experiencing life and having fun at it no matter where it takes
      you. The game should be fun in its own way at every level, no matter if you''re
