      /><br><br>January 1944. The German Army had their last toehold on the Dneiper
      River. This salient projected between two powerful Soviet army groups, the 1st
      and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts. Though weakened in their previous efforts against
      the Germans, on January 25th and 26th, these two powerful groups attacked and
      surrounded two German corps.<br><br>The Germans responded quickly to this threat,
      hurrying reinforcements from other sectors. Their relief drive made good initial
      progress, but stalled in the face of stiff Soviet resistance and both sides
      antagonist, &quot;General Mud&quot;. In the end, the trapped Germans made a
      desperate breakout attempt from the pocket. Less than half of the encircled
      forces escaped the trap, with none of their heavy weapons or equipment.<br><br>Battle
      For Korsun is a simulation of these battles in January and February 1944. Players
      control the various German and Soviet forces which took part in these struggles.
      The Soviet player must coordinate the offensives of his Fronts to encircle the
      Germans quickly before the Germans powerful reinforcements arrive. The German
      player must form a pocket perimeter, then orchestrate his relief drive with
      his Panzer divisions to rescue their trapped comrades<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/672140/extras/keyfeatures.png?t=1564045112"

    review: "What I love the most about this game is it\u2019s simplicity, it reminds\
      \ me of the old Avalon Hill board game \u201CBlitzkreig\u201D! This game has\
      \ so much potential and I love playing it  - when it\u2019s working - that is.\
      \ Constant crashes have ended my playing it, I\u2019m hoping some fixes come\
      \ out and soon. The manual could also use some work. Half the time I have no\
      \ idea what\u2019s going on. \nIf the improvements are made I would purchase\
      \ the add ons in a minute."
