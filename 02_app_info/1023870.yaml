    review: 'Checkpoints are in an odd spot. And I can''t get out of the first area
      as the terminal that unlocks the door is guarded by two grabbers. Too bad because
      I liked the looks of this game. But this game is too much trial and error for
      my taste. Even more so then Limbo/Inside.
