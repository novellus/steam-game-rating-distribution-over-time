    review: "Garbage in several different ways.\n\nI like a good pokemon knockoff\
      \ as much as the next, or even a half decent pokemon knockoff but I can find\
      \ nothing redeeming about this game.\n\n\nPoorly translated (with parts of it\
      \ left untranslated), glitchy (randomly couldn't catch a wild monster I had\
      \ caught before even when I had its health low and enough capture discs), awful\
      \ mon variety (beat the first gym and had only seen 3 different wild mons, 2\
      \ with the exact type and the exact same stats, not even a single point difference\
      \ in attack, def or speed. as well having the same move (what the fuck?), one\
      \ the game wouldn't let me catch), completely mindless  (every singe battle\
      \ can easily be won by pressing attack) and i got my mons to level 9 and only\
      \ my starter learn an extra move, the other 2 losers were stuck with the basic\
      \ attack command. Also the guy outside the gym says to go north. I beat some\
      \ team rocket knockoffs, and find the north exit in both that town and the the\
      \ previous town blocked off. \n\nAbsolute garbage. Even the review below me\
      \ flat out saying this is the best game ever could only bear to play it for\
      \ an hour and a bit. And I have a strong suspicion the review below is a shill\
      \ account\n\nLike if he truly thought he had found the greatest game ever, why\
      \ would he only play it for an hour and a bit after a full month?"
