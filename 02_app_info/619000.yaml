    detailed_description: "<h1>The Road to Riley Short</h1><p>Back in 2007, I got\
      \ the ambitious idea to turn a story of mine into an animated short. Loving\
      \ animation yet having absolutely zero experience producing it, I figured out\
      \ what needed to be done, saved a ridiculous amount of my meager salary, found\
      \ and hired talented people to do the things I couldn\u2019t do myself (like\
      \ animate), and in 2009, \u201CKid with a Rocket Launcher: The Fuzz of War\u201D\
      \ was completed. <br>Again in 2011, I did it all once more, for a completely\
      \ different idea of mine. It took 2 years again, a ton of my own hard-earned\
      \ money again, and \u201CTeaKitties\u201D was finally born in 2013. I even managed\
      \ to do the storyboards for that one on my 3DS (with the \u2018Colors! 3D\u2019\
      \ app).<br>I did those two animated shorts because I love being creative. I\
      \ threw a large percent of my annual, modest office manager salary at them to\
      \ make stories that I could be proud of, even if not many people could see them.\
      \ I love KWARL and TEAK, and they will forever be a part of my creative DNA.\
      \ <br><br>In 2015, I got the itch to do it again. However, instead of simply\
      \ doing another animated short, I was inspired by all the talk about VR, and\
      \ along with Unity suddenly offering their software for free, I decided to turn\
      \ my new idea into a VR experience (with some fun 2D animation included).<br>March\
      \ 9th, 2015. That was the day I realized I should make Riley into something\
      \ to enjoy in VR. March 10th, 2015, I downloaded Unity for the first time and\
      \ got to work learning the program from scratch. I can\u2019t remember a time\
      \ in my life I wasn\u2019t playing video games, but I had never seriously considered\
      \ making a game before that day. I estimate the first year of development was\
      \ spent coming to grips with Unity (thank you tutorial videos), while year 2\
      \ was spent actually building Riley toward my vision. Mention must also be made\
      \ of the very talented freelance artists from across the globe who contributed\
      \ to this project. One of the other reasons I do complicated things like this\
      \ is to work along with other creative individuals toward a common goal. It\u2019\
      s educational, inspiring and rewarding.<br><br>So what you now see before you,\
      \ on Steam, for $7.99 (and $3.99 for the soundtrack!), is my newest 2-year+,\
      \ self-funded, creative effort. I sincerely hope you enjoy it.</p><br><h1>About\
