    review: 'If you like the Angry Birds sets of games then this is a game which can
      relate very similarly to the Angry Birds genre. I really enjoy this game because
      you can strategise the launching/flinging move of the Piggy Princess herself.
      Another nice feature that makes it different from Angry Birds is the use of
      objects; it''s a but like animism, only you can use the objects to strategise
      your moves. For example, in one level you have to startegise with levers, boulders
      and magic all at the same time.

      If you would like a game that works very similarly to Angry Birds but still
      has its differences, then I would recommend this game to all gamers. It''s an
      interesting title that''s worth the purchase.'
