The character creation in this game has been one of the best I've seen and allow you to make any hero you could think of.  It's nice too when you see other heroes or villains in the game that have made awesome characters and you fight with them.\n\nWhile the character you make does have that special something, the whole character interaction with npc's almost seems to take a step backwards compared to wow.  The combat is a nice change from wow, it always makes you feel like your doing something in fights.\n\nIs this game for you? If you have high levels in other games like WoW, chances are you will both love and hate the game for some of the points above and will end up leaving after a few weeks.\n\nFor me, it has been a good game to try and I did enjoy the time I played.  Chances are I won't go back into it unless I'm going to try it out with mates.\n\nEdit: Well it would be silly to buy it now, the servers are down forever.  Was an awesome game while it lasted.","timestamp_created":1292856213,"timestamp_updated":1386195659,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j+Xs38ICfPfGAw=="}
