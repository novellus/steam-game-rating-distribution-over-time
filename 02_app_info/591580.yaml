    review: This is one of the most boring HOGs I have ever played. The developer
      did get better over time, but their first game, ( this one) is one of their
      worst. The rest of the series is more entertaining then this one. It's a great
      attempt at a first, but over all it's still pretty boring. Not Recommended!
