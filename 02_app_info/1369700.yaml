      \ /><br>Optimize the costs and schedule of the flights. Mind that each object\

      \ /><br>There are hundreds of thousands of objects in the Asteroid belt alone.\
      \ Some are made of water, others might contain precious metals. Deploy various\
      \ telescopes, arrays and probes to know the system better and plan your next\

      \ the profits to expand your corporation and start the projects on much larger\

      \ /><br>Your ultimate goal will be to make the moons and planets of the solar\
