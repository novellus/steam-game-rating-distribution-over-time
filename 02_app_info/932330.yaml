    review: "Did you watch the 44 second long trailer on the store page and then look\
      \ at the screenshots on the store page? Congratulations you have now seen 100%\
      \ of the game. This is not a joke.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
      \nWhat you are buying is not a game that you can \"play\" it's a digital book\
      \ with ciphers and puzzles that require you to go do research on the internet.\
      \ There's not even a way to input what you discover into the game. Your \"game\
      \ play\" is quite literally to view the book (as shown in the trailer) and then\
      \ alt-tab out of the game and go read about the puzzles that you are trying\
      \ to solve. \n\nIf you finish them it will be outside the game on whatever piece\
      \ of note paper you are using to keep notes. There's nothing else to interact\
      \ with in the game, there's no way to input your solutions to even find out\
      \ if you are correct. You just look in the game, see the puzzle and then google\
      \ the information it's trying to talk about and read more there.\n\nEven the\
      \ achievement isn't for playing or accomplishing anything, you just flip the\
      \ pages a certain way and it pops up.\n\nI'm at a loss for explaining how this\
      \ has 100% positive reviews up until now. Well congratulations, here's the first\
      \ thumbs down.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
      \nAnd before anyone says I should have read the store page, let me quote the\
      \ store page:\n\n\"Alchemia is a cryptic puzzle game which is solved through\
      \ research outside of the game.\"\n\nYes I fully understood that this was going\
      \ to be a cryptic puzzle game and that it required research outside of the game.\
      \ I expected this to have ARG elements and require abstract thinking. However,\
      \ I also expected it to be longer than 2 minutes of content. You are given 10\
      \ pages to read in-game, they might as well have just been screenshots posted\
      \ somewhere on the internet. And you have no way to input your solutions in\
      \ game.\n\nThis is quite literally a collection of screenshots that lead to\
      \ a puzzle that requires you to read Wikipedia and guess whether you solved\
      \ it or not since you get no feedback from in the game at all.\n\nThis entire\
      \ game is less content than the main menu page of most other games.\n\nThis\
      \ review is longer than the contents of this game.\n\nThis could have been a\
      \ clever marketing toy for another game if it was given away for free and led\
      \ you to information about the game it was advertising, too bad it's just a\
      \ list of things for you to google after reading a few pages.\n\nSeriously,\
      \ watch the trailer, that's the entire thing. You just flip the pages and then\
      \ go google for the information that's on them.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While\
      \ you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want\
      \ to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]"
