What am I guessing is that when the creators were making this game, they thought to themselves: \"Let's make something cool!\" And as a result, they did made something cool. That is all, It's only cool and nothing else.\n\nThis game doesn't have any kind of direction for its motive. Things happens in this game, but I don't have any kind of reason to care for it. The game just moves by itself, without thinking about me. It's not trying to take my interest; All it does is moving the mystery.\n\nAs a player you keep asking to yourself: \"Why should I care about this or that?\"\nThe characters for an example. They purely exist for giving you the information you need, so the main character plays it cool and talks smoothly with them. Alright, but why should I care about the main character's objection?\nThe game doesn't even give you a clear explanation on what she wishes for. In certain stories that is fine, but you gotta put some kind of thing for the reader to care about. Especially at the beginning.\nThe way this visual novel starts... Just plainly direct. When the opening started I couldn't believe it, What I had just read did not felt like a prologue at all; It was just a boring casual scene and nothing more.\n\nThe side characters has their own problems that connects with the mystery. \nThey will get in your way and that fact will make them unlikable. Every single trait of theirs is connected with the mystery that I had no reason to care about, so bye bye the possibility of me caring about the characters.\n\nWhat do you think was the biggest mistake that the game made? \nNo music. I do not care even a bit if it has some in it... It rarely plays anything. Like, that is probably one of the worst choices that you could possibly make in a mystery visual novel where you needed to have the reader's attention. You could give the characters some cool ost and from the music we would 'feel' the character. Maybe that would make it way easier to read the dialouge(I was sleepy while playing the game.) \n\nThat said, I was not expecting this game to work on my laptop; considering its high quality look and effects. It is definitely one of the most beautiful looking EVN ever made. It looks cool, very cool. \n\nYes, just cool-looking. That is all there's to it.","timestamp_created":1593713778,"timestamp_updated":1593713778,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1cuviPMCe7ihkgI="}
