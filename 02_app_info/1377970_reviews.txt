It has an ok story, with some funny references, and I liked the mechanics since we have the option to move our characters on the keyboard. My only issue with it is that I experienced some bugs, nothing too serious, but one of them was that even though I completed my quest it showed as incomplete, and I had to figure out what to do next by guessing, so sometimes I got stuck. Since the game is pretty new it`ll probably be fixed soon, so I didn`t mind it too much, I think this game has great potential to be a very fun and enjoyable experience, hope the developers keep updating it so we`ll have more things to explore.","timestamp_created":1606426920,"timestamp_updated":1606426920,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxLCgg/YCdLr4sgI="}
