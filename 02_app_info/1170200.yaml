      \ game in which you play as a little hero named B\xF4. His quest will lead him\
      \ through enchanted forest and temples where he\u2019ll need to deliver shamans\
      \ from corruption before the sun sets forever.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Environments</strong></h2>This\
      \ game has 10 playable levels in which you\u2019ll discover forest and temple\

      \ puzzle-oriented.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Skills</strong></h2>Throughout\
      \ the adventure, you\u2019ll learn many skills to help you during your quest\
      \ such as dashing through walls, push rocks, double-jump and even transform\
      \ your character in a little sphere to access new opportunities.<h2 class=\"\
