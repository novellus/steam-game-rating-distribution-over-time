    review: 'There are NO holographic dancing people as  of now.  If you already have
      a media viewer this offers nothing

      new in that regard but what is has works well enough.  I do like that I can
      start a TV show or video and then walk around

      while it is playing just because this is the only player I have that I can do
      that.  So it''s one of those toss ups where a

      middle of the road recommendation is warranted. So I''m picking the thumbs up
      option just to be on the sunny side.
