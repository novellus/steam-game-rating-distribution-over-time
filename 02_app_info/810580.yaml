    about_the_game: <strong> About the game </strong><br>  This game is a Brazilian
      comedy game, an RPG produced in RPG Maker. The game is in english now too.<br><br>  It
      focuses on people who enjoy bizarre humor and without baseness and profanity,
      and also without appealing sexual content, is a game for all ages.<br>In particular
      it is focused on Brazilians who enjoy a simple and humorous humor, with well-designed
      characters and very funny battle animations, despite having more normal techniques
      as well.<br><br> I'm putting the game online here on Steam because I think a
      lot of people can give their opinions about the game making it better, please
      think about it and help me make a great game, I know that as it is already will
      provide good laughs because the game was done with a lot of dedication.<br><br>  If
      the game has any problem with the letters of the game I added a font in the
      files of the game in two clicks and install it.<br><br><strong> Systems </strong><br>-
      Rpg Maker 2003's standard battle system, ie active turn-based battle system,
      however the animations and monsters follow a standard Rpg Maker 2000. All scams
      are drawn in sprite by me.<br>- It has a system of forging equipment, making
      each enemy has a utility in the game because it will give unique pieces that
      can be improved in the equipment stores.<br>-The game is very linear but from
      the half of the game, where it is now, will have a more open approach where
      you can choose between 9 paths where each path will focus on a character, his
      story and the villain that corresponds to him. THIS PART IS IN DEVELOPMENT,
      AND WILL APPEAR IN THE NEXTS VERSION OF THE GAMES.<br><br><strong> Duration
      </strong><br>  The whole game is well playable, with content for around 3 hours
      of play, and in case you like to win levels and do a lot of missions, it gets
      a lot better.<br><br><strong> Graphics, Music and Resources </strong><br>  The
      graphics are my own and the developer mac blue telekon, I used them as a base
      because they are very beautiful.<br>  The songs are standards of Rpg Maker 2003.<br><br><strong>
      History of the game </strong><br>  During the era of RPG Maker 2000, the main
      character of RTP (the character pack that comes with the RPG Maker) Alex has
      been participating in all possible games imaginable and many characters in the
      RTP package have become secondary characters.<br>Many of these characters then
      wanted more important roles generating conflicts and wars, so these characters
      were sent to the world of Rober for a greater participation, but even there
      not everyone had peace, some grouped together with their friends and formed
      villages living in peace, getting happy to just say hi, others want to be heroes
      at all costs.<br>One of these groups is called the Rober people (People 1-3)
      if isolated from the world and seeks to live in a peaceful way, even because
      they are weak, they worship the mole and practice mole-fu. And from this people
      the author of the game chooses him to be the hero taking prominence and other
      legalities that a hero has, kiss a pussycat, participate in minigames, get strong
      punch bad guys, steal wallets of monsters, enter any house and talk to everyone
      as if no one cared that he invaded the house.

    review: "Confesso que quando comprei o jogo esperava encontrar a vers\xE3o antiga\
      \ dele \"Las aventurietas  del Robercleiton Turbo\" que come\xE7ava com o Rafael\
      \ Mori com uma marmita nas costas, infelizmente n\xE3o encontro mais esse jogo\
      \ em lugar nenhum :v\n\nSobre o jogo, ele mantem a mesma ess\xEAncia deste que\
      \ citei anteriormente, varias piadas sobre arqu\xE9tipos de RPG Maker, jornada\
      \ do her\xF3i e tudo mais, alem de um mau gosto proposital em certas ocasi\xF5\
      es, que d\xE3o identidade a obra como a dublagem e alguns personagens... ok...\
      \ todos os personagens asuhaush\n\nSe voc\xEA chegou at\xE9 aqui j\xE1 deve\
      \ conhecer um pouco sobre RPGs ent\xE3o deve se familiarizar com as mec\xE2\
      nicas do game, o combate \xE9 em turnos com uma barra de preenchimento para\
      \ se realizar uma a\xE7\xE3o, semelhante ao de chrono trigger, onde quanto mais\
      \ agilidade voc\xEA tem mais r\xE1pido enche essa barra.\n\nO jogo tamb\xE9\
      m possui submiss\xF5es bem simples, \"v\xE1 l\xE1 e mate cinco caras\" ou \"\
      me traga tal item\", que quando terminadas n\xE3o te d\xE3o nenhum item ou gold,\
      \ mas sim status permanentes ao personagem, o que \xE9 bem interessante na minha\
      \ opini\xE3o. O desenvolvedor promete cerca de tr\xEAs horas de gameplay, mas\
      \ com as submiss\xF5es esse tempo aumenta (ainda n\xE3o finalizei o jogo mas\
      \ j\xE1 passei das quatro horas fazendo miss\xF5es secundarias, ta certo que\
      \ sou uma lesma... mas enfim)\n\nAgora sobre alguns problemas do jogo (sim,\
      \ estou levando em conta que estou fazendo esse julgamento enquanto o jogo esta\
      \ em early acess, e \xE9 justamente por isso que estou fazendo, para quem sabe\
      \ esses problemas serem corrigidos no futuro):\n\n- Na vila dos Robers a musica\
      \ de fundo n\xE3o fecha em um loop perfeito, acredito que soaria mais natural\
      \ se ela fosse mais \"redondinha\"\n- Quando se derrota um grupo muito grande\
      \ voc\xEA tem que esperar muito tempo clicando para passar todos as \"ess\xEA\
      ncias\" que foram coletadas, isso n\xE3o incomoda no come\xE7o mas mais para\
      \ frente no jogo come\xE7a a ficar um pouco chato\n- Outro problema com as \"\
      ess\xEAncias\" s\xE3o os vendedores que fazem as trocas com elas, voc\xEA precisa\
      \ passar um baita dialogo para trocar apenas um item com elas\n- Ataque f\xED\
      sico at\xE9 agora me pareceu bem ineficiente at\xE9 agora, basicamente o jogo\
      \ roda em torno da utiliza\xE7\xE3o das t\xE9cnicas especiais, por exemplo,\
      \ enquanto voc\xEA precisa dar dois hits de ataque f\xEDsico para matar um inimigo\
      \ voc\xEA pode utilizar apenas uma t\xE9cnica especial de dano em \xE1rea para\
      \ derrotar todo o grupo de inimigos.\n- O \xE1udio da dublagem do peixe na bacia\
      \ (esqueci o nome desculpa ;-;) esta muito baixo.\n- Personagens conhecidos\
      \ no jogo... ok... isso n\xE3o \xE9 um problema na realidade, eu entendo que\
      \ isso geraria problemas com direitos autorais mas sinto falta de andar pelo\
      \ mapa e encontrar o protagonista de Terranigma ashaushuahsasa\n- Pre\xE7o,\
      \ bom, de longe acho que esse \xE9 o maior problema do jogo at\xE9 agora, sinceramente\
      \ falando ele n\xE3o vale vinte reais (pre\xE7o atual que paguei) levando em\
      \ conta diversos outros jogos aqui da biblioteca da Steam (e sim, eu li o post\
      \ do desenvolvedor a respeito do aumento do pre\xE7o, mas acredito que isso\
      \ vai desmotivar muito futuros compradores, eu mesmo s\xF3 comprei por minha\
      \ memoria afetiva com o game e pra ajudar no seu desenvolvimento)\n- N\xE3o\
      \ tem potes com Game Over dentro ashaushau\n\nEnt\xE3o \xE9 isso, espero que\
      \ o jogo siga com um bom desenvolvimento, e se voc\xEA jogou e leu at\xE9 aqui\
      \ fa\xE7a uma review tamb\xE9m, n\xE3o custa nada ^^\n\n"
