All the fun is lost out of the storyline by the time one even leaves the first city, and a lack of proper direction only adds to the detriment of this mess. \n\nI regret buying it, more so because I bought it at full price.\nHow sad.","timestamp_created":1497511439,"timestamp_updated":1497511439,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557689905166625977","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qeWo1dwCeNnZew=="}
