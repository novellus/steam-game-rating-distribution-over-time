      \ it proves more than his sanity can bear."

    review: "Seriously, this is the H.P. Lovecraft short story portrayed in 1920's\
      \ style B&W silent film with sound track. Highly recommended to Cthulhu experts\
      \ and fans worldwide. \n\nThe feature is half normal length so you will have\
      \ some time left within the hour to make some lemonade and popping corn, enjoy."
