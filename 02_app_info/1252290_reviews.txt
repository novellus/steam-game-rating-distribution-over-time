Unlike [i]most[/i] DLC (which is [i]traditionally[/i] accessed in-game), this DLC is accessed via an RPGMaker game. This DLC could have been distributed via a PDF or loose images, but instead was packaged as a full game. So, I'll be reviewing this DLC as I would a full title.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nYou access this game's content by walking into a box. After doing so, the game will change into a sort of picture book, or visual novel. You progress through pages of the book by clicking on arrows, and that's about all there is to this game.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nThis book follows a brief interaction between a maid and her master. She whips out her naughty bits, makes a mess, and then the story ends.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nThere is no title menu and little user interface to regard. There are a few arrows which are used for navigation. They look aright.\n\n[b]- The Goods -[/b]\nYou're buying a single piece of art, with several variants. Each variant features one or more stages of undress and [i]goey fluids.[/i] The artwork is good, but heavily censored. Expect to see nudity and \"futa\"/transgender content.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\nI'm sure this DLC provides [i]some[/i] bang for your buck if you speak the developers' native language. But if you're an English speaker (like me), you'll be disappointed by the awful translations and censorship. I give this DLC a pass.\n\n[h1]Support the Wombat[/h1]\nIf you enjoy my review(s), please follow my Curator page.
