Unfortunately, the game is not fun.  It is even a game?  You basically swat flies.  You start the first 10 rounds with your hands.  I found it was more fun to make a fist and pound the flies.  Problem?  Yeah, no bug juice.  No physics.  Flies end up with a quick death pose in the air.  No fly crushed on the table.  No juices flowing.  Nothing.  The bugs just lay there for the most part.  How do you miss?  Seriously, they just fall there and then stay there.  \n\nWhen you pound them into nothingness, your hands don't get dirty.  You have the hands of Thing from the Fantastic Four for some unknown reason, except scaled down to tiny hands for even stranger reasons.  No sound of your hands thumping the table.  How are you supposed to feel satisfaction from your bug extermination?\n\nThen after the 10th wave, you finally get a fly swatter.  Alright, just what we wanted.  But nope, it's breaks really easily.  It doesn't feel satisfying.  The animations are all wrong.  Doesn't feel at all like you're holding a fly swatter.  \n\nOkay, but on the 15th wave, you get bug spray.  This will be fun.  Nope, again, very unsatisfying to use.  The animations are poor.  Your bug spray runs out quickly and you have to wait for recharge.  Actually, I recommend pounding the table with your offhand and using the bug spray at other times.  \n\nYou finally get to #1 on the leaderboards.  Maybe that's worth .59 cents.  Like being #1 at curling .. only probably not as satisfying as that.\n\nRating 2/10 yeah, it's really bad","timestamp_created":1515889067,"timestamp_updated":1515889104,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.638768136501312256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyIKC+eACeaiBlgE="}
