    review: After a brief intro where you have to choose whether to kiss a woman,
      you wake up in a jail cell with only one way out. You must navigate your way
      through a labyrinth of hallways which you can barely see, while a monster is
      chasing you. If you pause for even a split second, the monster will catch and
      kill you. If you don't take exactly the right path (which you have to memorize
      by trial and error), the monster will get you. There are rumors that the game
      is pretty good once you get past this first phase, but after 12-15 attempts,
      I still can't vouch for that.
