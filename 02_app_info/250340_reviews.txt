Back in 2009 or so, I was a huge fan of Legos, and believe it or not, I still kinda am to this day. So I was watching Lego videos and saw one where someone built a Lego house which was, in fact, this game before it became Blockland on its own. I remember playing the hell out of the demo a while back and honestly, I'm actually amazed that it's released on Steam now so I can play it as much as I wish. Of course it is kinda dated nowadays, and Brickadia is taking over, but I really suggest you getting this game for yourself so you and your friends would have one hell of a time with the minigames or just building together with a wide variety of bricks. (Psst, it's even better with add-ons :D)","timestamp_created":1610070215,"timestamp_updated":1610070215,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lbnq7/YCfe22wQI="}
