Not terrible, but I still didn't enjoy it. \nWalking speed is incredibly slow and you often have to do some sort of puzzle where a radio is telling a chunk of the story and then you have to interact with a certain item which should correspond to something you just heared. But this is just aweful. I was heavily stuck in the first of these puzzles and even in the others it's just way too hard to tell which items are the right ones. In fact because of that I think this is more a puzzle game, but mostly not very enjoyable.\n","timestamp_created":1606744665,"timestamp_updated":1606744665,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511627912521362305","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ur3cjPYCf6rrtQI="}
