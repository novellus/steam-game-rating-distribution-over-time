I'm generally not great at Arkanoid-style games, but I had a great time with this.\n\nIf you're not familiar with the style of game play, you bounce a ball to break blocks and beat enemies. That's it. You get a ton of items and skills to help you out so it doesn't become repetitive. \n\nThe graphics are colorful, the music is great, and the story was silly and cute. No complaints.\n\nAnd I want to say how happy I am with DYA Games for not doing what they did with Super Star Path and not putting any profanity in this. I have to admit I walk into all of their games with my breath held, not sure if I'm going to hear something horribly out of place, but I'm happy they kept this rated E. \n\nKeep up the good work, ya'll.","timestamp_created":1609814907,"timestamp_updated":1609814907,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h8Oc6PYCcsHKwAI="}
