    about_the_game: "The life of Elena, the first lady-in-waiting to Her Majesty,\
      \ isn't so much about balls, corsets and fancy hats as it is court intrigue,\
      \ secret service and life-threatening covert operations for the good of the\
      \ Empire. For example, Elena's last mission was to safely recover stolen ancient\
      \ relics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn unknown thief had ransacked the national museum\
      \ and got away with the namesakes of the empire's oldest rulers. A team of detectives\
      \ picked up a trail that led across the border, but then disappeared. The Queen\
      \ summoned Elena. &quot;The items stolen are of paramount value to the empire\
      \ and crown,&quot; she said in a slightly wavering voice. &quot;We mustn't lose\
      \ them.&quot; &quot;I understand, your Majesty,&quot; Elena answered. &quot;But\
      \ announcing their disappearance would only complicate the matter, so you must\
      \ carry out your duty in the strictest secrecy! You shall at once be sent abroad\
      \ under the guise of an ambassador to carry out your investigation in secret.\
      \ You must track down the perpetrator and force them to return what was stolen.&quot;\
      \ Elena soon found herself on a top-secret covert mission of vital interest\
      \ to the Crown. Her first order of business upon arrival was notifying the local\
      \ police of the missing valuables.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&quot;Were the items stolen\
      \ from your hotel or at the port?&quot; Asked the chief of police, his moustache\
      \ twitching like a walrus'. &quot;Neither,&quot; Elena answered, &quot;they\
      \ were stolen on the boat, but I know for certain the culprit is still here.\
      \ &quot;Hm...very well,&quot; the officer let out with an air of authority.\
      \ &quot;We'll get on the case at once, don't you worry. There isn't a criminal\
      \ out there who can slip away from me...&quot; By evening, the list of suspects\
      \ had been narrowed down to a few names. Elena asked the chief if she could\
      \ accompany the detectives to identify the culprit, and he gave his permission.\
      \ Elena was not only sharp as a tack, but was well-versed in the new deductive\
      \ method, which had already helped her crack open five robbery cases, two murders\
      \ and one case of destruction of hotel property. In the end, Elena and the detective\
      \ team tracked down the artifact thief and were just waiting for the judge to\
      \ sign the arrest warrant, when an urgent telegram came in from the Prime Minister\
      \ with orders to meet that very night. She had no choice but to return home\
      \ that very instant and put her operation on hold. What was it that happened\
      \ in the palace that forced her to abandon her job and return immediately?<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nJoin Elena on an unforgettable adventure through an alternate\
      \ Victorian world across the endless Emperor Desert Valley, the green banks\
      \ of the Nile, a volcanic island and more! Will good conquer evil? Can Elena\
      \ return the Crown of the Empire?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGet ready for: <br />\r\
      \n- A unique alternate world full of wondrous machines and mysterious creations!<br\
