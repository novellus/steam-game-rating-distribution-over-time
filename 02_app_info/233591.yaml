    about_the_game: "Cults have arisen around the worship of strange gods. Will you\
      \ embrace these new religions and build wonders to them in your cities, or purge\
      \ them from your land? Will you hunt down rumors of dark clad warriors, when\
      \ those that ignore their orders end up dead? Will you join a cult drinking\
      \ and celebrating as they burn ancient libraries to the ground, or save the\
      \ books and burn the cultists instead?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs this happens new,\
      \ unique, creatures have appeared in Elemental. The demon Cnotta, who has long\
      \ been restrained beneath Umber's Adytum Orphanage, has been freed. A diminutive\
      \ alchemist's attempt to permanently increase his size only affected his skeleton,\
      \ a tragedy a necromancer has taken advantage of to create a colossal skeleton.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nMany more surprises await in the Quest Pack including new\
      \ improvements, weapons, armor, items, monsters and of course new events that\
      \ make every game different."
