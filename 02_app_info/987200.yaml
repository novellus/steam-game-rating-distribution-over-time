    review: 'Compelling story with interesting characters.


      I guess that when I played it, a lot of the bugs had been corrected for I did
      not run into any errors or weird texts, just some grammatical errors.


      There were a good number of choices that stayed consistent and helped define
      my character and what they could accomplish.


      In general, a good game. Looking forward to the sequel.'
