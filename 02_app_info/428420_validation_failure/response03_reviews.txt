At first I thought 'hey it's not so bad, this aint scary' then BAM! \nGraphics are cool, sounds are great too. The intro video is a little weird because it's graphics dont fit with the gameplay. However I can't wait to get through the rest.\n \nUpdate***\nOk so I finally played it through to the end and honestly speaking the last act left me with a sour taste in my mouth and Ill tell you why.\nThere were too many bugs that it ruined the experience and the ending also felt rushed and or unfinished.","timestamp_created":1466893988,"timestamp_updated":1470704985,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.455655008554458618","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uqS2ttYCd93oWg=="}
