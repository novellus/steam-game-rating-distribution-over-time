Sweet, and surprisingly fun, I initially came to the game with an interest in how the shrinking was tackled, but I stayed for the surprisingly fun (and challenging in some cases!) gameplay! You'll be surprised how much fun this game is if you give it a try! It's inspired by Inch by Inch, sure, but this game has much more production and overall quality that just makes it the more fun! It's got quick, get in and have fun arcade-style gameplay. There is no story to the game, just you are a shrinking science person struggling to stop your shrinking before it's too late, nothing more too it. I'd definitely give it a shot, especially considering so few games tackle shrinking these days.","timestamp_created":1606544092,"timestamp_updated":1606544092,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwtq3fhvYCfLCatAI="}
