If you came to look for something that lives up to old school NES games like Ninja Gaiden. This isn't it. It's much, much easier than that game is!\nSure, it gets hard. But the difficulty of this game is how willing you are to keep dying to get that coin surrounded by spikes. I mean sure. You need pixel perfect movement to get through the later levels. And the reflexes of a fruit fly to get past some enemies. But none of that matters when you respawn at a checkpoint 5 jumps away. RN I collected all of the coins from the City level all the way up to the Moon level. And in that span of 5 different worlds, I haven't raged quit once! That's not what I expected from the store page! I expected to have my  A S S handed to me. Not half-assed handed to me! I haven't even broken a sweat yet!\n\nBut while all that I've said above leads you to believe I don't like this game. Nope. You are wrong about that. I actually do like this game. It's kinda like a harder kirby for me really. I'd let my 5 yr old play this as a warm up before I beat him up in Slap City. If you are below the ages of 5-11( which I estimate roughly half the people on steam are) I thoroughly recommend this game. It's a great \"getting good at video games\" game.\n And If you find yourself having a rough time getting through this game, I recommend reading the subtitles to the cutscenes out loud, preferably before bed. Your grammar teacher will love your for it.\n Thank me later. :)","timestamp_created":1609418789,"timestamp_updated":1609418789,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iLq13PYCd9uLvwI="}
