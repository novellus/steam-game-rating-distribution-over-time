      \ /><br><br>Desolatium is a new way to fully immerse yourself, in first person,\
      \ in the Point &amp; Click Graphic Adventure genre. It incorporates features\
      \ of Survival Horror so that you can live a unique experience, such as real\
      \ settings, the ambisonic sound (8D), a Lovecraftian narrative and hyper-realistic\
      \ graphics, enriching your gaming experience.<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Full\
      \ Immersion</strong>: To get you fully immersed we have invested all our efforts\
      \ into enhancing the sound and hyper-realistic graphics, combining them with\
      \ a chilling story based on Lovecraft\u2019s Myths, and with a decision-making\
      \ system that will transport you straight into a story like you have never experienced\
      \ before. <br><br>Desolatium will be available for PC / Mac, although, if you\
      \ want to get a total immersion, you will be able to use a Virtual Reality device.<br><br></li><li><strong>Hyper-realistic\
      \ Graphics</strong>: Every level has been generated by recording real locations\
      \ in 360\xBA, and later integrating 3D elements in a very subtle way, in order\
      \ to transport you directly into the insane universe of DESOLATIUM.<br><br></li><li><strong>Ambisonic\
      \ (8D) audio</strong>: The ambisonic audio (also known as 8D) generates a surrounding\
      \ sound effect that appears to come from every direction, creating the feeling\
      \ of being in a real scenario where danger lurks in every corner... a few steps\
      \ behind you... a chilling scream behind a door... can you imagine hearing the\
      \ piercing sound of a primeval god chasing you, as you try to overcome the obstacles\
      \ on your way out?<br><br>In DESOLATIUM, all the voice-overs, effects and sounds\
      \ are created using this technology, in order to make you feel part of the mystery\
      \ like you have never been.<br><br>Best of all, you only need headphones to\
      \ live this experience.<br><br></li><li><strong>Multiple endings</strong>: In\
      \ DESOLATIUM you will set the course of the adventure. Every decision you make\
      \ will determine your path, taking you to a variety of situations through the\
      \ different narrative lines that the game contains, and that will lead you to\
      \ one of its multiple endings... Will you be able to avoid more murders? Will\
      \ you find out who is behind all of this or will you prefer to be part of some\
      \ ritual?</li></ul><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1474900/extras/desolatium_titulo_PREMIOS_411x67_ENG.png?t=1605690657\"\
