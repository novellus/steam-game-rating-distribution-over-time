Simply a fantastic game, a fantastic experience, 10/10.","timestamp_created":1487732694,"timestamp_updated":1581137108,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.568078935146331787","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwwrPHkfACdp7lcg=="}
