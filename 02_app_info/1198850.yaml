    about_the_game: The once prosperous kingdom of Avon, ruled by the capable yet
      compassionate King Regnault, now lies in tatters after its benevolent ruler
      suddenly transformed into a ruthless tyrant, single-handedly throwing the kingdom
      into turmoil with his tyrannical regime. Following a series of uprisings, the
      king was slain by his rebelling subjects, and the magnificent kingdom that once
      stood proudly among its contemporaries was no more. With nothing left in its
      coffers and a pitiful four citizens to its name, Avon is now no more than a
      desolate land infested by wandering thieves and monsters, and effectively dead
      as a nation.<br><br>Yet even at the darkest hour, there's still hope to be found.
      Or so it was believed by Princess Ariadne, daughter of the late king. Determined
      to right her father's wrongs and restore the kingdom to its former glory, Ariadne
      stands valiantly amidst the ruins, vowing to accomplish her goal by any means
      necessary. Will her perseverance carry her through? Or is such a foolhardy attempt
      ultimately doomed to fail...?<br><br><br><strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2></strong><ul
