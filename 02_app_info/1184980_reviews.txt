Price 30+ euro, WHY?\nMaybe the steam downloaded the demo?\nAlthough I bought the full game and never pressed a button containing text \"demo\".\n4 Levels, 2 types of enemies, 1 weapon (3 sequence combo).\nEach level has 3-4 places to fight enemies. Found no bosses.\n\nEncountered no bugs. Graphics is pretty. \nLandscape is pleasant to the eye as well. That's about it.\n\nCombat needs polishing. Enemy amount needs polishing.\nSettings need polishing. Character animations need polishing.\nEnglish needs polishing. Story needs? ... there is one chat buble ...\n\nWeapon's reach is less than a kick. Touching and enemy makes you loose a heart (out of 5).\nTurning while fighting, even with continuing your combo, and not loose a heart nearly impossible.\nEnded up doing 1-2 hits and kitting.\nMouse setting missing. Moving my mouse 1cm made nearly 180 degrees.\nVertical Sync non existent. FPS limit non existent. 200+ fps made my PC almost take off.","timestamp_created":1591582736,"timestamp_updated":1591629166,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":5,"weighted_vote_score":"0.721976816654205322","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw27afyvICe9/ojAI="}
