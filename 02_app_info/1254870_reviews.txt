It accomplishes exactly what it sets out to-provides a stripped-down and streamlined grand strategy experience. It's very addictive-I've played as 4 factions and each time I had to finish my run in one sitting. Each run takes only about 1-2 hours, though I'm sure some are longer or shorter depending on goals and such. The first 3 factions I played as were on easy and I got Gold (highest level) fairly... easily. The 4th was medium and I got Bronze, though I feel like I could get Silver in a second attempt, and would be really satisfied to get Gold.\n\nAll in all, it's a great experience-I love the simplicity of just taking one action per turn, and every action or set of a few actions feels like an important decision. Really wonderful game, and I hope more maps come out in the future.","timestamp_created":1609737887,"timestamp_updated":1609737887,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40dv25fYCeK2mwAI="}
