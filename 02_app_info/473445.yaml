      used by commanders or for ceremonies.

    review: 'The very RNG nature of drops in EDF 4.1 make it almost a garuntee that
      you will make it to your first underground mission without any vehicles that
      can be summoned underground.

      Based on this fact alone, the Depth Crawler Gold Coat DLC is highly recommended.


      As for how the gold coat version compares to the earliest normal model you can
      get in-game:

      -You lose 100 HP, cutting the durability almost in half.

      -The main cannons each have 99 ammo instead of 120, deal less damage, and fire
      in 3-round bursts. This makes them vastly worse at handling large mobs, but
      slightly better at fighting single targets.

      -The gatling gun does 15 damage per shot instead of 10 and comes with 200 more
      bullets, making it far superior for extended fights.

      -Walking and turning speeds are noticably increased.

      Ironically, the standard version is the better choice for most underground missions.
      However, if you want a vehicle with a great ammo count and low reload cost,
      the gold coat does well on many surface missions. Just don''t expet it to take
      hits.'
