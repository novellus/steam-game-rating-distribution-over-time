    about_the_game: "The Cloudy Night! This is how the night it all began became known.\
      \ Much of the population has turned into terrifying zombies that in their insatiable\
      \ hunger have devoured another large part of it. The survivors take refuge in\
      \ the bars where they were and after deep analysis they concluded that what\u2019\
      s saved them was the fact they are all consumers of a particular type of craft\
      \ beer. That's what saved their humanity ! So, they they organized themselves\
      \ to seek out other survivors and offer salvation through this miraculous drink.\
      \ For that they will count with Steven, a brave and smart pizza delivery guy\
      \ who will risk his neck to deliver the craft beers manufactured by brewer Norman\
      \ and save the humanity from this terrible pest."
