You search on each map the exit which spawns you to the next of the 5 or 6 maps (that I went through). The maps are openworld so you can do a bit of exploration besides the actual task to find your home. This task is not that difficult:(  I didn`t get lost that often. The hitboxes are sometimes bad and the mapdesign somtimes boring. Instead of just a flat way there could be way more offroad stuff in your way. The playthrough happened in 25 minutes. And i did sometimes have to respawn because i jumped on a high obsticle or because of a fence pice which rolled me, when I was speeding over it.  So you could do a fast run in maybe 15 minutes or so. The physics are good and thanks to the openworld design you have some replayability. But don`t expect it to be played regulary. I bought it for 65 cents in a discount. The 3 â‚¬ are a bit much for this game so I would say: what for a discount and then get it.","timestamp_created":1607449801,"timestamp_updated":1607450115,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u8ffofYCdcSduAI="}
