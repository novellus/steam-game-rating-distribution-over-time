The enemies can kill you too easily. I tried playing it a few more times and it looks like I was only having trouble because more than one enemy was attacking me at the same time. You have to lure an enemy out after you away from the other enemies before you try to fight it.","timestamp_created":1605054883,"timestamp_updated":1606618746,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyZH8iPYCcuPTrQI="}
