    review: Not the best from CoG, but still decent. The characters were good, I enjoyed
      the worldbuilding and the story was interesting. I wasnt very interested in
      romance in this one (ironic for a game in their hearts label). Most of the characters
      are already in relationships, which isnt my cup of tea, though if you like poly
      stuff you might enjoy it.
