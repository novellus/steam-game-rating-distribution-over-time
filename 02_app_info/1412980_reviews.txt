A hidden gem of the 90's. I played this one 25 years ago. A 1MB file hidden among 600 others on a CD. This remake is quite faithful the the original, though the difficulty has now been notably reduced. I haven't played enough to know if all of the old systems are here, but what I see so far has been quite impressive.\n\nIf you are tired of all the \"newer\" games that put graphics over gameplay, give this one a go.","timestamp_created":1604499568,"timestamp_updated":1604499568,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545301437377929688","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2I7oyfUCfeagrAI="}
