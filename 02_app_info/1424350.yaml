    review: Really fun game to put a few minutes into here and there, not to say that
      you won't end up playing for thirty minutes or more. Every time you do anything
      to gain speed it feels satisfying. Once you play for a bit you'll be able to
      go [b] really [/b] fast. All of the characters have their own play styles, adding
      to the variety of gameplay. Local multiplayer is easy to set up and adds to
      the game's replay value. Gupi's contributions to the soundtrack are really fitting
      and would be something I'd listen to when not playing. Came for the hyperpop
      and stayed for the engaging gameplay.
