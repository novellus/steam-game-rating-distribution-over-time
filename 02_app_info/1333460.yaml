    review: 'Frustrating.


      This game started out promising.

      Relaxing music, not too difficult maze, nice animation of a running cat, ...

      I liked the game instantly and felt like it would be a nice way to relax.


      But the further I got in the game, the more I felt like the goal of the creators
      was to irritate us.

      The "difficulty" of the mazes was the increasing length and the smaller size.
      Everything became smaller so it''s not a game for people with bad eyesight!
      And the mazes were super easy but just really long. The music also became more
      irritating. Sounds that don''t fit together and "singing"?


      What happened? I really was excited at first, but it was such a disappointment
      that I would not recommend this game to anyone. Or you need to be trying to
      irritate yourself. I hope it changes in the future, but probably not...'
