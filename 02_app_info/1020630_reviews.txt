The good thing is that there doesn't seem to be a wrong way to play through this. Your decisions just result in the story taking a different path or situational outcome. I'm looking forward to playing through again and seeing what happens when other decisions are made.\n\nCharacters are lovable, except for Miles, who is WAY too loud! I mean, he is very nearly screaming into the mic in some scenes. It's annoying and totally unnecessary. The rest of the dialogue is fine, but I found myself having to move the headphones away from my ears on several occasions when he was doing his bit. He's funny in parts, but the volume is a huge problem;\nSam was awesomely portrayed by Laura Spencer. I loved her in The Big Bang Theory, and she certainly brings a sparkle to this production;\nShauna was hilarious, and she had me crying with laughter in the last part of the story.\n\nAll of the five parts to this story are well timed. Not too long, not too short. The good thing about them is that if you're not happy with decisions you've made, you can just replay that specific part and make another choice.\n\nThis really is the future of 3D movies. It's just a shame there aren't enough of them yet!","timestamp_created":1586149292,"timestamp_updated":1586149292,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519230782985687256","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/q73pvECd6jE/gE="}
