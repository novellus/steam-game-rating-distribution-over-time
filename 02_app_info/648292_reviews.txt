The attention to detail is absolutely stunning.\n\nCars:\n\nFerrari 512 Long and Short wheelbase: great fun to drive- especially around old tracks. And listen to that NOISE!\n\nPorsche 917: Not as good as the Ferrari, but still great fun.\n\nPorsche 924: My least favorite car- not because it isn't fun to drive, but because of balance. It is absolutely blasted by the M1 in the straights and corners, and therefore useless unless you are competing against identical cars.\n\nPorsche 961: Its... meh. Its blisteringly fast, but it just isn't... fun. Kinda defeats the point of a video game, but.. meh.\n\nToyota TSO50: HOLY MOLY, THAT'S FAST.\n\nAudi R18 Le mans and Fuji: HOLY CANNOLI, THAT'S BLISTERING.\n\nPorsche 919: They invented warp drive just now, because I can't feel my face. \n\nAll the 2016 prototypes are, definitively, fast, and extremely fun.\n\nOverall, a 11/10. The old and new prototype's brilliance outshines the balance issues of the 924 and the boringness of the 961. The track is even better- adds that extra one.","timestamp_created":1609264150,"timestamp_updated":1609264150,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw38bn1/YCfcXBvgI="}
