    review: "Pros: An engaging story, well-written dialogue, and interesting characters.\
      \ The art is a mix of pixel-based assets and hand-drawn character portraits,\
      \ but executed well. \n\nCons: The turn-based combat leaves much to be desired.\
      \ Early in the game there is a sniping component, but it is completely absent\
      \ for the rest of the experience. I'm saddened that it is not in the latter\
      \ half of the game.\n\nThe verdict: I would recommend this game. The story,\
      \ characters, and geopolitical intrigue are worth the time invested, and since\
      \ the creators are working on additional chapters, there is a chance the sniping\
      \ mechanics will rise again."
