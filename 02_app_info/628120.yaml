      \ Shibusawa Archives&quot; will be opened in the Steam Store. Here we will revive\
      \ popular previously released titles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this ninth round\

      \nRanseiki is a strategy based simulation game based in Japan's chaotic Warring\
      \ States period. The series is revived with graphics that are reminiscent of\
      \ the beauty of the Azuchi Momoyama period. In addition, not only have the battles\
      \ evolved from turn based to real time, but we have included 7 non-Daimyou forces\
      \ that played a large role in the times: Imperial Court, the temples and shrines,\
      \ navy, independent cities, ninja groups, land owner class and the Bakufu. Players\
      \ play as one of the powerful Daimyou and fight to unify the entire country."
