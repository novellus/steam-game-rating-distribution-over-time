In the first 10 seconds of playing it, I knew that it was worth the 50 cents, if not $4!\nThis is a simple but engaging game that lets you have fun with someone else, with crazy Pinata physics and upbeat music.\nI have multiple monitors, and just want to warn anyone else: your mouse can accidentally slide off the screen and the Pinata gets stuck. This is fixed by centering your mouse again.\n[h1]Overall, a great little game, and something I recommend you try out![/h1]","timestamp_created":1593306446,"timestamp_updated":1593306446,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi9+d/PICfILwkAI="}
