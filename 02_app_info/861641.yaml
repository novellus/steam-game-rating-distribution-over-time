    review: "Extremely bland\nThere's only 2 exciting things which happen in this\
      \ coaster, the start, and the end. There's 2 short cinematics at the start and\
      \ end which are quite cool but the main ride is very basic. There's a few jumps\
      \ but boring ride getting there. When doing the big jumps you won't even land,\
      \ it's just a portal which takes you back to the ground which is a very bad\
      \ way of getting around having to do much work on the map. \n\nSo in conclusion,\
      \ could've been made a lot better."
