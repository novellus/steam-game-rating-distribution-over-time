Sadly, it has a lot of issues that prevent me from recommending it.\n\nI'll get my main gripe out of the way first: this game has a very questionable translation.\nAfter seeing how bad the translation was I immediately switched to playing in japanese. Completely wrong translations, added jokes and memes that have no place in the dialogue and some awkward phrasing in some parts. The work Strangely Compelling (the company behind the game's localization) did in this game is amateurish at best. I'll give the translator the benefit of the doubt and say most of my gripes with the terrible translation comes from the editor. From personal experience I can tell you that for whatever reason editors for localized dialogue in japanese games have a tendency to shoehorn in their awful sense of humor. I would urge the publisher to seek another localization company to fix the bad localization Strangely Compelling made, or at least to hire a competent editor and/or translator. But seeing as this is a very niche game I highly doubt it will ever happen. Not that it's any skin of my back. I know japanese and can play the game with the original dialogue with no problem, but most of the people that are going to play this are going yo be subjected to this atrocious dialogue so I thought I'd give them a heads-up before going into this game\n\nSecond, no co-op in story mode.\nWhy? Is there any reason why story mode can't be played with another person? If Phantom Breaker could do it on the Xbox 360, then this game has no excuse. As far as I can tell there is only one mode where more than one person can join in. This is absolutely pathetic.\n\nVery disappointing game all around so far. A few good things I can say about it is that the artwork and music are excellent. But overall this was a very underwhelming experience compared to Phantom Breaker. For now, I can only recommend you try out that game if you haven't already. I really hope the devs and the publisher see this and address the issues this game has. If handled properly I can see it becoming a really good game in the long run, but for now it's a really convoluted mess.\n\nHard pass from me.\n\nEDIT Dec/28/20: After 3 hours in the game I cannot bring myself to keep playing this pile of garbage. There are better things to do in life than playing (bad) video games. Don't buy it.","timestamp_created":1597952695,"timestamp_updated":1609176051,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":153,"votes_funny":7,"weighted_vote_score":"0.804084122180938721","comment_count":8,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4072X1fYCcO/YnAI="}
