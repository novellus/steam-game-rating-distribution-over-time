    review: 'An okay set of casual games, though I feel it worthy to grade each game.


      [u]Gardini[/u]

      A fun game to attempt to kill enemies and bosses with your sword, though I experienced
      a glitch which let me only get the [i]Rusty Sword[/i], even after I had already
      bought it. [8/10]


      [u]Orb Looting[/u]

      (Played in single player) I feel like this game is one of the few I dislike
      most, due to there being no replayability. Possibly fun with friends though.
      [3/10]


      [u]Go Farm IV[/u]

      I enjoyed this game to a certain extent, though gameplay was slow. [5/10]


      [u]Pooper[/u]

      A silly game with the first 4/5 tries being fun, while the rest seem tedious.
      [5/10]


      [u]Pooper Deluxe[/u]

      The same as Pooper, though I liked the upgrades and multiplayer factor.[7/10]


      [u]Day Dream Adventure[/u]

      My favourite of the 8 games due to its replayability and enjoyment in leveling
      up and customising your character with capes, shoes, hats, faces, swords and
      bows. [10/10]


      [u]Vermillion[/u]

      A fun game with a fair bit of replayability, and fun to experience the gradual
      increase of the difficulty. I liked that the character, over time, would get
      new special abilities when bosses were defeated. [8/10]


      [u]Sandwich VS Bagel[/u]

      An okay game, with a bit of replayability. I did enjoy the boss fights and learning
      how to evade their certain attacks, and the eating away at the life total. [7/10]
