You'll hear the bike jump and skid around, as well as the environmental sounds of the stages. To be honest, I find the sounds of the game incredibly relaxing, but in this format, they seem a little overwhelming--a little more hectic than soothing. \n\nThe Story Mode tracks are the exact same audio as the normal tracks, but add skits about the cyclist ending up at the hospital at the end of each track. Not particularly worth it past the novelty of a first listen.\n\nThe files are presented as 128kbps MP3s and 24bit/44.1Hz WAVs. There is no metadata, the labeling of the tracks is inconsistent, and most importantly, the Story Mode tracks are supposed to be gapless/transitioning from one to the other (as the skits happen at the end and beginning of the tracks), but the beginning of each file has a gap of silence that breaks up the sound. I had to remove the gaps in an audio editor to cope with my OCD. This should not have been released like this.\n\nPositive review... but be aware of what this is. You can probably just play the game for the same effect, or play around by pairing this with other calming music or background sounds.","timestamp_created":1603462412,"timestamp_updated":1603462673,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.652497947216033936","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ptb0qvUCcPbOqQI="}
