    review: 'Okay so the gameplay is simple yet fun and the game itself holds no microtransactions
      (that I have found). Nothing really wrong there.


      But the save system appears to be almost completely broken. Basically the only
      thing that saves is unlocked maps and target progress on a bar to making the
      next shark in line available to purchase with in-game currency. Any items and
      sharks you''ve purchased and equipped get reset along with your stats and high
      scores. I mean it''s not so bad as you can re-purchase most if not all the sharks
      you did earn using the default 1500 gold that also resets upon game exit, but
      that''s still pretty bad. On top of that, the game is seriously overpriced.
      Frankly, it''s $50 for a game that would be worth maybe around $15 at most.


      I will edit my review and change it to positive if the devs fix the save system
      if the resetting save is in fact a bug and maybe lower the price without seriously
      breaking anything else in the game, but this is a bad release right now. Even
      Shantae Half-Genie Hero Ultimate Edition had a better release than this.'
