    review: "This is a fun click-to-win game that will allow you to burn up as much\
      \ free time as you have. Ideal for folks who need to do a lot to do a lot of\
      \ mouse clicking at work to appear productive. If you have issues with obsessing\
      \ over games (especially BEATING games), don't get this. You'll only find yourself\
      \ alone on your couch at 4 a.m. frantically clicking money bags and dreading\
      \ your 7 a.m. alarm. \n\n...Or so I've heard..."
