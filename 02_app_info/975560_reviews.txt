The reason I jumped right to this volume and one of the reasons I got the game in particular is actually [b]the music[/b]. The entire OST is great, but I discovered it by one track from this volume made in collaboration with [b]Toby Fox[/b] (Undertale). After that I got curious to see the story behind. Won't spoil it for you, you can experience the clown-fest for yourself :) \n\nThe writing is great along all volumes I've read, many references are present, world-building made me want to read the original web-comic. Definitely recommended if you are interested in the series. And check the soundtrack!","timestamp_created":1602914062,"timestamp_updated":1602914062,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.564233183860778809","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw6/HHmvUCevOsqAI="}
