    review: 'This was a good game to play. I liked pretty much everything. I often
      times found myself thinking out loud "Hey, this Wanderer looks like Raziel from
      Legacy of Kain!" and sometimes I found answers (the lens capturing energy, transforming
      it into crystals) to the game I love the most, that is True Fear: Forsaken Souls
      Part 2. (Can''t wait for Part 3!) Okay, here is a list of what I''ve found interesting
      in Chimera: The Signs of Prophecy.


      PROS:

      - Journal entries;

      - Beautiful scenes;

      - Good music;

      - Well-worked voice-overs (especially the Drunkard XD);

      - Fast-travelling map;

      - Interesting HO minigames;

      - Story revolving around super-naturally gifted children and chimeras;

      - Three-set collectibles (The Tarot Cards are interesting);

      - Main Game + Bonus Game + Secret Room (just like Chimera: Cherished Serpent
      and Haunted Hotel: Room 18).


      CONS:

      - No other disadvantage comes to mind.


      If you''re looking for a HOPA game with a good story and interesting puzzles,
      I think you hit the jackpot with this one.'
