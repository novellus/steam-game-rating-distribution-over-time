    review: Worth it. Why? you be 99,99 Euro for something which would be like 12
      x 13,99 Euro. You get Patreon for a WHOLE YEAR. that makes it worth it. You
      save some money. Of course you should only buy it if you are getting into the
      game EACH SINGLE DAY. Just to get your daily login bonus.  I hope more will
      happen in SWL. Please Funcom. Don't just let this game die.
