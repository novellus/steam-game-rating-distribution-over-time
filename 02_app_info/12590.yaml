    review: "Eu jogava no PS2... bons tempos, ficava horas e horas viciado nesse estilo\
      \ de jogo.\nComprei o jogo separado (sem o pack) na esperan\xE7a da nostalgia\
      \ e da summer sale, s\xF3 que me arrependi.\nJogo mal renderizado no windows\
      \ 10, jogo no time trial (sozinho) e d\xE1 muito lag!\nColoquei todas as op\xE7\
      \xF5es poss\xEDveis para reverter (admin e compatibilidade) e nada.\n\n\nAtualiza\xE7\
      \xE3o: no windows 8, esse jogo est\xE1 rodando liso. recomendad\xEDssimo."
