You hit the same coloured butterfly and make a combo and congratulations, you have already completed the game because that's it and no further level progress . Just one playground and try different permutations and combinations to score a combo and hear a ingrained cute baby voice lauding the player with \"Awesome, Cool, Combo, Multi Combo, Its funny that out of all the heavy and large games you have in your library you chose this astray one only, You are so weird, etc. etc.\" voices. \n\nSo, the achievements might make you stick with the game for few extra minutes of gameplay. But the chances are probably  no one would last long for more than a 5 minute song . Good for a 3 year old daughter and for the parents who want to introduce their kid into the world of gaming, this could be the best start for any toddler or their first game indeed.","timestamp_created":1609267565,"timestamp_updated":1609272790,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.598540186882019043","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv8GI2PYCeMzDvgI="}
