I did not know what I was getting into with \"Carnage Racing\" but I soon realized it should instead be named, \"Teleporting Racing\" Because that's what it is. And it is FUCKING AWESOME. For the price, you can't go wrong, the online is fun as fuck I cant get enough :D\n\nEdit: Online has been down now for sometime, and it is really the main attraction of this game. I wish it hadn't been taken down but that's just how it be sometimes. The game is still pretty fun though, and if you're looking to kill and hour or two with a unique racing game, give this bad boy a peek.","timestamp_created":1406683041,"timestamp_updated":1548395260,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546091198921203613","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhpXjwegCd6PhKw=="}
