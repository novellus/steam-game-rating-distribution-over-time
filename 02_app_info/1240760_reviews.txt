Excellent composition, instrumentation, and variety lends the game one of the best soundtracks to grace a danmaku game in recent years period. The only real issue is that you're buying a soundtrack from Steam, so the quality is only going to be a passable 128 kbps. Of course, I bought the soundtrack anyway because it truly is that good and I'll support the game in any way I can. :)","timestamp_created":1589220085,"timestamp_updated":1589220085,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40MG5gvICf/qLhwI="}
