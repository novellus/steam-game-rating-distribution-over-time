    short_description: Inspired by arcade game experiences, Drive By Hero is an apocalyptic
      shooter game. Shoot enemies, kill bosses, use new weapons and try to survive
      in this horrific action game. Alone with your car and your gun, you are not
      the hero they deserve but the one they need.

    review: This "game" is about shooting zombies before your truck hits them, which
      hurts you. Features 3 levels and a "boss". After you kill the boss and win the
      game, "you won the game" pops up and the game crashes. Achievements are locked
      behind 5 hours of holding down the mouse button.
