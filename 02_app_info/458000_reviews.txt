But what I find it´s not really what i expected. But despite that, maybe some people could have fun with the game, but not had been mine case here.\nI also did a search to see some gameplay of it, around youtube, and appear there's not much options for endings, something that cripples the decision feature in my opinion.\n\n☠[u][b]Could had been Better[/b][/u]:\n[b]1-[/b] The combat mechanics works based on something i would describe as a mix of excessive micromanagement and RNG stats. Or in other words, a lack of a better combat system i think, with the presence of unnecessary management in the fights, results in most of the time you getting infected or dying by zombies, even in a frenzy for make everything for the characters, and that is a lot awful.\n[b]2-[/b] Lack of Lore into the History of the game. Most of the characters dont receive a deep development, aside protagonist who receive a bit, the rest appear its there just to fill space. We also dont know much about what is around, just that is the zombie apocalypse.\n\n☠[u][b]Conclusion[/b][/u]:\nI get tired of the game, a little fast when playing i think, but i tried continue ahead for some more time at the hope of the experience get better, but unfortunatelly my feeling about the game, dont changed, so i decide ask for a refund. I also think is due my taste, who is for games/content with more depth, like the They are Billions, Dead Age, Dead State, etc. for examples, so if you share that same vision, i advise look for another title, that one is for a more superficial taste.","timestamp_created":1572496060,"timestamp_updated":1605917866,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527577042579650879","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgb+K9PUCepy11QE="}
