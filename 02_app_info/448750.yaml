    review: 'Infinity Saga is a fairly standard short RPGMaker game with pretty good
      custom artwork and (graphical) map design... and that''s, sadly, where the good
      parts end, because it''s a game about navigating through fairly long dungeons
      with a fairly small visible area and while beset by constant and grindy random
      encounters.


      The story is basically your standard silly and amateurish writing. If you like
      that, it''s not terrible - it''s at least got some character to it, even if
      it could have used some proofreading. Gameplay-wise, it''s mostly okay, with
      a fixed party of four characters who aren''t very customizable, but with at
      least some interesting equipment eventually. Monsters can get pretty grindy,
      running away stops working reliably after the first "dungeon," and the enemies
      in the second "dungeon" with full-party paralysis attacks get a special mention
      as being able to cause an arbitrary game-over easily when you first arrive.
      Plus the boss-tier random enemies with 10000 or so life in the last areas of
      the game, but at least you can run away from those.


      I can''t really recommend Infinity Saga, but I think the developer doing art
      and/or maps for a different game would be neat. Or just doing better with the
      parts they didn''t get down right this time, either way.'
