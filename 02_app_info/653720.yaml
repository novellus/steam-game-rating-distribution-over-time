    review: "There is.. pretty much nothing in this pack. Some slot machines/casino\
      \ tables, a luggage cart, a fancy hotel meal cart, some plants, some lighting,\
      \ a store shelf, a couple of counters, a stairway that looks like an escalator\
      \ that isn't even animated.. and animated open/closing elevator doors. I guess\
      \ the editted walls and floors are nice, and the wrestling ring is.. there,\
      \ but I can't see anything that I would do with it since it is all one big piece\
      \ aside from the crowd background. If the spotlights were separated you could\
      \ at least use them for a stage or something, but they aren't - the spotlights\
      \ continue right onto the poles and ropes of the ring, making both look weird\
      \ if you try to use them apart.\n\nLike, this is the type of thing you'd find\
      \ for free on the Lucky Duet resource site. At least they have an animated escalator.\
      \ \n\nYou may be thinking \"Ah, it's on sale, I'll pick it up anyway..\" - Don't.\
      \ There's nothing in here you need, unless you just HAVE to have a few more\
      \ slot machines and a blackjack table. This is honestly worth maybe a buck or\
      \ two at most, and even that is less a \"This is worth the effort\" and more\
      \ of a \"I'm tipping the creator for their work\" thing."
