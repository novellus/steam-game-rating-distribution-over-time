It worked on Win 10, looked ok, played ok, was understandable, sounded ok.  Very silly game.  Supposedly, it runs in 60fps.  You need to have an Xbox360 controller to play.   You can also set the game to use keyboard.  Check the manual before you play in the store page.  It is a single player game or two players can play on the same computer using the same keyboard.\n\nTry it, maybe you might like it.\n\nFor more info:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR7ERLrOa5s\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5msdR6iGWw\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=811945452","timestamp_created":1487471593,"timestamp_updated":1597164553,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.539480388164520264","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4sqCb7/MCdobEcg=="}
