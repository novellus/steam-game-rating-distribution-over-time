You're continuously in motion, attempting to collect dots while trying to avoid running into your increasingly longer tail.  First you maneuver around the exterior surface of a 3D shape collecting dots, being only able to turn left or right.  Then enter the shape to maneuver in a 3D environment with flight-like controls (i.e. yaw, pitch, and roll).\n\nFor someone like me who grew up in the 70s and 80s, there is definitely some nostalgia but with a new twist.  It's pretty cheap even at its normal price, but catch it on sale like I did and it's basically a must buy.","timestamp_created":1606333147,"timestamp_updated":1606333147,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ499S6gPYCcqTjsAI="}
