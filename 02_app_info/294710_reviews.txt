Never before has a story driven me to such emotional lengths as this: I reach the pits of despair when I fail, and a fluster of love in my heart when I succeed. I feel anger when the critters hug me, and I feel joy when I get ice cream. \nFurthermore, the work of the animators and voice actors make me feel immersed, make me feel like *I* am the dog on a pogo stick. For anyone who wishes to live life, Putt-Putt® and Pep's Dog on a Stick is the game for you.","timestamp_created":1555008303,"timestamp_updated":1555008303,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+fXthuoCd5aGvwE="}
