    review: 'This is a small minimalistic puzzler where you have to create shapes
      that match the two shadows given. All 80 levels have four different play modes:

      1: regular (find any shape that matches both shadows)

      2: minimal (find any shape consisting of the minimum amount of blocks)

      3: maximal (find the shape consisting of the maximum amount of blocks)

      4: picross (find a shape consisting of the number of blocks given)

      Basically you''re solving all puzzles up to four times, which unfortunately
      doesn''t hide the fact that this is a very easy game. Do not expect more than
      a couple of hours of game play to solve all ''320'' puzzles. If you have difficulties
      with shapes and shadows this could possibly take a bit more and / or even help
      with that.


      Graphics are minimalistic but perfectly sufficient. Only issue I have is that
      it can be difficult to discern if blocks are actually adjacent to one another
      or if there is a gap between them. All in all a small and simple game. Don''t
      expect too much replay value, especially on the short term. If you can get this
      at a discount, you can''t really go wrong here.'
