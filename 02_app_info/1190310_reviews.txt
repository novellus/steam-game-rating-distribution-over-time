It would be nice if they had a way to recenter the headset and more songs from various other Korean artists such as SHINee, BlockB, etc. \n\nGameplay is pretty straightforward, no complaints there. Some might not do so well with the language section \"hidden\" in Korean. If you can't read Korean, you might struggle with the settings. If you can read Korean, you'll be just fine. I can so it doesn't bug me but I could see how it could become a problem point for others. \n\nThe beat maps are really good, I actually enjoy playing them and I prefer this game over Beat Saber.","timestamp_created":1595524555,"timestamp_updated":1595524555,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4j5SrvvMCc9uPlwI="}
