You have to get this DLC!!! [/h1] [/b]\n\n[u] [h1] 3 New Multiplayer Maps + 1 Recycled Map [/h1] [/u]\n\nThe multiplayer maps are so shiny, so colourful and extremely sophisticated when it comes to pure map design.\n\nThey are not too big and are perfect for close quarter combat. I like. I even have the impression that the graphic got a little bit better, that the textures are more detailed, sharper than in the main game.\n\nOne map - \"Skyline\" - is already well-known from BO2. And it has been one of my favourite’s maps there. So I am very pleased and very much appreciate the graphical up-styling, the perfectness in recycling. Because NEW is not always BETTER. But OLD-NEW is.\n\nI hope they will keep up the innovation, the org-asm in map expertise in the following 3 DLCs.\n\n[u] [h1] Der Eisendrache [/h1] [/u]\n\nThe new Zombie map is something in between of WW 1 and WW 2 situated in an Austrian Castle called \"Der Eisendrache\", but full with German military symbols and even more crazy futuristic zombie-killing weapons. So far from history that you simply have to fell for it. In level 10 from one moment to another some hard-core metal song starts powering through my speakers and I am just WTF ... is some open browser… no it is the game…\n\nAnd then this robot is crushing from the sky and you run down in the caves where Egyptian Raubkunst is waiting for you, gold everywhere and North-African art like in the Cairo State museum. \n\nSo you run back in the main hall, from the wall a fire breathing dragon, hungry for Zombies. You stand besides the wall and feed him patiently and adore his detailed textures.\n\nA perfect map where years of horde mode experience meets the love for the game. Where perfect controls meet a puzzling map design, where everything just comes together and graphics with more love for details than in any other Call of Duty.\n\n[b] [u]  [h1] Very highly recommended!!!
