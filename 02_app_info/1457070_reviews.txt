Some of the hitboxes (esp. in boss \"battles\") are either completely arbitrary or just plain broken and several (that's the larger amounts of \"several\") times I've managed to die from apparently touching the enemy some fifth of the screen width away. The awful blinking noise backgrounds make me feel nauseous for the first time ever from such effects in games. The bosses barely telegraph their attacks or phases and some projectiles are even practically invisible in all the visual clutter (whatever those turd-like ice-cream-sticks are that one of the bosses launch at you) which is a big damn no-no since everything is instakill.\n\nKeep making games, guys, you'll get better at it, I promise. But this one I cannot recommend for anyone to buy.","timestamp_created":1609710408,"timestamp_updated":1609710583,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.472972989082336426","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zceO5fYCc62awAI="}
