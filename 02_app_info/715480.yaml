    review: 'DO NOT PURCHASE!


      I picked this up to support a player in my campaign that had chosen the Magus
      class. Previously, i had entered all the information manually in the Fantasy
      Grounds system.

      My manually entered information had more functionality than this module. What
      an absolute waste of money.


      MAGUS CLASS

      Arcane pool: Not supported

      Spells: Not supported

      Special Abilities (Like +1 weapon enchantment): Not supported.
