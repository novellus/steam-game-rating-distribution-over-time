      \n<br />\r\nPlayers assume the role of a survivor in a world plagued by a deadly\
      \ outbreak. The government announces their plans deal with monstrous infected\
      \ by means of nuclear weapons. The plan: to bomb the area and eradicate everything.\
      \ Lucky enough, there's a fallout shelter in the player's front yard - and enough\
      \ food and water to last. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow other survivors want in. <br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPREMISE <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe main story begins\
      \ once the hero has collected enough supplies to last himself in the shelter.\
      \ <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen other survivors show up, the player can decide who\
      \ to bring into the shelter and who to leave outside. Survivors range from children\
      \ to experienced adults that can offer the player help. The player can also\

      \ the game and will ultimately effect the ending. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever,\
      \ it's not enough to simply invite another survivor into the shelter. Each survivor\
      \ requires additional supplies to last their stay. While the player only has\
      \ enough for himself, he is free to explore the land and search for additional\
      \ supplies. This is the adventure aspect of the game. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCombining\
      \ old school graphics and simple gameplay with modern storytelling and a multitude\

    review: 'Its genuinely a well made game with an interesting storyline and good
      gameplay, however the Blue cave maze sucks and it took me 3 hours to get out.
      I had to draw the entire map and take dozens of screenshots and then slowly
      piece them together in photoshop in order to figure out how to get through.


      It was waaaay too much effort for almost no reward.


      Apart from the awful blue cave maze I enjoyed the experience.


      EDIT - SCRATCH THAT- after I finally got out of the cave I accidently hit F12,
      and the game immediately closed and I lost 3 hours of progress in that damn
      maze.


      This game could really use a guide, try as I might I couldnt figure out how
      to gather more than 3 Fodder, 4 Water and 3 Food for the shelter.'
