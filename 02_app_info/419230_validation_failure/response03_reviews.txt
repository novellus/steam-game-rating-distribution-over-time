However, it's straight to thumbs down because the store page shows \"full audio\" when there is in fact no audio at all.  I wondered if maybe it was just a mis-upload, but there's a review from a month ago (which I wish I'd read :P) stating the same thing, so that's plenty of time for them to either a) fix the upload, or b) fix the store page metadata.\n\nOn a side note, even if the movie [i]were[/i] deliberately silent (which I suspect isn't the case here), I think in 2016 you'd kind of have to point that out.  It's been quite a while since anybody's used the word \"talkies\" in normal conversation.","timestamp_created":1470745912,"timestamp_updated":1470745912,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.500640213489532471","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrLTSt9YCfu7JXg=="}
