      \ Touch other cubes so they follow you and direct them to triggers. Floating\
      \ platforms will fly away if you don\u2019t pay attention when you are stepping\
      \ off them. Move crates in front of lasers so you can pass. Use cranes and elevators\
      \ to transport yourself through the level. But all these things are only possible\
      \ if you avoid spikes, flamethrowers and enemy cubes that get in your way. The\
      \ gameplay and controls make it simple to pick up, easy to play and the different\

    review: '[h1]A short cube rolling puzzle game that takes mild use of its premise[/h1]


      [b]As other Nannings titles, [i]Cube Mission[/i] has [url=https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/739206]a
      free version[/url] available on browser.[/b]


      Not my favorite [i]kind[/i] of puzzle game, but since I decided to play through
      and review all Nannings games, here we are. For its sub-genre, it''s alright
      but rather short.


      Isometric cube rolling game, cube is controlled by arrows / WASD (rebindable)
      or mouse using controls on the window. Like other isometric games with diagonal
      movement, it was a bit awkward, since if I forget that ''left'' was for north-west
      instead of south-west, I might fall off the level. Since some levels require
      some speed maneuvers, so I felt it was necessary to play with keyboard instead
      of clicks - it can be learned / got used to.


      [h1]Level features[/h1]


      Levels are 3-dimensional. There are elevators, cranes, and jumping off to lower
      platforms. There are moving platforms, timed tile-based spike traps and line-based
      flame traps, and lasers to be blocked by boxes, sokoban-style but very simple.
      Simple spiked AI boxes might come after you in certain places, needing some
      speedy movement to avoid.


      Naturally, goal is always to reach the shiny end tile. Death or getting stuck
      sends you to back to the level''s start.


      Interesting feature are what I call "companion cubes", if you will. Green cubes
      will follow you around. Purple cubes stick to your cube and have to be rotated
      around to avoid obstacles. Both special cubes may activate certain switches
      to open path forward.


      The companion cubes and blocking lasers present some of the more interesting
      puzzles, while there are many timed obstacle courses of precision and patience
      as well. None of the levels are particularly difficult or challenging though
      - [b]this is a casual puzzler.[/b]


      [h1]A short casual puzzler[/h1]


      In the free version, there are 24 levels. Steam version adds 12 more to the
      total of 36 levels, but it is still not a long experience. My total playtime
      to completion amounted to about 30 minutes.


      That''s quite short. While it''s enjoyable, I recommend getting it on sale.
