    review: "After playing everything the developers have released thus far, I have\
      \ to say I'm a huge fan of Cloak and Dagger's work.  One of the most unique\
      \ games on its roster by far has to be the ambitiously oddball Legend of Hand.\
      \  You play as a rising and rather goofy Kung-Fu journeyman whose fellow men\
      \ & women as well as their lands are falling into disarray.  Off you go on a\
      \ colorful quest to find the elusive Grandmaster Hand; a mythical legend with\
      \ the powers on *hand (broke the game with this lousy pun, sorry)* to restore\
      \ order.  \n\nWithout giving too, too much away, I feel like Cloak and Dagger\
      \ spent about a month meditating in some remote cabin with electricity, doing\
      \ nothing but watching old Kung-Fu movies, playing Earthbound and 90s point\
      \ n' click adventures and ingesting platefuls of raw San Pedro.  \n\nAt the\
      \ length in which I like to keep my reviews there's far too much going on in\
      \ the Legend of Hand to explain and have a snowball's chance in hell of making\
      \ any sense to anybody skimming these words.  There's puzzling, point n' click\
      \ fetch n' find, mini-games, RPG elements including the trading of goods/talking\
      \ to NPCs in town settings, I mean Hesus Christo there's even a somewhat raw\
      \ n' barebones role-playing combat system with turn-based battle coming into\
      \ play...  Not everything that you do is cooked up fully in terms of gameplay\
      \ elements but even with some of the quirks and shortcomings the gameplay is\
      \ original and keeps you guessing as to what you might get up to next.  \n\n\
      The game looks and sounds great with colorful graphics that feel like a Far\
      \ East version of Earthbound that took place solely in meditative martial arts\
      \ master Pu's place of origin.  There's great attention to details in the towns\
      \ and as simple as the combat is I had a good time with it.  I mean this is\
      \ a game where not only do you get to do some fishing to help acquire needed\
      \ items, you also get to become a fish as well.  I'm making sense?  Right, I\
      \ sure as hell am not.  \n\nOverall, Legend of Hand has to be experienced to\
      \ truly understand what rabbits it's pulling out of its gui sleeves.  The game\
      \ is also surprisingly long and packed with content for its meager price.  If\
      \ you're looking for a combination of point n' click and role-playing I think\
      \ this is a great pick but be warned there's a chance you're going to love it\
      \ for its originality or be completely turned off by its host of oddities. \
      \ It's a tough call but for my money this still might be my favorite Cloak and\
      \ Dagger game."
