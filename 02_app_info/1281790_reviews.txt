Metroidvania with a platforming focus, decent albeit restricted exploration, not too long but not too short either. Controls well, all the mechanics gel naturally, fair bit of fun writing even if the plot's very lightweight, non-aggravating collection assistance. I did not really like the bosses, since they're mostly \"dodge until you can hit the boss/you win\" fights which. Ehh. The ones that leaned more towards platforming chase sequences are cool though. There's also full-game speedrun achievements I definitely can't be bothered with but I could imagine this being a good speedrun game, just, speedrunning ain't for me lol. More than anything the atmosphere of this game gave off Knytt Underground vibes, which, I mean, if you can invoke similar feelings as Literally My Favorite Game Of All Time then yeah I'm gonna like your thing a lot, I think. Not perfect, not particularly substantial, but I very much enjoyed my time with it nonetheless.","timestamp_created":1609995831,"timestamp_updated":1609995831,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ47djO7fYCd9qYwQI="}
