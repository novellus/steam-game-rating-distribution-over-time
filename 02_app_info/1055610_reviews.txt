You can hardly tell it's an early access game- I have played for almost seven hours without finding a single bug! My recommendations would be to:\n\n1: Add more classes and weapons. Maybe a Medic (TF2 inspired skin?) who could have a slightly increased self healing rate, and an ability to made some sort of mini tether-heal machine, like in the Medical Bay. I think that more weapons would also be cool, especially weapons in favor of one thing, and not the other- like a blowtorch. A blowtorch could be a very short-rage secondary that does high damage to doors and robots, but very low damage to players, or maybe a bomb or C4 that can deal very high damage to door and entities, maybe even the ship, but is a one time use item. Or maybe you can tie in the C4, blowtorch, add a pistol, and you could even make a demolitions expert class!\n\n2: Allow for more in-depth ship customization. If you could control B1/B2 patrol routes, where is the medical bay in your ship, or maybe even if you could choose what ship you commanded from a list of pre-made ships instead of just the one we currently have, one, that would be awesome.\n\n3: This kind of ties into #2, but add a a workshop where people could make a ship and then post it on the workshop for others to use, maybe even weapons, upgrades, or skins too!\n\n4: More gameplay. I play the game with one of my friends often, and without him there is not a lot to do. I think that a campaign may be a good idea, where you have to destroy enemy ships or protect an allied space station, and I think something other than a Ship-Vs-Ship gamemode would also be cool, like a few Frigates-Vs-Capital ship, or an Attacker-Vs-Defender.\n\nOverall I think that DSBS is a great game, and since it's an Early Access game, it has all sorts of community ideas and developer plans that have a ton of potential, and I think that for $6.99 (I got it on sale for $5.59 :P) it is worth your money.","timestamp_created":1609493165,"timestamp_updated":1609493165,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.508196711540222168","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4vJbR3vYCc9CsvwI="}
