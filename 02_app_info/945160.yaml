    review: "\"Hell\" no.\nApart from the scenes which are quite beautifully drawn,\
      \ the game is a serious pain.\nMain character is very annoying.\nNPCs are annoying\
      \ and overly repetitive.\nStory is ridiculous (not in a good way).\nGameplay\
      \ is lacking: no quick jump screen, can't skip cutscenes, hotspot highlighting\
      \ is a flash blink, character movements look unnatural, just to list a few.\n\
      But the worst part: the puzzles are super weird and tedious even though there\
      \ are not that many interaction points and objects (compared to other games).\n\
      And if this was not enough, [spoiler] the game doesn\u2019t even have an ending:\
      \ to be continued ??? :( [/spoiler]\n"
