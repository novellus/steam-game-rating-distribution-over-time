      \ Lich now sits on the throne. As a courtier to the previous regime you were\
      \ partly responsible for the coup, and as such, your services have been retained\
      \ by the Lich.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the story unfolds, you learn that there\
      \ is much more to this occupation than meets the eye, and must choose whether\
      \ to ally yourself with the Lich and his seductive right-hand woman, with the\
      \ Resistance to try and undo the damage you have unwittingly done, or to walk\
      \ the dangerous thin line of the mercenary, loyal to no-one but his friends.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nLastly, of course, is the Princess, who from her prison cell\
      \ holds a terrible secret that could change everything.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
