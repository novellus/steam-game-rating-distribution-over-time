The background music has an air of old-fashioned mystery to them, and the jazzier parts were fascinating to me--probably because I don't like jazz, and yet I liked these.\n\nThe art was also neat. I think I got this as a bundle or possibly from a Humble Bundle, so I don't remember why I already had this, but I would have bought it anyway just for the soundtrack. The art book is just a cool bonus to me.","timestamp_created":1598448791,"timestamp_updated":1598448791,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43Z2+lfQCe83wnQI="}
