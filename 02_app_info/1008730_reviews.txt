There is also an additional map (same pic) without the labels. The e-book is a 62 page pdf which shows past games by the dev (mostly unfinished prototypes) that led the way to Demon's Tilt pinball. Bigest part is the section about Demon's Tilt, with lot's of pic from the different states of development. It shows very nice how the different elements developed over time (graphics, table layout etc.) There are also developing notes, pics of unused assets, notes to the voice actress etc.\n\nI find it's worth the extra money and nice to have. I did not expect much when I bought the dlc, just to give some support. But I was positively surprised about it.\n\n...And  you get the soundtrack, which makes this already worth only because of this.","timestamp_created":1548374433,"timestamp_updated":1578136894,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":37,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.82018810510635376","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo7+SuO8CeIKRuQE="}
