    review: 'don''t buy this , 10 euros for nothing else than 2:30-3 minute lasting
      tracks !!!

      It''s nice music but I expected a thing like a "piece of art that you can listen
      to travel in your mind trough the ages" , I hope that at least, I helped the
      little passionates devepper''s studio , because the game itself is REALLY amazing'
