    review: 'Where do I even begin reviewing this album. Well first I will begin with
      how they seem to tell a story from start to finish with this album. They managed
      to tell the story of two farmers coming from nothing to making bank (money)
      in the city where they live now. There are songs that will bring you to tears
      such as "Drill Baby Drill (Get That Dough) that really makes you feel the struggles
      that these white boys with attitude have to overcome in order to get that dough
      (money). If you are thinking of picking this game up after experiencing the
      game play of "Whiteboyz Wit Attitude: The Pursuit of Money" you will not be
      disappointed. Somehow they managed to increase the quality of their songs with
      this album (seems impossible I know). Hopefully you decide to pick up this game
      and decide to wear the purp like I know I have been.'
