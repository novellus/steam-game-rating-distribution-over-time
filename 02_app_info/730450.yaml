    review: 'Good: Art, music, modern/cyberpunk theme, quick games.

      Bad: Totally undocumented - no manual, no help, no mouseover hints, a pointless
      30-second tutorial.  No players.


      It looks like there''s a potential game here waiting to be built, but feels
      like an unfinished alpha or demo.  There''s no explanation of basic gameplay,
      why you have two decks, which cards you can draw or play when, why there''s
      a dice button that doesn''t seem to do anything, why you sometimes receive cards
      without drawing them, why the same card sometimes has different costs, what
      the symbols in the corner of the screen mean, what the numbers on the sides
      mean, why your attacks sometimes cause more or less damage, how to get the special
      attacks and what they do, etc.  It''s all a big black-box mystery.


      You''d think with not understanding the rules, gameplay, or UI, that it would
      be difficult.  But chances are, you''ll win your very first game against the
      AI anyway, and every game thereafter.  There''s no real single-player game here
      in that it would be very difficult to lose even when you have no idea what you''re
      doing.  So it relies entirely on multiplayer, but no one seems to be currently
      playing it.  At the moment, only one reviewer has even played for 1 full hour.  (You
      can play over a dozen games in less than an hour.)


      There''s the potential for a game here, but it''s been languishing for over
      a year since release.  If the developers come back to it and flesh it out, it
      could someday become a fun fast card game.  But in its current state, unfortunately
      I can''t recommend it.'
