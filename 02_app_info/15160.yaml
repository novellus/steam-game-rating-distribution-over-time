    review: 'Sadly, this game is up to this day still the best single player game
      about horses, also the best one of the german "Abenteuer auf dem Reiterhof"
      series. There is a huge storyline and also a lot to do around your horses. Also,
      you can play with your horse and lounge it, very nice. The riding is exactly
      as "hard" as it has to be. The lessons are sometimes repetitive, but this is
      what you do with young horses: repeat, learn, and then show it. I could spend
      days at the breeding center! I love that you can continue the game after finishing
      your story. Also, a lot of old characters from the series "Abenteuer auf dem
      Reiterhof" are included, that''s lovely.'
