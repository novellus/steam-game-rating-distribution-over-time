    review: 'I don''t normally write reviews like this: The game is unfinished and
      buggy, As much as it might appeal to fans of sandbox RPG fans, the game should
      be avoided at the price point of $9.99 (and, arguably, at any price point).
      A few things I noticed:


      -No sounds when attacking.

      -Most of the spells just say ''Deals fire damage'', even shock spells.

      -No animations (by design, perhaps, but pretty bland).

      -Bows are the same as melee. Your first attack might occur at a longer range,
      but then your character gets within melee range.

      -Very hard scroll through the skill list.

      -You can clip through the outer walls of the bee hive room.

      -During gameplay my target reticule disappeared somehow.


      No hate for the developer(s?) here, but if you''re charging for a game like
      this then you''re open to critique.'
