      /><br><br>Miden Tower is a fantasy RPG with a compelling and dramatic story.
      After Miden Tower is invaded by the Alroval Empire, the mages who call it home
      find themselves cornered on its upper floors. This sets in motion a series of
      tragic events that lead to a counteroffensive being launched to take back the
      tower and to get revenge for the wrongs committed against them.<br><br>The heroine
      is an actual wall that provides support to the main characters by merging with
      walls or acting as a wind breaker if needed. Turn-based battles can be engaged
      with 3x3 grid battles by using skills with different effects or by summoning
      golems to take down your foes. Alchemize items, learn passive skills and enjoy
      the tons of quests and extra enjoyment that await in this magical adventure!

    review: "Surprisingly engaging game for what it is. There's so much I could say\
      \ that's bad about this game but, to be honest, none of it was bad enough. I\
      \ really enjoyed it.  \n\nDo not use the premium items. It is 100% not worth\
      \ it. Having cheat DLC is probably the worst thing about it because the base\
      \ game is designed to make grinding levels and getting permanent buffs super\
      \ easy.\n\nDon't even worry about grinding or getting the best gear though because\
      \ if you grind to max and get the best gear, you will one shot the final boss.\
      \  There are 75 chapters, most of which are pretty short. I wish there was more."
