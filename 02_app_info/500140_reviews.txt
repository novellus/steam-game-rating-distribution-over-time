Scoring is very basic, 1 point per kill and it doesn't track accuracy or have any goals. There is a Can shooting mini game, but again no real scoring or accuracy recorded. Just shoot some cans until you get bored. \nNeeds a lot more added to it until it becomes a game or something at least enjoyable to spend some time in it.","timestamp_created":1470060310,"timestamp_updated":1470060310,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551819264888763428","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw34Wbo9YCd76FXg=="}
