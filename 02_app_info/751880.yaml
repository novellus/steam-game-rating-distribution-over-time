    review: 'The base game was simply really, really gud.

      And so I bought this DLC, because why not.

      Well, to be honest, it''s actually a great DLC.

      It gives you a completely new game mode.

      And it''s actually a very challenging variant.

      It''s almost like the base game, but endless.

      Indeed, the endless mode is quite random.

      They added a ton of randomizable things.

      I honestly think it''s a really good addition.

      This doesn''t cost that much, so it''s great.

      I have to give it a gigantic positive review.'
