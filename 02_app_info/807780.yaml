    review: Steer clear of this game, the devs promise updates but never once actually
      release updates. They are all too happy to take your money, but don't go and
      fix the bugs that prevent you from actually progressing throughout the story.
      Until the devs actually take notice of every single other oak that's upset with
      the bugs and fix it, I honestly can't recommend this piece of trash.
