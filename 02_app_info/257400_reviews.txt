Yep, I love it. Yep, I hate it even more than I love it. Fuse is an ingenius software for creating characters, the only problem is, how the hell am I supposed to use that? The characters are uploaded to their site, then you can download them into blender, and voila. You have a model. But you can't use it, unless you're used to making models all the time, because the process of making the character usable in games, are terrible and makes you wanna kill yourself. So. Yeah. Great software, no use for it.\n\nUpdate:\nI have since learned to use various 3D programs, and I love Fuse to death, but it's been taken over by Adobe.","timestamp_created":1406594659,"timestamp_updated":1607851262,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519923806190490723","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg+jZrfYCe7LaKw=="}
