    about_the_game: "The powerful and impressive BR DP1 Deltic evokes the UK\u2019\
      s glorious railway heritage, and this attractive prototype diesel locomotive\
      \ is now available for Train Simulator.<br><br>The amalgamation of engine manufacturer\
      \ Napier &amp; Sons and locomotive builder English Electric in 1942 opened up\
      \ the potential to use the powerful Napier Deltic diesel engine in mainline\
      \ locomotives. In the mid-1950s, English Electric produced a demonstration locomotive,\
      \ officially numbered \u2018DP1\u2019, using the Deltic engine, which was to\
      \ be the forerunner of the well-known \u2018Deltic\u2019 class of locomotives.<br><br>The\
      \ DP1 had a particular American feel, with its high sides and streamlined styling,\
      \ made more prominent by its sleek livery, long aluminium beading, high cab\
      \ windows and large nose headlight, fitted for effect rather than practicality.\
      \ Two 18 cylinder Deltic engines were fitted, giving 3,300 horsepower (2,500\
      \ kW) in total and a top speed of 90mph.<br><br>The DP1 was demonstrated and\
      \ tested on the Settle-Carlisle line before entering service as a main line\
      \ locomotive alongside its sister Class 55 \u2018Deltics\u2019, although these\
      \ lacked DP1\u2019s distinctive look. As a main line locomotive, DP1 had a relatively\
      \ short working life, being retired in March 1961 after a major engine failure,\
      \ but easily serving its purpose to demonstrate the Deltic\u2019s power and\
      \ prowess.<br><br>Two years later, in 1963, DP1 was donated to the Science Museum\
      \ in London and is now on display at the National Railway Museum\u2019s Locomotion\
      \ site in Shildon, England. <br>The DP1 Deltic for Train Simulator is available\
      \ in its distinctive blue demonstrator/testing livery, featuring two-tone horn\
      \ and cab lighting, plus BR Mk1 maroon coaches as used on modern day rail tours,\
      \ complete with passenger view.<br><br>The locomotive is also Quick Drive compatible,\
