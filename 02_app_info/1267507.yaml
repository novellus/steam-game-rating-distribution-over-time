      s Frankfurt \u2013 Koblenz route!<br><br>The West Rhine Railway, or Linke Rheinstrecke,\
      \ dates back to the 1840s as a gradual effort to link K\xF6ln, Bonn and Koblenz\
      \ to Mainz, with the southern section between Koblenz and Mainz opening in the\
      \ late 1850s. This line is well known for running along the left bank of the\
      \ Rhein.<br><br>The Main Railway, or Mainbahn, was built following the completion\
      \ of the Rhein-Main-Bahn which connected Mainz to Aschaffenburg. This new line\
      \ was to branch off at Bischofsheim and continue along the Rhein, eventually\
      \ reaching Frankfurt am Main, and was built in less than 2 years, opening in\
      \ January 1863.<br><br>Combined, the Linke Rheinstrecke and Mainbahn offered\
      \ a direct route from K\xF6ln to Frankfurt, and until the eventual opening of\
      \ the highspeed line, made it one of the busiest lines in all of Germany. Even\
      \ in recent history it remains important however, with a station built to serve\
      \ Frankfurt Airport in 1972, followed by Gateway Gardens station which opened\
      \ in 2019. Both of these stations are reached by means of an underground tunnel\
      \ which burrows itself under the terminals of the Airport.<br><br>The lines\

      \ in the past few years, services have been strikingly branded as S\xDCWEX (S\xFC\
