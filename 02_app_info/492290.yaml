    review: "O jogo \xE9 muito bom, mas ele tem um pequeno problema: a curva de aprendizado\
      \ dele \xE9 meio estranha.\n\nDe in\xEDcio \xE9 um pouco dif\xEDcil pegar o\
      \ jeito, e por isso ele parece MUITO mais dif\xEDcil que \xE9 de verdade nas\
      \ primeiras vezes que voc\xEA joga. Depois de completar o jogo umas duas vezes,\
      \ por\xE9m, ele j\xE1 parece muito mais f\xE1cil at\xE9 que as primeiras vezes,\
      \ bem leve. \n\nComo cada partida dele dura pouco, d\xE1 at\xE9 pra jogar uma\
      \ vez, ganhar ou perder, sair, ir fazer outra coisa, voltar e jogar mais um\
      \ pouco. De in\xEDcio eu achei ele muito dif\xEDcil pro meu gosto (eu gosto\
      \ de jogos f\xE1ceis), mas decidi insistir mais um pouco e ele ficou realmente\
      \ muito mais simples."
