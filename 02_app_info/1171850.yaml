      notes: "The game contains opportunities to engage in romance and sexual situations;\
        \ as a text-based game, these are not visually depicted, but nonetheless are\
        \ intended for more mature audiences.  \r\n\r\nThere are scenes of violence\
        \ described, but again, as a text-based game there are no visual depictions\
        \ of gore. "
