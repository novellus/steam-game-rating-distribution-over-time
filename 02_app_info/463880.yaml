    review: "It retails for $2.99, so that should set your expectations. I picked\
      \ this up with for between $0.50 and $1.50. For that price I'm not even mad,\
      \ at the full $3, I'd be mildly irritated. \n\nThe presentation is as good as\
      \ it can be for what it is. I find a lot of charm and appeal in the color choices\
      \ and the general art. But, that's all things considered. It's not impressive\
      \ on it own in it's own right. It also claims to have full controller support,\
      \ but I can't seem how to figure it out. With a game like this it's not a deal\
      \ breaker per se, but I'd enjoy it a lot more if I could just get my damn controller\
      \ to work. \n\nThat said, there isn't much else to say. I would not recommend\
      \ it, even at the price point. But, because of the price point, it's not fair\
      \ to expect a ton out of it. If you are looking for a goofy, casual, fanfic\
      \ like old school JRPG then this game is probably worth checking out, especially\
      \ if you can get it discounted.\n\nEDIT: After spending a little more time with\
      \ the game, nothing has changed about what I said above, I will say the music\
      \ is pretty decent. Not worth the price of admission on its own, but worth bringing\
      \ up that I did actually enjoy the music. If it's used with royalties or if\
      \ it's original I don't know."
