We played this game vary often and I miss playing it with her. After all this social distancing is over that is what I plan to do... I was just expecting it would have been over sooner... hopeful thinking I guess.\r\n\r\nI do wish that I could have added muti player, however I do not think that I ever will, I hope that families can play this game as a fun way to pas the time together... though in this modern day that is happening less and less often.<\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1>When me and my sister were young, we would play this game to pass the time. We stopped playing because nether of us wanted to draw the dots for the game board. This is actually my second version of the game I have made using Game Maker, the first one was lost to time, however it was much less player friendly to play and required much more trust between players. \r\n\r\nWith this new version I was able to  increase the max number of possible players to 8.\r\n\r\nThis is a relaxed multi player game with out any combat and can be played by anyone of any age... meant for 2 or more players\r\n\r\n- setting up a game\r\n\r\nto set up a game, use the middle mouse wheel, or the arrow keys to select the number of players, then press the enter button on your keyboard when everyone is ready to play\r\n\r\n- game play\r\n\r\ntake turns using the mouse, left clicking between dots to create lines.
