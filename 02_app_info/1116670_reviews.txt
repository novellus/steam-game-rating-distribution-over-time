The challenge comes from various environments that limit your track placement, and the difficulty of avoiding other trains. If you do crash, you can send out a special train to clear the wreck, but that train also must be directed back to a station. It can get quite hectic, but there are buttons to slow down the gameplay which helps a lot. \n\nLaying track costs money, but I haven't been short of cash yet. You also get to spend your earnings on restoring old trains which is actually quite motivating and the 3D models look pretty good. I've not finished one yet, but there are achievements for doing so.\n\nI played the first seven levels before writing this review, and enjoyed the challenge. Sure, the graphics look a bit cheap and the English isn't perfect, but the gameplay is good enough to warrant a positive review. \n","timestamp_created":1580006779,"timestamp_updated":1580006779,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544568896293640137","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h8Xv7+8Ce/WO7gE="}
