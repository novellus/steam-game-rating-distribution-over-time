Grand life!  Games can take place in either New York, Amsterdam, Berlin, or Sydney with the first game only being focused on earning money. Once the first game is successfully completed, players can start new games in which categories of [i]lifetime happiness[/i], [i]education[/i], and [i]collections[/i] can also be designated as criteria for successfully completing games. [i]This Grand Life[/i] also has a \"zombie mode\" in which players have to find time to make it to the hospital and undergo treatment (while playing an ever-increasing fee) in order to keep the game going.\n\n[h1]Graphics and Sound[/h1]\n\nThe graphics are a simple 2D map of the city that the player has chosen for their home, but the only thing that really stands out about the graphics, are the creepy-looking characters.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1639586110\n\nSounds are all basic bells and whistles that add nothing to the game, nor does the music help with setting in the mood despite what the store page claims, but ol' Il Pallino advises players to turn off the music and sound and play [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHhOUYdg2S8]How To Be A Millionaire[/url] by [i]ABC[/i].\n\n[h1]Positives[/h1]\n\nOl' Il Pallino has the vice of providing objective information in reviews, so rather than just write \"everything not related to the graphics and sound\" for [i]positives[/i], the first great feature is that [i]This Grand Life[/i] has tangible differences between each of the cities, each with their own unique problem, but with many different advantages.  Financial sector jobs in New York are better paying, factory jobs in Berlin are also better paying, Amsterdam has coffee to consume, and Sydney has select days where the player can [i]throw shrimp on the barbie[/i].\n\nAlthough the game ultimately encourages players to make their money by starting their own businesses, not only are there a lot of businesses, but there's also a lot of different occupations with several top-paying occupations good enough to maintain the highest standard of living.  Every map has both a technical school and university where players can study a huge variety of subjects that lead to either the top-paying jobs or are used as a gateway towards self-employment. Libraries also have hobby courses that can be applied for to satisfy either lifetime happiness and educational goals.\n\nApart from completing collections of various knick-knacks, participating in special events, and acquiring more knowledge in one's life, [i]This Grand Life[/i] also has lifetime happiness that can also be worked towards in the form of finding lovers, getting married, having children, and raising those children correctly.  If players find themselves in a bind for trying to raise a child on a lower income while married, the spouse can be freed-up to work by enrolling children in daycare.\n\n[i]This Grand Life[/i] also allows for the player to adjust [i]advanced settings[/i] to help make the game experience more unique. If the player thinks the default [i]central bank vigilance[/i] makes for too calm of market conditions, the setting can be adjusted to make the market more volatile.  If the player is confident of their playing keep their health up,\" the player can totally slash the healthcare budget for the sake of reducing taxes.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1951737609\n\n[i]This Grand Life[/i] also allows for five different types of upbringings to determine difficulty, so that the n00bz can get lots of points to apply towards positive traits and/or starting education, while the 1337z can be forced to start the game with numerous (user-defined) negative traits the player can hope to manage.\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n\nThe sliders to set goals for  [i]money[/i], [i]lifetime happiness[/i], and [i]collections[/i] have too low of a maximum setting when compared to the slider for [i]knowledge[/i].  The player can satisfy the maximum need for [i]money[/i] before they can afford to buy their first upper-class housing. The player can also satisfy the maximum need for [i]collections[/i] with missing items in their collection.  (A player in Berlin merely needs to purchase a garage and high-end car.)  The player will also have no problem satisfying the maximum requirement for lifetime happiness.  However, if the player sets the [i]knowledge[/i] slider to the maximum, the player is going to need to earn numerous degrees, complete all of the hobby courses at the library, and earn numerous certificates from the technical school and government for the sake of acquiring knowledge.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThere is no better \"personal tycoon\" (for lack of a better term) on the market.  If the player wants a casual turn-based game to play while they're having an instant message conversation with a beloved friend either to pass the time or use for conversation material, [i]This Grand Life[/i] is that game!  Let it be known that [i]This Grand Life[/i] is to management games what the [i]Space Pilgrim Saga[/i] is to story rich games:  Indie [strike]gold[/strike] platinum!\n\nThis review was provided independently by an admin at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/25150682/]REXCurse (REXnetwork)[/url].\nNo compensation was provided.\n\nEmail contact@dnbmedia.co for requests & promotions.","timestamp_created":1578126341,"timestamp_updated":1609741756,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.594071149826049805","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5ryF5vYCcsXc6QE="}
