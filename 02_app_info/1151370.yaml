    about_the_game: '<strong>Synopsis</strong><br><br>You are the Night Guardian,
      part of a long line of warriors tasked with keeping the creatures of the night
      away from your sleeping owner. <br>But beware, these monsters are driven by
      a darkness that lurks under the bed. <br>Do you have what it takes to survive
      until morning?<br><br><strong>The Player</strong><br><br>You play as a cute
      little teddy bear who has been fighting against the creatures of the night for
      over a year since he was gifted to his master on a cold Christmas morning. But
      lately, you''ve noticed the creatures are a bit more active than normal. You
      soon realize that there is a force unlike anything you''ve ever seen rotting
      under the master''s bed.<br><br><strong>Your Weapon</strong><br><br>Your only
      weapon against the creatures of the night is a flashlight. Bash and burn your
      enemies until the sun rises on a new day. But be careful: the flashlight has
      limited battery life, you will need to shake it to recharge it. Make sure you
      are able to spend precious time doing so.<br><br><strong>The Creatures of the
      Night</strong><br><br>Toys and clothes by day, but by night they are corrupted
      by the darkness of the master''s nightmares. Easy enough to subdue, but they
      will swarm you if you don''t keep them in check.<br><br><strong>The Boss</strong><br><br>You
      are not the first Teddy Bear. Before you there was Snuggles. He too, swore to
      protect the master. That is, before the darkness of the master''s nightmares
      took over his mind and corrupted his body. Now he is but a shell of his former
      self. A mere vessel for the darkness to grow. It will stop at nothing to reach
      its full form.<br><br>Features:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Five monsters to face<br></li><li>A
      Boss that reacts to how well you play<br></li><li> Flashlight Combat<br></li><li>A
      cute Bear ready to kick butt!</li></ul>'
