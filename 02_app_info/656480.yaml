    review: "A nice game as such, but containing unforgivable mistakes in the vocabulary\
      \ that it\u2019s supposed to teach you, and badly optimised in my opinion.\n\
      \nI bought this game for my 9 year old daughter, who likes hidden object games\
      \ and is quite good in them - but there aren't that many suitable for children,\
      \ so I was happy to find this one. Since we are neither English nor Spanish\
      \ native speakers, I was prepared to translate for her and the game wasn't meant\
      \ as an educational tool, but she learns English in school, so I hoped she would\
      \ also pick up a few animal names while playing. But very early she got frustrated\
      \ by the fact, that it seemed simply impossible to get three golden stars and\
      \ thus uncover more pieces of the bonus puzzle, no matter how quick she was\
      \ or how hard she tried (I tried to help with that and didn't succeed either)\
      \ - so she stopped playing because it was driving her to tears, and I bought\
      \ her Hidden Animals Photo Hunt instead to make up for this disappointment.\
      \ \n\nThen I started playing myself. I got through all the levels, but I wasn\u2019\
      t able to figure out how the scoring works. At first I thought one just had\
      \ to be really quick, but sometimes I got three stars when it took me 60 seconds\
      \ and sometimes 30 seconds wasn\u2019t enough for even one star, so I didn\u2019\
      t have a clue. Eventually I developed an effective way how to exercise my newly\
      \ acquired language skills - after opening a level find all the animals in it\
      \ and try to name them one by one, and only after that start clicking on the\
      \ 8 randomly chosen \u2013 which turned out to be also an effective way how\
      \ to receive three stars, so I guess it\u2019s good mechanics in itself, but\
      \ having to find that out by trial and error wasn\u2019t that great. This was\
      \ long after I decided not to mind the scoring (even though it kept me slightly\
      \ wondering because it just seemed completely random) and concentrate on actually\
      \ learning a few Spanish words just for fun and some new English words too,\
      \ because to this day I never knew what a curlew was for instance (neither in\
      \ my own language). \n\nVery soon it became clear that this won\u2019t work\
      \ without a Spanish dictionary (with pronunciation, because what use is knowing\
      \ how to write a word in foreign language when you don\u2019t know how to say\
      \ it), a zoological encyclopedia and lots and lots of googling \u2013 because\
      \ there was a lot of birds pictured as seen from a distance that weren\u2019\
      t recognisable at all, animals I wasn\u2019t sure about and didn\u2019t know\
      \ their English name, and some I thought I knew but the English name given didn\u2019\
      t correspond with that. And thus I found the greatest fault of this game, one\
      \ that simply doesn\u2019t allow for a positive review: there are mistakes in\
      \ the vocabulary. You get a picture of a stag beetle \u2013 yet are given \u201C\
      dor-beetle\u201D as its English name, and \u201Cel escarabajo de oro\u201C as\
      \ its Spanish name, which appears to be a jewel scarab Chrysina resplendens.\
      \ You get a picture of a grosbeak and the right English name for it - yet are\
      \ given the Spanish name for a great spotted woodpecker (el pico picapinos).\
      \ The same goes for a hyena, that is passed to you as a lynx (el lince) in Spanish.\
      \ You get a picture of a silver angelfish \u2013 yet are given \u201Csailfish\u201C\
      \ both in English and Spanish (el pez vela), which is a very interesting fish\
      \ with a characteristic dorsal fin that I didn't know at all before. And so\
      \ on. (Please do correct me on any of these if I'm wrong.) If you are really\
      \ dedicated to learning the right names, you\u2019ll find all that for yourself,\
      \ and it certainly teaches you not to trust everything that is written and verify\
      \ your information. But I doubt the game was meant to remind you of the importance\
      \ of that instead of teaching you the correct words.\n\nAlso, I went through\
      \ all the English-Spanish levels, so that I would be able to learn the Spanish\
      \ names of all the animals in the game, and then practice them in the Spanish\
      \ levels. But there are a few animals that are not present in the bilingual\
      \ levels, and then appear in the Spanish ones \u2013 how is one supposed to\
      \ learn those? Again the only way is to use a dictionary outside the game, which\
      \ is uncomfortable and the game being designed this way somewhat goes against\
      \ its proclaimed educational value. Plus the fact that you are given 8 randomly\
      \ chosen animals in each level to find and thus practice resulted for me in\
      \ getting the same animals again and again and again most of the time, while\
      \ others weren't chosen but once or twice. This really isn't a very good way\
      \ of building your vocabulary.\n\nThen there are some minor issues. As mentioned\
      \ in another review, it\u2019s quite annoying having to click the exit icon\
      \ three times in a row in order to exit the game. Much more annoying is entering\
      \ the bonus puzzle every time you finish a level with 3 stars, after it has\
      \ long been uncovered \u2013 one wants to revisit the levels in order to practice\
      \ the words, which this feature makes rather unpleasant. And the score counting\
      \ at the end of each level simply takes too long (not to mention that the dull\
      \ jingle accompanying it always feels like a slap in the face after such great\
      \ music in the level itself), but if you skip it, you don\u2018t get to see\
      \ what score and how much stars did you get. I also encountered two minor bugs:\
      \ in one English level there is a picture of a curlew assigned to \u201Choopoe\u201C\
      \ (in other levels these two birds are correctly distinguished) and in one Spanish\
      \ level a bear and a fish it carries in its mouth are wrongly assigned each\
      \ to the other\u2018s name.\n\nPros: Unlike one other reviewer I find the way\
      \ the animals are \u201Cglued\u201C into the landscapes quite cute and often\
      \ entertaining. And the music of course \u2013 that is undeniably good."
