    review: 'I love tower defense games!


      If you can get over the graphics, you''ll find a decent Tower Defense game.
      It looks like what Master of Orion (yes, the original) would have looked like
      if it was going for an retro version of itself. If it''s not clear, the graphics
      are pretty clunky.


      It''ll give you a good day or game play. It has a tech tree, about 25 maps and
      4 towers. The balance needs a little tweaking but if you love tower defense
      games like me, it''s worthwhile addition to your library!


      I can only hope the first tower defense game that I build turns out this well.'
