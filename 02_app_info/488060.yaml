      \ Dessa vez podendo jogar com povos asi\xE1ticos, todos eles super carism\xE1\
      ticos, com visual espetacular e muitas adi\xE7\xF5es para o competitivo (como\
      \ poder jogar com elefantes sem ser os Persas). Claro, a Definitive Edition\
      \ ainda \xE9 a melhor escolha, mas donos de computadores mais simples n\xE3\
      o se arrepender\xE3o ao jogar isso"
