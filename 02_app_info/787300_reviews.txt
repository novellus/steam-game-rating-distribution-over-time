Playtime for the whole game is around 2  (EDIT: now 4) minutes. All parts of the game, handling, graphic, sound are awfull. The best part of this mess is this sentence from the storefront-description:\n\n\"The most interesting feature of this game is that if you shoot the goons and they don't die, you have to shoot at the places surrounding the attackers to kill them.\"\n\n\nHere is a full walkthrough of the game (i played it twice to see, if the abrupt ending is not just a bug):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qh5Xz4971Q\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nEpisode 2 came out as a free dlc. While it is still a mess, e2 is better then the first episode. Graphics, sound and handling are still awefull, but it is much more playable. Playtime around two minutes. But i am impressed, that the dev is still trying to make a full story and invest time to add new content.  It is still a bad game, but i cant say anymore, that this is the worst game on steam.\n\n\nHere is the full walkthrough for Episode 2:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kxS4Mwlv7g\n\n\nIn the moment i wrote this update, the dlc is not included on this storepage.
