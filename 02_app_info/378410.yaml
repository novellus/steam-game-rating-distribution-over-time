    review: "Okay.  So.  I have a bit of a chip on my shoulder when it comes to what\
      \ seems like arbitrary character deaths in games.  So maybe I'm being too hard\
      \ on this.  But there seems to be at least one arbitrary death zone on each\
      \ level.  \nWhat I CAN legit complain about is the controls.  They are not good.\
      \  I believe the word commonly used for this issue is \"floaty.\"  I've played\
      \ through a level and a half of this and, quite frankly, I have not encountered\
      \ anything compelling enough to put up with the controls any further.   The\
      \ game play is iffy.  The challenge is sparse until it becomes instantly fatal\
      \ with little of no warning.  I have not gotten far enough in to know if the\
      \ story is worth it but I get the feeling it's not.  The artwork is not bad\
      \ per say but I can't say it's particularly good either.  It's a style I'm not\
      \ normally fond of so take that criticism with a grain or three of sodium. \
      \ \nOverall, I can't recommend this.  I PERSONALLY dislike it enough to be asking\
      \ for a refund.  But, objectively I can see where some would enjoy it.  Just\
      \ not me."
