      Creature&quot;:</h2><br><i>&quot;It's a long story, but let's start with the
      past... In the &quot;old 80s&quot; there was a rumor that an alien species was
      stranded here on earth. It was hostile to us and wanted to kill us all. But
      this creature was stopped by brave teenagers...<br>What were the chances that
      this group was in the same place at the exact time?<br>But, you know... This
      is not the last time there's been a rumor like this. There have been several
      stories of such creatures. Were any of them real? Even several years later,
      there have been incidents that describe exactly this event. Unbelievable...
      isn't it? Well, my boy. Sooner or later the whole world knew that these events
      were true, and then it happened... But this is a story for another time...&quot;<br>-
      Zaiden to his son in the year 177.</i><br><br><br>This game doesn't currently
      offer anything like what it will offer in the future. It will be very exciting
      when all the stories come together. But we want to make the start to get the
      necessary experience of how this game will be received by you and where we need
      to improve. But what is there to play here?<br><br>&quot;Kill or Die&quot;,
      a multiplayer mode for up to five players:<br><br>You heard it in the story
      of Zaiden. In the old 80s there were teenagers who defeated a hostile creature.
      Well, you know... Let's jump back to that point and take the role ourselves.<br><br>In
      this mode, you can be one of four teenagers, or the hostile creature trying
      to kill the teenagers. As a teenager, you must destroy crystals to close a portal
      and disable the creature's protective armor. Only then can you attack and finish
      them off. As a creature, you must stop the teenagers and survive. By a mysterious
      effect, there are also altars that can be used for special actions to make it
      difficult for the other team. Kill or die.<br><br>&quot;Hunt&quot;, a single
      player mode (soon to be co-op mode)<br><br>Zaiden also told of similar events
      after the heroic deeds of the teenage group. You can experience exactly these
      events in this mode. You are with other people in an area that has long since
      been abandoned or never entered. Now you have to coexist with them and fight
      for survival. But that is not all. One or more stranded creatures live in this
      area and will kill you and the other humans if possible. Defend yourself, hunt
      them and survive.
