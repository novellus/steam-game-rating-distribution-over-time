this game, the poor cursed knight needs to drink different types of alcohol to stay alive and get special powers, solving puzzles along the way. It is NOT for kids. Drinking too much will make him vomit, which is a limit you don't want to reach, in the game or in real life. There is also a minimal amount of \"weed\" comedy. Think lite \"memes\" level comedy. There is swearing in the game, but it's mostly \"translated\" into parody medieval English.\r\n\r\nThere are also scenes of comedic nudity and implied sexuality, as well as 2D cartoon violence, similar to drunken boxing and kicking. Please, do not try to recreate any of this foolishness at home, or anywhere for that matter. Just enjoy the silliness. Thank you."}}}}
