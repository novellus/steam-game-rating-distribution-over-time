This is similar to Google Blockly or MIT Scratch if you're familiar with those free open-source programs.\n\nObviously, you can just learn block programming from Blockly or Scratch for free if you'd like and there's several online tutorials for that as well. However, this program lets you see your creations in VR so it does add something to the table.\n\nYou can use teleportation or full locomotion. You have a tablet that you can easily re-size and have it come towards your hands. You have a few environments to choose from as well. The program ran smoothly for me and I didn't experience any issues.\n\nMy main criticism of this app is that there really is no tutorial. There is just some texts explaining what the different functions do in general. There's also some exemplars that you can run within the program and mess with to give you an idea of how the different functions work. Also, I would like to see more than just drawing. I know that MIT Scratch has sprite animations in their block programming as well. That would have been really cool here. \n\nOverall, I had fun. I don't know how much time I have to put into this but I definitely learned a very simple block program in a very short amount of time. I can definitely recommend this to anyone interested in block programming for VR. I know the 2D programs are free, but I don't mind spending $9 USD (sale price) to see this brought to VR.","timestamp_created":1580266109,"timestamp_updated":1580266155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.590163946151733398","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v/3M9+8Cc4Pn7gE="}
