      \ /><br><strong>Paradiddle</strong> lets you explore your percussion skills\
      \ freely in a flexible and responsive VR environment. Drag and drop as many\
      \ drums as you want from your palette. Arrange and scale them with ease to create\
      \ the setup that works best for you. Save custom drum sets and load your favorites\
      \ whenever you come back.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>Virtual Drums, Realistic\

      \ /><br>In Paradiddle, drums give off different sounds based on a variety of\
      \ factors, with some drums supporting over 100 sounds just based on how hard\
      \ they were hit. Certain percussion instruments, such as the ride cymbals, also\
      \ play different audio samples depending on what part of the instrument was\
      \ hit.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A Platform for Sharing and Learning</strong></h2>Record\
      \ your songs and share them with others in the Paradiddle community. In a song\
      \ playback, Paradiddle uses visual cues to show when each drum is about to get\
      \ hit. Speed up, slow down and play along to a recording in a uniquely immersive\
      \ learning environment\u2014or just sit back and the watch the show.<h2 class=\"\

      \ different types of percussion instruments without worrying about making noise,\
      \ having a dedicated space for them, or buying them.<br>The current list of\
      \ playable drums are: <strong>hi-hat, bass drum, snare, 3 types of toms, 2 types\
      \ of crash cymbals and 2 types of ride cymbals.</strong><br></li><li><strong>Realistic\

      \ can be integrated into Paradiddle to trigger any drums within the environment.\
      \ Likewise, Paradiddle can also send MIDI output, which means you can use the\
      \ app to trigger your own samples in your favorite digital audio workstation.\
