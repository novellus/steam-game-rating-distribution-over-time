    review: "Vanilla- Garden of Judgement is a short visual novel experience. Fair\
      \ warning, it\u2019s written to be pretty bleak, don\u2019t go in expecting\
      \ slice of life or true happy ends. \n\nLooking at the lovely character artwork\
      \ and gentle music, I often felt extremely at peace and contemplative reading\
      \ this. At other times I just found everything very haunting and mysterious.\
      \ The backgrounds are mostly just real life imagery with a strong blur effect,\
      \ but it works very well here and sets the mood nicely. \n\nThere are three\
      \ main girls you interact with, in order, followed by a kind of epilogue tying\
      \ it all together. I didn\u2019t like the way the interactive parts were handled,\
      \ as you\u2019re essentially railroaded into making heartless decisions to continue.\
      \ If you choose the kinder options, you get a bad end with that particular girl-\
      \ which actually reads more like a good, if vague ending- it\u2019s a little\
      \ confusing. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m against the MC doing bad things,\
      \ but at the times they happen, they come completely out of the blue and seem\
      \ to happen just because the author needs them to.\n\nI also felt that there\
      \ were a couple of brief scenes that were written as crude for the sake of being\
      \ crude, but there\u2019s not too much of that. \n\nIt\u2019s nice to have a\
      \ more contemplative story that doesn\u2019t follow all of the standard progression,\
      \ although some of the standard anime tropes (tsundere, etc.) still apply. \n\
      \nThere are myriad technical issues such as the script being unable to properly\
      \ deal with an apostrophe, causing extra spaces to appear. The visuals are either\
      \ viewed in a small window, or if maximized, you get a larger picture but it\u2019\
      s set all the way to the left of your screen with a large black bar on the right\
      \ side. You\u2019re unable to take screenshots through Steam. I\u2019ve heard,\
      \ but not confirmed, that there was supposed to be more voice work but it wasn\u2019\
      t implemented properly in the English version. \n\nAll in all, I found this\
      \ just unique and enjoyable enough that I feel it\u2019s worth pushing past\
      \ the technical problems and giving it a try.\n"
