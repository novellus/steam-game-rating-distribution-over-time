    review: "[h1]Experienced on Windows Mixed Reality[/h1]\n\nThis is a VR music video.\
      \ Whole thing lasts about 5 minutes, although the song is on a loop and you\
      \ do have to manually quit the game. There is no gameplay here and no interactions\
      \ other than walking. Locomotion is gaze-based plus press of the trigger. \n\
      \nThere are two environments. I would suggest looking around the first one completely\
      \ before teleporting into the second world as there is no way back. The two\
      \ environments are nice. I liked the music track. I thought the music went well\
      \ with the intended experience. \n\nIt's running on the Unity Engine. The visuals\
      \ are kind of dated now in 2020. The lighting could have been done better as\
      \ well. You can clip through objects. Wish there were at least some interactions.\
      \ Still, it was a nice, though not great overall experience for me. I guess\
      \ it depends on whether you like the music or not ... listen to the store page\
      \ video. \n\n[b]Rate 6/10. Not the best music video. There might even be free\
      \ ones that are better. However, keep in mind, you're paying for a audio/visual\
      \ artistic experience. So I can't really complain about the price. [/b]"
