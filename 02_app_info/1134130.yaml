    review: 'I''ve tried several times to beat the Egypt boss and while it explodes,
      it doesn''t go away, so I wondered if this version is broken how do they have
      screenshots...


      THEY ARE FROM THE AMIGA VERSION!


      As far as I know this game is uncompletable, Piko Interactive is known for getting
      unreleased games and finishing them, so either this is a prototype of the DOS
      version of the DOS version was never completable?


      Don''t buy this game, unless they switch it with the Amiga version of somehow
      fix this old game.
