The whole thing isn't that bad.\n\nIt's interesting for a while until it stops being interesting and a bug wipes out your whole progress.\nThen you have to Alt-F4 because it's the only way to quit the game.\n\nThe crazy high base price and the impossibility to change keys definitely seal this as a thumb down.\n\n[h1](follow my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33882793/]GenXPlayers[/url] for more retro and indie reviews)[/h1]","timestamp_created":1608998162,"timestamp_updated":1608998434,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwzfbxz/YCfb62vQI="}
