Just wow. \nI've seen lots of games filled to the brim with far-left propaganda, but this one surely takes the cake.  \n\nWe're talking about the farm collectivization in communist Russia;  the violent submission of land owners to Stalin's \"master plan\", and the subsequent famine of 1932-1933.   \nYes, we're talking about more than 10 million dead people - especially in Ukraine;  this was without a single doubt an absolute genocide, masterfully executed by Stalin, the bolshevik dictator whose atrocities can only be equaled by Hitler himself.  \n\nFarmers who dared to oppose the bolshevik regime were either exterminated or sent to gulags;  their possessions forcefully, violently confiscated, their Christian icons burned, priests arrested and their churches closed by the godless communists.  Their farmer class (kulaks) completely eradicated.   \nEven the children were encouraged to \"rat\" on their parents (if they dared to hide any grain to avoid confiscation by the communist state agents).\n\nSuch was the extend of this famine, that even cannibalism was not uncommon.\nThat's the true legacy of Stalin and his communism:  millions upon millions of dead - because human life in a bolshevik regime has zero value;   it means absolutely nothing;  the complete submission to the party is all that matters.  The only alternative is death - through starvation, or worse.  \nDid you think the Katyn massacre was horrible?   Think again; that was nothing, compared to this;   and it was just one of the famines that would befall communist Russia.  \n\nAnd yet in this \"game\"-piece of shameful communist propaganda, the main character tries to.... \"peacefully reason\" with the farmers, \"get in their head\", in order to... \"peacefully convince\" them to give up their property and become a part of a \"collective\".  \nIndeed, it will all be done \"peacefully\"...  \nBecause, otherwise....  there will be \"peaceful\" starvation....   \"peaceful\" imprisonment in gulags....  and \"peaceful\" executions.  \n\nAs a closing comment, I'd like to urge anyone who feels too lazy to read about the Dekulakization, the Holodomor, the Collectivization, etc., to, AT THE VERY LEAST, watch the 2019 movie \"Mr. Jones\".  (and while at it, maybe even learn what inspired George Orwell to write the \"Animal Farm\" and Big Brother's absolutist-totalitarian-regime-exerting-control-through-massive-propaganda, that was depicted in his seminal book, \"1984\").","timestamp_created":1602608425,"timestamp_updated":1603794921,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.408221513032913208","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44ozotPUCdonVpwI="}
