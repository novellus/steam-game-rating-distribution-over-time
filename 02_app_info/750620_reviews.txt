I almost quit and restarted the game when this happened, as I didn't expect to have reached the end after 37mins.","timestamp_created":1576487245,"timestamp_updated":1576487245,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zMr9hu8Cd6rY5AE="}
