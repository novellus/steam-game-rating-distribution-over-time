    review: "\n\n            (THE GOOD)\n\n\nIn short this changed my life, before\
      \ I viewed this video I was hooked on drugs, crack cocaine especially.\n\nThis\
      \ is a masterpiece of a film, the best installment in the Merio Broth series.\n\
      \nI will always enjoy this more than I could ever enjoy the games, as this sends\
      \ powerful messages about anti-bullying and racism, better than any cool cat\
      \ media out there.\n\n\n            (THE BAD)\n\n\nMerio is blatantly racist\
      \ towards the Koop Troops"
