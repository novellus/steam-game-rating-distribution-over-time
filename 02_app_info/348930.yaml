    about_the_game: "Lone Wolf: A Post Apocalyptic Beat-Em Up Role Playing Game. This\
      \ action/adventure game lets a player use martial arts skills, weapons, and\
      \ turn into a werewolf to fight their way through a world set in the aftermath\
      \ of post nuclear devastation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis game is considered to\
      \ be a Beat-Em Up Role Playing Game, where you take control of a character and\
      \ his special fighting abilities. Akin to the art of a comic book, it relies\
      \ on 2D animation for the characters in a 3D environment to give it a new style\
      \ to the games of today. It can be played as a single-player game or co-op with\
      \ other players, in several modes of game play including a Story Mode and a\
      \ multiplayer Fighting Mode. The game is currently playable on Windows, Mac,\
      \ and Linux.<br />\r\nThe focus of the game play combines the aspects of a beat-em\
      \ up fighting action filled game with the character building and interaction\
      \ of a role playing game. However, the character building is transparent, for\
      \ the most part, allowing for players to play as they want and get better at\
      \ what they do best. The world is non-linear and open for players to explore\
      \ and discover its secrets and have encounters with the denizens of the world\
      \ in the aftermath.<br />\r\nThis game has a very retro-feel as it takes the\
      \ player back to the days of the beat-em up arcade machines of the 1980's and\
      \ 1990's, and shows how fun a platform styled action/adventure game was and\
      \ can be today.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCurrent Features and Notes:<br />\r\n<br\
      \ />\r\nAll character art is hand drawn and the environments are all 3D modeled.\
      \ The sprites and artwork is currently made for 1080P.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMain\
      \ character &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; can transform into a werewolf to fight enemies<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nComic book style cutscenes as part of a full storyline that\
      \ the main character is engrossed in<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCurrently local multiplayer\
      \ only, up to 4 players<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWrestler character &quot;Brok&quot;\
      \ can be played in multiplayer or AI driven, more playable characters will be\
      \ added in the future<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlayable characters can be AI driven,\
      \ if you play a multiplayer game and want to continue without your friend the\
      \ playable character can be switched to AI on the fly. AI can be customized\
      \ per character<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSneak kills can be made as the character\
      \ is in some shadowed areas of the game<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCharacters have unique\
      \ skills that increase in the way that you play, there is no level building,\
      \ the character just improves their skills based on how often and how you use\
      \ the skill.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCharacters use weapons that they are skilled\
      \ in, so there are weapons that can only be used by certain characters. Currently\
      \ there are 28 playable weapons! 10 different guns, 3 different swords, 4 different\
      \ knives, and a lead pipe that can be used by the main character Lone Wolf,\
      \ and 3 guns and 4 heavy two handed melee weapons for Brok the wrestler, and\
      \ finally 3 throwing weapons that can be used by both playable characters<br\
