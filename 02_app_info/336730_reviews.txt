Sam & Max got along, despite their differences. In this, we have two characters constantly opposed to each other in largely bland or trite dialogue. When it wasn't puerile, it was just \"meh.\"\n\nIt's a shame, really - clearly these people worked on/have some inspiration from the old Sam & Max games (there's a Max sticker on their car), but it falls flat. \n\nPretty bland and lackluster. Slow gameplay.  As a head up, it has more adult themes than the old Sam & Max games, so you may want to steer clear of this for a kid. \n\nPlus points - good background music & good graphics. Voice acting was overall good, but the two main chaarcters sorta grated on my ears. The sidekick has a particular lower-class English accent which gets irritating after a while.\n\nI'd take a quick pass.","timestamp_created":1539487281,"timestamp_updated":1539487281,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522058844566345215","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49vWluOYCconTrAE="}
