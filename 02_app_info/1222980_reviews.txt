Unlike Space Invaders Extreme here on Steam, you do not need a constant internet connection to play it.  Wow!\n\nPros:\n+ It's fun and cheap\n+ Excellent arcadey sound effects with booming bass!\n+ Enemy variety, Upgrades and Bosses spice up the classic formula\n\nCons:\n- More visual options would be nice.  I don't need to see a \"0\" pop up when my hit scores zero points.\n- Audio mix options would be nice.  At first I thought the fun music in the game's trailer was not in the game.  It is there but very quiet compared to the sound effects.\n- Upgrade system is very simple.  Single level for each upgrade that times out.\n- I think you have to start from the very beginning for each new game (like an old-school arcade game).\n- A few bugs.  Once I killed all enemies but the game did not move on to the next level.\n","timestamp_created":1593417087,"timestamp_updated":1593417087,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548595607280731201","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4gefD//ICdc+hkQI="}
