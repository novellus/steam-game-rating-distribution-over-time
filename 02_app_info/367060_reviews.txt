Saving progress system is tough. Every loading is going to take you to where the level starts. But I think that the lowest price category is a \"let go\" to all those flaws.\nI guess that's it. Other than that this game is just.. pleasurely awesome. Shooter, platformer, driving. 2D and 3D for each.\nGame gives you challenge (hover gas fly), it gives you spooks (flying heads). But also, that cool feeling of mastering it.\nI'm already like couple of days in, and I'm just at level 3. :D\nYou can find some secrets and glitches to help you through. Just like back in a day' games! B)\nIt is a simple game. But it is just as interesting and entertaining.\nOne of the best games of it's price. You get much more than you pay for. %)))\nMaybe it's just me. Maybe. But I'd say it's just that kid in me. :)\nPeace. And thanks for the emotions.","timestamp_created":1593719027,"timestamp_updated":1593719027,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4087DiPMCffejkgI="}
