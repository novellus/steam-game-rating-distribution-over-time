Whenever I enter the arena track editor, it crashes. When there are multiple events in a session, it crashes after I finish the first one.\nThe track editor is a bit lacking. I would have liked a 45Â° turn, longer/shorter turn, and shorter straight when building a track.\nThe AI is ridiculously overpowered in drift mode. Even the easy AI got twice the score I got, meanwhile in other modes I had no issue defeating medium AI.\nControls aren't customizable, which constantly lead to reset intead of activating the powerup.\nI personally dislike the handilng. Not being able to turn even slightly without sliding is not my thing.\nI had a bit higher expectations overall. The worst part is the constant crashing. Right now, I cannot recommend this game because of this. Otherwise, as long as you avoid drift mode, and you're into sliding all over the place, then it's alright.","timestamp_created":1608924501,"timestamp_updated":1608924501,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1608975673,"developer_response":"Hello,\n\nSorry that you experienced crashes. Having just tested the game, I can confirm that I also get crashes when running multiple events. Sorry about this.\n\nAs for the crash in the arena editor, I was unable to replicate this, would you be able to provide some detail as to when the crash occurred or anything you did beforehand?\n\nThe game is sold as a drift racer, so yes, drifting is a large part of the game. The drift mode relies on you basically holding the drift for the entire length of the event on hard mode. On easy mode, you can probably afford to lose the drift once or twice. However I will likely lower the score the AI can get on easy/medium difficulties.\n\nBeing the sole developer of the game, difficulty is a very hard thing to get right, as I mainly have to base AI difficulty on what I personally find difficult, and having had hundreds of hours of playtesting on the game, my perspective on that isn't the same as 99% of people.\n\nEDIT: The game has been patched to fix the crash when playing multiple events in a row, it also slightly lowers the difficulty of Drift mode.\n\nI was unable to fix the crash in the arena editor as I haven't experienced it myself to know what was going wrong there."}],"cursor":"AoJ4wPLXzfYCc8aSvQI="}
