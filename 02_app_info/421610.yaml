    review: "I like the blazblue franchise. While the story is not overall a masterpiece\
      \ and is more convoluted overcomplicated than great, I still very liked some\
      \ of the characters and the idea of fusing vs fighting with visual novel in\
      \ a way where the battle result was your choices for the novel. That being said,\
      \ I was very interested of what would be this pure visual novel prequel. Well,\
      \ let's get reviewing. Warning, contain spoilers\n\n\n[b]Story[/b] : like blazblue\
      \ story, it's entertaining without being that great. The three first chapter\
      \ are too similar to my liking (meet an union, meet a girl, meet plot) but once\
      \ the first part of the game over, the plot overall get to the point. \n\n[b]Characters[/b]\
      \ : without a doubt, the weakest point of the game. The characters  are more\
      \ there to reference a character of BlazBlue, either by gender-bending one or\
      \ crossover two, than being their own characters. Some characters don't have\
      \ personality at all and are only described by their relationship with others\
      \ characters \n[spoiler](Ringo, Justice, Akira)[/spoiler]. The worse for me\
      \ is the main character. Listen, if you write a visual novel, either the main\
      \ character you get the pov must not have personality and be a stand-in for\
      \ the player, or be at the other end of the spectrum, the most well written\
      \ and deep character of the cast. Here, the hero have two character traits and\
      \ its all.\nSpecial mention to the whole path = one girl which is a very classic\
      \ visual novel system, but not even concluding the path with at least a 'I love\
      \ you' or/and a kiss. The swiming pool fanservice is okay, but a kiss is too\
      \ much?\n\n[b]Lore[/b] : The game should have been called Blazblue : Prototype\
      \ because it's just referencing the previous and latter games in the franchise\
      \ without giving much. Since we discovered the blazblue world being our future,\
      \ we wanted the pov of the world it should have been before the calamity. Yet,\
      \ what we got is normal world with secret magic organisations. Like, for real,\
      \ it wasn't already completely done and redone? Just read the wiki\n\n[b]Port[/b]\
      \ : This game suffer from the same problems than other games made with the BlazBlue\
      \ engine. It was developped for PS systems and the game is more of an emulation\
      \ of a PS system in a windows on your PC than an actual PC port. Which is why\
      \ you get not only the pixelated problem if the game launch on 1080p screen\
      \ and you need to select 720p and return to 1080p to resolve it. The game was\
      \ once on a CD and it show when the same scene contain sometime 3 different\
      \ loadings before reaching its end.\n\n[b]Translation[/b] : While I would not\
      \ usually talk about it, the horrid translation of this game from Japanese to\
      \ English must have a special mention. I rarely seen such bad translation in\
      \ a professional work. Even a fan translation would be more respectful of the\
      \ original text than this. I don't listed them, but the ammount of cases of\
      \ either direct speech to text translation, or at the other end, approximations\
      \ that doesn't carry the meaning, is completely out of the roof. I first though\
      \ it was a problem of the Japanese voice not saying the same as japanes text,\
      \ but no, it's just the english translation being horrible. When you have two\
      \ character separating by saying -See you soon, -Farewell (or most precisely\
      \ : I don't think so), and replacing by having both saying a simple 'goodbye',\
      \ there is a big problem\n\nGameplay : Ah, we are entering the critical zone\
      \ of my frustration so I will first give credit where credit is due. The ToI\
      \ system is both from a meta perspective and a lore perspective very brilliant.\
      \ It's a great replacement to the classic choice options and [spoiler] explaining\
      \ the idea of shifting timeline by the knowledge the character got or not from\
      \ the news/social media is a great idea [/spoiler]\n\nNow let's enter the reason\
      \ I am so angry with this game in the first place. Let's talk of my game experience.\
      \ While I would not call myself a visual game expert, I still fully played fate/stay\
      \ night, Clannad, MuvLuv, Higurashi, and another half dozen. I know how visual\
      \ novel works, I am experienced in this genre. Yet, this one is the most counter\
      \ intuitive one I ever played.\n\nFirst play : Didn't understood the Toi was\
      \ the full choice system. The way the tutoriel work by recommanding to read\
      \ the three neutral articles before showing you almost immediately a scene tagged\
      \ as happening because Toi made me think it was complementary to a classic choice\
      \ system, not it by itself. So of course, I stop using it and got the bad ending\
      \ at chapter 5/6. I was waiting to have a choice to make, and its pretty much\
      \ what the bad guy say to you before killing you, but well, I meet the cast,\
      \ knew more or less the girls who would have a path, and get back to it.\n\n\
      Second PT : The game being a prequel, I understood one of the path was supposed\
      \ to be the true end, so I wanted to avoid it and keep it for last. I pretty\
      \ much understood it was either Es or Hinata path, the former being the obvious,\
      \ the latter the most probable if obvious was a red herring/bait and switch.\
      \ So I decided to try to do Kuon path first because I liked her character and\
      \ she was the girl from the secret magic city. That and well, I am not fond\
      \ of abusive tsundere like Mei. I was supposing you needed to read the character\
      \ chart, see what they are interrested in, then select the news that correspond\
      \ in the bunch. Tried and failed.\n\nThird PT : Thinking I missed something,\
      \ I redo it selecting all Toi except the Swimming pool one. Why? Because it's\
      \ the only case the Toi open by force outside the tutoriel, and were the previous\
      \ article always paired the path by two (Hinata and Es, Kuon and Mei), this\
      \ one clearly separated them, making me think it was the supposed point of choice.\
      \ Selected Kuon only, died again\n\n4th: Going frustrated, even more and I must\
      \ specify that, with one of the worst fast foward in a VN that make you repeat\
      \ the first chapters in an half hour each time. I was already in by 4 hours.\
      \ I supposed, from my knowledge of VN, that the game forced the separation and\
      \ I was to avoid completely all toi except Kuon's. At this point, I had mapped\
      \ which toi correspond to which character. Made sure only to choose toi with\
      \ Kuon icon... I reached the same bad ending. Must also precise having exactly\
      \ the same bad events and bad ending each time without variation doesn't help\
      \ at all feeling progress.\n\n5th : Did the counter intuitive choice of only\
      \ taking Kuon AND MEI toi because their toi are paired before the swimpool,\
      \ finally reached the actual 6th chapter, saved, and respired at least. Decided\
      \ to map the next tois by selecting them all, the obvious happened, another\
      \ bad ending which is exactly the same bad ending than previous, but happening\
      \ this time latter, out of nowhere. By this point, I though there was only one\
      \ bad ending, just happening at different points.\n\n6th : Did the Kuon path,\
      \ completed the Kuon end, not as much lore as I would have loved, no real secret\
      \ interresting scene (Izayoi bad consequences are already known from BB : Continium\
      \ Shift)\n\n7th : Discovered that once an ending was reached, now the news were\
      \ tagged before read about which character they concern. Extremely frustrated\
      \ about the page I wrote to map the paths. Did the Mei path, which was EXACTLY\
      \ THE SAME than Kuon path but with both switching and the very end of it being\
      \ the only diference. Hated this end, more over that I hate abusive tsunderes\n\
