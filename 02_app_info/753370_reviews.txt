I downloaded the demo over a year ago and loved it so I upgraded to deluxe, and enjoyed playing this quite a bit. I stopped playing for quite a long time and decided to pick it back up a little while ago, and I must've missed a few updates because everything was different. The intro tutorial used to be one of my favorite parts, I loved the quirky little drone and it was voiced beautifully, now you get lifeless beeping and text on screen that is impossible to read making the tutorial almost entirely useless. the weapon selection has changed drastically to the point where, without a clear tutorial, this game is near unplayable. I am disheartened to see what was once a very promising wave shooter devolve into this mess of a game.","timestamp_created":1562622663,"timestamp_updated":1562622663,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lbPk6esCeMDyzQE="}
