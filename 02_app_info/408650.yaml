    review: "There's something here, but it's never been the Portal game so many people\
      \ have come looking for.\n\nIf you want a puzzle game, go elsewhere, you simply\
      \ won't find what you're looking for here.\n\n[list]\n    [*] Poorly implemented\
      \ darkness =\\= interesting gameplay, rather it leads to confusion and frustration\
      \ at not being able to see the aspects of the puzzle you're working on.\n  \
      \  [*] If most of the buttons have lines showing exactly what they activate,\
      \ they should ALL have said lines.\n    [*] Unintuitive environmental timers\
      \ shouldn't exist, they do nothing but confuse the player until they finally\
      \ recognize what the timer is based on.\n    [*] Players will look at a puzzle,\
      \ assuming that what they are seeing will give them information needed to solve\
      \ the puzzle. When seeing a painted wall, the player does not immediately assume\
      \ they have to change the color of said wall in order to draw in an item that\
      \ is otherwise unseen, that's just poor design. [spoiler] Chapter 8 Floor 3\
      \ for anyone wondering. [/spoiler]\n    [*] One of the worst things a puzzle\
      \ game can do is implement a new mechanic or item into a puzzle without ever\
      \ having explained it. Somehow, Chromagun manages to repeat puzzles increasing\
      \ in difficulty so mildly that it feels like an extended tutorial for the first\
      \ few Chapters, yet still introduce the mirror (an item easily circumvented\
      \ for the remainder of the game) without any tutorial.\n[/list]\n\n\nOn top\
      \ of that: 100% in <4 hours, with regular breaks prepping for New Years. There's\
      \ just not much here for the price"
