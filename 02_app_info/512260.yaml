      reclusive by nature, the druids have a long-standing alliance with King Arthur
      and his knights of Camelot, having pledged to come to their aid in times of
      need. Now is such a time! Camelot lies in ruins, sacked by goblins and Arthur
      needs your help to rebuild it.<br><br>Harness the power of the cards as you

      \ voi. Io gli ho trovato una sola pecca, i 300 livelli necessari per portarlo\
      \ a termine credo siano troppi, sarebbe stato meglio stare sui 150 - 200."
