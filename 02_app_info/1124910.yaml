    review: "The first expansion is certainly cool, I wonder if it's worth the price\
      \ though. \n\nThe second and third expansions are supposedly larger, so I guess\
      \ the content volume is fine. The base game released with 6 races and, 7? classes,\
      \ a plethora of biomes and maps and all the base content for 50$ so an asking\
      \ price of 40 bucks for the DLC is a stretch. The first expansion had new battlemaps,\
      \ a quest system, map structures and most importantly: A new minor faction (plus\
      \ a few extra neutrals), a new Class + a new campaign and baseline planet to\
      \ play with. \n\nFrom what I can tell, we'll keep getting balance updates for\
      \ a long while, I bet two to three more races, two more planet types and one\
      \ more class. Not to mention a dozen or so new neutral mobs (much needed, Hopperhounds\
      \ are fun and all but MORE please) and whatever new ideas they come up with\
      \ later.\n\nI.E, I think 40$ isnt a bad asking price for what we can expect\
      \ to get + at least a year more of updating."
