Though I forgot just how fast paced it was.   You have to build up fast, or you will get conquered fast, because the AI in this builds itself up very fast.   If you don't, you'll quickly find yourself excommunicated from the Church and your Happiness level dropping fast.  \n\nTo this day I feel the more modern and more advanced castle building games like the Stronghold seriers for example, just can't compare to this .  Because this Game, and its predecessor both have just enough randomness to keep them challenging and interesting.  I can't help but wonder what a Castles III game could have been like if this series had continued.  \n\nIt took me a few minutes to remember how to do everything... a few, precious minutes... that the AI used to stomp me in its gathering and army building.  By the time I remembered how to do everything... the AI already had me surrounded and vastly out numbered me.\n\nAll that said, this IS a Steam Port of an old early 90's game.   Its 30 years old; originally marketed as an MS-DOS game, ported from a Pre-Microsoft Windows Era (Windows is not even mention in its original \"specs\" as a \"supported platform\")  to work on modern Windows based PC's.  So its not without a few bugs... but its still fun and enjoyable for the sake of Nostalgia, just be prepared for its ridiculously fast pace!","timestamp_created":1609778979,"timestamp_updated":1609778979,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i7yT5/YCfca4wAI="}
