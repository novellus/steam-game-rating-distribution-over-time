    reviews: "\u201CThe Royal Trap's strength is in its replay value. Not merely in\
      \ hunting down all the endings to its many romances, but also in filling in\
      \ all the pieces of its multilayered mystery. Each path will really only give\
      \ you a few bits rather than the full story, and some have entire sequences\
      \ you'll never see that will drastically change how you look at the story itself\
      \ and other characters.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://jayisgames.com/review/the-royal-trap.php\"\
