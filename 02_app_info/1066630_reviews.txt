MC's father dies very early on, but the whole town has ZERO evidence to what happened. \n- This has got to be the most unbelievable plot point because no one seems upset about this event. \n- MC's father is supposedly a well respected Magistrate\n- After MC's father killed, nobody is on guard at all or worried they might get attacked either. Contrast this to a later event where the shinsengumi commander gets attacked (just an arm injury) but the WHOLE TOWN is pissed and on guard. WTF?!??!\n- The most illogical point is that the MC himself was by his father's side when he died, and hence there was a much higher likelihood of at least a lead or some evidence being gathered.\n\n2. When MC saves a Sakura and gets knocked out cold for a few days in her place\n- Doesn't get a word of thanks ( I guess you could argue that's part of her \"character\" but I think it's general courtesy right to say thanks even if you're the worlds' most stubborn Tsundere character)\n- In fact this character has zero ounce of gratitude \n- Even when Sakura takes over as the magistrate, she only realizes faults with her \"character\" being stubborn and selfish but only acknowledges a character fault.\n[/spoiler]\n\nGameplay and story is great but I think some dialogue and writing suffers in certain contrived contexts and it really affects the plot because it messes up the consistency and standard of the story in much of the game.\n\nTLDR: \n- Great gameplay, interesting and thought provoking cases\n- Great storyline\n- Suffers from crappy writing in some major plot points (see spoiler above) and hence screws up the consistent great storytelling and gameplay.\n- Overall, still highly recommended","timestamp_created":1609188147,"timestamp_updated":1609188147,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ488/F1fYCcMCcvgI="}
