Also sometimes you can't get enough triangles to proceed, usually because you have to have a specific part (Example: The \"Retrieve ____\" missions usually require a magnet, and are extremely hard to do without one.), or you don't know how to do the mission without having your drone explode 10,000,000 times. Luckily, there IS a sandbox mode, which gives access to all parts, so that makes up for all the mission troubles in the regular mode, and the included tutorial helps.","timestamp_created":1610075909,"timestamp_updated":1610075909,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uJWA8PYCf+W4wQI="}
