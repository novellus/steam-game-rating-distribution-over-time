    review: This visual novel is a soft sequal to Aselia the Eternal, a very old console
      game. You don't especially need to play the previous game, as the story is pretty
      much self contained. There are some characters that appear from the previous
      game though, and you will enjoy them all the more understanding where they came
      from. In my opinion, the game is an improvement in gameplay, but it lost a lot
      of the charm that the first game had. This game replaces a lot of the dark themes
      of the previous game with a happy go lucky school slice of life style of story
      telling. You are floating around in a school with all your classmates! That
      really took a lot of the mystery and beauty out of the setting of the game,
      but that's the last i'll compare the two. The games story is still very good,
      albeit pretty cliche at times. The aspect that made this game, and the game
      before it, some of my favorite visual novels are the setting of the world, the
      behind the scenes characters, the mysterious eternity swords. The setting is
      so good I hope that one day I will see a sequel which revives this fantasy world.
