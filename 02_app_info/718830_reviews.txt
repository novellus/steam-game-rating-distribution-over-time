The characters.  The little joking they do.  It's got an anime feel to it, and not just because of the drawing style.  I'm taking my time, exploring, and looking for everything.  Gonna wring my two bucks worth from it.\n\nSo far, I do not see any imbalance like one reviewer posted.  Milly is not hitting for more damage with her wand than she does with her spells.  That's not even close to true.  I see I'm not the only one who found that review to be wrong.  I'm doing okay against the tough lizards, but that might be because I leveled up more than a player who tries to rush through.  It might also be because I got the game after some patches.\n\nMainly, I got the game now because I'm looking forward to the sequel with the catgirls.  :)   I'm enjoying it so far.","timestamp_created":1519662850,"timestamp_updated":1519662850,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/du96eECdM+XmgE="}
