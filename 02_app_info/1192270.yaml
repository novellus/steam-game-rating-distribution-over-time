    review: 'The third game in the Royal Detective Series on Steam. Very enjoyable,
      I preferred it to the second game in the series, and liked it almost as much
      as the first game. The one oddity is that there is no Royal Detective in the
      main story - only in the bonus story.  That said, both the main and bonus story
      are quite good, and the bonus story is a substantial addition to the both the
      game and the story as a whole.


      In this chapter you play as the Princess as she tries to rescue her daughter
      from an evil (?) witch. But as the adventure progresses, the Princess learns
      of her own undeniable part in the current disaster. This is an unusual HOPA
      game, in that the "bad guy" may have a reasonable, even sympathetic, motivation
      for their (not so great) actions.


      Pros:

      - artwork, music, and overall gameplay are high quality

      - several different kinds of HO scenes & nicely done

      - story is reasonably interesting for the genre

      - customizable difficulty and fully interactive map (including collectibles)

      - puzzles are varied and a few are moderately challenging

      - overall, the right amount of back and forth within a set of related screens

      - very good bonus chapter (other "bonuses" are nice, but standard; the little
      puzzles to assemble are pretty; in-game achievements are fun to try for)


      Cons:

      - arguably, we didn''t need [b]three[/b] sets of collectibles; that said, they
      were reasonable to find once you got used to locating the puzzle pieces within
      zoom-in screens; still not sure if this is really a con

      - maybe a few too many "find X to unlock Y... use Y to unlock Z... okay now
      go back to the first scene and unlock A"

      - honestly, *why* can''t you just *ask* the local carpenter to give you a match?

      - more could have been done with secondary characters

      - the series is a bit weak in terms of not keeping useful items


      Summary:  It''s a very good game for the genre, worth buying with any reasonable
      discount (Big Fish games are expensive on Steam, especially given the lack of
      trading cards or Steam achievements)'
