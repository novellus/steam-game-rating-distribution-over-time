    review: 'I''ve got this addon long ago and if you have BR52, it''s pretty much
      a must-have because it''s the kind of tender this loco usually was and is seen
      with. But there''s one thing that never stopped bothering me about it: The hand
      brake is always on in the tender and there is no way to release it. Clicking
      on it in the coupling&handbrake management bar doesn''t do anything. The Loco
      still goes pretty well and doesn''t lose too much steam or anything when it
      starts running, but it stalls easily. Is it normal, or is it a bug?'
