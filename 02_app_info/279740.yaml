    about_the_game: <strong>ParticleGen</strong> is a flexible and highperformance
      tool for the creation of multifaceted 3D particle effects in real-time. Thanks
      to numerous professional features like Interactive real-time previews and the
      exact setting of parameters using curve diagrams, the program is ideally suited
      for DTP, video compositing, post processing, software development and all kinds
      of visualization.<br><br><strong>ParticleGen </strong>enables the realization
      of almost any desired effect, from explosions and fog to reflections in water.
      Besides using your own particle shapes which can be created with any conventional
      image editing program, the software also allows you to import textured 3DS files,
      which you then can use as particles or animations. For &quot;Autodesk Maya&quot;
      users, <strong>ParticleGen </strong>enables users to import camera animation
      for compositing purposes. Yet another of the software's special features is
      the display of optical deformation effects like shimmering air, shock waves,
      etc. <br><br>ParticleGen also enables you to import the widest range of file
      formats, like TGA (images and sequences), BMP, DDS or AVI.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul

    review: It does not seem to work. The preview window never seems to show anything.
      The interface is clunky and hard to use. The effects look nice if you can get
      them to show up on screen, I am a former Discreet/Autodesk Combustion user,
      I know my software, but this is not complete software.
