Thats all the content in this WHOLE 14,99â‚¬ game.\nIts just playing long, boring and easy matches with ONLY 15 different units over and over again versus some dumb A.I\nThere is multiplayer, but noone playing the game (of course)\nGameplay (from the units to actually playing a match): Boring as all floopin hell\nVisuals: Ive seen better.\nPrice: Should be a free game.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME NOR THE 4 TERRIBLE VR STRATEGY GAMES BUNDLE! NONE OF EM ARE WORTH IT!\nI hate that i didnt refund this before it was too late.\nI warn you. You will regret buying this game later.","timestamp_created":1542119957,"timestamp_updated":1551798375,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pYKZp+kCd63ZrgE="}
