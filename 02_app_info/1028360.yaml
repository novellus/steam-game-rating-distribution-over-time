    review: "I love the original Robo Miner it is smooth and easy to play. This Version\
      \ seems so clunky like the robot can't move but one spot with each mouse click\
      \ or key press and the timing of rock falls is insane, you have to move insanely\
      \ fast not to get squished! And forget about explosions you do not get enough\
      \ time to get away from the TNT before it explodes before you squished! \n\n\
      For the positives\nYes I do like the new look... Mostly the old map is odd The\
      \ 3D effect is kinda cool for a bit but does get old fast and does have a toggle\
      \ for it in the options menu The map itself is odd with caverns and whatnot\
      \ make the game a bit more of a challenge which I liked a lot and the fact that\
      \ the map goes let to right forever is sweet you can cheese the game a bit just\
      \ by digging til you hit a rock and ladder up then go over one then dig down\
      \ till you hit a rock or a hole rinse and repeat till you can afford your upgrades\
      \ then reset the map and then hut the diamond. \n\nFinal Thoughts on this game.\
      \ At this time I have 7 hours played. and I do find it frustrating at times\
      \ but as stated I cheese it and got the upgrades early and simply. I do not\
      \ recommend this game to any one who played the original Robo Miner because\
      \ you will feel disappointed in how clunky it feels from the original."
