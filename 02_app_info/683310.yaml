    review: '[b]Introduction[/b]

      Cecconoid is an eight directional twin stick shooter. It comes with a story
      mode inspired by Cybernoid and a seperate survival mode named Eugatron inspired
      by Robotron and Llamatron. I don''t think I''ve played any of those games but
      I have played similar games on the C64 and I enjoy twin stick shooters.


      [b]Cecconoid[/b]

      Looks like a greyscale+red reimagination of Cybernoid with smooth gameplay,
      nice multiplier system, plenty of rooms, a few secrets and multiple upgrades.
      It''s pretty tough. You start slow with a wimpy shooter but with every upgrade
      you improve. However when you lose a life you drop your upgrades. If you then
      don''t pick them up quick enough they disappear and you''re stuck with a vanilla
      spaceship again for the time being. You just need to learn from your mistakes
      and get ahead further before you die again :) Some enemies and items will give
      out stars on destruction which will increase your multiplier when you pick them
      up. Other items give out ''100'' bonuses you can pick up which will be multiplied
      by the multiplier


      [b]Eugatron[/b]

      Your spaceship is thrown into the middle of a room with enemies which you have
      to clear before you get transported to the next. There are indestructable big
      enemies that just move around slowly, enemies that can be destroyed some of
      which shoot while others spawn new enemies. There are also items that give out
      the ''100'' bonuses upon destruction. When you reach certain scores an extra
      life is awarded.


      For a relatively simple survival game it took me quite some time to get familiar
      with it. Once it started to click it became very enjoyable and I worked myself
      up the leaderboard. I was clueless about some game mechanics which were later
      pointed out to me by the developer.


      [b]Tips[/b]

      The first enemy ship in Eugatron that gets destroyed will give out an upgrade
      if you''re the one that destroys it.

      Picking up an upgrade will make you invincible for a short period of time.

      Your multiplier drops when you shoot.

      Try to get your multiplier up before you pick up bonuses.


      [b]Conclusion[/b]

      If you like challenging 80s retro shmups Cecconoid might be a game you enjoy.
      If you like twin stick shooters and/or survival games Eugatron will be a game
      you enjoy once you get accustomed to the 8-directional shooting.


      [b]Gameplay[/b]

      Here''s a recording of me reaching the top score in Eugatron. In each level
      I tried to raise the multiplier to maximize scoring.
