HoG's are 50% music and this one has a great, immersive score.   The plot is amusingly cheesy and is good for a few good laughs especially the main villain and his animations.  This is exactly what I look for in HoG's.","timestamp_created":1576813054,"timestamp_updated":1576813054,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg7nYkO8Ccbq65QE="}
