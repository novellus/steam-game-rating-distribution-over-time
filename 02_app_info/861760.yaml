    review: "Foto Flash is back and there's more photos to take and a new location\
      \ to explore.\n\nStory:\n\nSet right after the first game, you still pay as\
      \ the photographer who won a vacation. You decide to visit a mall which is dying\
      \ and the owner of the mall wants you to help her assemble a calendar with the\
      \ girls working at the mall in the hopes of saving it.\n\nThe story is pretty\
      \ much identical to the first game, where you try to save a dying business by\
      \ taking photos. It's fine for what it is and it does what it sets out to do,\
      \ but again it's nothing special. Writing is again pretty cheesy, but I still\
      \ enjoyed the story somewhat, not to mention the crazy cliffhanger ending.\n\
      \nHowever I will say the cliffhanger ending is really disappointing since there's\
      \ basically no chance of a Foto Flash 3 because the dev has gone quiet since\
      \ the release of this game, I would definitely buy a Foto Flash 3, but it's\
      \ unlikely to ever happen.\n\nGraphics:\n\nOne thing that I really liked about\
      \ the first game is the bright and colorful art style of the world. It was an\
      \ absolute joy to explore the world, which is why I'm so disappointed about\
      \ the sequels choice of ditching a bright and colorful world into a drab and\
      \ bland shopping mall.\n\nThe mall itself just looks boring, all of it mostly\
      \ looks the same, with white tiles and mall stuff like benches and trash cans\
      \ scattered everywhere. It's really boring and kind of depressing to explore,\
      \ not to mention since most of it looks the same, it's kind of difficult to\
      \ find your footing. \n\nI will say the design for the girls is just as good\
      \ as the first one, so there's at least one positive, but everything else is\
      \ an absolute downgrade.\n\nAudio:\n\nThe music is also not as good as the first\
      \ one, it's just okay at best. Since you're stuck indoors at a mall, there's\
      \ not really much ambience, just music that sounds like it's coming from the\
      \ malls speakers, which was a cool touch, but other than that it was just sort\
      \ of disappointing. \n\nGameplay:\n\nFoto Flash 2 is almost identical in gameplay\
      \ to the first one. There's 10 girls and to get their photos you have to do\
      \ a favor for them to get their photo. The puzzles this time are around much\
      \ easier than the first one and actually in some instances even worse. \n\n\
      One of the worst additions was the arcade games you have to play to get a photo\
      \ of one the girls. There's three games and you have to get a high score in\
      \ each of them and the controls of them are horrendous. Because of the insanely\
      \ stiff controls they are super difficult to play and give the game a massive\
      \ difficulty spike. \n\nThe slippery controls return and due to the malls design\
      \ it's easy to get stuck in very tight corners and when you get to the box pushing\
      \ puzzle, it really becomes annoying. I think the game is much easier overall\
      \ and also much smaller in size.\n\nVerdict:\n\nFoto Flash 2 is a really disappointing\
      \ sequel and a downgrade to the first game in every way. I still had a fun time\
      \ playing, but I can't deny that I didn't have as much as fun as I did with\
      \ the first one. It's also much shorter than the first one, just roughly an\
      \ hour, but the developers even warned about this on the store page so I don't\
      \ mind that much. The game also has more bugs than the first and more issues,\
      \ but on a sale I can still recommend this one. \n\nFinal Rating:\n6/10\n\n\
      Pros:\n+ The art of the girls is really good\n+ Some decent puzzles\n\nCons:\n\
      - The Mall is a terrible location\n- The slippery controls are even worse here\n\
      - Those arcade games\n\nIf you liked the review please consider joining https://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog\
