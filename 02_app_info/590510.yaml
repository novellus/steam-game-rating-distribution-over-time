    about_the_game: 'SoundSelf is the collision of centuries-old mindfulness wisdom
      and the videogame trance. It''s an exhilarating journey into altered states
      of consciousness powered by your own voice. <br><br><strong>Use your voice</strong>
      to generate a hypnotic world of sounds and visuals that feel like they are coming
      directly from your body. Emergent music harmonizes with you, as you drift through
      strobing tunnels-of-light, impossible shapes, and deep into a meditative trance.<br><br>Measured
      by cognitive neuro-scientists to produce transcendent states of consciousness.
      SoundSelf is an elegant symmetry of image, sound and body that takes advantage
      of loopholes in the way you perceive to facilitate a new experience of yourself
      and your world. Read the study here: <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.enterandromeda.com/ss-science"

    review: This was an important piece in my life. It helped me create the picture
      book, Boiling Point. I don't use it anymore. I actually find it hard to do now,
      but 13 hours of meditation was a great blessing.
