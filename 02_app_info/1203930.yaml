    review: "So i have reached day 226 and even though i like the game a lot, there\
      \ is much needed improvements before i can recommend this.\nso see below for\
      \ my recommendations.\n\n1) You cant add equipment to soldiers unless they are\
      \ already wearing it (i have had helmets in my warehouse but they wont put it\
      \ on for ages) be nice if we could tell to go one.\n\n2)Upon soldiers death\
      \ you lose all equipment maybe you keep there ammo or the odd gun drops but\
      \ what about helmet/body armour?\n\n3)Prison should be for problem ppl or enemy\
      \ after awhile you should be able to recruit the enemy or get you problem pp,\
      \ back.\n\n4) Winter last way to long\n\n5)in game houses should be destructible\
      \ (the ones you can take over when all resources are gone)\n\n6)building need\
      \ more info - how much does a coal factory output you can then decide if you\
      \ need more of less\nfood details etc... more info on buildings on input/output.\n\
      \n7)AI work in fort some throws an grenade or an RPG they stand there and take\
      \ it.\n\n8)better hospitals for more patients \n\n9)Steel walls or maybe land\
      \ mines/trip wires and barb fencing to be added?\n\n10) coal production is way\
      \ to low for the long winter period needs balancing\n\n11) soldiers seem to\
      \ gather in the warehouse all the time not sure why seems a bug? also the soldiers\
      \ in the gun nest \nneed like a rota system ive been attacked and there is no\
      \ one there all gone to eat\n\n12) i have noticed the game caps at abt 105 ppl\
      \ then it does everything it can to lose them i was getting raided 3 times before\
      \ i got offered new survivors i was down from 109 ppl to 50 at one point.\n\n\
      13) cars need re work they struggling passing one another on a raid.\n\nDont\
      \ get me wrong i really enjoy the game and would 100% give a thumbs up if a\
      \ lot of the above was improved and implemented, i no it's only 1 person and\
      \ hes doing a great job but these thing will ruin the game for a lot of ppl\n\
      coming to the game and it needs material balancing but if the info is on building\
      \ would solve a few issues.\n\nRegards \n\nMorph"
