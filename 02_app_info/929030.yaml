    review: 'This VN really took me on a epic trek.


      Loved the story, with its different working components, the concept, and the
      depth of  the interactive functions.


      There may be images, as the options menus provide an activation button, my computer
      didnt respond.


      Half way through the game, I understood more what the ''Stats'' menu was about,
      and, when finished, played thru a second time, to see how high i could get my
      percentages, and to see where the other choices will take me.


      The only critique would be about the inability to have save points.

      While the auto save is more efficient, from the perspective of the reader, we
      are taken directly to the story, where left off.

      IMO, the downside is, if wanting to explore different endings & outcomes from
      trying out new actions, quite a lot of dialogue wd have to be skipped thru.


      The dialogue/ action options are semi frequent and have a choice of 3 or 4  decisions,
      which is great in a ''choose ur path'' VN , with the exception of wanting to
      discover the other story arcs, without save points,and  the pureness of directing
      a story without the ''redo'' ability is refreshing.


      This story, imho, however, is worthy of throwing caution to the wind.



      Thumbs up to the Author.

      Thank-you for this experience.'
