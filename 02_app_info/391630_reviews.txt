There are still several other changes that would need to be made before I would recommend this game to anybody.[/i]\n\n\nGood sound and music, but that's pretty much the only aspect I liked about Necromonads. A list of things I didn't like:\n\n- Scanlines cannot be removed. The screen curvature [i]can[/i] be removed, but only by darkening the overall image, which makes it look even worse.\n\n- No d-pad support on dual-analogue gamepads. Also, the game does not have \"Full controller support\" as it claims. You can pause the game using the start button, but the only way to unpause it is using the keyboard.\n\n- The game is locked at 60 FPS, which is fine, but there are frame-pacing issues that cause stutter when flying across the map. How much this bothers you will depend on how sensitive you are to stuttering (a fair amount, in my case).\n\nAll those problems could be overlooked, but Necromonad's biggest problem is that it is way, way too easy. Compared to [url=https://youtu.be/GdUlS_cSMoE?t=39]Defender[/url], this game is baby food. The enemies are never any threat to you, unless you accidentally collide with them. There's only one enemy that even fires bullets at your ship, but those bullets move so slowly you can literally fly circles around them.\n\nThere is no challenge whatsoever until at least level 15. And even after that, it becomes more tedious rather than difficult. You'll need to tap the fire button more and the stages will take longer to complete, but there is still no danger of actually losing.\n\nI reached level 20 on my first playthrough (which took about 40 minutes). By that point I had gathered 7 extra lives (up from 3 at the start), received a perfect score (no captures or infections) in all but one stage, and was so bored I ended up killing myself 8 times.","timestamp_created":1474626006,"timestamp_updated":1475031124,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.56153106689453125","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgpmtt9cCfcTrYQ=="}
