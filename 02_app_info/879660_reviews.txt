You can actually increment the pages: If you rotate the content in a library with the rotate left/right buttons, it will increase a page after one 360 degree turn to the right, and decrease after one turn to the left - I really need to put that in the tutorial ;) Also, Search should be functional... if you have some time, please let me know if you're using Oculus or Vive, and what library you're trying to search and I'll figure out what's going on there. \n\nThanks for the good review! \n\n-Laura Lynn (10k Developer)"}],"cursor":"AoJ49qTf++gCfJeHuwE="}
