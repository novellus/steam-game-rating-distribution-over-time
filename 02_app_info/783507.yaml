    review: I purchased this add-on alongside the rest of the Time Fantasy set for
      VXA.  Unfortunately, on both of my PCs (my laptop and my desktop), it did not
      install.  The page says that it's in my library, and it's in the DLC section
      of the game page in my library, but no matter what I do it will not install.  Going
      to attempt to get a refund if possible.
