    review: It's cute! It's a shame this little game hasn't received more traction.
      It lacks the polish of a bigger studio or something, but it has a lot of heart.
      Nice aesthetic, solid gameplay, and a challenge that will take you off guard
      if you're not careful. The characters are likable and the world interesting.
      Not a long game by any means, but it'll provide some pleasant entertainment.
      Definitely give this one a look!
