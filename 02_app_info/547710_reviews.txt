The interiors are also almost empty and the few furniture inside the left buildings work unloved. Our character runs around the large area and searches for useful objects and journals, which give him clues to the whereabouts of his brother. After 39 minutes i finished my gameplay because i couldn't find these damned axe to cut through wood barriers. Pleasant is the very smooth overall performance of the game and it's not dark only empty. Maybe a good title for the version 2.0 would have been \"Emptiness ahead\".","timestamp_created":1601828878,"timestamp_updated":1601896318,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJww8Cd/PQCeqHupQI="}
