    about_the_game: '<h2 class="bb_tag">CLAM MAN 2: OPEN MIC</h2>is the prologue to
      the upcoming Clam Man 2, a stand-up comedy RPG adventure, and the first day
      in a week of jokes, quests, and saying a lot of really odd things. It''s a combatless,
      narrative RPG that takes you on an unlikely quest in a very unlikely world.
      Play as the titular Clam Man and uncover a secret lurking in the basement of
      Snacky Bay Prime Mayonnaise that will change the course of your life! Do quests,
      get jokes, and do stand-up!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1278360/extras/ezgif.com-resize_(3).gif?t=1593638682"
      /><br><br>If any of that sounds remotely interesting, give the game a shot!
      <strong>It''s free! You''ve got nothing to lose!</strong><br>Still not convinced?
      Alright, let me share some of the other things you can do in this game;<br><br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li><i>Faint in an attempt to get out of public speaking</i></li></ul><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li><i>Lie to a child</i></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li><i>Talk
      to a prehistoric beast</i></li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li><i>Cause an earthquake</i></li></ul><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li><i>Do standup</i></li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">THE GAME JUDGES
      WHO YOU ARE</h2>Four different stats dictate your abilities;<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Aquadynamics</strong>
      - your ability to perform physical comedy, mime, act out scenarios or just remain
      deadpan!</li></ul><ul class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Improv</strong> - the ability
      to think on the spot, be strange and absurd, or come up with new takes or ideas!</li></ul><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Detection</strong> - your ability to perceive the
      world and use logic to deduce it! The key ingredient in observation comedy!</li></ul><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Self-Awareness</strong> - how much of an absolute
      mess you are! Taking a page from games like Fallout: New Vegas and ''dumb''
      playthroughs, high Self-Awareness could turn you into an empathic, nervous wreck,
      while Low Self-Awareness will let you be mean to children, slap people, and
      blurt out the most unbelievable b******t you could think of. Yay for self-deprecating
      comedy!</li></ul><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1278360/extras/ezgif.com-resize_(1).gif?t=1593638682"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">TONS OF DIALOGUE</h2>If you''re averse to lots of reading,
      this might get tricky - Clam Man 2 has a LOT of branching dialogue, offering
      tons of replayability! Dialogues also feature tons of static skill checks that
      only unlock with the right stats; if a conversation only has a couple of available
      response options, chances are that other outcomes and absurdities hide behind
      a different character build!<h2 class="bb_tag">GATHER MATERIALS</h2>In order
      to do stand-up, you need jokes! In Clam Man 2, quests are character-based with
      choices to be made and errands to be run, and finishing a quest rewards you
      with material you can use in your shows! Every quest has multiple endings, and
      depending on your choices, the resulting joke loot will change, and it''s impossible
      to see even half of all the jokes in a single playthrough! <i>(Completionists
      beware - it could take around six fully optimized runs to see everything in
      the game!)</i><br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1278360/extras/ezgif.com-resize_(2).gif?t=1593638682"
      /><h2 class="bb_tag">GET ON STAGE</h2>Each joke you receive from quests will
      measure your abilities, with classic RPG dice rolls. High stats and the right
      joke makes all the difference! Succeeding will give you multiple options of
      where you want to take the joke, and even failing will allow you to choose your
      destiny in a spiraling maelstrom of stuttering, awkwardness, and pure bad taste.
      <i>Will you land every joke, or will you bomb your way through your shows?</i><h2
      class="bb_tag">NO FIGHTING</h2>Clam Man 2 is a narrative RPG, with zero combat!
      (Apart from a part where you can slap a guy in the face.) Furthermore, bombing
      jokes doesn''t lead to a game over - instead, it leads to changes in how characters
      perceive you, with larger ramifications on the story in the full game! Oh, and
      you''ll also be embarrassing yourself on stage.<br><br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1278360/extras/ezgif.com-resize.gif?t=1593638682"

      first day of the full game currently in development, but even so has tons of
      quests, characters, and dialogue to see! The full game is currently in development,
      and the response to this will determine the direction, changes, and style of
      the final game! Every single Steam review will be read to gather feedback!<h2
