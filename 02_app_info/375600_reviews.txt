Landfall Games has released two other games after this one and the last update for this game came out more than a year ago, so we can safely assume that Landfall Games has given it up, in favor of new projects.\nI've bought Air Brawl just a few weeks after it came out and payed about 6â‚¬, now it's free. Air Brawl by itself is a very fun dogfight game which provides different planes with all different loadouts. In addition, there are several maps and modes, which make the game versatile and not boring at all. The graphics are simple and yet nice to look at, the music is fine too and doesn't annoy you when you fly. The tutorial is ok, but I wish there would be a way to practice shooting at planes instead of slowly hovering candies.\nI'm a Mac-user, so I and others can confirm that achievements don't work at all. Also I'm not able to switch between the continents and each time have to restart the game to get it on \"Europe\". Creating an own match seems difficult too and there are almost no people hosting one.\nI hope Landfall Games will return to Air Brawl and fix it...","timestamp_created":1482841078,"timestamp_updated":1608574485,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.517145812511444092","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4oNigw/YCf6zCbQ=="}
