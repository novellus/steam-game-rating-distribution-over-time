    about_the_game: Dragonflight VR is a multi-level VR experience featuring massive,
      destructible environments, fast-paced combat with enemy dragons swarming the
      skies around you, ancient castles teeming with archers, and lost wizard towers
      shrouded in mist. Ride your dragon over mountainous countryside, through showers
      of flaming arrows, and then deep into canyons where huge dragons rule. The only
      way to get a more realistic feeling of riding a dragon than Dragonflight VR
      would be to breed one!

    review: "As a dragon lover I bought this game years ago, it was fun for a little\
      \ bit, for the fact that the model and animations looked cool and you could\
      \ fly around canyons as a dragon breathing fire on other dragons and destroying\
      \ castles. Then out of the blue they just change it to VR only so people like\
      \ me cant even play it anymore, and I dont know if i can even get a refund because\
      \ i bought it so long ago.\n\nIts a shame really because it had a lot of promise.\
      \ \n\nIf you want a game you can control a dragon and fly around as, check out\
      \ Day of Dragons, currently in development and they are making good progress"
