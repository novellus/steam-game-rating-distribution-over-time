It has good old school 8 bit graphics, similar to fire emblem with a dungeons and dragons feel at its core giving a more personal character experience. \n\nMy favorite aspect of the game is once you clear a level you can either pick from three items that either give a stat bonus, new attacks, or fully heal. This gives you the ability to make very diverse character builds, while also adding an edge of difficulty since you cannot heal if you decide to improve your characters build after each level. \n\nTwo Die rewards players that make calculated decisions to defeat each enemy without taking damage. This can be done with any class by either killing an enemy before it gets within range (Mage Class), increasing armor/using block skills (Warrior), or attacking and running out of range of an enemy (Rouge). \n\nI also like that once you clear the \"last level\" you continue through levels that get progressively harder without getting the option to heal or improve your character.  To conclude this game is very addicting and offers lots of ways to play the game without it ever feeling stale. This game is certainly worth your time and money. \n\nIf you make it past level 22 let me know  <(^.^<)","timestamp_created":1609991758,"timestamp_updated":1609991758,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.625162243843078613","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwi5S/7fYCd7WXwQI="}
