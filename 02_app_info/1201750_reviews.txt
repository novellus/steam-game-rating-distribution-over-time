The graphics are wonderful, vibrant and colorful with nice effects and the sound is suited for the type of game it is. The controls are outstanding!! I wasn't sure what to expect looking at the videos, they don't do the experience justice. I love the comfortable pacing and route choice as you go through the levels and in the harder difficulty you have to work if you want to complete it. I have tried three ships and love that you are dual wielding and also have a secondary to work with as well. The alternate shield option while you are playing is a trip and will take getting used to but it changes the gameplay so that's good. Having secrets in the levels are great and I look forward to getting the new ships and seeing the next levels. Worth the price, very happy to have. Thanks! Just AMAZING!!","timestamp_created":1590347159,"timestamp_updated":1590895959,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4vbuytPICf8CFigI="}
