The game strives for 'realism', which means physics and inertia, your ship feels heavy and real. Also, the game's weapons are ballistic, not lasers or plasma beams, which is great to play, kinda like diesel punk sci-fi.\n\nThe game still is on early access, so don't expect a finished game.\n\n[b]I appreciate the linux release[/b]","timestamp_created":1503882818,"timestamp_updated":1590224659,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":37,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.765636563301086426","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4o9SxoPICfsLigwE="}
