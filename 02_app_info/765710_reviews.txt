The stages are just large enough to feel you can hide safely from the darkness, yet small enough to keep the challenge.  The movement is smooth with extra fun using the wall jumps and dash to practically fly across the stage as you free your teammates from the ensuing darkness.  Finally, after all my hours logged in the game, I have yet to see the light prevail against the darkness even once.  The challenge in this game makes it a very easy grind to higher levels while enjoying some of the best gameplay and most creative characters.  Strongly recommend you pick this game up!\n","timestamp_created":1541141892,"timestamp_updated":1541141892,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuuHN6eYCcNburQE="}
