However, major weaknesses:\n- English voice acting is poor, with exaggerated fake accents.\n- Writing is also fairly poor and reads like a very stereotypical detective novel. \n- No subtitles for a dialogue-heavy game.\n- Fifth level is frankly offensive to the mental health community, casually uses slurs against people with mental illnesses, and distorts real-world concepts to the point where it's hard to tell who are supposed to be the 'real patients' (the puzzle in that level) since the writers so clearly did not understand mental health and misrepresented real-world concepts to make them fit their plot twist.\n\nThe most fun part of this game is making fun of it MST3k style.","timestamp_created":1610081007,"timestamp_updated":1610081007,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42c6T8PYCe7K6wQI="}
