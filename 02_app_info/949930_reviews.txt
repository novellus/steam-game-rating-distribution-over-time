(making the placement something you need to focus on rather than being easy)\n\nIf anyone want to know how I can decide this is not up to snuff with very little time played I can tell you that I've spent a lot of hours with PvZ, enough time to survive a survival round long enough to basically only have supermutants - don't remember name, the buffed version of the blokes with the gimp on the back - when I finally died... (I've finished it X times, I love that bloody game, it's brilliant in it's simplicity, this game comparing itself to it is an atrocity...)","timestamp_created":1544215738,"timestamp_updated":1544217667,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42/SixecCd8TZtAE="}
