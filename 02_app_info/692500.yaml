    reviews: "\u201CAs soon as I ran the server on my machine the app on the phone\
      \ connected straight away which I was really surprised with. My keyboard was\
      \ detected once connected to the computer too, I use a Roland PCR 500. Set up\
      \ is as simple as that for anyone wondering. The AR is very on point here and\
      \ I am no handyman at all and anyone can get this set up no problems what so\
      \ ever.\u201D<br><a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/app/692500/discussions/0/1484356232250636030/\"\

      \ like guitar hero but you actually get to play a real instrument. And plus\
