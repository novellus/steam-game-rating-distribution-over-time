      \ belonging to one of the three races, having invaded the Earth. In contrast\
      \ to the Soldier, Scout has a wheel instead of legs. It gives him more speed\
      \ and maneuverability. The main feature of robot type is Energy Shield, his\
      \ main ability. The right mouse click activates the Shield that absorbs damage\
      \ dealt to the scout. Shield has its own resources \u2013 energy that is a renewable\
      \ resource. If you do not use the Shield, its energy itself will be resumed.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nScout\u2019s weapons differ from the Soldier\u2019s basic\
      \ set. For example, Crossbow damages your opponent as well as dazzles him; Discobols\
      \ cuts the enemy to pieces, its projectiles ricochet off the walls; Mines strike\
      \ the opponent with shrapnel, rather than explode. Scout is an excellent choice\
      \ for speed and smart game."
