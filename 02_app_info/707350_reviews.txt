Mission quality is dependent on arena rank, but the arena gets closed for half the plot so you better be high rank before that happens or you won't be able to level or gear up properly. You aren't allowed to level up until halfway through the loop regardless of if it's your first time, which keeps you from challenging deeper levels until it gets re-enabled.\n\nSecondly the combat is 90% rubbing your numbers against theirs. Proper piloting helps, but usually one of you nullifies the others' damage and can just sit still while firing. Guns seem to scale way worse than armor, so eventually fighting devolves into a never ending series of 'DODGED' texts popping up","timestamp_created":1595338651,"timestamp_updated":1595338651,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543859660625457764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41/7luPMCf6TalgI="}
