    about_the_game: Paralyzed has over twenty unique levels with a large variety of
      obstacles and enemies. As you progress through the game the challenge increases,
      always keeping you on your toes and ensuring satisfaction upon level completion.
      Beating a level unlocks 1-2 new levels, making sure you never get stuck with
      only one level left to play.<h2 class="bb_tag">Level Themes</h2>The game has
      five different themes, each one with four levels of increasing difficulty. <br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li> <h2 class="bb_tag">Cube</h2>To make an enemy cube jump out
      of your way, all you have to do is match the color and press <strong>space</strong>,
      simple right? If you're curious you could also find out what happens if you
      do that while you're on top of it...<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1412500/extras/cube.gif?t=1608332120"
      /><br></li><li> <h2 class="bb_tag">Laser</h2>The lasers are simpler than the
      cubes, all you have to do is match their color and you'll phase right through
      them. Be on the alert though, these &quot;simple&quot; obstacles combined with
      the cubes can be a deadly combination!<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1412500/extras/laser.gif?t=1608332120"
      /><br></li><li> <h2 class="bb_tag">Fire</h2>These work like reverse lasers,
      meaning they're only dangerous when you match their color. It may sound easy
      but they're not something you should play around with, or you might very well
      get burnt.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1412500/extras/fire.gif?t=1608332120"
      /><br></li><li> <h2 class="bb_tag">Car</h2>Cars are handled the same way as
      the cubes but with the caveat that while other obstacles are stationary, these
      move. In other words you'll need even faster reflexes if you don't want to crash.<br><img
      src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1412500/extras/car.gif?t=1608332120"
      /><br></li><li> <h2 class="bb_tag">All</h2>All is... you guessed it, a combination
      of everything! These levels are the ultimate test of your skills combining all
      obstacles, resulting in the hardest levels by far. The fourth and final level
      of this theme is the <strong>FINALE</strong> of the game, if you beat that level
      you will have mastered Paralyzed.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1412500/extras/all.gif?t=1608332120"
      /></li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Practice Mode</h2>If a level is too challenging
      to finish in one go, you have the practice mode available for training. Put
      down as many checkpoints as you want to get sense of the whole level, or combine
      them with the use of self-destruct to practice specific parts. Levels finished
      in practice mode won't count towards the normal game progress, but hopefully
      it will help you prepare for the real deal.<h2 class="bb_tag">Colorblind support</h2>The
      four main colors have been chosen to be easily distinguishable, no matter if
      you're colorblind or not. The background colors can be disabled in favor of
      a plain white background, should the colors be too distracting.<h2 class="bb_tag">Stats
      and Settings</h2>We both know what kind of person you are if you're still reading
      this, and we've got you covered with all the statistics you could want. See
      which obstacles or colors are the deadliest, track how many times you've died,
      &quot;jumped&quot;, switched color and much, much more. For settings we have
      the option to bind the colors to whatever you want, including a controller if
      that's your preference (don't do that though, playing with a controller is very
      hard). Multiple ways to &quot;jump&quot; is also available in the settings,
      be sure to experiment to find what suits your playstyle the best. More features
      are also planned as free updates coming in 2021, so be on the lookout for those!

    short_description: 'Paralyzed is a challenging precision platformer with a simple
      objective: reach the end of each level. The challenge is that you have no input
      on your movement, only the color of your cube. Match your color with whatever
      approaches or you''ll quickly meet your end. Timing is key!'
