Overall, the soundtrack included is pretty good in and of itself. It's got some good ambient tracks and other tracks that do a good job of capturing the game's gritty atmosphere. And the digital artbook is interesting as it shows some imagery from throughout the game's development process. I'd recommend you purchase this if you liked the game's soundtrack enough, or if you'd like to see the game's artbook.","timestamp_created":1596241584,"timestamp_updated":1596241584,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+LPa0/MCecLZmAI="}
