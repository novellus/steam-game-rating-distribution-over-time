Forty minutes it takes for the story to progress from the protagonist arriving at the airport, taking a taxi, then arriving and falling asleep in their new apartment. The protagonist has almost nothing interesting or funny to say about anything, all they can do is perpetually ramble about extremely ordinary and unexciting things. It doesn't even serve much to establish their character as the main thing the reader learns is their academic background and basic childhood. Forty minutes for that information, forty minutes of that information continuously rehashed for zero advantage.\n\nIt seems like this might be translated but even so the fundamental way that the protagonist talks feels scripted. They add unnecessary descriptive words and terms onto their phrasing as if they're purposely trying to speak like a written narrative, which is generally not how humans talk. Nor do humans internally monologue by standing still and relentlessly musing about random aspects of their past and whatever else they can think up. The protagonist even gives readers a play by play of what they're doing, \"Oh I'd better go to the lobby now and blah blah blah\" why are they thinking this instead of just doing it; why is their monologue scripted so inorganically. The story appears to be entirely founded on their internal monologue yet their internal monologue isn't written like an actual genuine monologue; it's like a combination of a narrative description and a backstory description pretending to be the internal monologue of a character.\n\nIt doesn't seem like any other characters in the story have talksprites. Which is boring, immersion breaking and only continues to place more emphasis on the rambling protagonist. The protagonist themself looks great, although some of their talksprite sets are strangely unaligned. The default, suit wearing state of the protagonist is fine but other sets of their talksprites like the one where they have their airport luggage are inconsistent. In those sets, whenever their expression changes their position on the screen also slightly changes because apparently the different images are not aligned properly so every pose is inexplicably standing in a slightly different place. \n\nAdditionally, the backgrounds are a strange combination of seemingly drawn images and also images that look like bad three dimensional models. The grocery store, which can be seen in the screenshots, looks especially bad. Some of the backgrounds are also incomplete as they randomly lack details like; an entire section of the world. The airport exterior has absolutely nothing in the distance, the entire world is just an open blue sky there's no grass fields or distant city or anything. Many of the city backgrounds also lack buildings in the distance, giving the impression that the world is just a blue void. And everytime the protagonist does go to a new location the dialogue box feels the need to tell the reader the exact name and time of the new setting before the next scene begins, further breaking the flow of the story.\n\n\nForty minutes in and the protagonist is still in their apartment, still talking to themself about pointlessness. I'm desperately reading through the text hoping something interesting will happen soon and nothing does, the self indulgent monologue just keeps going. That is not a feeling a story should ever give to its reader, at any point. Especially in the beginning, which is supposed to be the hook. \n\nMaybe this story actually is a dark comedy drama slice-of-life but apparently it takes at least forty minutes to become that. Perhaps it takes even longer to become that, or it never becomes that. Either way after forty minutes of listening to monotonous rambling I'd lost interest. Readers could actually get this same experience from just finding a selfish human and attempting to socialize with them, resulting in the human rambling for forty minutes egocentrically about themself. That's actually just what this is, for at least the first forty minutes.\n\nIf you're interested in finding some games that I do positively recommend they can be found on my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38950844-Anoemalous/] here [/url].","timestamp_created":1605299154,"timestamp_updated":1605299459,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.621835052967071533","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4u7rT4fUCeeCXrgI="}
