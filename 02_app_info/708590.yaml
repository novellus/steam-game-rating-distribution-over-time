    short_description: A world of Dwarves, Elves, Humans and Orcs. Mounted in the
      crowns of each race's king are four scattered shards of the Watcher's Tower
      Gem, which must be returned to its rightful place before the world degenerates
      into oblivion. Conquer all four races with the army you assemble and lead into
      battle.
