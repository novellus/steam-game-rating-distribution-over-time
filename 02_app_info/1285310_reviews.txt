(the car models were decent though, they look quite good, more than good enough)\n\nBad:\nYou can't change anything in regards to video.\nController doesn't work.\nI was at 18 FPS when I started the race, pc is: 1600X, 5700XT, 16Gb RAM. (nothing special but it can run Grid 2019 at very stable framerates at 1440p)\nThere's one track in the game and you can only use cars.\nThe UI has an outliner that seems to be stuck on whatever is to the left. (PS4 - Xbox for choosing controller it shows the Xbone image but the outliner is on the PS4)\nYou can't rebind the controller keys - didn't check how it was with PC-keys.\nThe only options you can really change is audio...and it may decide you put it wrong and increase it for you all of a sudden... (at least music as it did that when I went back to a previous screen after viewing the cars in the garage)\n\nHad the game been 5$ and they had at least a couple of different vehicles and tracks (with decent framerate and working controllers) I may have said something like; If you have the money, maybe spend it and see if it improves.\n\nIn its current state and at the price they're selling it for...I really don't see any reason to buy it outside of you either being a friend of theirs, have so much money that you've bought everything already and *absolutely want to buy something* or being just a bit of a masochist...","timestamp_created":1594224084,"timestamp_updated":1594224084,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.634713590145111084","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwwqDKl/MCfNvpkwI="}
