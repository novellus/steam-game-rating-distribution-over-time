Manual power control also possible, it's usable for shunting mode or moving without the train.\nAlso, it has ZWS driving mode , when locomotive remotely controlled from driving trailer in push-pull trains. \nThe driving controls feel awkward at first sight, but once you get mastered it, you can easily accelerate and brake on RegionalBahn routes with short distance between stops.\nOn the negative side this add-on is very old (dated by 2012),\nso it doesn't have all fancy features like openale doors/windows, sparks from the pantograph. \nI wish cab would be more detailed.  But from the driver's prospective it's very fun to drive, because of nicely implemented sophisticated controls.\n\nAlso, this loco cannot be driven in simple mode, or using HUD driving aids... HUD only shows power/brake level in %, but handles can be operated only by mouse or keyboard. \n","timestamp_created":1607961127,"timestamp_updated":1607961127,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hfX8sPYCfsiUugI="}
