Story is even better although mechanics wise a bit more limited though spending time on weapon and augmentation setups is worth the trouble.  This particular game provides a lot of background story for characters seen in the more technically limited Outrage game so this one is recommended to play before that one. \n\nAgain a good game to recommend assuming one can stomach the old aging rpg maker VX engine.  Astronomic Games is to me a sign of quality these days. If one has a strong opinion that rpg maker games are either shovel ware or the base of very old jrpg games only then this developer brings the best antidote to that by showing it can still be pretty decent especially when price of these gems is not that particularly high. \n","timestamp_created":1609604896,"timestamp_updated":1609604896,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0LL74fYCcpTjvwI="}
