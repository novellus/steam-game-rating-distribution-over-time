    short_description: A short and semi-sweet 2D platformer to recover precious coffee
      and fix the leaks in Coffee Co factory! Endure the crazed coffee-highs of the
      critters infesting throughout and the nagging feeling that all of your work
      is disregarded by your corporate overlords!

    review: ZACH I love this game, no joke either. I got to like lv 8 in 20 mins and
      replayed some of the other levels back again. And I can say I love it. You let
      me play your game when it was in alpha, and I instantly like it. I like partially
      bc you're one of my best friends, but I'm also a sucker for great indie games.
      When the floating enemy type is introduced it adds a new element that's kind
      of frustrating but totally manageable, you actually have to think about certain
      strategies to progress. Overall, 10/10 would recommend. Can't wait for your
      future products, I'M honestly psyched!!
