Not only does the game not have any good things that you'd come to expect from a game developed at it's time, but it's performance makes the game literally unplayable. And when I say \"unplayable\", I mean, choppy performance on a GTX 1070 with an i7 8700k. Either that, or the game doesn't have support for 144hz which is also the case. \n\nAdditionally, when I launched the game, it would cause my system to become very unresponsive for a good 30 seconds before I managed to be able to utilize any input to navigate to my task manager and close down whatever it was that was causing it........ which turned out to be the game itself, not surprisingly being a 32-bit application. It's not pretty. Couple all that with the fact that there don't appear to be any updates from the developers on if or when the game is being updated, and you can see why stuntmania online was the superior game back in the day.\n\n*sigh*...","timestamp_created":1595467430,"timestamp_updated":1595467501,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43MHRvPMCf7aAlwI="}
