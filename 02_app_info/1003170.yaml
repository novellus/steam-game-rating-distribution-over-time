    review: 'This "soundtrack" is actually just a lie. All four of the tracks you
      purchase for $1 here just aren''t in the game at all. None of them. These are
      weird MIDI tech loops that just physically aren''t in the game.


      The actual game only has one song, the main menu music, that just loops forever
      and never changes. There are two other music tracks in the game files but they''re
      never used. And they aren''t in this soundtrack either.


      Zero indication of these just being random unrelated bonus tracks. The dev probably
      used these tracks instead of the ones in the game because they''re probably
      royalty-free songs so he wouldn''t have the rights to sell these songs by themselves.


      This seperate "soundtrack" is a poor quality quick cash grab that just lies
      about what it is.'
