        realistic and detailed "stills" that appear during certain cut scenes.

    review: Interesting premise. Enjoyed the gameplay, although figuring out the controls
      was awkward. Which parts of the model are interactable was unclear, and I wish
      the UI was a little less obtrusive. All that said, I liked it, and really, I've
      payed far more for less. Worth checking out, especially for the price.
