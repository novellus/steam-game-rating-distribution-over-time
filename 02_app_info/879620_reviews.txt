Sometimes your characters do what you want them to do and sometimes there is no control over them. You just watch them die. Game over, try again.\n\nGamestyle reminds me of FTL but this game surely fooled me. Like at least in FTL you KNOW why things are not working or why your characters are unable to follow your instructions. [/h1]\n\nHealing for example, one of the characters is about to die, I send him to the first aid box (I drag him to it, why is that? Why not just click the guy and then click on whatever he needs to interact with?), he only heals himself a small portion and then starts walking around, so I need to put him back to his station but he got injured again, so I wanted to drag him back to the first aid box but he didn't wanted to be dragged. So I just watched him die. Fun fun fun...\n\nSo the first encounter was an enemy train, I put the characters at their stations; shield, power and gun control. Put the three weapons on specific target, enable auto-fire (like in FTL) and just watch. All three weapons started to shoot, no idea what type of weapon it is, but hey, if the game doesn't want to tell, then we don't need to know right? -_- \nWe beaten the armored train, went to a trainstation, there you can get some jobs and assignments, buy in resources for along the way and move on.\nThe map is nice to show you where you want to go, where obstacles could be and such. I upgraded some modules on the ship, like shield and power, because I saw that going down too rapidly in the first battle.\nSecond encounter, wanted to do the same deal, putting the characters on their stations and locking the weapons on their targets. Now suddenly I had only one weapon (which didn't fired, at all), one guy was about the die but didn't wanted to go to the first aid box and the other one was standing between two fires frying his fingers as sausages (at least it looked that way), I had no control over anybody, except the one who was controlling the shield but he died, because he also didn't wanted to go to the first aid box. No control over anything! \n\nThird encounter, I was getting good hopes, the characters did what I told them to do for now. We did some errands, upgraded our train, untill one of the A-holes didn't wanted to do what I told him to do and so followed the rest. One of the guys identified himself as a sausage and was just standing still in the fire! Plus, found a bug with the repair button, you can keep smashing it and that makes your train invulnerable. But utterly useless, when your crew isn't responding to your calls.\n\nAfter three times, three restarts of the game, I had enough of this BS.\n\nThe game has good intentions and if executed in a well manner, this game would be a good game. The setting is good, also reminds me of the game \"The Last Train\" - just because of the setting.. But the controls... Aaarrrghh!!! Drives me nuts! This game need a lot of work!\n\n[h1] Therefor, I do NOT recommend this game.
