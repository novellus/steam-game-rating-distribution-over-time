The dev made an even better zombie game called Dread Blood. That proves that sometimes less is more. There's a lot of zombies in this one. But the 3D models look terrible and the animations are also pretty bad. \n\nThe ride on the tracks itself is not bad. It has speed, it has twists & turns. But the same thing can be said about several of the other DLC. This one is just visually ugly and the sounds are not good either. Just the poorest effort out of all the DLC. I would only recommend this as part of a bundle pack for the DLC. I would not buy it on its own.\n\nRate 4/10. Sadly, there are even worse VR rollercoaster rides out there so I'm giving it a 4 instead of lower.","timestamp_created":1537942043,"timestamp_updated":1537942043,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53271031379699707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4l6efiuYCeem4qwE="}
