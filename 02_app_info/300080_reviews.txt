Some battles against the ai have come down to one unit. More than once there has been nail biting victories and defeats. I haven't played any pvp duels. It does play like Red Tides Art of War against the ai. I don't think its as good as Red Tides Art of War which plays similarly, but it was worth the $6.","timestamp_created":1489026211,"timestamp_updated":1489026211,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503680765628814697","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y5u42NoCdrj8cw=="}
