    review: "I'm trying to like this game but it needs a few quality of life changes\
      \ before I can recommend it to other people for purchase. \n\nA graphical options\
      \ menu would be great with a brightness or gamma slider because I honestly can't\
      \ see a thing. All I hear is a bunch of people moaning and I already have poor\
      \ eyesight so my eyes took a beating trying to play this. Actually having difficultly\
      \ getting my eyes to focus after about an hour of this which is troubling to\
      \ say the least.\n\nThe journal is a little bit too vague. It says I have to\
      \ find a way out. I think that is literally always the objective of every horror\
      \ game ever, so I didn't really need a book to tell me that I needed to get\
      \ out of there. What I did need, was a clue as to what the game actually wanted\
      \ me to do next. Wandering in the dark straining my eyes wasn't fun at all.\
      \ \n\nCrouching only lowers me about 4 inches from my standing position and\
      \ I have no idea why it is even a mechanic. Picking up objects sometimes flings\
      \ them several feet up into the air and away, causing them to somehow fall through\
      \ objects and become unobtainable. \n\nThis is a fresh release so I understand\
      \ that there is some polish that needs to happen. But good golly, this probably\
      \ could have waited a little longer or been tested more. \n\nIf nothing else,\
      \ at least make a brightness slider so I can see. As it is, there is no way\
      \ I can justify the current price point. Sorry :("
