You can create the complete design yourself and even have your own software developed.\n\nNevertheless, the game is unfortunately no longer being developed and thus no longer receives updates. The problem now is that \"Smartphone Tycoon\" unfortunately has a lot of bugs and crashes frequently. \n\nMy current recommendation would be to write to the developers to fix these bugs. Because it would be a great pity if this game remains so bad forever.\n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)","timestamp_created":1572871756,"timestamp_updated":1610096474,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+c7O8PYCfaO71wE="}
