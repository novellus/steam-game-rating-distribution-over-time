The story, card artwork, and theme are cool (Eastern religion and mysticsm), but as a hybrid between card + battle arena, the Rock-Paper-Scissors approach is too random for real strategy. Not many modes or deepness, and some characters are just way too hard. With English being the programmer's second language, it feels like a chore to try and read everything.\n\nGame is dead, no community, no dev.","timestamp_created":1484494724,"timestamp_updated":1536079001,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.576612889766693115","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42q7c0uUCdoLXbw=="}
