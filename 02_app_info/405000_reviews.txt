The mini boss idea is unique (when you die, the enemy that killed you: takes your items and becomes very strong). Then waits for you on your next run unless you choose a different path. I wish there were more different enemies. Once you get used to it, becomes pretty easy to complete the stage. I hope there is more to come on future runs. I bought this for around $3 and that makes it totally worth the fun I have already had. Other than the lack of different types of enemies, I have enjoyed myself while playing. \n\nPros: many different weapons, graphics, can save after completing a level\nCons: types of enemies and not a huge assortment of mutations","timestamp_created":1595092555,"timestamp_updated":1595092555,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4z5q7sfMCcb6OlgI="}
