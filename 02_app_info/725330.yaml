    review: "this game is very very very impressive. I actually didnt expected that\
      \ much qualify. it feels \n deep and melancholic. recommended strongly. but\
      \ I actually dont like final scene. it wasnt serious and realistic unlike all\
      \ the game. I believe it should end bad or with infinite suffer topic. despite\
      \ it , worth to buy actually. also special thanks to a lot of language translation\
      \ dev ! 9/10"
