I had to summarize things because it was late at night for me and I needed to get some sleep for my college exams the next day.\n\nThis game isn't bad. I'm actually impressed with the work in this game for only having 1 main developer. So I'll be going more into detail about what I liked, disliked and somethings that I think should be worked on.\n\n---\nSome of the things I really enjoyed are...\n\n  1) The mining minigame was pretty fun and enjoyable. I can tell you put a lot of thought into it. And props to you on adding an anti-afk feature.\n\n  2) The user-created marketing feature is great but a tad bit confusing. I couldn't find out how to sell my own things on the market even after creating my own business.\n\n  3) The amount of interaction in this game was very enlightening. Being able to walk up to a piano, television or chair and being able to either play it, turn it on or sit on it.\n\n---\nSome of the things I disliked are...\n\n  1) The music in this game sounds kind of child-like and repetitive as if someone is constantly playing the xylophone around me. A game like this should try to have music that you can listen to without growing tired of it or getting annoyed by it.\n\n  2) The sound in the game whenever text is being written is too loud and clunky. I found myself trying to skip through all the text sound by holding space because I disliked the sound that much.\n\n  3) I fealt like I had no purpose in the game after about 20-30 minutes. From what I could tell, There were no real goals that I had in mind that I could work towards completing. Hopefully as time goes by however, Your future content that you add will change this.\n\n---\nSome of the things I think should be worked on are...\n\n  1) The UI in this game isn't very stream-lined and consistent with a theme. The colors and fonts seem varied.\n\n  2) While trying to play with my friend on his server, my own server or your own server (Jargoon), We couldn't see each other and there was some consistent latency across the board. But I can't really blame you for that.\n\n  3) I crashed about 3 times in the hour that I played. I can't tell you exactly what the error was off the top of my head because it's been a couple days. So I apologize for not being able to help you identify this problem.\n\n---\nTo summarize my experience, This game is fun however its small and partially buggy. I don't think a game like this should be worth $14.99 USD in it's current state especially since it's a new release, early-access game with little to no players online. You could compare the price of this game to something like Garry's Mod which is 2/3rds the price with a stable client with more content and a larger playerbase. I would probably buy and keep this game if it was $4.99.\n\nI hope the information I've provided assists you in your development of this game.","timestamp_created":1507363308,"timestamp_updated":1507499431,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.681126654148101807","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true,"timestamp_dev_responded":1515040426,"developer_response":"Hi there. Sorry to hear that you did not enjoy the game. Please understand that there are no centralised servers, and it is up to players to host their own games, so your experience with high latency might improve if you or a friend host (which uses Steam lobbies so no technical setup is required).\n\nIf you have the time, I'd appreciate any information you have about the crashes, issues, or bugs you experienced, so I can fix it immediately. There is a support link on the ProtoMasons website, or a bug forum in the community hub.\n\nI hope you can consider revisiting the project in the future. Thanks for the feedback.\n\n-----\n\nUPDATE JAN 2018:    I understand that you have updated your review to give some opinions and feedback regarding specific issues. Thank you for this.\n\nIn response to this review, we introduced new game music and a more consistent UI in version 1.0.4, and intend to continue improving the interface of minigames in the short future. This update also included a new multiplayer minigame and is the beginning of a focus to add more generalised game features to keep things fun and interesting when you are playing alone or with a friend. \n\nA number of bugs have been fixed since this review, including an issue that related to the desync of player movement, which sounds like the cause of your complaint regarding latency. ProtoMasons was specially designed to work well under high latency environments (200 - 400 ping) and it is a focus to continue improving this so desynchronisation is avoided. Thank you for helping identify this bug."}],"cursor":"AoJ4xfr9/t4CdZrIhwE="}
