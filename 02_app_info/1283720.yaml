    review: Good game, but needs some fixing. When you mine down to far you just keep
      falling. If you were to press the "Respawn" button and press space after it
      keeps pressing "Respawn". If you knock a enemy in the air it just flies to the
      left which is funny but weird. The tutorial in the game is under all the UI.
      Anyways its good the moving is good with the motion blur, ect. I also watched
      the YouTube video linked and I noticed that you are pretty young. That's not
      bad, it is cool because most people can't even make a game this good that are
      older then I assuming you are!
