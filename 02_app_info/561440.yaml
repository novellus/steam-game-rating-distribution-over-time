    review: 'For what it is, I am loving it so far. It is fun to just sit there and
      listen to the portable boom box (play''s live internet radio from what I can
      gather) and paint your designs on the wall. I can see myself sinking hours in
      this game just to relax and have fun. I legit think the coolest part is that
      the world is persistent between sessions. If you exit the game and come back,
      all your work will still be there.


      A small forewarning... the controls might feel a small bit janky!  Just needs
      some small improvements in that regard, but the base mechanics of actually painting
      work wonderful!! The game literally just came out into early access, and the
      devs are very receptive to feedback. I have strong confidence that a ton of
      quality changes will come with time as the community gives feedback to improve
      the game. Can''t wait for more to come.


      Game runs well with my 7700k and GTX 1080 Ti'
