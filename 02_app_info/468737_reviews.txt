It makes an otherwise complicated setup and tracking mod, into one that makes things simpler and less of a headache to manage. It's also intuitive in the way the user areas are presented. It's definitely attractive! \n\nThat said, it is a little outdated compared to where TTS is in 2020. The rulebook is a simple import of the actual rulebook and with it being vertical and dense, it's hard to read it within the mod due to limited zoom space and resolution. From a scripting perspective, you could feel the lack of a \"Start Game\" button, to help get the game going once all players have their dashboards setup. I also felt it odd (nitpick) there wasn't bank/wallet for credits on the dashboard anywhere, considering the credits don't stack. \n\nAll that said, the game itself being fun really caries this mod home! There are user mod's which contains the Embers expansion; it's essential at this point. In fact, don't bother buying this DLC unless you intend to use one on top of this mod. \n\nNow that I think about it, It's actually a quite disappointing the expansion hasn't been integrated into the official DLC yet. The main reason I say that is due to the fact that the Embers expansion exists mainly to address/fix several of the major issues players were having with the base game rule set, and significantly improves the immersion. \n\nI still recommend this DLC, but not without the caveat of using a user mod to include the Embers expansion. On it's own 6/10; with the rule improvements from the Embers expansion via user mods 8/10. Would've given either an extra point if there was \"Start Game\" scripting.","timestamp_created":1599406337,"timestamp_updated":1599406337,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4vv2CsvQCd6SZoAI="}
