    review: The game seemed fun, but I had issues getting it to display correctly
      on my Rift S (no issues with any other games). Right after starting the game
      the field of view was covered in black dots/pixels that made the game pretty
      disorienting and difficult to play. I haven't been able to find any help online
      with how to fix the issue, but until I can get it working I can't recommend
      the game.
