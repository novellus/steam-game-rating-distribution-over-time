      \ Ynglet is a game in which I discovered a secret underground transport network\
      \ composed of ghostly avocados. Where does it lead? No idea. Ynglet is hard\
      \ to talk about, then \u2013 I keep plinking between metaphors. Cell structure?\
      \ Ice cubes? Urban transport? \u2013 but it is a joy to play. It\u2019s headed\
      \ to PC and it\u2019s going to be brilliant.\u201D<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-03-24-ynglet-allowed-me-to-discover-an-underground-transport-network-made-of-ghostly-avocados\"\
