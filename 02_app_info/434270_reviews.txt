But it gets annoying to use certain ones and doesn't control well enough. \n\nThe text in this game is way to big that sometimes it will just take up the entire screen while you are playing the game and you have wait till it disappears till its comfortable to keep playing. \n\nAlso changing to different forms to progress through the areas costs one heart every time you change your character and I would love to know why that's the case cause if your confused and don't know which form to use as your cycling through them you then realize you are about to die in one hit and can make the game frustrating when that happens constantly. I haven't gotten far to tell if this would happen but what if you get in a situation where you need to change to different forms and if you don't have enough health at one point you might be stuck, just a random statement of how annoying that is.\n\n3/10, I don't recommend this game at all.","timestamp_created":1553042909,"timestamp_updated":1553042909,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.51242828369140625","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ49MSkzOkCf6m1vQE="}
