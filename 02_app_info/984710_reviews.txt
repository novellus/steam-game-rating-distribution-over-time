Thus, this DLC no longer has a reason to exist.\n\nI'd recommend the Deluxe Edition DLC for Mojo: Hanako, but... she just looks awful. If the dev re-drew Hanako to look like all the other characters in the Mojo series, AND if the Deluxe Edition DLC had the same price as this \"Collection Edition DLC\", THEN I would recommend it.","timestamp_created":1577742814,"timestamp_updated":1577742814,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.383561640977859497","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws5mzrO8Ccea96AE="}
