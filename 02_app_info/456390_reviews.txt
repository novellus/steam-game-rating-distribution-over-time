It may look too bright and overloaded in screenshots, but it is much better in dynamics.\n* The story is an unexpected bonus -- it is small and non-invasive, but it is there and it is cute, presented via comics between episodes.\n\nOverall, I like this game a lot, it hits all those singleplayer-Trackmania vibes for me (\"run the track until you are happy with the time, then move on to the next one\") without being the bloated monster that Trackmania has become. \n\nThe devs here have done an amazing job with what little budget they had. You can definitely see some rough edges (some menus look clunky, character models are very low-detail, time bonuses are not explained anywhere etc), but this game has it where it matters, and it's a real shame to see it lost in the depths of steam with not even enough reviews to get a rating.\n\nP.S. The game runs flawlessly on Linux with proton","timestamp_created":1598354697,"timestamp_updated":1598354742,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr7vXkvQCe6nUnQI="}
