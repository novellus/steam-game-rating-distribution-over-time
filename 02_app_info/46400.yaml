    review: This game is a highly abridged and fairly mediocre Diablo clone. The three
      classes you can choose from all quickly become boring. The locations are forgettable,
      the combat is tedious, and the design is unimaginative. If you want an ARPG
      that hits the spot, there are many others on Steam that will do better. Will
      they do better for the money? ($5 asking price at time of writing) That's not
      clear. But I would rather have a cup of good coffee.
