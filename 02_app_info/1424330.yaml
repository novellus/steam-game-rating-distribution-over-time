      \ /><br><br>Wobbledogs is a 3D pet simulation where you raise your own personal\
      \ hive of rapidly mutating dogs, physically simulated all the way down to their\
      \ guts! It\u2019s a casual and chill sandbox experience for players of all ages\
      \ who want to care for their very own virtual pets in a surprising, unique,\
      \ and stress-free environment. The dogs start out relatively normal, but mutate\
      \ and behave in surprising ways as the game progresses and their evolutionary\
      \ lines advance.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1424330/extras/gut_600_t.gif?t=1609798985\"\
      \ /><br><br>Dogs have highly variable bodies controlled by a simulated genetics\
      \ system. As they age, they periodically enter a pupal state and physically\
      \ mutate. The foods they eat fill their guts with different flora, just like\
      \ in the gif above. These flora influence the dogs' mutations, letting you craft\
      \ and mold them to fit your own idea of canine (im)perfection!<br><br><img src=\"\

      \ /><br><br>Dogs need a place to call home, and it\u2019s up to you to create\
      \ an appealing habitat to help them thrive. As you play, you'll gain access\
      \ to more and more objects and decorations. String together rooms and decorate\
      \ them however you\u2019d like. Give your dogs a relaxing place to sleep, set\
      \ up an maze, or even cultivate a garden. There are no built-in goals, so you\
      \ can prioritize whatever you like the most!<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1424330/extras/walk2.gif?t=1609798985\"\
      \ /><br><br>The dogs in this game are physically simulated, which adds a layer\
      \ of uniqueness to almost every action they take. Two dogs with separate body\
      \ structures will experience the world in different ways. They also have unique\
      \ personality traits that influence the types of behaviors they tend to run\
      \ and govern how they interact with other dogs and objects.<br><br><img src=\"\

      \ /><br><br>Wobbledogs is meant to be enjoyable simply to passively observe,\
      \ but it\u2019s also rewarding to interact with the dogs directly, whether that\u2019\
      s petting them to relieve some stress, tossing a pup around to watch it tumble\
      \ through the pen, or helping your canine companion get free after it wriggled\
      \ itself into a particularly tight space. These dogs try their best, but sometimes\
      \ they need a bit of extra help!"
