Whack-a-mole with zombies. Not exactly groundbreaking, but maybe some arcadey fun.\n \nThis game though, isn't very good. The basic mechanics are hitting zombies or digging holes for zombies to fall into. This is made much more difficult since the controls are terrible, and your character slides around like he's in a Mario ice level. You don’t exactly slide so it’s not a perfect description but that’s the best way I can think to describe it. I tried playing with both controller and keyboard and while keyboard was slightly more bearable I would not say I had a good time. The whack-a-mole part is pretty precise in registering a hit, and you have to be fast, so anything being awkward about the controls is a very bad thing.\n\nOne thing I found strange was the gravestones (which the enemies spawn from) being randomly generated, which meant that sometimes a level would be hard since the graves were far apart and the controls suck, but then on retrying it all the graves would be in one corner making the level stupidly easy. It seems like actually planning out the levels with the gravestone placement would make for a better experience, especially since the levels increase in difficulty as the game progresses and adds more enemy types and mechanics. Enemies’ spawning is literally the only thing you have to manage while playing so the randomness just seems like poor design. \n\nThe game is still pretty easy until the introduction of ghosts around level 8 or so, random spawns aside. The ghosts are honestly terrible. When an enemy hits you, you become stunned for a few seconds. Ghosts can hit you, but the only way to kill them is with a random pickup - the crucifix. However, as soon as you kill one another spawns, so it's pretty pointless. The problem with the ghosts is that they often stand over the graves as zombies are spawning, meaning you can't get to the zombie and kill it. The ghost just wanders around randomly so sometimes a couple of zombies will just be blocked off with nothing you can do about it. And it’s not like you can just dig holes to get around this, since you can’t dig on tiles with gravestones and skeletons take 2 holes to kill, which you often don’t have time or room for (and keep in mind this entire time how bad the game feels to control). I don't mind challenge, but having like 2 mechanics in a game and then randomly making some enemies guaranteed to get past is really annoying (and the game isn't exactly fun to begin with).\n\nThe sound design is also pretty dreadful. The music is generic atmospheric stuff, bland but inoffensive. But there's this weird and off-putting 70's porn music that plays when you pick up tequila (kind of like this game's version of the fruit in pacman, letting you jump on the zombies and kill them faster) and in the main menu mousing over any of the options plays a weird sound of what I think is someone saying \"dig\" but it sounds more like \"dink\" and is just weird. When you complete a level it tallies up the enemies you killed and plays an 8-bit chirp for each one making each level end with what is basically a burst of static.\n\nIt's pretty easy but becomes very tedious since every time you fail a stage it shows a game over screen and kicks you back to the main menu where you have to select the stage again. Not a huge issue but adding a retry level option or something doesn't seem that hard. \nThe game is also very short. It took me like 30 minutes to beat all 12 levels even with the annoying controls, and after that I just played it a while longer for the cards. The last level changes things up with a flamethrower and no powerups but it's not really any better. Really not worth the money it's being sold for, or any money at all in my opinion.","timestamp_created":1544752279,"timestamp_updated":1544753318,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.628666877746582031","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh6Ge1ecCcbKgtQE="}
