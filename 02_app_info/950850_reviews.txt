It's characters are charming, the art gorgeous, and the story interesting. The puzzles are mediocre, and not very fun. The story itself, without spoiling much, is of 5 friends reunited in Elsa's house, when their lives are at a crossroads. Their stories intertwine into your experience.\n\nIt's good. If you relate to their issues, it'll probably be better than if you don't. Worth it on sale.","timestamp_created":1603806462,"timestamp_updated":1603806462,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg5CUtfUCcei4qgI="}
