    about_the_game: "You\u2019ve heard of the summer of love? 1967; San Francisco;\
      \ turn on, tune in, drop out; kids with flowers in their hair? Well, Barry had\
      \ its own summer of love a year earlier, in 1966. Oh, I\u2019m not talking flower\
      \ power \u2013 it was still mods and rockers round here, suits and scooters\
      \ or leather and brylcreem.  But Barry\u2019s summer of love ended eventually,\
      \ making way for \u2013 well, let\u2019s call it the Autumn of Apathy. No music,\
      \ no lights, no queues. Just silent streets. At least they were silent \u2013\
      \ until that night. The night the Doctor arrived\u2026<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe\
      \ Silent Streets of Barry Island, penned by Jacqueline Raynor, is drawn by Emma\
      \ Vieceli and colored by Kris Carter. It features the Eleventh Doctor, Amy Pond\
      \ and Rory Williams in mods-n-rockers era Barry Island. It's a summertime love\
      \ story in an unseasonably snowy Barry Island which is plagued by mysterious,\
      \ gruesome deaths and disappearances. They've arrived for a planned holiday\
      \ but quickly have to ditch the beach gear and blend in with the locals. Their\
      \ guide is Ted, a down on his luck fish n chip shop owner. Ted is voiced by\
      \ Steffan Rhodri (Gavin &amp; Stacey, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows).\
      \ Look for an exciting new story which features a startling reveal for Doctor\
      \ Who fans."

    review: "This one is bad...really bad\n\n and now I am not talking about the gameplay.....\n\
      \nStory is utter bad...first 20 \"Pages\" are the worst Visual novel I have\
      \ ever seen.....\nVoiceacting is monotone and just boring.\n\nSkip this one\
      \ unless you are into moths....\n"
