It's a fun game with an interesting story line but there is some glitches that need to be fixed. \nOne is within the main game where you have to put a plan back together within a HOP and then the game crashes and then closes itself down, I did however find away around this by playing the match 3 mini-game. The other glitch that I have found is within the bonus chapter and this now means I can not finish the game, this glitch isn't a puzzle or HOP it is something simple, by trying to put the fuse into the fuse box so that the electricity works, I have tried to do the bonus chapter a couple of times and tried to do it differently but still no luck.\nOverall I still really enjoyed the game. I just hope that the developers fix the glitch so that I can fully finish the game.","timestamp_created":1609441130,"timestamp_updated":1609441130,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw4daK3fYCcL+XvwI="}
