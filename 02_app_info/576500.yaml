      \ midst of a mysterious forest world. Transform your garden by combining plants\
      \ into strange new forms, and unearth deeply hidden secrets as you become engrossed\
      \ in the game\u2019s calming rhythm. Wander into the forest and help bring it\
      \ back to life with the help of Fen, your creature guide. Evergarden may feel\
      \ familiar at first, but you will discover it is like no game you have played\
      \ before.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h2><strong>Q: What\
      \ type of game is this?</strong><br><strong>A: </strong>Evergarden is an \u201C\
      evergreen\u201D puzzle game, set inside a narrative adventure.<br><br> We\u2019\
      ve spent years developing the core puzzle game to be accessible and relaxing,\
      \ but also very deep and strategic. On a basic level, you\u2019ll combine plants\
      \ on a board to create more valuable items, and grow your garden within a turn\
      \ limit. The game holds a lot of secrets though, and most players will spend\
      \ months mastering the strategies required to get a great score. This portion\
      \ of the game also has a leaderboard.<br><br>Beyond the garden puzzle board,\
      \ there lies a mysterious forest environment to explore, with its own puzzles\
      \ and progression. You\u2019ll use the stones that you earn by playing the core\
      \ puzzle board to solve puzzles, and unlock new \u201Csongs\u201D which add\
      \ depth and fun to the puzzle board. <br><strong><br>Q: How long is the game?</strong><br><strong>A:\
      \ </strong>The core puzzle game is \u201Cevergreen\u201D, which means you can\
      \ play it repeatedly and keep mastering it, without ever truly \u201Ccompleting\u201D\
      \ it. The adventure game portion will take most players 10-15 hours to explore,\
      \ and there is also a daily challenge portion with a new procedural puzzle to\
      \ unlock every day."

      board at its center, a mysterious creature nearby, and secrets lurking in the
      shadows. Why are you here, and what will you do next? A deceptively simple puzzle

    review: I am skeptical as to why a game, that is basically a neat twist on 2048,
