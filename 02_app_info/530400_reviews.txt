I got this, because I thought it would be a great new show for my kids and grandkids to watch. I am not at all disappointed. It's very colourful, simple, and the movement is great, which are all things that catch a child's attention. Considering how much I loved cartoons and anime growing up, and still even love them now, I think it's something that will be very memorable for them later on in life. You never know, one day they may look back and remember when Nana/ Mama watched Battle Disc with them.","timestamp_created":1503956282,"timestamp_updated":1503956282,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqfWxld4CfrTsgwE="}
