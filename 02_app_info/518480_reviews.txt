It does have pacing issues in the beginning. The protagonist doesnt really have a clear motivation. Since Shinkai used a different studio the animation while still gorgeous isnt on par with his other projects, also the dub is far worse (but still passable) than his other projects. And this didnt real feel like a shinkai project at all, it felt like him trying to do a version of princess mononoke. That being said even being the weakest of his projects it is still a good movie even if its a bit too long. There are some fun chase scenes and even a disturbing scene. I would give it a 7/10.","timestamp_created":1534832840,"timestamp_updated":1534832840,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1NHKreUCePb4qAE="}
