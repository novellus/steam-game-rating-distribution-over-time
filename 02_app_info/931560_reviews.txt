The galgame “Seven Days” has an extremely meaningful story and the most important idea it would like to convey is that “Treasure Your Life”. After going through the entire game, I ended out realizing so many life principles which really impressed me a lot and brought this game to a higher level. For sure I want to suggest people purchase this galgame Seven Days and I am looking forward to seeing more galgame published by this company in the future. By the way, the galgame is for full age and I really appreciate it.      \n\nSakura: A girl who taught me to slow down my step, enjoy and live in the moment of present without always thinking about what is next. (Moe: Glutton)\n\nKotoha: A girl who taught me that the loneliness I was suffering before is not meaningless, the loneliness I experienced actually brought up my present toughness and gentleness. (Moe: Tsundere)\n\nMari: A girl who was lacking the love from her original parents, especially her mother, but finally felt the warmth of mom’s love from the protagonist’s mother. (Moe: Energetic)\n\nIchiru: A girl who was pursuing a cool life like a passionate life that a shonen manga’s protagonist has, burning out all her energy by doing exciting things until the end. (Moe: Wild)\n\nShizuku: A girl who was working hard to share the truth behind their sadness stories in order to convey the idea of treasuring your life and everyone beside and important to you. (Moe: Mukuchi)\n\nNene: A girl who realized true love is not really expressed by the physical relationship but built by a metal and psychological relationship (Moe: Hentai in the surface but pure in the heart)\n\nChiyako: A girl who treasure the forty-nine days’ memories spent with the protagonist Shuizie, who was suffering from the nightmare for a long time and finally released from the curse by Shuizie’s rescue in the end of story (Moe: Tennen) \n\nRecommendation on improvement: I actually have experienced some problems with the game system like I cannot make screenshots in the full size, and I hope they can make the story longer to more than 45 hours playing time. Also, if every heroine can have equal story length, it will be better.    \n\nOverall, the galgame is worth buying because of the quality of the story and the charming heroines. I will give Seven Days the score of 8.6 out of 10.","timestamp_created":1610078778,"timestamp_updated":1610079072,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8J2M8PYCdNu5wQI="}
