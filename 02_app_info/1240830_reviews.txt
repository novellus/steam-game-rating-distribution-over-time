Do not worry for I shall save you your money, time, and sanity. I have sacrificed to show you the error of this developer's ways. \n\n*tips hat and gallops off on noble steed.*\n\n1) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQdUMoiyjlE\n\n2) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEMbI5AVOAM\n\n\n- It is what we thought it was.\n\nLazy.\n\nGameGuru.\n\nCrapola.\n\nThe Irony.. and how \"fitting\" that THIS review is my 666th review here on Steam!  Just noticed.\n\nShame on you developer for making one of the absolute laziest rip-offs on Steam ever.  - How do you even have a conscious trying to sell a demo export from GameGuru for money?\n\n\nMy Score:  - 1,399.  (Negative 1,399 out of 0 to 100 possible)\n\nNOT Recommended.. unless you enjoy the process of refunding your Steam purchases.  Because well that refund process is a helluva lot more fun than is playing this \"game/demo\".","timestamp_created":1582372902,"timestamp_updated":1582394796,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":49,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.801946878433227539","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw/oyFt/ACe/7u8wE="}
