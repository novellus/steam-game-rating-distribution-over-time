Text on screen can be blurry or nearly impossible to read during battles. Bullets sometimes clip through the edge of walls. And it is obviously trying to capitalize on the popularity of Enter the Gungeon. That said, I really love this game. It is fun with very satisfying combat. The shooting is so enjoyable that despite dying repeatedly on levels (granted I don't have the best skills) I kept coming back to see if I could overcome it. This is a very challenging game, but not frustratingly so. And the guns are just so satisfying to use, paired with a substantial variety of enemies that force the player to change tactics (somewhat). The writing is also hilariously over the top and enjoyable. This is just a great little game that I know I will be coming back to repeatedly. Considering its price, if you think you might be interested at all in this game I would strongly recommend that you check it out.","timestamp_created":1589986208,"timestamp_updated":1589986536,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwpKWlmfICctSFiQI="}
