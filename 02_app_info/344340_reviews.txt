I always loved drafts and team building  more than taking control of a player on the field.\nIt started out seeming I would love this. So much potential. potential UNDELIVERED it turns out.\nI roll up my sleeves and spend quite a bit of time working on my team building - drafts and FA. My eyes get sore after crunching numbers for my first round pick. I hired the best coaches I could with ratings in interviewing, player development and young talent.\nTo no avail it seems. \nEvery season my draft picks just die before they reach year 4. MY cornerstone LT I was so proud to get in the first round to build my team, drops from a 71 future to 39!!!!! This is with an interview and low volatility.\nThe LG I draft the next season who was a 65? he drops to 42.\nThe next year the CB I draft who is a 72? Over 4 seasons as a starter he drops to 50.\nThe 74 OLB I drafted last night who was a 74? He comes out of pre season and his Future is now 59.\n\nIs this supposed to be fun in anyway? How am I supposed to build a team? I love drafts, but I would just be better off going George Allen and trading all my picks for veterans.\nExcept it is the same with veterans. the LE I signed that was a 71 and only 25 years old - You guessed it immediately died. He spent his final season riding the pine and rated 36 while making 11 mil that season.\nIt wouldn't be so bad if it balanced out and my 2-4 round guys would have a player or 2 that bloomed, but that NEVER happens, except maybe 5 points temporarily.\nThe 3rd round QB I drafted last night went from 50 -30 by the end of pre season. Yahoo!!! So fun!!!\nOh- and those busted out players who are now 30-45 ish, they all hold out their final season asking for HUGE salaries, and if you don't pony up 5-13 mil per season on them they won't re-sign with you and go to FA where they get 1-4 mil per season.\nIn 2020 I have exactly ONE Very Good player on my team, the SS who came on the roster at the start of the game.\n\n\nI was thinking of grabbing FOF8, but now I ill be saving my $.","timestamp_created":1607109565,"timestamp_updated":1607110603,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4j7bQl/YCd96otwI="}
