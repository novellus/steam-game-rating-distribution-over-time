    review: "Obviously a another rushed VR experience. It had potential, I can see\
      \ what they wanted to do but it falls much too short to be worth buying. \n\n\
      Pros: \n- If you really like history and can tolerate monotone narrators then\
      \ you may have some enjoyment.\n\nCons: \n- Mind numbing, monotone narrator\u2026\
      \n- Environment rendering is so low rez, you can\u2019t really see much. It\u2019\
      s just a badly done CG rendering onto a sphere. \n- The small number of interactable\
      \ items are so useless and not engaging at all.\n- There isn\u2019t even a tower\
      \ beneath you, you\u2019re just floating on this platform that appears miles\
      \ above the ground.\n"
