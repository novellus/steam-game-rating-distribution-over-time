      is it still there where you''re not looking?<br><br>SightLine is an award winning
      virtual reality experience based on the concept of missing object permanence
      and affecting the virtual world simply by observing it, creating a surreal dream-like
      experience that messes with your most natural instincts, something that can
      only be fully experienced with power of VR.<br><br>This includes the popular
      <strong>SightLine: The Chair</strong> experience, originally designed for Oculus
      Rift DK2. This is crafted as introductory experience into VR, demonstrating
      power of this technology to create familiar worlds and settings as well as realities
      that behave unlike anything that you might know.<br><br>Additionally the original
      <strong>SightLine 2013 VR Jam experience</strong> for DK1 has been remastered
      and updated with latest OpenVR SDK, making it playable with modern VR headsets.
      This version offers a narrative and based experience with action and puzzle
      solving built around the same core mechanic.<br><br><br>Both demos are <strong>available
      for free</strong> on the main website as they have been for the past few years,
      but your purchase on Steam helps support the developers and help them continue
      focusing on developing virtual reality applications.'

    short_description: The laws of physics ensure that your perception of the world
      stays consistent. But what if those laws were broken? You'll find yourself in
      a surreal world where everything changes the moment you look away.

    review: "Two experiences in one free title \u2013 how can you argue!? In my opinion,\
      \ the chair experience is more polished, and a fun demo of VR in general. It\u2019\
      s a trippy use of the platform to demonstrate something that can\u2019t be done\
      \ IRL. Surreal and well executed. The other experience \u2013 a puzzle - has\
      \ more content, is a little longer, but not as polished. Combined, they offer\
      \ about one hour of playtime. Both are definitely worth your time! Thumbs: UP!"
