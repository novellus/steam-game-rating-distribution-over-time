The guns work well, the reloading is perfect, the wild west setting is nicely done...BUT... I bought this because I wanted to relive the Clint Eastwood gunfights against one, two or more players. It seems to offer this in the 'Defend The Town' option...BUT...IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO LOSE A GUNFIGHT, even against 3 GUNFIGHTERS. In 32 separate waves I encountered 1, 2, or 3 baddies in each case. But in every case they took at least 3 seconds to fire even a single shot shot, giving me more than enough time to fire as many bullets as I wanted. Even worse, when they do eventually start shooting, not a single shot is on target. Not one. Even if I fire my bullets at the ground or refuse to fire at all, I did not get shot once in over 30 waves. It's inexplicable, but there it is. It looked like someone had finally created a viable gunfighting game, but with no possibility of getting shot, what's the point?","timestamp_created":1591900888,"timestamp_updated":1591900888,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvPur0vICcvK8jQI="}
