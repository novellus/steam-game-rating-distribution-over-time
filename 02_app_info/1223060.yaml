      /><br>An imposing and unpredictable figure, with unmatched strength and an arsenal
      of Ancestral Equipment that served only to enhance his already devastating array
      of attacks, Torfin was considered by those who had not had the misfortune of
      crossing his path in battle to be an embodiment of tall tales and hearsay.<br><br>Now,
      having led the Ox Clan to becoming one of the most feared and respected in all
      of Northgard, there are few who question his legitimacy as he lies dormant,
