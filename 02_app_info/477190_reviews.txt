Epic Snowday Adventure is a challenging and easy-going game where the goal is to defeat the neighborhood kids in a snowball fight. It's an adventure/strategy game- the further you get, the more tools and tricks you learn to ultimately be crowned the winner-- and did I say it's challenging? It took me four attempts to defeat the third wave of opponents.\n\nIt has a fun story, detailed artwork and unique VR game mechanics that I've never seen before. Highly recommend for all ages.\n\n","timestamp_created":1522810141,"timestamp_updated":1522810141,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4lNejx+ICdIiznQE="}
