It's a cartoonish VR Shooter with some twists and cool boss battles. \n\nI got this game on sale. I was keeping an eye on it after many zombie shooter, horror games, war games, fight games etc..I needed something more happy and positive. I think it's actually good.. Thumbs up for the cartoonish world inspired by Pokemon. Graphics are simple but neat in VR. Runs flawlessly with 1.8 Super Sampling (on g1 1080), i guess it could be even more. As far as i played i didn't notice mayor flaws in the gameplay nor in the presentation. The other way around: i've been beating a couple of bosses and they were nicely done. I enjoyed the positive vibes and the funny translations. It's trippy stuff overall, so if you are into trippy VR games you will like this one as well. Makes me want to get back inthere later on. In case i will change my mind about something I will edit this review.","timestamp_created":1485451027,"timestamp_updated":1485451144,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.548661470413208008","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtLXy7dkCfvjGcA=="}
