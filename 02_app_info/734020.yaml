      \ powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and\
      \ more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers\
      \ (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains\
      \ who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array\
      \ of six cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player's\
      \ turn a villain card is revealed and added to the row of villains. This row\
      \ has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, villains start to escape.\
      \ The villain deck also contains &quot;master strike&quot; cards, and whenever\
      \ one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes\
      \ a bonus action. As players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards,\
      \ which will be worth points at game's end. Players can also fight the mastermind;\
      \ if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath\
      \ the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these\
      \ cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their victory points to\
      \ see who wins. If the mastermind completes his scheme, however \u2013 having\
      \ a certain number of villains escape, for example, or imposing a certain number\
      \ of wounds on the heroes \u2013 then the players all lose.You will never play\
      \ the same game twice as the game changes each time you play. Team up with other\
      \ players and fight to the end but make sure you have collected enough victory\
      \ points along the way to be victorious.<br><br><br>Features:<br><ul class=\"\
