Again, it’s sweet, but nothing to write home about, and I don’t know if I will be replaying any time soon. Quality wise, the art is nice, and the music can be a bit overbearing at times, but it did match the theme well enough. There were a few snippets of text here and there that confused me a bit, some were small spelling errors and there were a few that I’m not quite sure if they were typos or just figures of speech that I had never heard before, but it was nothing major and I wouldn’t say that they detracted from my overall enjoyment of the game.\nReally my biggest issue with the game was the progression of the story, which went WAAYY to fast for my liking. These two dudes have just met this girl and suddenly it’s all “Hey let’s date!” I mean, it even sorta gets acknowledged in game how quickly things are progressing. But again, for a $5 otome game, I wasn’t expecting an Idea Factory narrative.\nIn conclusion: It’s a short game you can finish in less than a day, it has it’s cute moments, and the art is pretty, so go ahead and buy it if you like the beach and shirtless mermen. It's only $5 after all.\nOn a side note: there was a scene near the beginning of the game that was unintentionally funny? [spoiler]It was a pan up of Crylis (The merman’s) sprite, and for some reason this merman sprite descending from the heavens was just the funniest thing to me.[/spoiler] Don’t ask me why; it was late, I was kinda tired, and I have a terrible sense of humor.","timestamp_created":1606150428,"timestamp_updated":1606150428,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575835466384887695","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1tKB+/UCc/yLsAI="}
