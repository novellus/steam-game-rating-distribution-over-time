    review: 'This is a fun turn-based, hex-grid ship combat game.  The ships are somewhat
      similar between classes of the same type (they do all come from the same tech
      background, so I give it a pass) but the story missions themselves are fun,
      and there''s randomized missions you can take from stations to improve your
      standing with them, make extra money, and salvage some loot if you''re lucky.  Your
      pilots all come from the story line, so there''s little sense in wandering off
      the beaten path for more than a few missions until you have all of them.  They
      also come with their own ships, so you''re not scrambling to scrounge up the
      money for another ship b/c someone invited themselves in!  They also level up
      and get better as they take more jobs, so there''s incentive to bring them along.


      Pro tip: When one of your pilots (no names for spoilers'' sakes) has "Light
      ''Em Up" as an option at the level-up screen, TAKE IT.  It illuminates every
      enemy position on the map, which is really good for NOT walking your flotilla
      into an ambush.'
