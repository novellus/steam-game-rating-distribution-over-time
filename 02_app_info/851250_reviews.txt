Maybe we just don't know how to play, but I can't imagine finding 3 levers in 30 minutes. Honestly not sure why there's even a time limit... feel like the game would be better without one. We're all refunding unfortunately.\n\nI someone does a better version of this game because it would be really popular if done well.","timestamp_created":1583625268,"timestamp_updated":1583625268,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.494594603776931763","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsv3a2/ACd9bc9gE="}
