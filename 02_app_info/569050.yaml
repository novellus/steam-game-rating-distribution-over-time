    about_the_game: 'An ordinary guy forced to defend the world from an alien invasion
      of infectious zombies. A point-and-click adventure with beautiful pixel art
      and bombastic retro sound.<h2 class="bb_tag">The Gameplay</h2><br>Gameplay is
      similar to old games like Maniac Mansion, Zac McKraken, Beneath A Steel Sky
      and Monkey Island, but the game has a unique interface. Unlike most other point-and-click
      adventures the player actually holds the current item in his hand. Even the
      new TouchBar on the MacBook Pro is supported (optional).<h2 class="bb_tag">The
      Graphics</h2><br>All handcrafted pixel art.<h2 class="bb_tag">The Music</h2><br>All
      game music only uses original Commodore C64 SID chip sounds, but polyphonic
      and with professional effects. The main theme of the Paul Pixel game was composed
      by the Pixel Lover Orchestra and is called &quot;They Want To Get Us&quot;.
      Other chiptune highlights are &quot;The Awakening&quot; by the underground duo
      Retro Arcade Boys and &quot;The Giant Meteor&quot; by 8-Bit Factory.<h2 class="bb_tag">The
      Story</h2><br>An average guy called Paul Pixel discovers that the part of the
      city where he lives was put in quarantine. Apparently there has been a zombie
      outbreak. He needs to get out...<br><br>Of course, a short time later he needs
      to save the whole earth from this zombie apocalypse.<br><br>Playtime: 2.5 -
      3 hours'
