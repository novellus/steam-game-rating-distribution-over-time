    review: "This VN is A lot of fun,,\n \nLana is just horrid, she can change a bit\
      \ IF you dont try for her but alot if you do,, \nRika is cute and fun, And is\
      \ a romance that needs gentleness, Jade is cute and has hidden desires but is\
      \ a rewarding romance to. Zoe is nuts,, super fit, but nuts, this is a romance\
      \ for those who like madness and pain.\n\nHaving Now done The Lana path, she\
      \ does come great in the end, though you say friend with benefits but Lana does\
      \ act more like a girlfriend in the end, which surprised me to be honest.\n\n\
      Managed to get Emily,, It IS reliant on getting  2 Things correct.. The relationship\
      \ has it's challenges but also has great times.\n\nYou see the story from all\
      \ angles if you date each girl on each play through.\nZoe shocked me a bit,\
      \ though I half expected it,, Jade was sweet but a huge view \nof a part of\
      \ the story from the inside..which you saw from a kinda view on a sort of inside\
      \ with Zoe..\n\nThe CG collection can Remain incomplete as there are 2 left\
      \ for me,, One is the Sex   Scene with the female reporter After Loosing the\
      \ Halloween game, and the other is for having all the CG's.\nI am not going\
      \ to loose a game to make things even harder lol\n\nIf you like Yuri you will\
      \ enjoy this.\n\nStory  = 10 (Excellent)\nGraphics/CG = 10 (Scenery and CG's\
      \ all great)\nMusic = 8 (pretty good but I usually mute music)\nYuri = 10 (Pure\
      \ Wall to Wall Yuri)\nEase of use = 10 (All controls as expected for a VN)\n\
      \nOver All = 10 (Though Music is an 8, I cant fault it because it doesn't really\
      \ match my taste)\n"
