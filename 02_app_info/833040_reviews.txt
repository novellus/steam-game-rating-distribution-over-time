I really liked Cirava? But a lot of these are really uncomfortably weird Friendsims that are an unguessable game of picking the right options. You think you were right? Wrong. You're almost always wrong in this game but stick around. Some of the content is great. Some is terrible. I don't recommend this game to NON-Homestucks. If you're a normie playing this game prepare to be traumatized by how weird it is.\n\nHowever, if you ARE a Homestuck fan, you'll probably see this as a solid 4 or 5 out of 5! It's very creative.","timestamp_created":1531986863,"timestamp_updated":1609638751,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4scX84vYCeMiypgE="}
