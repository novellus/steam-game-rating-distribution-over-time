    about_the_game: "Gravity Control is a puzzle platformer where you don\u2019t control\
      \ the player directly but indirectly by changing the gravity direction. <br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nGuide the player to the wormhole that brings you to the next\
      \ level. There are 60 levels to overcome. Each level challenges the player differently,\
      \ some are more action-focused whereas other levels will need the player to\
      \ use their brain.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBe surprised by obstacles that are needed\
      \ to be avoided, like moving spikes and rotating lasers. By changing the direction\
      \ of the gravity not only the player but also crates will move in the gravity\
      \ direction. Some crates will operate the open and closing of nearby doors or\
      \ turning the lasers on and off. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe stages will become\
      \ more challenging the further you progress. How well the player is handling\
      \ the floaty astronaut will determine if you don't crash into an obstacle. In\
      \ later levels switching triggers on and off will require more thinking because\
      \ the number of blocks will increase."
