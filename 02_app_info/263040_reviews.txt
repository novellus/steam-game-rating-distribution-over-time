You interact with robots by speaking or writing. The robots react to your inputs depending on the information they have or their perception of things, so they don't always react exactly as expected. There are several situations you have to solve in this way. Sometimes within a time limit. Graphics are OK but I'm not a graphics guy so don't take my word on it. Sound is also OK, but it's not so important for the gameplay. The interesting part (and why I really love this game) is the interaction itself. This game shows you clearly, and beyond any doubt, that what you think is evident might not be so evident to other person. Many people should play this game in order to improve the way they treat others at their workplace or at home. The only downside I see at the moment is the voice recognition. When I played this game in Windows 7 it was hit or miss. Sometimes it worked like charm, other times I wanted to kick the screen. I have not tried Windows 10. An interesting game from my point of view, even though I understand it's not for everyone.","timestamp_created":1587063290,"timestamp_updated":1587063290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwif+VwvECepemgQI="}
