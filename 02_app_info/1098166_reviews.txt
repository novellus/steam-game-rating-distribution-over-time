Whoever did the rather good modelling and texturing has been thoroughly and shamefully let down by the utter disregard for any level of acceptable quality in SOUNDS.   DTG - You have always received some deserved criticism for poor sounds in releases but this is truly a new low.   The core engine sounds are not too bad but it's how the sound has been implemented that's the main problem.  Being in the cab is just an awful experience in the sim - the tinny engine sound is deafening.  You notice the engine start and stop buttons - then immediately regret pressing them - no sound simulation whatsoever of a start up or shutdown sound - the sound just stops abruptly.  Pulling away, the engine behaves nothing like a mechanical diesel with a torque converter.  RPMs are too low until you really open the throttle.  Having reviewed the sound files and PROMYXML files I can see why. The sound has not been set up at all to behave like a mechanical diesel with a torque converter and final drive.  Then there's the fact that you load this train and it spawns with no brakes on - come on!!  Are you serious?  Something as sloppy but critical as this has not been fixed in 11 months since release?\n\nBased on the modelling and texturing (particularly the cab texturing) this could have been such an opportunity to release a quality, much needed Pacer to TS.    Instead we have the most sloppy and quality-lacking release I've ever seen from DTG.\n\nDTG's quality is so inconsistent.  You can buy a product from 2014 or so and find that the level of functionality and general quality is far ahead of some products like this, released in late 2019.\n\nDTG - Seriously, I've never written comments like this about you, I am not a DTG hater, I own almost everything you've released for TS and TSW .......... but this 142 is just 100% unacceptable.\n\nThe final insult is that I spent hours trying to fix the sound files, and then testing in TS (to no avail), and was therefore refused a refund because of 2+ hours of \"game play\".","timestamp_created":1599125744,"timestamp_updated":1599126182,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581749081611633301","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwh6PWqfQCfPa/nwI="}
