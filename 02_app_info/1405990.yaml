    review: 'I''m liking the artbook especially part of the iteration of character
      designs. Not really complaining cause the price is just right in my currency
      and I am excited with the extra tidbits about the characters but... kind of
      wish of more revealed about the creative process and images of such process.
      I am thinking like frostpunk artbook with the basic almost-thumbnail-quality
      landscapes, lineart and b/w of characters. Or say, images of what one of the
      artist talking about of an attempt on making 3d shadows for Julia. How much
      are photos used for the arts. If there is photobashing for the final product,
      I somewhat do not notice it.  Well, there are more in-depth on bigger books
      of triple-A games but those are expensive! (plus they do have a lot of graphical
      contents in game to discuss)


      In a more positive praises... I enjoyed the cityscapes, added with the play
      of lights, shadows, and some animations. Simple but nice, and something I don''t
      think I see in VNs. Reading out one of the artist is also an architect, I feel
      like it answers why the locations-- esp the church-- looking so good. Zooming
      in to 400%, the art is deliberately rough edged and concepty-quality than marketing-illustration
      but they work so well. I do not have the confident to do such unless it is matte
      painting. The characters feels like having an aura of some of their characteristics.
      ~~I envy how good the characters art reflect their outstanding narrative but
      then I remember I hate drawing people~~'
