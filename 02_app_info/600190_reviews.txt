I'd love to see this get more content, both with real life hills and with joke fun hills, like the moon one. Unfortunately I can not currently recommend the game though, as the last update was in 2018, and it seems like this was abandoned and will never get out of early access. I mean, for 5 bucks this is still decent, but it would need more development.","timestamp_created":1598447512,"timestamp_updated":1598447512,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwnK25lfQCf5XwnQI="}
