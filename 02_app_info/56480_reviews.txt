However, it replaces the hand gun, so you won't be able to shoot nor throw the shield. \n- An armour with a low armour rating, which increases your damage by 25% and, for every melee hit you land, does extra damage to the entire squad you hit (rather than just the target). \n\nAlthough I never use the armour, I like the shield. Even if the Space Marine isn't as offensive as some other heroes (e.g. the Tau for example), it does increase his overall toughness. \n\nWith the proper wargears, I was able to tank a huge chunk of Anvil of Khorne wave 19 by myself, long enough for my team mates to clean up.","timestamp_created":1585337953,"timestamp_updated":1585337953,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525316417217254639","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4rq3gjvECcvbN+wE="}
