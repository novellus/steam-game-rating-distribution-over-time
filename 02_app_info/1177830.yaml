      notes: 'The title depicts a special task force in the police that deal with
        action-packed raids on criminal strongholds. Enemies are a-plenty and they
        carry heavy arms, ready to shoot at you, unless you take them out first. The
        style of the game is cel-shaded and carries comic-book styled violence. Most
        stages involve breaking in doors or action-packed scenes in a prison, where
        your task force uses police weaponry to deal with criminals. '
