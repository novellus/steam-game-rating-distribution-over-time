    review: "This is a good HOG (Hidden Object Game) with some great graphics, good\
      \ background music, good story line, and great game play.  \n\nPositives:\n\
      Lots of locations to explore.  Lots of hidden object mini games.  Game play\
      \ offers hints, a strategy guide, and a location status map.  Bonus section\
      \ follows completion of the main game.  The game is somewhat anti-climatic at\
      \ the conclusion, but still enjoyable to play.\n\nNegatives:\nGame appears to\
      \ only support 4:3 ratio resolution.  Installed this game on 3 different computers\
      \ and all 3 came up in a 4:3 resolution instead of filling the more modern widescreen\
      \ 16:9 monitors.  Game does offer different monitor resolution settings and\
      \ options, but still unable to take advantage of entire monitor screen real\
      \ estate."
