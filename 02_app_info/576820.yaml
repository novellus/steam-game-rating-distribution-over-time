    review: 'Not sure what it is with puzzle games in VR, but I find them very enjoyable.
      I bought tons of games in SS17, but this was the first game out of the bunch
      I immediately went back to, to complete, just couldn''t stop thinking about
      it :)


      The levels are very well made, they teach you the mechanics without you (probably)
      noticing, they vary in difficulty and design, and a few surprises sure had me
      chuckle :P Even if it''s all just shapes and lines, they do communicate.


      While the graphics look simple in screenshots, I have nothing to complain about,
      mainly because the lighting is quite sublime. The orbs actually light up the
      environment and when they change color, so does the light that spills out over
      the surfaces. Lighting is so very important in VR, and I think here they did
      a good job with it.


      I bought this at -20% at a whim, and I''m happy I did, would buy it again at
      full price without hesitation :D'
