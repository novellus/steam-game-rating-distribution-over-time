    review: 'TL;DR, If you''re looking for an exceptional challenge, I don''t think
      you''ll find that with this game.  I''d equate the hardest bosses in this game
      with the hard difficulty of Touhou 6.  The low difficulty does make the game
      accessible to beginners, but a mode with a much higher difficulty would''ve
      been neat.  If you''re on the fence about the game, but enjoy bullet hells,
      I''d recommend getting this game when it''s on sale.  More thoughts below.


      You''re basically open to fight most of the bosses in whatever order you want,
      with no minor enemies in between them; a huge plus in my opinion.  It also makes
      the game quite short which isn''t too much a big deal since re-fighting the
      bosses is a pretty good time, though like I said earlier, it would''ve benefited
      from having a mode with higher difficulty.


      There''s polish to be had; the music isn''t terribly memorable, some fights
      have really janky mechanics, certain cutscenes softlocking you in walls, and
      so forth.  These don''t occur terribly often in my time replaying the game,
      but they happen often enough that it might irritate someone playing through
      the game casually.  Hebi''s roar comes to mind.'
