It takes the simplicity of a good old flash game and brings it into a 3D world for you to shoot things in VR. I've found no bugs and it's got great mechanics. Haven't been able to get past 12 minutes in endless mode but it's sure fun. Great game that reminded me of the good ol' flash days. Definitely a \"gr8 8/8 m8\"","timestamp_created":1561777210,"timestamp_updated":1561777210,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54356849193572998","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqaDL0OsCdIbtxAE="}
