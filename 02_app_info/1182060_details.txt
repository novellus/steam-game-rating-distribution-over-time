{"1182060":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Heavens Tournament","steam_appid":1182060,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"Heavens Tournament is a hardcore realistic fighting Virtual Reality game that will test your power, reflexes, dexterity and skills. So, although it has anime characters, the fighting won't be anything like the animes that we're used to watch. You will actually have to keep your guard up, dodge, hit hard and make smart decisions, just like in a real fight with combat realism being the main philosophy, that's one of the reasons that there isn't TouchPad locomotion, because footwork is extremely important in a fight, due to that, Room Setup is necessary to play this game. Wanna hurt the opponent? Then swing your arms like you would in a real fight. And do expect to feel your arms heavy and lungs burning a little while playing this game ;)<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIt has a unique feature that the opponent will block the incoming attack according to the direction that the player is striking or even try to knee the player if they see a level change of the player going for a takedown.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe combat has a simple realistic fighting system, such as, the wider and faster your attack it, the more damage it will deal, just like in real life. It sounds silly, but this is one of the only or the only game like that out there for now. Most VR games out there, you can knock the opponent down by just waving the controller on the their faces really fast, and that's very unrealistic.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nExpect real challenges, each opponent having a different fighting style and ability.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAlthough the combat is realistic, Heavens Tournament has a few flashy abilities inspired by Animes (and my personal favorite, Hunter x Hunter), making the combat even more fun.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis game can be a stress reliever or just some casual fun if you wanna play on Easy mode. Or a challenge, workout or practice if you wanna try the Hard mode.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nRoom setup and 2 towers are required for this game with the minimum space of at least 2m by 1.5m or 6.5 feet by 5 feet.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nVoice Actors<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nVicente and Matsumoto: Blaque Pauldron, https:\/\/twitter.com\/Blaquepauldron<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nArthas: Mr. Pebble<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFynis: Kenya, https:\/\/twitter.com\/kettchanvrc<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nNellaen: Caterina, https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/caterinahunts<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nLuke: Relle, www.youtube.com\/RellePlays","about_the_game":"Heavens Tournament is a hardcore realistic fighting Virtual Reality game that will test your power, reflexes, dexterity and skills.
