      is a cyberpunk online co-op loot shooter where you fight for the best future!
      The game takes place in the 25th century when the CyberCorp corporation learned
      how to create artificial human bodies and temporarily load people's minds into
      them for military operations. Each player assumes the role of a agent who has
      to fight for the corporation ideals!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1116170/extras/en.gif?t=1608001677"
      /><br><br>The planet environment became unsuitable for long life due to many
      space, nuclear and biological wars in the 25th century. People began to create
      special &quot;shells&quot; through the three-dimensional bioprinting. It allowed
      them to be controlled at a safe distance and not be exposed to dangerous environmental
      influences.<br><br>The CyberCorp corporation has invented an improved approach
      to the use of the shell with the ability to partially copy the consciousness
      of people in it. But she could only perform specific tasks, went crazy over
      time and became dangerous because of the simplified model of consciousness.<br><br>As
      a result shells were used only for combat operations as CyberCorp agents in
      corporate wars for power in the world. You take on the role of a corporation
      agent which will plunge into endless conflicts with enemy corporations of the
      future!<br><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Cyberpunk atmosphere<br></li><li>Online
