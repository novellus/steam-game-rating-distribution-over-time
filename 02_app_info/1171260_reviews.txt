The graphics are nice and add to the eerie feeling while playing. The game is really short though 20-40 minutes depending on if you explore the areas thoroughly. Getting both endings took me only 47 minutes.","timestamp_created":1609300274,"timestamp_updated":1609300274,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwta3x2PYCf9DUvgI="}
