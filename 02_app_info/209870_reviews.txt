I played back in 2012-2014, when the competitive scene was booming and the game itself was great.This game has fallen and is no longer a game worth playing anymore. The developers have completely abandoned this game, and the only reason I would ever return is if the game is finally given to a company more willing to devote some type into making this game what it should have been. The current and past developers show that they don't care what so ever for the players of their game, and if there is one thing that is important in making a product its ensuring that the consumer enjoys the content. This game may be free to play but there are many more great free to play games that are much more enjoyable than this game. It really did have potential and the only thing I am hoping for is that a company can dust this game off and make it what I always hoped to be. The game itself had great game mechanics in it that other first person shooters didn't have at the time, although some do now, the game itself still to me has some potential to return to glory, but not with its current developers. For now I wouldn't recommend this game for the time being.","timestamp_created":1485223897,"timestamp_updated":1590062921,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ40tbIm/ICfNWtcA=="}
