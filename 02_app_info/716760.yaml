    review: "Dream Alone is a complete piece of trash and a horrible game, so what\u2019\
      s the story.\n\nA young boy\u2019s Village and his family contract a disease\
      \ that puts them into a coma, he hears of someone called Lady Death who can\
      \ save them. So he soon sets out to find her.\n\nNow for the likes, the some\
      \ of the music was okay and the background art was kind of nice looking. The\
      \ enemy designs were cool looking like the faceless spiders monsters and I do\
      \ like that at the start of a new chapter is told like a fairytale/story book\
      \ opening.\n\nNow for the dislikes and there is a lot to dislike about this\
      \ game. To start the story is very confusing, as I said at the start of a new\
      \ chapter its has a fairytale/storybook opening. \n\nBut the problem with it\
      \ is its very inconsistent and barely has anything to do with the boy\u2019\
      s story except for Lady Death, but it\u2019s just too confusing and has nothing\
      \ to do with the boy and his problem. \n\nThe Ending is also really bad and\
      \ confusing, [spoiler] basically when we get to lady death she says that we\
      \ have to get a box for her but we're never supposed to open it. but the boy\
      \ does open it and it turns out that his family is okay but then it turns out\
      \ he's not part of the family and he turns into some kind of demon thing, I\
      \ don't know the game doesn't even have narration to explain what the hell happened.\
      \ [/spoiler]\n\nthe game's graphics/picture is really bad, the game is black\
      \ and white normally that's actually not a problem but in this game it has this\
      \ very grainy look to it which can be hard to see sometimes and there's also\
      \ this weird dark filter thing where this darkness closes in and out like your\
      \ blinking and it got really, really annoying.\n\nThe gameplay can be very frustrating,\
      \ it's a simple side-scroller but what made it bad and very annoying was all\
      \ the damn traps in the game. There are tons of traps that kill you in one hit\
      \ and when you\u2019re trying to get past you have to be pinpoint accurate or\
      \ you die. There were so many of them that it almost made me quit the game.\n\
      \nThe game also has this power were you can switch between two different realities\
      \ but you see in other games that have this kind of mechanic, it can help you\
      \ solve puzzles or get past enemies. But in this game it's rarely used other\
      \ than revealing some platforms or hidden doors or showing a hidden lever sometimes\
      \ times, it doesn't make enemies disappear like in other reality altering games\
      \ and it\u2019s so rarely used you forget to use it until you\u2019re stuck,\n\
      It also requires power to use and if your power for drained you have to die\
      \ and collect the power ups to use it again. Sometimes the platforming can also\
      \ be a pain we're even though your close to the next platform you still miss\
      \ it and fall.\n\nThere's also bugs in the game now I don't know if this was\
      \ my computer or the game, but when I was at one part of the cave level my computer\
      \ kept going into power save mode and I had to unplug the cable to my computer\
      \ screen and plug it back in, I even checked if everything was okay, it was.\
      \ But it's still kept doing that, it did stop and I was able to beat level and\
      \ it didn't show up again, so I don't know if it was my computer or the game\
      \ itself. Just thought I'd mention it just in case it was the game. \n\nThe\
      \ level designs in the game are really bad sometimes the worst being the cave\
      \ level because of that bug I mentioned, the city level because there's a part\
      \ in the game were you go into this house and you have to hit all the levers\
      \ to unlock a door. \nbut it doesn't give an indication you have to hit four\
      \ levers then the one you see and if you die you have to start all the way back\
      \ to the beginning which can be a pain in the ass. And the Battlefield level\
      \ with all the damned explosive traps.\n\nAnd what really makes this game so\
      \ bad is the fact that it did have potential I mean given to a proper game developer\
      \ I'm sure it would have been a classic but as it is right now well it's just\
      \ garbage pure simple garbage.\n\nAll right then with all that said Dream Alone\
      \ is a complete piece of trash and a horrible game, its story is bad, its gameplay\
      \ is bad, its level designs are bad and even those I got this when it was on\
      \ sale I still feel ripped off. So never ever get this game not even if it's\
      \ on sale, not even if it was a gift."
