The humor and writing is still great but this DLC does nothing to alleviate the negatives of the main game unfortunately. A good example of a DLC to get on sale if tug-of-war is a game style you simply cannot get enough of but otherwise well worth skipping, much like the main game.","timestamp_created":1580345237,"timestamp_updated":1580345237,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.447341978549957275","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ44NP6+e8Ccrj/7gE="}
