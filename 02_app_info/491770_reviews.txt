But, you have to go online and verse real players for coins for new creatures and game money for customizations. The AI don't fight back in local play but still fun to play with friends.\n\nOnly get this game if you have family or friends that play it, I only play it because I have a sister who does, we help eachother out with the unlockables and steam achievements.\n\nThere are things wrong with this game however. Like said, in local play, the AI don't fight back and the game forces you to go online to unlock things. It takes forever to level up, also, you have to pay real money to get in-game money to unlock things. I wouldn't recommend getting this game if your playing it by yourself. Make sure that you have friends or family members that play it as well before getting this game.\n\n1/5\n\nGame Rating: PG (Mild themes and violence)\n\nGenre: Action\n\nRELEASE DATE: 21 Apr, 2017","timestamp_created":1502871352,"timestamp_updated":1590383983,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mbeRpfICc6LeggE="}
