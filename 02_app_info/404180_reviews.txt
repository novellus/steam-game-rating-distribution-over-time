This game is bad. The way it forces the character into situations and when you're given a 'choice' where the choice really doesn't follow along the way it logically would and instead forces you into reading more garbage. I wasted my money. None of the 'girls' are likable. They are just all annoying, the teacher especially. Would ask for a refund but past that point unfortunately.","timestamp_created":1602700219,"timestamp_updated":1602700219,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4p5KYlPUCepnvpwI="}
