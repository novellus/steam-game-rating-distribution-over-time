All of the beautiful handdrawn backgrounds contribute to a dark atmosphere and mystery. The game consist of many unique elements like a switchable fireball gun / laser switcher, time turning platforms, rotating / sequential lasers, floating ball shooting enemies, wall of death. There are 8 challenging levels which make you think, puzzle or run for your life or learn the deadly laser sequences and patterns. If you are an oldschool player I would give it a try anyways","timestamp_created":1586958198,"timestamp_updated":1586958375,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.627795755863189697","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4heOFv/ECc//9gAI="}
