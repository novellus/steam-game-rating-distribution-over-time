    review: 'Certainly an interesting story, although it feels too short in comparison
      to the plot it''s trying to tell.



      The art is quite unique and the music is fitting, the protagonist is nicely
      designed and the dialogue options are amusing. Although it seems like there''s
      one dialogue option at the start when you first talk to the escape artist; that
      seems to stick and not advance properly unless you just click on all three dialogue
      options.


      The story is pretty generic but is still genuine in its intentions, the writing
      is strong but is not brought to its full potential due to how short the game
      is. The whole story is very abrupt and feels like an abridged version of a relatively
      typical animated movie. The plot just doesn''t fit well into this small a time
      frame. The entire sequence about logic and fallacy doesn''t make much sense
      considering it doesn''t truly have anything to do with the story, it seems to
      be artificially injected in for the sake of trying to teach the player some
      kind of lesson.



      Overall while it was a nice little experience, it definitely is rough around
      the edges in the way it tells a generic magician story in a half hour; with
      this strange inclusion of a lesson on critical thinking. Would of much rather
      paid for a larger scale story that has been fully fleshed out and fits into
      itself, then this very confined and uncertain short story. Still interesting
      though to be sure, just this same concept would have been much more interesting
      and more natural in a larger format.'
