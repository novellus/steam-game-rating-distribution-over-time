The game screams 'I am beautiful' at you, which it surely is, as long as you just look at the landscape and the overall constellations. The close up graphic details on the other hand are bad and outdated. I mean, this is a small Indie studio. They for sure didn't have a large budget, but it still is a bit weird for a game that focusses on aesthetics so much and clearly wants to be beautiful.\nThe puzzles fit in the overall atmosphere but I wouldn't recommend playing it as a puzzle game. Therefore the puzzle mechnics are way to easy and boring. The game offers basically the most standart puzzle minigames you've seen in a dozen of games before.\nApart from that the game is doing a good job. I really liked the changing atmosphere, the story, the artstyle of the story sequences and the way of telling it without the use of language.\nI think the best way to play Aporia is as a pretty and very atmospheric walking simulator with a nice stoy.\nYou'll for sure have a good time then.","timestamp_created":1609778614,"timestamp_updated":1609778614,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw74mS5/YCeqy4wAI="}
