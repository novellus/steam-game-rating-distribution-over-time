Recruiting them brings them into your squad and they follow you throuigh the game fighting the enemy with you.\nThey also each have a special skill.\n\nThe levels themselves are procedurally generated and although not very varied are fairly challenging.\nEach level has a boss towards the end, the ones I've faced so far haven't been that tough.\n\nOnce you die, you return to your base where you can upgrade skills, recruits and craft weapons with the money you've found playing the game.\n\nThe game does have a couple of bugs, If you leave the home level with a UI window open it stays open on the main game and you can't shoot until you close it.\nI also managed to crash the game by accidently entering the first dungeon with the bank UI open but I'm, sure the developer will look into these minor bugs.\n\nAll in all, a fun game only really brought down by the graphics. 8/10. well worth the price.","timestamp_created":1541622644,"timestamp_updated":1541622644,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.616888165473937988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw0tf39+YCc+ulrgE="}
