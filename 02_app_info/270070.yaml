    review: "It's cute. I feels a lot like an old PS1 game both graphically and gameplay\
      \ wise. \nThe ending is a cliffhanger but not a very good one at that.\nThe\
      \ controls are hot garbage! OOB the stem controller doesn't work and i couldn't\
      \ get it working with my PS4 controller either. the Keyboard/mouse controls\
      \ aren't well laid or very intuitive. I spent the first 20 minutes tweaking\
      \ the control map on the steam controller and never got it working very well.\
      \ I ended up having to swap to the kb/mouse and back a few times for some segments.\
      \ \nOverall, it might be worth it if you get it on sale (like $3 or less). Gameplay\
      \ is ~1.5 hours unless you suck like i do and fight with the controls the whole\
      \ time. then expect it to to be a bit closer to 2.5 hours of game time"
