      /><br><br>Mage Math is a fantasy adventure game where kids fight monsters, use
      magic and practice math at the same time. The game has two parts to it. The
      first part is where you spend most of your time exploring levels, finding powerful
      Number Stones, fighting monsters, fulfilling quests, finding gold, leveling
      up and other fun things. The second part is how you get your magic by practicing
      math and using math videos inside the game to help you. This game is for kids
      from 1st grade up to 6th grade and great review for 7th graders.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1131210/extras/ThreeCharactersSmall.png?t=1569290430"
      /><br><br><strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Large Levels Allow For Fun Exploration</h2></strong><br>As
      you search for powerful magic number stones you will explore numerous areas
      that range from frozen lands to underwater and even lava filled lands. There
      is plenty to explore as your kids level up and find cool potions.  We are continually
      adding updates to the game, adding new quests, new spells and much more.<br><br><strong><h2
      class="bb_tag">Get Help Along The Way!</h2></strong><br>You will get magical
      dragons, mini monsters and even wizards to help you in your journey to save
      the Math Realms. These are just some of the many helpers you can get along the
      way. You might even be able to recruit monsters to aid you.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1131210/extras/Helpers.png?t=1569290430"
      /><br><br><strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Battle Epic Monsters!</h2></strong><br><img
      src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1131210/extras/water.gif?t=1569290430"
      /><br><br>As you play you will battle numerous monsters in an attempt to find
      what is causing chaos in the math realms. Your magic will grow stronger and
      new spells will be unlocked as you save the realms and find the Number Stones
      that could save us all.<br><br><strong><h2 class="bb_tag">Kids Feel Confident
      In Math</h2></strong><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1131210/extras/MathVideos3steam.png?t=1569290430"
      /><br><br>The goal of Mage Math is to help kids feel confident in math by removing
      the fear and anxiety that often accompanies math. As you play the game you will
      regenerate magic by answering math questions from grades 1st through 6th. Players
      are free to choose which grades they want to play in and are encouraged to master
      all topics in grades below theirs. This helps them build a firm foundation in
      math.  Our math videos that are used inside schools are now inside the game
      to help players feel confident answering new questions they may not be familiar
      with. Kids will watch how the math works and then answer similar questions covered
      in the video. The videos help take away a lot of pain and fear associated with
      math problems. <br><br>Your kids will LOVE this game! We are excited to see
      you start your journey to save the Math Realms.
