I got it for 90% off, so 1.99$. Its fun so far, though i have only done the first level. It seems to be a pretty buggy port, and i was only able to complete the balista shooting part by swapping controls around (mouse control worked here, where keyboard did not), the basic config did nothing to reload the balista.\n\nSo far seems to require using all of the characters provided, as each can do different things. Like the dwarf being able to crawl through tiny holes the minataur or centaur could not.","timestamp_created":1431801029,"timestamp_updated":1431801029,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":20,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.604385852813720703","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mLz/rs0CcrK/PA=="}
