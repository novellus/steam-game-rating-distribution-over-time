    review: '[h1]72 / 100[/h1]


      Not sure when Shoot ''Em Ups became Shmups (sounds more like ''Schmucks'' to
      me), but anyways perhaps the brevity is more appropriate for Procyon since it
      is very short at only 5 levels. For veteran Shoot ''Em Up players out there
      you might find Procyon less challenging than some of the brutal contenders currently
      on the market, but that''s not to say that it is not an enjoyable experience.


      Graphically, it looks sharp with high def effects & backdrops (no 8-bit look
      here) with sound effects & soundtrack holding strong too. Comes together very
      well. Controls are intuitive, allowing you to switch between your standard wide
      bullets to your concentrated beam weapon in an instant. The weapon & shield
      system implementation was one of the strong points for me. The weapons are linked
      into your shields and when combined offers a power-up damage to clear your path
      ahead. Beam weapon also arcs & bends which is a nice effect and allows you to
      still move around somewhat without loosing out on damaging your target.


      For those that don''t skip through the mini-story cutscenes there is also some
      humour to be had (worth watching through at least once).


      On the negative side, I did find the boss fights a bit average; not bad but
      not really exciting either. Also an online co-op mode would have been awesome
      so I could play with friends around the world. With the duality in the weapons
      I could see online co-op being a lot of fun! Also, as I said earlier the game
      is very short. The 5 levels took me about 30 mins to complete first time through
      (and that was watching the cut-scenes!). Thankfully there is replayablity with
      higher difficulty levels in Attrition (5 lives + 1 per level completed) & Survival
      (1 life only!) to conquer.


      For the price, overall quality & fun factor of this little title, this still
      gets a ''Thumbs Up'' from me.
