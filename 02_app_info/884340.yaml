    review: 'EDITED (See Old Review Below the new one):


      NEW REVIEW:

      I haven''t played this in a long time and I came back to see if it has had any
      updates but there''s nothing on the store page, Steam forums, or Discord to
      indicate any progress. It''s been slightly over a year since anything was heard
      from the developers so they''re either quietly working on this or they''ve abandoned
      it. I''m thinking the latter at this point.


      It''s a shame as this showed some great potential but with the devs not giving
      updates and messages from several people being ignored on Discord I can only
      assume that this is a dead game.


      I cannot recommend this given the current situation and I certainly hope the
      devs com back to it.



      OLD REVIEW:

      For clarification: I did receive a temporary free copy of the game for Beta
      Testing but that copy has since been revoked when the Beta Test ended and now
      I own a personally paid for copy.


      For those concerned about any Early Access products:

      *It''s very early days for this Early Access product but so far the developer
      team of two are very active on both the forums and Discord and are acknowledging
      bugs almost as fast as we can report them. It''s good to know that players are
      being paid attention to.


      *The team has been receptive of comments and suggestions from the community.


      *Despite the nature of team based games in this day and age I have yet to come
      across anybody toxic. I''ve played several games in co-op mode and those that
      do talk have been amazingly friendly. Only time will tell how this holds up
      but so fa it''s looking good.


      Pro''s:

      * An interesting take on the zombie survival genre where the devs aren''t enabling
      people with infinite stamina to do crazy parkour stunts to avoid  and attack
      zombies. At this time you can''t even jump which makes sense considering the
      equipment the playable characters are wearing.


      *Supplies are limited. You''re hand isn''t held with an over abundance of first
      aid kits and ammunition as they''re all limited. The only exception are the
      handguns you start out with as they have infinite ammo which I don''t agree
      with personally.


      *The "Find Lobby" function works when there''s another person hosting and most
      of the time there''s almost no problem joining a game. At the moment the game
      will only find hosted games that haven''t started yet and the community has
      made the suggestion to the devs to make it so we can join games already in progress.


      * Since Beta Testing there have been almost daily updates to fix reported issues.
      The devs stated just recently that they''re going to limit the updates to one
      per day in order to reduce overall patching time.


      Pro / Con:

      *The maps are interesting in their concepts and have potential to look amazing
      but their appearances are basic and do need some work. At this time they look
      pretty basic, are way too dark for my own personal taste (could use more ambience
      lighting like table lamps, candles, emergency lighting etc), and in some placed
      feels way too open, even in the bedrooms of the mansion.


      !!HOWEVER!!

      That being said they do play very well, it''s still very early days and much
      can change. They have provided the basic necessities of playability to the levels
      very well and, at this time, that''s more important while they focus on removing
      bugs and adding more gameplay features.


      Cons:

      *For me the guns feel too close to the screen when aiming down the sites.


      *Reviving players isn''t made very clear but all you have to do is find the
      player, stand over them, and hold ''E''. But I must state that the devs are
      aware of this and are working on possible ideas to better highlight this.


      *There''s only one objective for all maps and that''s to gather supplies that
      are inexplicably scattered. It would be nice if the devs could make it so that
      the supplies are randomly placed around the map but that could, maybe, come
      up in future updates and provide variety in gameplay experience.


      Summary:

      I normally try not to be brutal on any Early Access products that have only
      just been released and there''s a lot of room for both community feedback and
      potential from the devs on any EA product.


      I''ve played far worse "Day Zero" Early Access games and had my money refunded
      as they were clearly cash grabs.


      This isn''t one of them and I certainly wish the devs well.'
