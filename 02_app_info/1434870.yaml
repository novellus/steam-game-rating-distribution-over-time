      notes: "Some of Oswald's dialogue can lead to a monologue on human/robot sex.\
        \  It's handled in a straightforward/educational/theoretical way, and is not\
        \ meant to be \"lewd.\"  But nonetheless, it is there.  Also, one of the endings\
        \ can be seen as (without spoiling anything) sudden and disturbing.  Kids\
        \ should most likely not be allowed to play.  \r\n"

      I hope the developer makes more things like this in the future.'
