      \ unlike other turn-based strategy games, Potemkin has the following groundbreaking\
      \ features:<br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> No Restrictions\
      \ on Customisation</h2>Have you ever had a book or movie, that you wanted to\
      \ make into a strategy game? Well now you can! Simply build an accurate map\
      \ of your universe and play! There are zero restrictions when it comes to map\
      \ customisation, play on a map of literally any size and with any number of\
      \ players, even hundreds!<br></li><li> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Sharing Maps is\
      \ as easy as Copy-Paste</h2>  <br>Share your maps with the world simply by copy-pasting\
      \ them onto Reddit. The best maps are upvoted, refined and played by the entire\
      \ Potemkin community! Not only that, but you can play on all the maps other\
      \ people upload, meaning there will never ever be a content drought!<br></li><li>\
      \ <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Simulate any Real or Fictional War</h2> If you ever get\
      \ tired of playing, just make the computer play for you! The games war simulator\
      \ lets you simulate literally any real or fictitious conflict you can imagine!\
      \ Have you ever wanted to simulate what would happen if Mexico invaded the US?\
      \ Or simulate an alternate WW2 scenario where Brazil is an Axis power? Well\
      \ now you can!<br> Simply build the map, and launch the simulation!<br></li><li>\
      \ <h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Immensely Powerful Artificial Intelligence</h2>  <br>Potemkin's\
      \ AI is made to be extremely flexible and to work on every type of map! Not\
      \ only that, but unlike most other games, Potemkin's AI does not rely on advantages\
      \ from the algorithm to be challenging. This game's AI is smart enough to beat\

      \ was custom built in Python, a programming language usually used for scientific\
