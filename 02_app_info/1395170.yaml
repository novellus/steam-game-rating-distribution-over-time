    review: 'The game requires a controller, which is fine, but no way to remap the
      keys. I understand that devs don''t want to do any extra work on these multi-platform
      releases, but I''m not really interested in doing the work for them to work-around.
      Always an instant refund.


      A minor gripe was not being able to skip the boss dialogue. You may enjoy this
      game but absolutely wasn''t worth my time.'
