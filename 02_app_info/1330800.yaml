    review: "TLDR: If you like indies, play this game. Its story and atmosphere are\
      \ well worth a few hours of your time.\n\nThis is not a full size game. It was\
      \ created by a small group of students on no budget, and it shows. However,\
      \ for that size and scope, it is impressively complete. I greatly enjoyed the\
      \ couple hours I spent playing.\n\nNarrative:\nThe writing is very strong. The\
      \ mystery is intriguing, the characters are likable and complex, and the story\
      \ is well constructed. There are several emotionally impactful story beats;\
      \ at various points I felt shock, anger, suspense, horror, compassion, etc.\
      \ I enjoyed the prevailing theme of identity, trust, and how our experiences\
      \ shape who we are. Also, LGBT rep is a plus!\n\nDesign:\nThe use of information\
      \ as a consumable resource is an interesting mechanic that reinforces the themes\
      \ of the narrative. \nThere are multiple paths through the story depending on\
      \ what you say to which characters. Not all the content can be seen in one playthrough.\
      \ It is worthwhile to replay the game to try other solutions, get to know different\
      \ characters, and investigate previously unanswered questions.\n\n"
