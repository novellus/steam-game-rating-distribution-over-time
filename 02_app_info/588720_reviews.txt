It looks old and ugly. \n\nThe worst part about this app is the fact that I can't completely maximize it. When I press on the maximize button, then it only goes to about 25% of my screen and doesn't completely maximize.\n\nMy Steam hours also doesn't count for this game. I've spent about 5 hours on this app already, but Steam says I've only been on it for about 5 minutes so far. For some reason Steam doesn't see that I'm running the app.","timestamp_created":1562173162,"timestamp_updated":1562173162,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":16,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.626436769962310791","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwodix3OsCdPvSywE="}
