The bosses are really easy if you know what you're doing. The difficulty here is catching all backpacks and all survival routes. I think you can avoid the hardest stage in survival (54), so it's fine.\n\nThe music is OK, good thing that you unlock the older musics, the new ones are good but not exceptional.\nGood game, but if you completed both first and Shun, this one won't surprise you.\n\n","timestamp_created":1609437563,"timestamp_updated":1609437563,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h4n93PYCftGVvwI="}
