[u]push[/u] unlocks in the first world, self-explanatory, but it's important that crates can be pushed diagonally as well. [u]freeze[/u] is next, spells can ricochet off frozen surfaces, but lava blocks can't be frozen. then there's [u]fire[/u] to unfreeze or destroy objects, including lava blocks. and finally, [u]energy[/u] to activate or deactivate pistons that raise or lower blocks on top of them. they can be frozen but not destroyed.\n\nseparate volume sliders are available, windowed mode with a resizable window as well. [b]the graphics are great (I like voxels), the music is excellent[/b] (especially on the ice levels), but the writing is a bit awkward, what little there is.\n\nit's really cheap and fun, there are even some general hints from the wizard if you're not using a spell right, but I still got stuck before reaching the halfway point. everything was going fine, then suddenly [b]ice mountain 12[/b] is somehow a huge spike in difficulty, as well as the last level in that pack, and the second half also has plenty of challenges.\n\n[b]I definitely recommend getting it[/b], but it'd be even better with undo, on-screen goals, a few more hotkeys, a line to see where the spell will go without wasting a shot, more than one level unlocked at a time, and a bit faster walking speed.","timestamp_created":1584234270,"timestamp_updated":1604891345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":19,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.650077521800994873","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4htC+1fUCdLCW+AE="}
