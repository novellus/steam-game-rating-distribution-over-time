No matter how big or useful it is, especially in this day of internet guides. I could tell you to get it on sale (there were -90% sales in the past) but on GoG you get this for FREE as part of the Epic Edition. As such it seems like a cash grab here on Steam so just get it somewhere else if you want it.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this DLC review you can find more in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]","timestamp_created":1494659035,"timestamp_updated":1500524991,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.648842811584472656","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ocqQr90CdYX/eA=="}
