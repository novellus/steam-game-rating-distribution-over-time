    review: "Inicialmente eu nao tinha entendido a pegada do jogo, mas logo consegui\
      \ come\xE7ar a compreender. O jogo \xE9 simples e muito bem feito, os pixels\
      \ sao muito fofos e a musica \xE9 estimulante. Tem muito a melhorar ainda, vou\
      \ com certeza continuar jogando pois adorei mas acho que falta muita coisa pra\
      \ realmente ser \"agrad\xE1vel\". O ceifador do nada aparece e ele \xE9 muito\
      \ mais rapido do que o fantasminha, levando o game over rapidamente. Se afastar\
      \ do seu corpo perde muita vida, quase nao d\xE1 pra explorar o mapa, e nao\
      \ mostra oque cada objeto faz. Para ser um jogo em desenvolvimento, \xE9 realmente\
      \ muito bom."
