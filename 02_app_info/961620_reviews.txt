Amiga or Mega Drive versions, they are both great in their own ways. This sadly uses a lot of elements of the DOS version, which isn't quite as good. Along with some visual changes, the sound is pretty atrocious and the music just seems to pop in whenever it feels like it. Sound effects are ear grating at times too. \n\nSpecific to this \"remastered\" version; achievements don't always trigger when they should, some locales seem as if they've had a portion cut off the side of the screen and some floors can be fallen through, despite there not being holes there in any other release. I found that using the  'shift' key, while executing my Steam overlay shortcut to check achievements, caused the action button to stop working too. Pressing it shift a second time caused it to work again. What a peculiar bug!\n\nIt's not exactly the best display of a game that is probably in my top 10 of all time, so I just can't recommend it in this state unfortunately. Go try the original Mega Drive or the Amiga versions instead if you can, as it really is a brilliant game.","timestamp_created":1609970903,"timestamp_updated":1609971077,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+KHw7PYCfeePwQI="}
