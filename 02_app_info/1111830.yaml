      notes: "This game contains graphic violence, as events depicted in this game\
        \ are based on real historical law & punishment in 16th Century Europe. As\
        \ such, it also contains verbal descriptions of crimes which some may find\
        \ disturbing or anxiety-provoking.\r\n\r\nVirtual reality (VR) is an immersive\
        \ experience that can be intense. Certain risks may include, but are not limited\
        \ to, injury resulting from malfunction of the equipment, motion sickness,\
        \ nausea, dizziness, seizures, disorientation, loss of balance, tripping,\
        \ falling, and post-traumatic stress disorder responses. VR is a new technology\
        \ and there may be additional unknown and nonobvious risk associated with\
        \ VR technology. Participation is at your own risk."
