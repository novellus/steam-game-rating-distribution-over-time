We're actually upping the speed and adding a sprint ability in the next content update so that should take care of the movement issues. As far as bugs go, would be willing to send us a list of the bugs you experienced? Most people email them to support@seacreaturesandwich.com, but you can feel free to post here as well. Once we know what bugs you're having we can address them ASAP. Thanks in advance for your time. :)"}],"cursor":"AoJ4quzygukCf8WmuwE="}
