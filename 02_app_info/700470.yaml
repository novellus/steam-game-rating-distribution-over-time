    review: Selenophobia is an incomplete game.  Perhaps the project has been dropped
      and will stay this way who knows.  Aside from that information the game has
      incredible potential.  The RPG battle system is turn based and very indepth.  Characters
      have at least 2 styles to choose from to change their builds/strats and it affects
      the types of damage/elements to can deal.  The item system is really restricted.  A
      character must equip an item such as potion to take into combat as you cannot
      just use an item command to access your 99x potions from any players.  No item/revive
      spamming!  Characters are likeable and nuisance at the same time, story is a
      mystery thriller as well.  Again the game has AMAZING potential and its worth
      to try since its only a couple of bucks especially if you like more advanced/innovative
      rpg combat mechanics.  10/10 for me even though game is incomplete!  Hopefully
      we get a full version, and if you do decide to pick it up I hope that you enjoy
      the game as much as I did
