We would like to note that the game is in early access stage and we are open to feedback, would you be willing to work with us to improve the game with the aim to give you a good experience?\n \nAdditional note:,The game is currently listed as LAN multi player so that feature can be expected. When going sown slopes the players movement is restricted on purpose to carry on sliding down the slope.\n\nCan you provide improvement suggestions, e.g.:\n-Improve the controls, e.g. provide sensitivity sliders? \n-Change  slope movement?\n-Change Multi player features, over internet?\n\nThanks in advance and hope to hear from you soon."}],"cursor":"AoJ466CFn+8Cf8e35gE="}
