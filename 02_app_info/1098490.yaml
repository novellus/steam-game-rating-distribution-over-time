    about_the_game: (DLC is required for VR compatibility)<br><br>With photos and
      memories from a few years ago, I set out to achieve a detailed, realistically
      designed recreation of the renowned Japanese shrine, Fushimi Inari Taisha. I
      feel like the real place has a very culturally unique significance, I personally
      had a great time exploring it a few years ago. I've designed this environment
      to be experienced from a first person perspective, with the aim of allowing
      the player to be immersed in the same kind of atmosphere as the real place.<br><br><img

      /><br>(Engine / Photo Comparison)<br><br>The map is very extensive to explore
      with shrine gates laid out over the entire mountainside. I've tried to include
      a lot of variance in different parts of the mountain, with lots of points of
      interest to discover and many branching/intertwining paths to encourage you
      to make choices with your exploration. Take photos with the in-game camera,
      customize the soundtrack, walk around at your own pace. Your attentiveness and
      eagerness to explore will be rewarded with access to hidden areas, areas that
      will be easily missed by a rushed player.<br><br>I hope you are able to dive
      into this game without much context and just enjoy being immersed in the world.
      Thanks for playing and for your support !

    review: "A walking simulator with a famous site. Gives a glimpse on Fushimi Inari\
      \ Shrine site.\nNeed to adapt to walking part with knuckles a little bit, but\
      \ it works. (great danger of motion sickness, because orientation is rasterized\
      \ only, strange standard motion settings, not smoth enough. But hey, it\xB4\
      s impressive. (The VR version tested) \nVideo shows much better resolution than\
      \ standard VR environment, be carefull. I judge on, because PIMAX 5K+ shows\
      \ enough details for comparison."
