That's the core of Sam and Max's story. It is a journey of nonsensical discovery, a story of hijinks and humour that, as dumb and childish as it might be, is still funnier than it has any right to be.[/b] \n\n[h1]First Rundown[/h1]\n[b]Sam & Max - Hit the Road[/b] is a 1993 LucasArts point-and-click adventure. Based on the 1987 comic book franchise, the game follows a pair of anthropomorphic, vigilante/private investigators of New York City in their crazy paranormal investigations all around the USA. Although it may look like a cartoon, it's most definitely not designed for kids. Max, a psychopathic little fur ball of a rabbit, and the more sensible canine shamus dressed in a suit named Sam are an odd couple. Even today (I still have the floppy disks somewhere in my basement), this classic stands as an enduring testament to adventure gaming's finest and funniest hours.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2352503121\n[h1]\nIn Deep\n[/h1]\n[quote]\n[list]\n[*][h2][b]Story[/b][/h2]\n◼️ [b]Writing[/b] \nA bizarre but amusing adventure across North America in which the detectives must solve the mystery of a runaway carnival bigfoot. Their quest is continuously opposed by the evil schemes of a famous country-western singer that wants the creature for his business. Between a rescue mission and a manhunt, Sam and Max discover that nothing is as it appears. The story is a rollercoaster of totally hilarious and nonsensical situations, which parodies American culture. It offers a marvellously funny mystery, a cast of memorable characters. There are also lots of references to politics, films, celebrities and 80s pop culture in general. Some of them too old for us to catch, but still funny.\n◼️ [b]Characters and dialogues[/b] \nThere are many visual jokes, but the backbone of the game is in its dialogues. The humour strongly relies on verbal acrobatics, on the use of polysyllabic words, old English and other such oddities.\n\n[*][h2][b]Gameplay[/b][/h2]\n◼️ [b]How it plays and nice features[/b] \nUI interface includes five basic commands (walk, examine, take, use, talk to) that the player can change by pressing right-click. In the game, the player controls Sam while Max follows him by entertaining himself by doing stupid stuff in the background. Essentially most of the time the interactions are made within Sam and the items collected and stored in the inventory. Those can be used to combine the junk gathered and this feature is often used to create the most strange solutions to enigmas. Occasionally, Max can perform special actions to characters or objects. By getting new clues and progress with the plot, new icons will appear on the map. That allows Sam and Max to continue the manhunt across the States. In some areas can be found several independent subgames to play, most are useful to get story items, some are just for fun.\n◼️ [b]Overall difficulty[/b] \nThe puzzles consist mostly of object-based problems, some are so illogical to the point of being surreal, making them hard nuts to crack. Over the playthrough, you are free (and encouraged) to try out all the craziest actions until you find a solution that works. I can’t lie. My memory is not as good as it used to be, and I got stuck two times during my play. Looking online for a tip is not an unforgivable sin, who didn’t check the solution on pc magazines in the golden years?\n\n[*][h2][b]Graphics[/b][/h2]\n◼️ [b]Art Design[/b] \nMade by splendid graphics and with a cheesy colourful cartoon style atmosphere. The backgrounds and the characters are gorgeously drawn and beautifully sketched in 256 colours, with many wacky palettes and details to study. A few scenes also include 3D rendered elements which blend in surprisingly well (like UFOs and helicopters).\nLevel design is memorable, Sam and Max's investigations will take them to interesting roadside attractions (or better the satirical version of the real ones) such as the world's largest ball of twine or Mt. Rushmore (where you can bungee jump from a president's nose), several highway stations, a Twilight Zone park and the alligator-infested marshy south.\n\n[*][h2][b]Audio[/b][/h2]\n◼️ [b]Music and effects[/b] \nThe old jazz music is well scored and pleasurable to listen to. You'll also hear blues, some tribal and medieval themes, surfer rock and lots of country tunes.\n◼️ [b]Voice acting[/b]\nThe voice-acting is incredibly high quality and the crazy dynamic duo of detectives have very fitting voices that add to the comical lead's wisecracking attitude.\n\n[*][h2][b]Extra[/b][/h2]\n◼️ [b]Replayability[/b] \nWhen I bought the game, I was probably just having a fit of nostalgia. That’s the main reason to replay this title after all those years. If you are new to the genre, I can’t recommend it as a starting point. \n◼️ [b]Game length[/b]\nI finished the game in around six hours but it wasn’t my first playthrough.\n[/list] \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2352505164\n[/quote]\n\n[h1]\nBugs and Issues\n[/h1]\n[quote]\n◼️ Not a single game-breaking bug but some glitch between voice tracks and subtitles.\n◼️ Most of the puzzles are completely illogical, you can solve them by trial and error.\n◼️ Like the majority of Lucasarts point-and-click adventure games, it is developed and uses the SCUM system. To open menus you need to press F5. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2352505569\n[/quote]\n\n[h1][b]JUDGEMENT[/b][/h1][quote]\n[b]Sam & Max - Hit the Road is a classic cult point-and-click adventure game, definitely one of the funniest games I've ever played. However, it’s not the best choice as a starting point for new players to the genre. If you just enjoy the cartoonish adventures, you’ll get a kick out of it, but the first approach to the investigation is infuriating, to say the least.[/b]\n[/quote]","timestamp_created":1610131234,"timestamp_updated":1610131438,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.623073697090148926","comment_count":1,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm//T8fYCdLLNwQI="}
