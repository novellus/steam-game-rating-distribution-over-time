What surrounds you are the walls of an ancient temple. Your only guides are mysterious shrines. Your only ally is a friendly robot - the suit support unit. You make your way out of the temple to find out that its builders have long been forgotten. Humans have settled over the ruins of the old empire. Fierce monsters roam across the land. Dangerous insects lurk in the shadows. Ancient rusty automatons keep digging towards the core of the world with the same relentless persistence they had on the day they were abandoned.
