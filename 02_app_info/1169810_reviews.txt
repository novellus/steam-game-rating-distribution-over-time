Some elements here, like the Hivory Towers and Dr. Quack, might confuse you a tad if you have not played the original Yooka-Laylee (which you totally should if you haven't yet, though I've 100-ed the game so I'm biased ^_^ ) . Otherwise though the artwork is lovely, the story and dialogue are irreverent and kooky and the novel itself is pretty hefty. You get a lot of bang for your buck here and as such, this comes highly recommended to any fellow YL fans . :)","timestamp_created":1574298008,"timestamp_updated":1574298008,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.63059699535369873","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnKfexe4Cd4vJ2wE="}
