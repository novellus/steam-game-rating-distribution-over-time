This is very likely a problem with an update. You are most likely missing the mapping of inputs in one of the files. Please check the file \nBasketball Madness\\BasketballFruits\\Config\\SteamVRBindings\\knuckles.json and whether it has the necessary inputs mapped inside, such as \"GrabRight\", \"BallSpawnRight\" in the lines \"output\":\nIf it doesn't, the inputs won't be able to work. Please come back to us with the information so we may get the game working properly for you, and others who may have the same issue. \nThanks\n\nHello again!\nWe have been working hard on the game and have released a new update with updates to the game's optimization, smoother physics and a brand new level!\nWe urge you to get back into the game, and hope you see some of the old problems resolved. If you do, please consider changing the review, as it would mean a lot to us.\nHave fun shooting the hoops!"}],"cursor":"AoJ4q97znfYCcMP9qwI="}
