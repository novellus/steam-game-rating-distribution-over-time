There are several other better alternatives that you can get for the same price, or even cheaper, such as CPS or SAI.\nThe program lags a lot and tends to freeze.\nThe brushes were not that impressive.\n\nI tested some of the brushes and here is my opinion on it:\n- The \"paint\" brush is mediocre, it does not blend well with colors.\n- The \"airbrush\" does not have a good feel to it, it looked like a lot of low opacity circles rather than an airbrush.\n- The \"pen\" the only OK tool (in my opinion).\n- The \"pencil\" is it a pencil? It is a lot of dots lined up together when looked upon closer inspection.\n\nNot worth the price.","timestamp_created":1609521741,"timestamp_updated":1609521741,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zJe+3/YCec+6vwI="}
