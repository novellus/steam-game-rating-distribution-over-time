    review: unfortunately the game is either made really badly, or broken right now,
      cause every time i die, it starts doing this like "hey im a spirit telling you
      that you were too weak and clearly explaining that youll get better with subsequent
      deaths etc" and then while that spirits cutscene talking to you, it kicks you
      back to the main menu where your save will be gone and youll have nothing lol,
      game looks like it could potentially be fun but as it stands theres no point
