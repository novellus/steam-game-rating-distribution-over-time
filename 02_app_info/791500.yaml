    review: Mahjong is one of the most difficult games ive ever tried to learn, and
      its very hard for a newcomer for both myself and friends. While Mahjong Riichi
      is very simplistic from a game design point (i mean this in a good way), what
      it has is a very user friendly interface and it also has a really helpful easy
      to understand tutorial. I was able to learn how to play the game quickly and
      i was able to get my friends into it as well. I even went out and bought a real
      Japanese set in real life, this steam game version is definitely a great way
      to get into Mahjong.
