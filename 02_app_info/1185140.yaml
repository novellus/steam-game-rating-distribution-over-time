    about_the_game: '<u><strong>Overview</strong></u><br><br>Step into the shoes of
      Samantha Cooper, a young treasure hunter who lives for adventure.  Her current
      passion is scouring the globe for lost artifacts.  But unlike most it''s not
      for the money it''s the sheer challenge of the task.  Her world  gets turned
      upside down when her father goes missing and is named the primary suspect in
      a murder investigation.  Samantha is determined to rescue him and clear his
      name.  But things get complicated in a hurry.<br><br><strong>DEMO NOTE</strong><br>FYI:
      If you decide to try to demo it''s actually chapter one of the game. Be aware
      the plot does not really start until chapter two.  Chapter one is action oriented
      and will take 45 minutes or so if you decide to play out the whole chapter.  Hopefully
      it''s not too difficult, yet still fun for causal players.  It should help you
      determine if the game installs and plays okay on your equipment and give you
      a look at the game basics.  As an indie developer I''d appreciate feedback at
