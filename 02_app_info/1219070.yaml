    about_the_game: "HexiHashi is a minimalistic puzzle game based on the classic\
      \ puzzle &quot;Hashiwokakero.&quot;   You are presented with a field of nodes,\
      \ each having a number.  Nodes may be connected to each other along gridlines\
      \ with either single or double bridges.  A puzzle is complete when all nodes\
      \ are connected, and the number of bridges connected to each node is equal to\
      \ the number indicated on that node.  HexiHashi is a fresh and original take\
      \ on this classic puzzle.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhereas classic Hashi is played\
      \ on a rectangular grid, HexiHashi is played on a triangular grid.  A game of\
      \ classic Hashi can be solved nearly completely using deductive reasoning, with\
      \ normally only one or two moves per game requiring an intuitive guess.  In\
      \ HexiHashi, because each node has six possible connections instead of four,\
      \ pure deduction will normally solve less than 10% of a puzzle (even small ones).\
      \  As a result, gameplay focuses more on inuitive heuristics, testing hypotheses,\
      \ backtracking, and tweaking of solutions.  One puzzle in HexiHashi may have\
      \ more than one acceptable solution, but our puzzle generation algorithm guarantees\
      \ that every puzzle is solvable.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFeatures: <br />\r\n-\
      \ Beautiful piano score by the inimitable Steve McRae<br />\r\n- Dynamic sound\
      \ effects which harmonize with the background music<br />\r\n- Puzzle Generation\
      \ Algorithm providing endless replayability<br />\r\n- Time Attack, Move Master,\
      \ and Endless modes<br />\r\n- Cool-looking Hint system<br />\r\n- Levelling\
      \ System <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHexiHashi will scratch the puzzle-itch of any avid\
      \ puzzler.  Buy it for yourself! Buy it for a friend!  Buy it for a friend's\
      \ dog!  Buy two copies!  C'mon, it's only three bucks. (American)."
