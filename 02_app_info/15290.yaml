    review: 'DO NOT !!!  buy this game and DO NOT blame UBISOFT for it.

      Ubisoft makes great games but were limited thanx to ABC limited story, no suspense,
      boring caracters... limited everything pretty mutch makes LOST a disapointment.

      However you do get your 8 hours, if thats what you paid for.

      3/10'
