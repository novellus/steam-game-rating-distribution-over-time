The camera is horrible, the gameplay is undefined, there's ZERO tutorial, no story that I can find.\n\nThat being said, this game has potential, I hope the developer keeps working on it. I hope he adds new features, polishes what's there AND fixes the camera.\n\n","timestamp_created":1596668022,"timestamp_updated":1596668022,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwz5G14PMCfonVmQI="}
