      \ I gave this recommendation because the core idea of this game is really good.\
      \ But you really need to focus on the differences between a GAME and a SOFTWARE.\
      \ A good simulation game means you can play even you don't know any knowledge\
      \ about the simulated theme. Hope you can do better on your next \"game.\""
