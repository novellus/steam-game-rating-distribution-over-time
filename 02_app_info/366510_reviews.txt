But it feels like someone gave up halfway through making it. It is quite basic and short as far as classic dungeon crawlers go - which is not necessarily a bad thing in itself - when making a game it's important to chose a manageable scope - but here you can feel like there were intended features and untapped potential that ended up just scrapped. I would prefer to give it a 'meh' rating than thumbs down, but when compared to its genre peers, it's just not good enough.\n\nThere are 15 levels in 5 visual styles and 11 enemy types in total (including final boss) and 5 of them are just slightly different variants of skeletons. There are just two spell mechanics - damage and damage with a chance to stop enemy for a bit, different elemental types differ just pretty much by graphics. My playthrough was 13 hours, but if you don't backtrack  to shop to sell every piece of junk and loiter around as a mage waiting for your mana to regenerate, I guess the game can be completed in about 6 or 7.\n\nWhile first half of the game feels nice, with its wintery setting, nice ambient sounds and interesting dungeons, the second half is clearly rushed - maps become uninspired, ideas blatantly recycled and gameplay unengaging. The whole last level can be bypassed by going straight to the final boss. Game ends before you're able to unlock about 1/3 of the remaining skills and spells.\n\nIt's a bugged game to be sure. There are occasional flickering overlaying textures, poison and fire bolts don't register hits at all, wearing items increasing your stats don't seem to affect your hp or mana, etc. It is also extremely clunky - especially in the UI department. You can't attack a monster by clicking it, you have to push button. There is no dedicated key for magic, you gotta cycle through melee and ranged weapons. You can't bind space, tab, alt or ctrl as keys, there is no drag and drop or any way to move items in your inventory. You can't even drop an item except on a pressure plate or a receptacle.\n\nStory is almost non existent - you're a champion of your people selected to retrieve an artifact from the maze - but for some reason your people sent you there literally naked and unarmed. There is only one NPC, which also serves as a shop, and the writing is... ugh. Lazy - as everything you ask she doesn't remember or doesn't know. And it shows that English wasn't the author's native language.\n\nThe worst aspect of the game however is its RPG system - balance is virtually absent and I don't think anyone testing it bothered to play the game as anything other than a melee character. For example, there is a whole branch of poison spells and skills, while literally half of the enemy types are immune to poison, and nearly all the rest are resistant to it. There is just one enemy that isn't, and it's like 5% of entire monster population. On the other hand, poison effect applied to player is ridiculously strong even on the easiest difficulty and about half of monsters and traps you face can apply it to you. Perhaps it was a desperate attempt at adding some difficulty, because otherwise almost non-existent ai of enemies can be easily exploited by just stepping in and out of the square in front of them. But sometimes game chooses to pin you down in tight corridor with several tanky poisoning enemies, and you just can't survive it, even if you're chugging potions like a college frat boy during a keg party. Mage build is almost non-viable because mana depletes very fast and there is a pointless system of spell slots that requires you to dump literally all the stat points you can earn during the entire game into INT to unlock them all just right before the end. 'Ranger' build however is just literally impossible because of the price of arrows. Game gives you enough of them to kill maybe one enemy in a level, there is no way to retrieve projectiles fired, and they are prohibitively expensive. Other ranged weapons are so heavy that carrying a stack of 9 of them makes you literally crawl at a snail pace, and again - it's barely enough to kill one enemy. Oh, and on the top of that if you happen to use a crossbow, magic bolts just pass through enemies without registering hits, a bug that has not been addressed since 2015.\n\nOverall, if you like this kind of games and you need your next fix after playing Grimrocks or Fall of the Dungeon Guardians, Ruzar may scratch your itch for exploring smelly dungeons and hunting hidden switches. Perhaps its clunkiness can entertain you for a while, but better set your expectations low for this Unity based title.
