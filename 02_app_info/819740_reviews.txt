For all that though the graphics are quite visually pleasing, and the game itself is a fun way to challenge your reflexes and thinking for a while.\n\nI also wish there was a \"mixed\" option to the yes/no recommendations because that's basically my view - YMMV for each person. I chose \"No\" only because I feel the control sensitivity might be a dealbreaker for some people.","timestamp_created":1595182336,"timestamp_updated":1595182336,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwgNmRtPMCdPaplgI="}
