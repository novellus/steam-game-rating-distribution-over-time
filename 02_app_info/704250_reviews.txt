There's probably another 20 past either town, to the next sidings. The rolling stock is worth it though, You get 3 of the most detailed engines in the game, a full Amtrak train, and a TON of freight cars including boxcars in 3 livers(Brown, Blue, and Yellow w/ black door), coal cars, gondolas, centerbeams and bulkheads, and a 5-car spine set with different loads for each car. Worth the cost overall, and espcecily on a sale, as I got it for. I would recommend this route, it's a good deal overall.","timestamp_created":1606927390,"timestamp_updated":1606927390,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw08KVkvYCdtbltgI="}
