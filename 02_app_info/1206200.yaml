    review: "Ok Funcom, you can do better than this!  *Yawn* is the one word I was\
      \ use to describe Isle of Siptah.  It has a nice map but that\u2019s about it.\
      \  Little to no content, as a new character, everything kills you.  There is\
      \ no Low/Med/High Engagements, so starting off is a bit tough, it lacks the\
      \ flow of Conan Exiles.  There is one NPC Camp and it\u2019s a sleep fest, can\u2019\
      t kill or capture anyone there.  There are no NPC camps to be found, no little\
      \ XP/Level Dungeons, it\u2019s feels like this was rushed into service and is\
      \ incomplete, which is sad because it has potential.  The Storms are a joke\
      \ and make most of the map unusable when in play.\n\nI hope Funcom is looking\
      \ at this and is planning a major overhaul, because after a few hours in this\
      \ game I am ready to head back to my Steam Library and find one of my other\
      \ games to play, Hell Conan Exiles as old as it is, is still a lot more fun\
      \ to play than this is.  \n\nSo in it's current state would I recommend it?\
      \  NO!\n\n**Side Note**  \nYou will see 0 hours played, it because this review\
      \ was done on my admin PC, if you check my profile you will see I have 2251.4\
      \ hours playing Conan.  Which is why I am sad at this current state of this\
      \ update."
