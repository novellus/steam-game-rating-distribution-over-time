    review: 'UPDATE: I was really frustrated when I wrote the initial review, so I
      think I came off much more harshly than intended. While the game is definitely
      not finished, it has potential. The basic building blocks of the game are all
      there; it just needs a story and some polishing. I''ve left the review as "not
      recommended" for now, since there are some serious issues with its current form,
      but I look forward to seeing the finished product.



      ORIGINAL: This game is obviously not finished. The controls are glitchy, the
      levels are poorly planned, there''s no story, new items and monsters are introduced
      with no explanation, and the only form of attack you''re given is some sort
      of freeze-trap which is basically useless. This game is artificially difficult
      and poorly made. However, if these were fixed, I''m sure the game would be good.'
