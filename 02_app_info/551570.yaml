    about_the_game: "Story:<br />\r\nOnce upon a time, there was an evil creature\
      \ who called himself Goblet of Death. He created an organization to control\
      \ the human world. He was planning to create a new world in which only his kind\
      \ would live in. No one could stop his evil plan, except for one man who used\
      \ a legendary sword to fight the evil. This man also had five legendary crystals,\
      \ each of them containing a nature element. After some time, the hero stopped\
      \ Goblet of Death and his organization with his bravery and powers, but there\
      \ was another source of power... a box with mysterious qualities. Goblet of\
      \ Death found this box and its key with newborn twins. The box's powers were\
      \ so strong that even they couldn\u2019t open it yet. Suddenly, this box and\
      \ the twins are kidnapped by an unknown one. Then, Goblet of Death sent his\
      \ Five Devils to retrieve the box and kill the brave swordsman. The Five Devils\
      \ managed to kill the swordsman and steal the Five Crystals, but, unfortunately,\
      \ they couldn\u2019t find the box and the twins.<br />\r\nWhere is the box?\
      \ Who was that swordsman? How will the newborn twins live after these events?\
      \ And what will Goblet of Death do?"

    review: "Things I liked about the game :\n \nSuch a great game and Journey and\
      \ long  complicated story it took about 9 hour from me to finish it, I am curious\
      \ about who took the box, I get mad about the fact that Sarab didn't met his\
      \ twin brother, I don't know how many chapters will take from you to finish\
      \ the whole story . \n-I liked fight effects they are really cool. \n-I like\
      \ characters arts.\n\n\nThings I disliked: \n- we hit a lot of obstacles when\
      \ walk, and I got stuck one time in one of cities I rest the game for it.\n\
      -more music is needed eventhough I forget about it while I am playing and the\
      \ game is designed well without music.\n-I didn't like most of sound effect\
      \ especially when leave the place or cave.\n-Monster art need more improvements.\
      \ \n-the game don't have enough animation.\n-the main menu art can be better\
      \ and changed depend where did you reach in the game.\n-the way of rising the\
      \ level of player \n-the environement can be improved too \n\nI enjoyed the\
      \ story and I am waiting to see the next chapter of the and with all new improvements.\n"
