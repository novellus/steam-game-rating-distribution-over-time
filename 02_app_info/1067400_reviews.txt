When you start the game, you are immediately greeted by terrible pixel-art with little-to-no shadows and amateurish dithering, dull voice-acting (at first, I have thought that the main character is voiced-over by a bot), and the messed up first location exit area (hard to click). The temptation to turn off the game at this point was truly excruciating; nevertheless, I had persisted. \n\nWe arrive to the station to find out that the protagonist is an artist working for the London Police Department. Among other things, a peculiar mini game happens where you have to sketch the con based on the witness' description - that neat engaging element is repeated multiple times throughout the game story ([spoiler]it is even incorporated into the best ending scenario - however, the whole plausibility of a riot-control robot from the mid-2050s not being able to distinguish between a drawing and a real-life person is nigh impossible (additionally, in that scene one can just walk out into the clear and run around the villain - nothing is going to happen, that just kills the tension!)[/spoiler]), which certainly helps the player to submerge into the plot. The rest of the locations are pretty generic for the not-so-distant future sci-fi, a blend between [b][i]Ghost In The Shell[/i][/b], [b][i]Blade Runner[/i][/b], and [b][i]Detroit: Become Human[/i][/b] - however, a few landscapes are truly gorgeous (like the city view in the hobo town). \n\nThe characters do their job but are not memorable, with the exception of Frank who is the only one graced with the decent voice acting. The story unwinds at a steady pace, the dialogues are not overwhelming, and the finale is fitting (and also has some groovy tune). More detective work (e.g. cross-referencing the data bits using the AI DB interface provided by the main character's smartphone) would be appreciated - alas, the investigatory content is disappointingly lacking. An occasional joke is brilliant, though, somewhat making up for it! Most importantly, the interactions required to progress the story further are logical, including from the game context's perspective ([spoiler]the only tedious bit was the pixel-hunting I had to do to find the CCTV near the gallery - the world detalization is not sufficient for such kind of activities[/spoiler]).\n\nThe game blesses you with the option to run towards the location's exit - a feature that more point-and-click adventure games should provide. However, some of the other technical decisions are a miss - there are not enough descriptions for the interactable objects, nor there are plenty of them in general. Additionally, the dialogue and item-hover boxes are the standard Unity ones along with the font used for them and they look unsightly and out of place.\n\nThere are a few plausibility issues here and there (e.g. the ability to access and interact with random devices at the police station via a terminal without entering any kind of password) - whilst they serve the plot, it is hard to overlook such shortcomings, as the game strives to be a cyberpunk-themed work: a genre in which the logics and believability of human-technology interaction are vital.\n\nTo summarise, it is an [i]OK[/i] game which would definitely benefit in its development from some more experienced creators. It is akin to a good daytime TV show - it is enjoyable but not quite there yet. Surely, I could have been doing something more productive or play a better video game, but I do not regret spending a few hours on this title - it was a pretty good time.\n\nI would recommend grabbing it on sale, especially if you are fond of point-and-click adventure games.","timestamp_created":1604773273,"timestamp_updated":1604773273,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ42pv80fUCcLX7rAI="}
