    review: '*******SPOILERS!!!!!!*********




      Lovely looking game, but ultimately I simply quit.  I found it frustratingly
      slow and the story very sad.  I don''t have a lot of time to spend gaming, so
      ultimately I went elsewhere.


      ( Who wants to spend spare time making themselves sad?  Your results may, of
      course, vary.)'
