    review: "I think my previous review was too dumb, so I deceide to rewrite it.\n\
      \nI like asteroids and it's one of my favorite games. It's a game about carefully\
      \ managing the ship's movements and shooting wisely to survive. I especially\
      \ like Asteroid deluxe which made the original more challenging and fast phased,\
      \ so I looked for something similar in steam store.\n\nThis game looked quite\
      \ promising on the store page as the game offered many colorful contents, but\
      \ once I bought and played it I was disappointed by the controls. For someone\
      \ who played Asteroids in Atari vault a lot, the rotating speed in this game\
      \ was so slow that it was beyond the acceptable level. Fortunately The developer\
      \ improved the controls, but there are still other bits I don't like :\n\n1.\
      \ I can't manually fire the bullets by tapping the button. one of the joys of\
      \ asteroids was rapidly fireing bullets at big asteroids to destroy them faster\
      \ and then carefully shooting bullets one by one to destroy small asteroids\
      \ around me. that kinds of joy doesn't exist here as I can't shoot faster than\
      \ it's automatic firing speed.\n\n2. lack of frequent saucer encounters. In\
      \ asteroids The saucers appeared in all levels. they fly from left to right\
      \ or vise versa and shoot the bullets. what make saucers special is that they\
      \ also can shoot and be destroyed by the asteroids. sometimes you can use asteroids\
      \ to take cover from the saucer shots, and you can keep many asteroids floating\
      \ around to make saucers harder to survive. Also the small saucers (or all saucers\
      \ in deluxe) calculate the player's movement and location and fire the bullet\
      \ based on it. so you must frequently move around to avoid their shots. In my\
      \ opinion saucers are what made asteroids really fun and addictive and I really\
      \ hate when asteroid clones don't have any saucers.\n\nwhile this game does\
      \ have saucer style enemy, It doesn't make frequent encounters to make the game\
      \ hot enough and there's no smaller varient that shoot the anticipated shot\
      \ at the player. \n\n3. Hard rocks mode. This mode plays quite different, The\
      \ screen isn't wrapped around and the player controls differently. problem is\
      \ that I can't understand the logic of the controls in this mode. At first glance\
      \ I thought the controls work like cinematronics' Rip Off or Armor Attack, where\
      \ movement direction is tied to the player's facing direction and can't move\
      \ to side by thrusting and rotating the ship around. however, it seems when\
      \ the player's movement is slower than the certain value suddenly the movement\
      \ direction isn't tied to the facing direction anymore. also the thrust speed\
      \ in this mode is way too fast that it's nearly uncontrollable, and rotating\
      \ the ship while moving in light speed decreses its speed which i can't understand\
      \ why. My assume is that the developer intentionally made the controls harder\
      \ for more challenge, but in my opinion it just feels broken and doesn't make\
      \ the gameplay more challenging but rather annoying.\n\nIt's not a bad game\
      \ by any means but definitely it's not my cup of tea.\n\n\nTo the developer,\
      \ I'm Sorry for writing the terrible, rude review before. I should have played\
      \ it more to decide I actually like it or not but I was too impatient and kept\
      \ complaining."
