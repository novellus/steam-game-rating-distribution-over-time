      \ /><br><br>Iron Danger is a tactical combat game with a unique time manipulation\

      \ Danger is its unique time control mechanic. You can rewind time for up to\

      \ /><br><br>The time manipulation allows us to combine real-time combat gameplay\
      \ with controls from more traditional, tactical turn-based combat games. This\
      \ gives tactical combat a puzzle-like element, as you can continuously keep\

      \ protection, shines in the middle of this world, surrounded by towns, sea lanes\
      \ and and woodlands under its protection.<br><br>But from the frozen north,\
      \ a witch queen is leading her army on a quest for vengeance against the lords\

    review: 'Iron Danger has an interesting battle mechanic where you can ''Rewind''
      your battles. In fact it''s essential. Unfortunately there is little else of
      note here. Sorry.


      If you find the game on sale and the battle mechanic interests you then it may
      be worth a purchase, but as much as I hate to put down a developers hard work,
      I recommend you do not pay full price for it.


      I enjoyed micro-managing and rewinding my two-warrior party during battles,
      but things rarely get more complex than dodging and counter-attacking or exploding
      barrels from a distance. I can see why they limited parties to two - it would
      be too much to micro-manage a larger group of warriors.


      Skills are the usual fire/ice/heal magic type stuff, the very linear story is
      mostly uninteresting and the dialogue isn''t great. Don''t expect to get a choice
      of responses, there is no branching conversation tree, you''re a passenger story-wise
      and I quite often found myself grinding my teeth at the heroines "Reluctant
      hero" shtick which went on for too long - I just didn''t feel invested in the
      character at all.


      The game is largely a series of missions strung together with two to three small
      maps per mission including a dungeon, there is little variety to the assets
      so each island/dungeon looks largely the same. There is no loot beyond picking
      up inflammable things you can throw at enemies.


      The game saves automatically between each map (There is no manual save here).
      At the end of each mission you may upgrade one skill for one hero in your party
      (The game decides who), there are no accumulated "Upgrade points" to spend.
      Upgrades are pretty much along the lines of ''Small fireball'', ''Bigger fireball'',
      ''Biggest fireball''. Fire does spread if you hit something inflammable which
      is a nice thing to factor into your battle tactics, but it''s not a new concept
      and there is an awful lot of inflammable foliage on an island and some tight
      enclosed spaces, so you do have to be extremely careful setting light to things.


      After each mission there might be a little dialogue to progress the story, then
      it''s on to the next mission/set of maps. Do not expect a world map, side quests,
      things to click on, conversations with NPC''s, loot, weapons and armour shops,
      deep conversation trees or other complex systems. They are not here.


      I will say that there''s the bare bones of something which could have been great
      given enough time, resource and budget. Unfortunately what we have is merely
      an OK diversion. Maybe if there''s an Iron Danger 2?


      Pros:

      * Interesting ''Rewind'' battle mechanic

      * Nice graphics

      * Nice music

      Cons:

      * The ''Rewind'' battle mechanic becomes repetitive

      * Complete absence of many of the systems I consider essential to an RPG/ARPG

      * No depth to the systems that are there

      * Uninspired skills and progression of those skills

      * Uninteresting linear story'
