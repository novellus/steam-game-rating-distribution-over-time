    review: 'They really should have named this one "The Agency of Anomalies: Backtracker''s
      Paradise".  There were countless times I had to backtrack 8-10 screens, then
      go forward 8-10 screens to get an object, then go back 8-10 screen to use that
      object, then go forward 8-10 screens again.  It''s as if they knew the game
      wouldn''t be long enough under normal circumstances, so they added endless backtracking
      to pad the length.


      Overall, the main game was enjoyable enough, though the story didn''t make sense
      and contradicted itself at times.  It had a mix of find-by-name, find-by-silhouette,
      and put-item-where-it-belongs hidden object scenes, and they were enjoyable.  The
      mini-games in the main game were fun except for the ones to activate the special
      powers.  A few of those mini-games had you moving the mouse around to try to
      rotate a bunch of lines to form a picture without telling you what the picture
      is, so you just keep moving the mouse endlessly until it says you did it.  Another
      few of those were mini-games in which you had to fill a winding snake-like path
      with bubbles of seltzer water from a bottle by pressing or holding the mouse
      button to "spray" the water; this type of game was very frustrating, and I''m
      still not sure why some attempts worked but most didn''t.


      And then begins the "bonus" game.  First of all, let''s be honest, it''s not
      a bonus game.  You pay extra for the "Collector''s Edition" over the standard
      edition of a game (even if the standard edition is not available on Steam).  When
      you pay for something, it''s not a bonus.  The bonus game was completely frustrating
      without a single minute of enjoyment.  If the main game were called "Backtracker''s
      Paradise", the bonus game would be called "Backtracker''s Nirvana".  Additinally,
      there were three mini-games in which each one was split into three sections.  You
      have to play the first section, get an object from it, go do something with
      that object, come back and play the second section, get an object, do something
      with that object, and then come back and play the third section.  These games
      were extremely tedious and difficult, with no enjoyment.  For these puzzles,
      I ended up using the in-game strategy guide where I could, and then skipped
      the last game (because the strategy guide didn''t bother including the solution).  The
      bonus game was so bad with no fun whatsoever, I didn''t feel bad about cheating
      and skipping.  I just wanted it to be over.


      I like hidden object games, and I''ve heard good things about the ones published
      by Big Fish, but this one just isn''t worth your time or money.'
