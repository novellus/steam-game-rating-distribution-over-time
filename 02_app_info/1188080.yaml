    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">A better place. Made just for us.</h2><br>Cats
      are Liquid - A Better Place is a 2D platformer about a liquid cat and her friends.<br><br>You
      play as the cat, in a place created just for you and your friends. You get to
      go on a nice adventure with them where nothing goes wrong and everything is
      perfect, as long as your friends stay there, right by your side.<br><br>Over
      the course of the game, you get to explore 120 rooms and discover new abilities
      like the hookshot and light burst.<br><br>You can also create your own worlds,
      and share them with others through the Steam Workshop. All of the rooms in the
      game were made using the same editor that's included in the game. So if you
      see something in an official world, you can do that in your own custom world.<br><br><br><strong>This
      game contains dark story elements, including strong feelings of abandonment
      and detachment from reality. This game is not for children.</strong>

      It is the game I need that I never know before.

      I often play this when I feel blue, and somehow it made me feel so much better.'
