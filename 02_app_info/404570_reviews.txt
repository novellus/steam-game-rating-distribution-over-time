(Like the liquids.) HOWEVER, there is a minor issue I've been having with this DLC. The included characters actually are new assets added to the in-engine character creator, which for me has a critical flaw, where their body glows very brightly in dark areas, similar to how \"fullbright\" makes the entire map look in Source Engine games. (Strangely their head is unaffected.) Beyond that blunder, everything else in this pack is absolutely worth it, you owe it to yourself to get this pack on sale if you want to make Sci-Fi levels :)","timestamp_created":1578812216,"timestamp_updated":1578812216,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrNKizO8CdNW86wE="}
