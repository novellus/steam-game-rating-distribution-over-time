Basically the point of each level is to guide MC to the end by placing obstacles on the level in real time. When facing an obstacle MC always turns right. Some levels have interactable elements. Pressing Q shows the grid, so you wouldn't be confused by isometric perspective (the most important button in the game);\n+ Variety: There are lots of tools like arrows, crates, fans, bombs, teleporters, holes, skulls, magnets etc. Game often tries to throw something new;\n+ Final levels are genuinely hard;\n+ On some levels you may get stuck for a long-long time. You can skip levels however (up to 4)\n+ Some levels require a good mix of precise planning and precise timing;\n+ Music is good;\n\nCons:\n- The biggest flaw is this: out of 99 levels only a quarter or so are genuinely excellent, the rest are either ok-ish or straight up bad (like levels 83 and 84 where you're just pulling boxes with magnets for 4 minutes); \n- There are no saves, only passwords, so don't forget to write it down BEFORE you quit; \n- Sometimes the game crashes (it didn't back in the day). Played on win 7. So write passwords each 5-10 levels as well;\n- Font for passwords is almost ok, it's easy to mistake u and v however;\n- Presentation/graphics are hit or miss. Details like screen transitions and art style in menus will take some time to get used to;\n- On some levels you control the robot, his controls are very precise so it may be hard for some to get used to;\n- The function to speedup the levels would benefit the pace: once you know where and when to place obstacles you're just waiting for the MC to walk where he needs to be;\n- Although the music is good, I think there is not enough of it, a couple more tracks would help;\n\nI would give a neutral review since creative mechanics are severely held back by quality of level-design. I'd say buy it on sale, I'm intrested what people who never played the game think of it. \nThere's also an intersting option in the menu to select level packs.... sadly they never released anything like that, AFAIK. Would have gladly bought it as DLC","timestamp_created":1604073053,"timestamp_updated":1604073053,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476190477609634399","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tIuNvfUCcqqLqwI="}
