      \ wakes up to realize the group they joined isn\u2019t as kind as they once\

      \ remains of fallen cultists roam the halls, attacking any living thing they\
      \ see. These monsters are called sentrymen, because they only move to keep the\
      \ living out of the stronghold. Of course, The Fellowship simply brushes them\
      \ under the rug and ignores the threat of their ever increasing numbers.<br\
