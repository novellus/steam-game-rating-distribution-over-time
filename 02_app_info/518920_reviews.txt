My criticism will not entirely reflect the experience on other Headsets.[/b]\n\nSo this game was eh, quite something. Let's start off with the issues that a lot of players seem to have (probably only on WMR):\nThe game is entirely black when you first boot it up in your headset, but the window on your monitor works. In order to get the game visible on your headset, you need to hold up your headset and open the settings in-game, and toggle the motion blur setting. After doing this, your game will be visible in your headset. Further, if you pause at any moment, you will have to navigate the pause menu by taking off the headset and once again doing the same as with the settings.\n\nFor the technical difficulties, which I think everyone will have (but im not sure about):\nThe glitchyness. All Operations are pretty easily doable, except the brain surgery. To obtain a A++ score, you need stay above a certain amount of blood loss. Well, after you have successfully removed the skull and just \"grabbed\" the brain to get it into a removable state, one of two things will happen:\n1. The brain and \"the string\" that you have to sever glitches around so much, that its almost impossible to cut it. Only after trying about 11-12 times, I was able to get a lucky hit.\n2. The brain isn't glitching out. Good in that regard, but a bad sign since this means that somehow \"the string\" despawned or got severed while you were removing the skull, meaning that you have to restart the surgery as there is no way to sever the brain anymore.\n\nStory- and gameplay-wise it's certainly just like surgeon simulator, even if a whole lot easier and shoter (except for the bugged brain surgery). I was able to complete the whole game with A++ ratings on all surgeries in about 50 minutes, and even had some time to still mess around with some tiny eastereggs. Spoiler about the last surgery: [spoiler] The last surgery on the alien is hard to finish, not because of glitchyness or anything but much rather because it's unclear what you need to do. The voice prompts are way too quiet even at the loudest setting, which made me just throw literally everything at the alien till it worked.[/spoiler]\n\nOverall I think that the game is pretty fun, but currently with its price tag of 19,99â‚¬ a bit too high for what it delivers. If this game is on sale and you feel like having a bit of random fun, I can recommend it. But due to a lack of replayability and a fair bit of laggy-ness and confusion caused by the game, I must say that I can't recommend it for now. Maybe if there is more content added in the future, it might be worth the price. [spoiler] I think I would very much enjoy the teased North-Korea-Mission.[/spoiler]","timestamp_created":1609927300,"timestamp_updated":1609927300,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwuqLJ6/YCfsT6wAI="}
