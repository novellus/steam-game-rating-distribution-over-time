      \ /><br><strong>The End of the Sun</strong> is a first-person exploration and\
      \ adventure game, where the story has the most important meaning, as it is set\
      \ in the world of Slavic rites, beliefs, legends, and their everyday life. It\
      \ is a series of mysterious events that ordinary people dealt with, as they\
      \ were living in a small village where the line between myth and reality began\
      \ to fade perilously.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/912840/extras/belka1.png?t=1606755273\"\
      \ /><br>As the Ashter (Volhv / someone like Slavic sorcerer) who is gifted with\
      \ the ability to travel in time and knowledge about Navia (the space where human\
      \ fates shape), following the trail of the secretive fugitive, you come to a\
      \ mysterious village, but you cannot find anyone there, at least not in a way\
      \ you wanted to. All you can see are burned hearths around.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/912840/extras/WhoIsThePlayerOptimize.gif?t=1606755273\"\
      \ /><br>A story inspired by Slavic mythology and legends. It presents the events\
      \ occurring during the 4 major Slavic festivals during the 4 seasons far away\
      \ from each other in time. Recreates mystical events, culture and people\u2019\
      s habits in an unusual way. The game is inspired by both adventure and exploration\
      \ games with unorthodox riddles to solve, but the story-line is in the first\
      \ place here.<br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/912840/extras/travelIntime.gif?t=1606755273\"\
