This one definitely felt a lot more like the next two games did: there was a lot of content to go towards, and there definitely was a lot more suspense with what was happening as you go through the game.  The characters are lovable, and there are definitely returning characters from the previous two games that I absolutely adore.\n\nDefinitely give this game a try, especially if you want that feeling of nostalgia.","timestamp_created":1606988534,"timestamp_updated":1606988534,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwj+L+k/YCfaH6tgI="}
