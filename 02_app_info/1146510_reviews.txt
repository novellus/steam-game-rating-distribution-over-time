Can be played for free online but i suggest you support this amazing dev and buy his games.\n\nIts a trilogy of point and click games. I already played them so it took me like 20 minutes to finish each one. Some puzzles but nothing too complicated. \n\nBuy it and support an amazing developer!","timestamp_created":1610014753,"timestamp_updated":1610014753,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4jvCW7vYCer2ewQI="}
