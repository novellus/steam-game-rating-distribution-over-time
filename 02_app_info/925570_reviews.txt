It's a good puzzle type game with nice story, dialogues. \nBut, I really hate, every single time on loading screen, game freezes and i have to force close, It's only happening when game load on a next mission like that circle loading screen. Overall, Good game. Hope this fix soon.\n\n#update: Seems i recently found that, my Antivirus was the problem. Just to be check, i have disable temporary, and i was able to play it normally without any crashes, so i now switch my negative to positive.","timestamp_created":1609776162,"timestamp_updated":1610075546,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwmeT+7/YCd/K2wAI="}
