So this one is basically a direct upgrade from before with new attacks and such. Oh and that cutscene where Ribbon attacks her was kinda swag.\n\nOverall all the bosses bring new stuff to the table and are just direct better upgrades of their basic counterparts.\n\nBesides that it adds more boss fights (as stated), 1 new costume for Erina and 4 for Ribbon, and 4 new CG's in the Gallery.\n\nOnly buy if you really want more of a challenge to the game. Besides that just buy Is The Order a DLC? as it adds more onto the story.\n\nPrioritize Is The Order a DLC? then this.","timestamp_created":1610002351,"timestamp_updated":1610002351,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ucjn7fYCdMuawQI="}
