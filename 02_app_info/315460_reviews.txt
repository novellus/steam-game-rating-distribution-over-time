I posted this way back of how the bugs are so unrealistic in how much damage they do and the items are who knows where most of the time.  After many hours of look at dam You Tube and finding that items I so far up in the air it is just for another stupid item.   Also the lava is like the stupid water but even worse it burn so much of the land if this was even remotely real the world as for this plant would be destroyed in a shot period of time. How do you make a game that everything in it just destroys so much,  not a fun game.    I like a lot of the ideas but just a poor game play do to how all the things and it’s destruction.Sorry this is just to many poor game play ideas,  that outweighs the good ideas.  Its  a big thumb down for me.","timestamp_created":1459574660,"timestamp_updated":1610064748,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":9,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3svV7/YCdbzTVA=="}
