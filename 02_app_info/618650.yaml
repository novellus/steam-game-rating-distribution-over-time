    review: 'NOT RECOMMENDED FOR REMOTE PLAY - NOT TRIED FOR ACTUAL GAMEPLAY


      The game claims to have Remote Play Together, however :

      -It shares the VR screen and not the computer screen ; the remote PC players
      can''t see their screen

      -It doesn''t create a virtual controller, which means it''s impossible for more
      than one player on keyboard to play'
