      /><h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>SUNDAY IS FOR RIVALS</strong></h2>Sunday Rivals
      is a fresh take on the hard hitting, action-packed football games of the past.
      On the field, gameplay is tuned to be snappy and fun, rewarding quick thinking
      and creative players with dazzling open field jukes and bone crushing hits.
      Simplified rules, familiar controls, and a streamlined playbook make it easy
      for players of all skill levels to immediately jump in and have fun, while quick,
      addictive game sessions will keep you coming back for more.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>CUSTOM

      including stadium and grass colors, endzone text, individual player ratings,
      and a slew of appearance options down to what kind of facemask and socks a player
      wears. If it exists in the game now, you can edit it!<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>HEADHUNTER</strong></h2>Lead
      your favorite team through a 4 game, single-elimination tournament while racking
      up points using a fantasy football-style scoring system. As you battle increasingly
      challenging opponents towards victory, your stats are tracked and saved, along
      with 8 additional scoring bonuses tuned for maximum performance! After the game,
      check to see if the fruits of your hard fought victory are good enough to be
      enshrined in the record books and celebrated for years to come.<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>EARLY

    review: Such a cool game, getting better and better with every update. Definitely
      worth the money to support such a hard-working developer (yes, singular. One
      dev made this whole game!).
