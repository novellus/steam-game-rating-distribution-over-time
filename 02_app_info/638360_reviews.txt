A Fever dream was just a simple Half Life reskin, reskined weapons, reskinned enemies, and reskinned npcs, its stength was its simplicity, but now Parasomnia has to stand on its own, and it mostly succeeds. \n\n-Firstly the new inventory system is great, insted of having to worry if you can find a meat pie or whisky when you're at low health you can carry them with you. There is also a money system, you find either money or gold and can use it at stores or vending machines to buy ammo and health items. \n\n-The maps are good aswell, they are very big and non linear making thw world feel more real, however at times the maps are very dark and you can often get lost, and let me return to the inventory, you have a launtern that burns fuel, and you only have a limited supply, you can run out of fuel however i rarely encountered this since fuel is usually plentiful if you explore. The atmosphere is great it gives me a They Hunger vive when i played this. However some maps are bad, the corn field for example isnt a bad idea but executed poorly some of the corn stalks you can walk through but then some act as solid walls, making it worse is that several enemies are chasing you making the whole thing VERY frustaraiting.\n\n-The weapons, I think theyre good. There are problems however, unless i just missed them the Henry and double barrel shotgun only spawn once, so if you miss them you're really out of luck. If you do get them they are good, then henry is deadly at most ranges and the shotgun can kill almost anything at close range. Some of the features seem a but useless. The colt's seconday the \"ghetto blaster\" downright sucks, it doesnt fire fast enough and you can't hit the broad side of a barn with it.\n\n-The voice acting is good, it's over the top bit it fits with the game, but my problems are with Half-Rats' voice lines, for fucks sake add more pain lines than just \"woah this calls for an amputation\". Other than that the acting is good. The sound track is great and worth paying the dollar for the OST.\n\n- The enemies are great, they all are different and have unique designs. There are some problems however the zombie cops have guns so it make sense for them to drop ammo, but for the amount of bullets it takes to kill them they drop too much ammo and at some parts it is very easy due to being fully stocked up on ammo at all times, mainly the henry can kill them with 1 or 2 headshots and you get 10 bullets in return. The bosses are cool but leave a lot to be desired. One you can just kill with a machine gun you can pick up, the next is melee only with a sword, sound cool and is a challenging fight but it you can just kick him to death. The final boss I like but if you have a cocaine lozenge it becomes really easy.\n\n-Overall I recomend this mod to anyone who likes half life mods, and any old They Hunger fans, it has a unique setting and great atmosphere.","timestamp_created":1518754468,"timestamp_updated":1539208172,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnpr9r+YCfoqEmQE="}
