    review: "I played this on the Oculus Rift with Touch controllers .. and it works,\
      \ sort of.  But it's still not a fun game.  It's not even a good Fruit Ninja\
      \ clone (which is what I was hoping for).  I wanted to like this game.  It's\
      \ just bad though, even at the sale price of .99 cents.  \n\nIn case you're\
      \ wondering, if you start game from Steam directly, it will work on Oculus.\
      \  However, if you start game directly from Steam VR, it will start upside down.\
      \  \n\nWhen the game did work, the fruit/candy would come at me very slow, like\
      \ slow motion.  No challenge in cutting them up with candy canes.  On top of\
      \ that, there were hit detection issues.  Randomly, I would hit the fruit right\
      \ down the middle with my candy cane and nothing would register.  This happened\
      \ randomly about 10-20% of the time.  \n\nRating 2/10.  Good visuals, nice VR\
      \ environment, but terrible gameplay, not even a good clone :(  I can't recommend\
      \ this game free or at .99 cents until it is fixed"
