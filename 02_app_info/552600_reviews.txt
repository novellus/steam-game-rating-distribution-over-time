Server is quite often down and usually for quite a number of hours. This is really not satisfactory, regardless of early access status. It looks more like insufficient resources provided to infrastructure and support. Going to keep trying to connect but am coming to the end os my patience with this game and am going to start to try and find a more reliable replacement. What a shame!","timestamp_created":1609556027,"timestamp_updated":1609556027,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ45/zA4PYCfInMvwI="}
