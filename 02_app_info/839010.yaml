    about_the_game: 'In Real Winners: Victoryball, you''ll operate as a sports robot
      doing their best to win. Pick up and play rules that change the match and end
      up with a game that''s nothing like where it started. Rules can change everything
      from the size of the players to adding buzz saws to the field. Fast paced and
      silly, Real Winners: Victoryball is a great game to pick up and play with friends,
      relative or frenemies! Real Winners: Victoryball is a <u>4-player local party
      game.</u><br><br>Real Winners: Victoryball comes with four distinct game modes:<br><br><strong>Victoryball</strong>
      begins as classic soccer. Kick the ball into the opponents goal. Add a laser
      fence and a baseball bat for a real challenge.<br><br><strong>Dodgeball</strong>
      poses the question: What if dodgeballs were also bombs? The answer is: Way more
      explosions. <br><br><strong>Trophy Troubles</strong> is a free for all where
      bots scramble to grab the trophy and hold onto it as long as possible. <br><br><strong>King
      Of The Hill</strong> gets a bit of a twist. This co-op mode finds the bots defending
      the King Ball from an onslaught of zombots that want to kick him out of his

    review: "This is a tough one, and even as I type this review I am conflicted about\
      \ giving it a thumbs up or a thumbs down. The recommendation I am making comes\
      \ with a lot of caveats, but the very attractive price makes it worth taking\
      \ a chance on.\n\n\nI love this type of game, and these developers have gone\
      \ all out trying to cover the bases of a good \"couch arena\" competition. The\
      \ 4 varieties of match (basically Foosball (\u201CVictoryball\u201D), Dodge-Ball,\
      \ Capture the Flag (\u201CTrophy Troubles\u201D) & King of the Hill) are sprinkled\
      \ with power-ups and craziness and some pretty funny gags. The games \u201C\
      power ups\u201D which add obstacles, Weapons, change the size of the players\
      \ or even turn them into cars is nicely implemented, and scoring sometimes becomes\
      \ secondary to seeing just how nuts things can get on the field.\n\n\nGrowing\
      \ up with 8-bit consoles, it seems to me this type of play-with-friends game\
      \ would be far more popular, but there seems to be only a handful them on Steam\
      \ that I try to snatch them up whenever I find one. They are perfect to play\
      \ with kids, and \u201CReal Winners\u201D has both a great concept and a fun\
      \ look to it.  I so SO wanted to love this game.\n\n\nBut... and there are a\
      \ LOT of buts...\n\n\nFirst of all, its buggy. The game was just released 2\
      \ months ago so perhaps they will be addressed, but right out of the gate there\
      \ were issues with the camera obscuring ends of the playing field, players becoming\
      \ stuck after collisions, and other minor glitches. Also, players sometimes\
      \ interact with objects inconsistently, with one player triggering a \u2018\
      perk\u2019 automatically, while the same player needs to hit a button to do\
      \ so. Still, early days, so not a deal breaker yet (assuming the devs are planning\
      \ on patching this thing up a little).\n\n\nThen there is the \u201Cfeel\u201D\
      \ of the game. Some of the movement feels muddy and slow, and some controls\
      \ are counter-intuitive. As the controls are not customizable, this can make\
      \ for a much steeper learning curve than a game of this type should have. This\
      \ may be something that players can adjust to over time, but after a couple\
      \ of days with this game I am still having trouble figuring things out. Granted,\
      \ in the chaos of a match with some friends, this might not be as much of a\
      \ problem, but I found playing it with my child frustrating as I could not explain\
      \ the cause-and-effect certain moves or buttons made.\n\n\nThe camera also has\
      \ the same problem many of these arena type games do, where the field of view\
      \ doesn\u2019t give a lot of headroom where the scores are located making visibility\
      \ a little more obscured than is comfortable.\n\n\nBut then we come to the two\
      \ most troublesome elements of the game. The first is the Menu Music\u2026 oh\
      \ dear lord the Menu Music. It is a short and repetitive loop that will drive\
      \ you rapidly insane. It\u2019s a minor issue, easily solved with a mute button,\
      \ but it\u2019s there.\n\n\nThe second problem is far worse: this game NEEDS\
      \ a \u201CPlay Again\u201D button. Some matches are very VERY short, which is\
      \ fine, but to then have to go back to the home screen, pick the same scenario,\
      \ then pick your team and robot for all players, and THEN get to play again\u2026\
      \ it seems the setup takes longer than the actual game. There should have been\
      \ the option to just hit a button and replay the same match without going through\
      \ all the setup again. For every gripe I have so far, THIS is the one that caused\
      \ the most frustration\u2026 and the one I hope the developers might go back\
      \ and patch.\n\n\nI hope they fix it because, despite all the gripes, there\
      \ is a fun little game at the core of all this. Competitive \u201CCouch Arena\u201D\
      \ games like this are not very common, and this one covers a LOT of bases. I\
      \ love the variety of the matches and I think the style and humor are very enjoyable.\
      \ Despite the many issues with the game I still have to recommend it as it does\
      \ a lot right, and when you aren\u2019t being held up by some of the glitches\
      \ it can be a very immersive and enjoyable experience to play with a buddy or\
      \ three.\n\n\nWith just a few little fixes and tweaks, this could be a really\
      \ fantastic game, but as it stands its still worth the price of admission for\
      \ the things it does right."
