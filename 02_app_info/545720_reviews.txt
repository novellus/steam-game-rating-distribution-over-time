An old game but i do believe it deserves a chance.\nI may update this as i play more but my first impressions are as such:\n\nQuick version; A charming art style and a decent attempt at converting souls like combat to 2D. \nCombat seems relatively straight forward and while you may die quickly re-spawning and trying again is very quick\nProgression is simple and while grinding is easily available i have yet to find it necessary.\nRolling seems relatively useless against regular enemies due to unclear wind-up animations.\nSome minor bugs with movement making me get stuck on certain tiles (quite annoying in combat)\nOver all a fun and interesting game for anyone with a souls itch, though with a few small problems and minor bugs. \n\nA charming game which imitates the souls styles quite nicely if not flawlessly. \nTo start with as advertised there is little in way of tutorial and it allows you to get right into the game so you can explore. Whether or not you think this is a positive or negative is up to you but i found that with relatively little to learn, as the systems are fairly basic, that this was not an issue.\nSpeaking of getting straight into it, re spawning is actually rather quick. I was quite grateful for this as i found myself dying quite frequently to begin with.\n\nThe game however is not without fault. There are certain minor bugs, such as getting stuck on some tiles or entrances not working that can be slightly annoying  but nothing major so far. \nThe audio can be a bit buggy when switching between areas and is quite a suddenly cut off, simply annoying but not much more to it. \nThe game seems rather small, which is to be expected but with about 5 bosses and an estimated ( my own estimation) completion time of about 6 hours you can decide if it is worth it.\n\nThe bosses are simple and fun and as i said before decently telegraph their attacks. \n\nOverall 6.5/10 not bad at all but far from perfect. For anyone with a souls itch this may scratch it for a short time.","timestamp_created":1609813220,"timestamp_updated":1609813220,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqouW6PYCfuvJwAI="}
