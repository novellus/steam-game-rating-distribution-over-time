    review: "For the price it is hard to fault it too hard. My friends and I wanted\
      \ to play some poker with each other online since we can't go out. But the majority\
      \ of poker games on Steam are microtransaction trash, so this was ok. We were\
      \ able to get a game setup and running. A little documentation would go a long\
      \ way. Just know that you need to set your table up for the exact number of\
      \ players you expect, and if someone wants to join later, or back out, you need\
      \ to restart the server. \n\nThe biggest issue we found, is that it does not\
      \ account for High card. If two players have a pair and one has a 5 high and\
      \ the other has an ace high, it splits the pot. Also it won't count the ace\
      \ as low card in a straight. These are some basic issues that I think could\
      \ be fixed. For the price we got an evening of playing and having fun together,\
      \ poker was really just something for us to do in the background while hanging\
      \ out and for that it served its job. Just don't expect a super serious poker\
      \ game, and know how to setup port forwarding going in."
