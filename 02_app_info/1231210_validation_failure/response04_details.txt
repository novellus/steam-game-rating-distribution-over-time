Using your jetpack and frictionless boots, launch high-speed airborne assaults, expertly dodge enemy fire, and soar from hilltop to hilltop. Free yourself from the ground or become a quick frag for your opponent. The jetpack draws from your armor’s energy pool, so strategically manage your use of the jetpack and weapons to ensure your battle advantage. Depending on the situation, adjust your jetpack from pushing you upward to giving more maneuvering power.

In Midair it's critical that you coordinate your assaults for maximum effect. Take down their flag defenses one by one to expose their flag for a quick grab.
