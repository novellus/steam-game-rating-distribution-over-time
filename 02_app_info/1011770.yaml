    about_the_game: The Alchemist is a game about a young man who is trying to follow
      in his late fathers footsteps to become a master Alchemist. So he left his home
      with only a map, his inheritance and some stories to guide him on his journey.
      Wilder Village was his destination, often told of as an idyllic village that
      borders the dangerous and awe inspiring 'Great Wilderness'.  After months of
      travel the protagonist has finally arrived...<h2 class="bb_tag">Wilder Village
      &amp; The Great Wilderness</h2><br>The village houses a selection of locations
      you can visit and people you can meet and work with whilst exploring the wilderness
      that borders the village.  You can also build relationships with them, help
      them out with a few things and even have a romance, or maybe just have some
      casual dates if you prefer. <br><br>Just outside the village is the entryway
      to the Wilderness an area considered wild and mostly unexplored, filled with
      creatures of legend, beasts and most importantly reagents. The items you find
      will allow you to craft new potions to sell in your shop and increase your wealth
      and experience to become a new master Alchemist.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features</h2><ul
