Meaningful POVs - not fillers, the POV actually add important bits Bad ends actually ARE bad. Mc with a backbone, backstory and integrity Characters are varied and distinct.

It’s not for the faint of heart, that’s for sure. Some may even end up hating him in the end, never forgiving him for his deeds. But this was what gave his characters so much of that “oomph” factor. It was what made his storyline darkly enchanting and tempting for me. So please, do give him a try! He truly is one heck of a guy, that’s for sure! And his story backs him up with that all the way!”<br>🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/aminoapps.com\/c\/otome\/page\/blog\/hajime-fukuyama-aol-review\/Xe0Y_JpUgu8K8d5wl0Z4kRXla6NkPqGR2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Lucifer<\/a><br><br>“I found the game and it’s world enthralling, experiencing the drama and mystery as if I was watching it in real-time. The MC is well-rounded and I was able to put myself into her mindset, which is a rare thing to find. The small problems I had, in no way detract from the overall experience of the game. The market is saturated with some high-quality games that are rife with bad translations or generic plots. With Agent of Love, it goes above and beyond its storytelling and explores themes that can limit its appeal and audience. However, it does not do this for shock value and puts thought into the story it tells. Like any story, everyone has their own tastes and preferences which cannot be changed regardless.”<br>🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 – <a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=https:\/\/ominousbeep.com\/2020\/05\/08\/agent-of-love-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Ominous Beep<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/1013830\/header.jpg?t=1596340009","website":"https:\/\/www.delusionalinc.com\/PublicWeb\/agentoflove","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br><\/li><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 10+<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Dual core from Intel or AMD at 2.8 GHz<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> Intel OnBoard, nVidia GeForce 8600\/9600GT, ATI\/AMD Radeon HD2600\/3600<br><\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> Version 10<br><\/li><li><strong>Network:<\/strong> Broadband Internet connection<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 2 GB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> There are reported bugs with Windows 7 &amp; 8<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<br><\/li><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Mac OS X 10.9+<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 2014 or newer Intel Core i5<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> Intel, Nvidia or ATi GPU with 1GB Memory<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 2 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system<\/li><\/ul>"},"legal_notice":"© 2014 Central Information Systems Pty Limited.
