    review: "Playability\nThe Playability of RealFlight 8 is amongst the best simulators\
      \ I have used in relation to the realistic physics of the models. From the moment\
      \ I plug in the Interlink USB Transmitter the SIM instantly maps all the primary\
      \ channels I require to fly my model. Should I wish to make any channel adjustments\
      \ I can easily make this in the menu. The Interlink transmitter however whilst\
      \ is an easy to use product for RealFlight is also is a source of great confusion\
      \ and frustration for some that are new to RealFlight. Simply put without a\
      \ RealFlight compatible USB controller or dongle you are not able to use the\
      \ Simulator. AccuRC or another Simulator such as PhoenixRC maybe a better choice\
      \ in this regard however as you can simply use a cheaper dongle to connect any\
      \ transmitter to their software. \n\nOnce you have however plugged in your controller\
      \ and take-off instantly the physics of the models becomes a very apparent strong\
      \ point of this software. From performing Aileron Tic-Tocs to Autorotation\u2019\
      s you can feel the weight of the model as realistically as I would fly a model\
      \ in real life. \n\nSounds\nThe sounds of the models whilst flying I feel does\
      \ sound a little tinny and may struggle to capture an absolutely realistic representation\
      \ of some models, I believe it is still a fair representation for a SIM from\
      \ the revving of a nitro engine to the flutter of blades as you come in to land\
      \ an auto.\n\nGraphics\nRealFlight has highly detailed models with reflective\
      \ canopy's and photorealistic fields all rendered through Direct X 9. Whilst\
      \ one of the more demanding Simulators on a GPU you will also experience fantastic\
      \ graphic fidelity through a range of post processing effects including bloom\
      \ and depth of field. Whilst, these effects create a uniquely gorgeous flying\
      \ experience I have found some people using the SIM to lose depth perception\
      \ using too many of these additional effects which can also negatively affect\
      \ your frame rate and flying. I have previously used this SIM however on a Nvidia\
      \ GTX 970 4GB GPU pushing well over 60FPS and my recommendations for getting\
      \ a good experience with RealFlight is to lower the depth of field settings\
      \ until you have smooth performance, find a suitable camera angle and fly. \n\
      \n\nMods and Community \nIn relation to the RC and RealFlight community as a\
      \ whole it is always expanding and if you want to look into downloading additional\
      \ new Aircraft and Airports you can visit the knifeedge.com Swap pages. Adding\
      \ an additional aircraft of airport is as simple as extracting the new files\
      \ into your C:\\Users\\YourUserName\\Documents\\RealFlight 8 folder and reloading\
      \ the simulator. \n\nVerdict\nOverall RealFlight 8 is one of the most photorealistic\
      \ experiences you will have flying a remote-control model without leaving the\
      \ house. The physics of the models provide a unique sense of weight to each\
      \ one flown and provides a great training platform for anyone looking to getting\
      \ into Remote Control Planes, Helicopters and drones. If you are new to RealFlight,\
      \ as I alluded to before you will need to also purchase the InterLink DX controller\
      \ for an additional cost to get the most out of the software.\n\nIn reviewing\
      \ RealFlight 8 I have used multiple other RC Aircraft Simulators including the\
      \ early editions of RealFlight, PhoenixRC, neXt and AccuRC. I have over 10 years\u2019\
      \ experience in building, maintaining and flying model RC Helicopters from 250\
      \ size all the way up to 700. I also have extensive experience in both electric\
      \ and Nitro models. \n\nIn taking the above into account I have reviewed the\
      \ product on Playability, Sound, Graphics and Modding. RealFlight is without\
      \ a doubt still the premier product for learning how to fly a Remote-Control\
      \ Helicopter model.\n"
