If you find the game easy then play it on a harder mode, if that's still simple then try a power up to change the game play. For example you have a few unlockable slow down options that slow down the bullets if they get near you, which is good to position the bullets for better score. You have another slow down power-up to give the game the \"cave slowdown\" feel. I stream this game regularly on https://www.twitch.tv/brianreboot so if you're wondering how the game looks please take a look.","timestamp_created":1609219222,"timestamp_updated":1609219222,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwn5W81vYCffGrvgI="}
