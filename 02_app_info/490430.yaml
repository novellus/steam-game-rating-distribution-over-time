    about_the_game: Late one night while listening to the music of the stars, a dozing
      Dr. Dee picked up an unusual transmission from a distant world. Decoding the
      signal he discovered it was a distress call from a planet called Octamari. <br><br>The
      planet was about to be engulfed by a supernova and this message was their last
      hope. Included in the distress call were detailed instructions for a machine
      that would blast the Octamari escape pods through the heart of the supernova,
      twisting space and time and lord knows what else before arriving safely at their
      destination. <br><br>There was only one thing to do. Build the machine and save
      the Octamari home world!<h2 class="bb_tag">Key Features </h2><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Fast

    review: "[h1]Simple, But Well-Executed[/h1]\nAs this is part of the HELP game\
      \ bundle, apparently developed in a matter of six days, you won't be surprised\
      \ to learn that this game isn't particularly complex. I've only played it for\
      \ 10 minutes and I've probably seen just about everything it has to offer. \n\
      \nStill, for what it is, it is quite well-made. It's bright, it's colorful,\
      \ the blocks make adorable sounds when they're matched, and if you need something\
      \ mindless to occupy your hand while you're busy watching something else, it's\
      \ not a bad option.\n\n[h1]What it is[/h1]\nBasically, it's a Match-3, where\
      \ you just need to click on any one of a group of three or more same-color blocks\
      \ to match them. And since it takes place on a cube, every so often it rotates\
      \ and you'll work on one of the other surfaces. (When it decides to do this\
      \ appears to be random.) Match enough blocks in a row and you'll enter some\
      \ sort of bonus... point... thing. \n\n[h1]Recommended?[/h1]\nIt's so small\
      \ and so short, you'll probably spend more time mulling over whether to try\
      \ it than it'd take to install and play it two or three times. I daresay this\
      \ serves a small, but definitive 'positive' in the bundle's overall value."
