It is also repetitive. A lot of time is spent taking over weakly defended rackets. This ends up just being a not very enjoyable grind after a while.\n\nThe game is quite buggy. I think that loading the game is broken and it messes up the character stats to some extent. The game sometimes gets stuck and the only way around it is to load the saved game before it got stuck. The side missions sometimes cannot be completed because of bugs in the game too e.g. I was not able to find a character I was supposed to talk with in the building they were supposed to be in, Also, the computer characters make some very strange moves in combat e.g. the enemy boss sometimes runs up to a character to punch them instead of using its devastating special skill from distance.\n\nI am not sure I would recommend the deluxe pack as it provides very little over the base version. It gives powerful weapons from start, making the game even easier and less enjoyable. I wouldn't strongly recommend the base version either - the game is very easy and very buggy.\n\nAll that said, I did play it through with several characters and I enjoyed it.","timestamp_created":1609474715,"timestamp_updated":1609474715,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ41+WK3vYCfOSlvwI="}
