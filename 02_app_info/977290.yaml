    review: "I bought this game on sale for .49, to see if I could get all the achievements.\n\
      I play a lot of bad, cheap games to get achievements and try to 100% them. This\
      \ was cheap, but it was not bad, at all.\n\nI wish there was more to the game\
      \ such as a leaderboard of some sort, but for the price, that's not really a\
      \ complaint.\nThere are only 20 levels, but due to the type of game, and again,\
      \ the price, the levels are all different enough that it felt like the perfect\
      \ amount of game play and experience for the price.\n\nI used a controller,\
      \ and only used the keyboard to see if it made a difference in precision. For\
      \ me, the controller worked great, but I think the keyboard would have worked\
      \ just as well. I simply prefer the controller.\n\nSome levels are extremely\
      \ easy, while others require precision jumping and landing. A couple levels\
      \ made me want to send a \"grumble grumble\" email to the dev for making the\
      \ level the way they did, but the collision detection did feel accurate, and\
      \ I eventually beat the level.\nThere are \"cheap\" deaths that had me saying,\
      \ \"Oh, come on!\" ...BUT at no time did I ever feel like the level was going\
      \ to be impossible to beat. Just annoying because I would get to the end, not\
      \ land perfectly, and have to restart. \nHowever, the levels are short enough\
      \ that retrying over and over until I got it, didn't feel like torture, and\
      \ I understood it was just part of the type of game I was playing.\n\nThough\
      \ I am sure some people will nail it the first time and finish the game in no\
      \ time, it logged my time as 3 hours...but I was not completely focused on the\
      \ game by any means.\nI was managing multiple clicker games, checking stocks,\
      \ doing research, had a business meeting and heart to heart with the wife, etc....so\
      \ I'm honestly not sure how long it would have been if I just played straight\
      \ through. Definitely not 3 hours lol\n\nOverall I enjoyed the challenge, got\
      \ my achievements, and had a sense of accomplishment.\nI won't ever play this\
      \ game again, not because I don't like it, but once I beat it...I felt good\
      \ and moved on.\nThe game didn't do anything I haven't already seen a 100 times,\
      \ but what it did was give me more of what I already knew I liked, and didn't\
      \ over stay it's welcome in my life. \nI would definitely recommend it to achievement\
      \ hunters, and anyone that just wants a quick challenge."
