Interesting as one-man-project but needs QoL-Updates to be enjoyable such as checkpoints, longer-lasting runs or forms connected to buttons because once the L-shape is on spot 1, and with the next hole the cube is on spot 1 and the L is gone until it appears again.","timestamp_created":1603042809,"timestamp_updated":1603042927,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mbyznvUCdoXXqAI="}
