    about_the_game: "HexTrains trains your brains with trains!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      HexTrains mixes the classic tower defense with the puzzle genre. You need to\
      \ destroy colored cargo containers that are transported by trains while building\
      \ turrets that match the respective colors. Additionally you can manipulate\
      \ switches to control the movement direction of the trains, which lets you guide\
      \ the freight to the matching turrets. To make it easier to deal with the oncoming\
      \ flood of trains you can also upgrade your turrets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe\
      \ game offers you 58 levels, each usually playable multiple times with different\
      \ cargo and turret configurations. This currently results in a total of 139\
      \ unique, playable versions. These can all be unlocked by playing the game and\
      \ no additional in-game purchases are necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChoose from\
      \ 4 levels of difficulty to adjust the game speed to your needs. The difficulty\
      \ level can be changed any time, but you need to keep the challenge high in\
      \ order to be awarded with the most precious medals and achievements.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nThe game's level browser provides you with easy access to all levels.\
      \ Also your high scores and awarded medals are displayed there so that you have\
      \ an overview of your performance for each each level / version so far.<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nSince the game was initially developed for smaller screens, you\
      \ can play HexTrains on a desktop monitor in windowed mode with resolutions\
      \ including 1440x810, 1366x768, 1280x720 and 1136x640.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf\
      \ you get stuck on a map and need help, we offer you access to solution proposals\
      \ for each map on our website."
