    review: 'The game is quite entertaining, the content is good enough.


      PROS:

      Good story, Nice characters. Interesting world. Feels like an Anime fantasy
      series.


      CONS:

      The english localization is awful and the skill variety feels ridiculously complex
      for the simplicity of the battles.

      I mean, you got like 985679 skills for each character but you won''t ever need
      them. Just use "the one that kills stuff" with any character and win the game.
      Also, many of the battle conditions are either not shown or explained correctly
      so the "kill stuff " is always a valid path.



      Overall the story and art outweighs, in my humble opinion, everything else.
      It feels a little "early accessy", but fun.'
