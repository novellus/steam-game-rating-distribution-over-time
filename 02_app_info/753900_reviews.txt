Good steering, no crashes and straight mission informations.\nAt the begin a little bit hard but if you find out the mechanics it works great.\n\nPro :\n- Top atmosphere\n- very nice Graphics\n- KI is good\n- clear spoken mission Infos\n\ncontra :\n- to short !\n- not very much to upgrade just only the guns and rockets.\n\nThis game could be more than this but it is worth buying it on sales actions.\nI played around 6 hours and passed through.\n\n@ the developers (just 2 of them ! crazy, one additonal actor also) :\n\n- Try to design a story around it\n- implement ingame docking sequences between dog fights\n- implement ship upgrading possibility\n- implement a difficult selector (it is to easy at all)\n- maybe ship selection with different weapons for different mission styles \n\n","timestamp_created":1609785086,"timestamp_updated":1609785086,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwg+Kq5/YCd/27wAI="}
