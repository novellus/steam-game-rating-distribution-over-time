But instead you just stand still and wait for the attacks to come, which sometimes don't even work.\nThere's a guy that throws you spears and you are supposed to block those spears with the sword that they gave you, but sometimes you can't even block the spears just because.\n\nSo I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe in a long time they can actually fix these issues and I have hopes that they do. But for now, it really fits with the Unity logo.","timestamp_created":1538916793,"timestamp_updated":1538916793,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4qtelp+YCe7KhrAE="}
