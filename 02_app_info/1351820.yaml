      /><h2 class="bb_tag">Free Demo</h2><br>Check out the free demo above for an
      exclusive ending! I believe demos are great for people to try out an experience
      and see if it resonates with them without committing to a price point.<h2 class="bb_tag">Why
      I made this</h2><br>Over the past 9 months, I created Shivering Hearts by myself
      with RPG Maker MV in my free time to show my artistic skills. I also wanted
      to create something that brings back the magic that I sorely miss from old school
      1990s PC RPGs like Baldur''s Gate 2, Fallout 1, 2, and Planescape; Torment.
      CLANNAD, Undertale, LISA: the Painful RPG, and Oneshot were also huge influences.
      <br><br>Role Playing Games can be so much more than combat, stats, character
      builds and optimal play (however, I still value these game design aspects very,
      very much). I wanted to challenge myself to see if I can still create an engaging
      experience that doesn''t have combat or leveling mechanics, within a 1 month
      period. That turned into 10 months. I wanted to make a game with deep conversation
      trees, memorable characters and an emotionally touching story. RPG Maker MV
      allowed me to create and bug-test very intricate dialogue trees that match the
      quality and scale of those older titles but at the fraction of the development
      time and with plenty of polish. I hope that I have done those games justice.<br><br><img

    review: I was actually really disappointed when the game ended so early. The characters
      are very interesting and so is the world, which is why I want to learn so much
      more about them. I hope there will be a sequel/bigger game that covers the past
      and future of these two. Please give us more of this, dev!
