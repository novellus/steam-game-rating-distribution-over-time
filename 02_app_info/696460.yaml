      /><br><br>Finally on Steam, this long-awaited game has finally been released!
      This game will help anyone overcome boredom, filling their time with fun, and
      interest!<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Simple and easy
      controls<br></li><li>Amazing graphics<br></li><li>Tons of game difficulties
      to choose from<br></li><li>A wide variety of different cars<br></li><li>Lots
      of amazing achievements</li></ul><br>You, the driver, have to sit behind the
      wheel of a car, and show care and caution, to avoid collision with a circle
      of moving cars, who, of course, do not observe traffic rules. You must carefully
      calculate the timing, otherwise a collision is inevitable! The game is harder
      than it seems at first glance, and after a couple of minutes, you will feel
      how difficult it will be to squeeze between the two cars moving at different
      speeds. Their number will increase, and the complexity will increase for each
      successful lap. But your efforts will be well rewarded! For each successful
      lap you get a gold coin, which can then be spent on a lots of new, unique vehicles.
      Additionally, your achievements will be carefully counted, and you will have
      the opportunity to compete with your friends, and see who will be the best in
      this awesome, hard game!<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/696460/extras/os.png?t=1504112870"
