The brakes are horrible and the unit is vastly underpowered. Sounds are alright. Horn is a bit loud, which is an odd complaint coming from me. But it takes just about a full 30 seconds to take a 10lb set on a 12-car train. This should take less than 5-ish seconds. It should also significantly slow the train down, and yet no. The independent brake is useless, which is nothing new coming from Dovetail.\n\nTLDR; It's pretty, but unplayable. Waste of money, even if it's on sail. Really only useful for AI trains.","timestamp_created":1602804348,"timestamp_updated":1602804348,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxq6ll/UCd6CNqAI="}
