Tsume Shogi (mating problems)  and problems on tesuji would be very welcome.     As is the program is easy to use but it would be nice if there were more features to allow players to improve and if the ideas behind things like castles were explained so that new players can understand them.\nIf all that is desired is a computer opponent this program is fine but it will not satisfy the needs of more serious players of the game.","timestamp_created":1608465971,"timestamp_updated":1608724363,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.534497082233428955","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ477bcx/YCdrfYuwI="}
