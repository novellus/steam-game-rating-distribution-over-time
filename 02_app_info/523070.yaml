    about_the_game: Black Forest is a turn-based multiplayer game about cooperation
      and betrayal. A resource-management strategy game about survival and despair.
      It is set in the dark and dangerous Black Forest in medieval Germany. It is
      a casual game, meaning that you will spend anywhere from a few minutes to maybe
      half an hour per day, with a game possibly running for several weeks.<br><br><br>In
      the game, each player controls one family in a village that is located deep
      in the forest. Everyone tries to survive the wolves, bears and worse that come
      at night. Plant and harvest, gather and build, cooperate and betray. Survive
      as a community, but do not forget about yourself. Try to survive the coming
      winter to win the game. Or simply be the last survivor to gain a personal victory.<br><br>The
      core element of the game is cooperation and its limits. At some point, you have
      to think of yourself first. If your community is strong, others will help you.
      But the forest will sooner or later overwhelm you all - when will cooperation
      break down? Will people betray openly, or trick? Is that proposal a trick maybe,
      or really the best? What role will common ground play? Does the village provide
      shelter for those who lost their homes? Do you share resources or keep them
      private? All of these and many other questions will be asked and answered in
      every game.<br><br><br><strong>Please note</strong> that Black Forest is a turn-based,
      slow-paced game. Do not expect to jump in and have immediate action. If you
      are familiar with play-by-mail games, you will be used to such speed of playing.
      If you are not - come in and enjoy, you don't know what you've been missing
      so far.
