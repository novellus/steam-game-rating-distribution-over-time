    about_the_game: Cyber Escape is an infinite runner in which you must survive as
      long as you can in an attempt to escape the police of a future dystopian world
      after your smuggling run went wrong. Smash cars out of your way to gain a higher
      streak and get more points, and risk it all by moving closer to the front for
      a higher multiplier- but a better chance at getting hit by the oncoming traffic.

      Thanks for the review. A lot of these things are things that I will be tweaking
      over the next week in order to make the game more fun. I employ you to try again
      next time an update is pushed and reconsider your thoughts on the game.


      Thanks,

      Fogbound Dev Team'

    review: "Having played this game, I'm left with a lot of feelings.\n\nGraphics/UI\n\
      It is obvious looking at the style that there is an attempt to emulate the cyberpunk\
      \ style. I use attempt purposefully, as because of the lack of enviornment or\
      \ detailing it is hard to use the world style when talking about this game.\
      \ The 3 towers that you pass are bland, and reppetitive within seconds. The\
      \ cars aren't detailed, and are boring to look at. To be honest, even the VRC\
      \ effects are bothersome to me. I'd say remove it, but its cool and could have\
      \ a use. Maybe when being hit or something, but as is, its severely tiresome.\
      \ \nAs for the menu, it actually looks cool. I'd say put more colors into it.\
      \ Maybe a glowing gradient around the text or something.\nAlso, you should be\
      \ able to control the menu with your mouse.\n\nGameplay\nMost infinite runners\
      \ are repetitive. This is to be expected. What normally helps them is a \"twist\"\
      \ in gameplay that makes them interesting. Something that changes the normal\
      \ dodging mechanics. One More Line has its movements. Temple run has turning\
      \ and jumping. Flippy Knife has physics. This game does not. Besides dodging\
      \ cars, there is no variation in gameplay (except one thing that I'll get to).\
      \ Maybe have a shield burst, or powerups, or increased speed.\n\nI feel the\
      \ controls are rubbish. They feel sluggish, and unresponsive. Maybe limiting\
      \ the movement to maybe 9 snapping points would help make it feel as bad as\
      \ it does. Hitboxes are very fidgety as well, and a lot of the times it would\
      \ be a coin toss whether or not I'd hit them or they'd hit me. Also pressing\
      \ is that at least 3 times in my short time playing I was given a situation\
      \ that I could not win.\n\nBecause of the issues above, along with the (slightly)\
      \ high price point, I wouldn't recomend this game at the moment."
