    review: As someone who just stumbled upon this while searching for a game with
      a great story that I hadn't heard anything about before, this is a hell of a
      find. Fantastic story, beautiful art, great voice acting, good soundtrack. There's
      nothing else to be said go buy it. Have a good day.
