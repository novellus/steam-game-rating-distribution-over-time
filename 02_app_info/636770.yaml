    about_the_game: <h2 class="bb_tag">Overview:</h2><br>The king is having a huge
      birthday celebration! Five days of dancing, festivals, and drinking, culminating
      in a grand masquerade ball. It just so happens that Rivian Varrison, the introverted
      son of a famous nobleman, is forced to attend this giant event by his father.
      By chance, or maybe something more deliberate, he runs into a host of colorful
      and shady characters, all with their own stories to tell. But when a sudden
      and mysterious crime happens on the second day of the celebration, Rivian finds
      himself thrown into the middle of it, and has to discover the truth behind what
      really happened -- and who the people around him really are.<h2 class="bb_tag">Features:</h2><br><ul
