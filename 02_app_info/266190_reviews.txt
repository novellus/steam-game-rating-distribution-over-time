As to why, it comes down to communication. The devs don't appear to be engaged with their community at all currently. Last update to the game was 6 months ago and I've caught nary a word from them since. As I state in my original review small indi devs like this deserve a lot of slack but I can't maintain good faith in a project when people are silent. \n\nFrom the forums I glean that the devs are tired from constant negative feedback which I think is understandable given how genuinely small indi projects are treated on Steam. None the less, it's the obligation of the devs to stay in touch with their backers. I can understand limiting exposure to unconstructive criticism but radio silence isn't acceptable. The very least good faith backers deserve is communication. \n\nI hope the devs are doing alright, the project moves forward and they find a balance that lets them be involved with their supporters. Until I see movement though, I have to recommend against supporting the project. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal review:\nI'm giving this game a positive review really for one specific reason, which I'll detail below. \nBefore that, let me say right out the gate that the game is still pretty darn rough. \nIf I were giving this review just on the game as it exists, it would be a thumbs down. \nIt has bugs, crashes, lack of content and general clunkiness. The game needs a lot of work still. \nAs a product, I can't recommend it in its current state.\n\nWhy I'm giving it a thumbs up anyway is because I see what it's trying to be and also because this is the kind of developer that deserves a lot of slack. I bought the game the day it came out because I loved the concept and I've checked in on it every once in a great while since. I see they've regularly made \nupdates to the game and playing today I see a lot of progress. \n\nIn a nutshell, I'm not so much recommending the game as I am the potential. The developer has a really great idea and they've shown they're the type to keep working on the project. Kenshi took almost 6 years but look at it now, one of the few great success stories from the launch of Early Access on steam. That term, Early Access, has become so over used, exploited, homogenized and just outright abused that I can't really blame people for not thinking of it as much more than saying a game isn't finished yet. However, that's not what it was supposed to be for. What it was supposed to be for was projects like this one. It was meant for truly small, indi devs who have a great game idea and the grit to see it made even if that takes every weekend for the next 5 years. This game is one of the rare projects that actually belong in the Early Access category as it was originally intended. \n\nSo if you like the concept and approve of the update history as I do, then consider giving the game a buy to support the developers attempt to bring it to life. The concept is one I'd like to see pursued and if brought to a good state could be an amazing entry in the genre. The developer has evidenced their ability to stick with the project and keep it moving forward making them deserving of at least a little good faith. \n\nTLDR: I support the endeavor, not the current product. If you're looking to buy a product, wish list and check back later. If you're interested in supporting a hard working indi dev with a great idea, consider giving it a buy to support their project.","timestamp_created":1550101352,"timestamp_updated":1603249598,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.511473000049591064","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw4+3HpPUCcv7qugE="}
