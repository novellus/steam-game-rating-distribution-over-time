    reviews: "\u201CThey can infect others with a horrible chest spike and they can\
      \ mutate into their true form at any time, in a HUGE explosion of blood. Wonderful.\u201D\

      SurvHive is certainly ambitious and takes a lot of its cues from both John Carpenter\u2019\
      s The Thing as well as Alien and Aliens. The common themes of a shape-shifting\
      \ alien that has the ability infect other beings and turn them into themselves,\
      \ causing paranoia and group tension as they do not know who to trust.\u201D\

      \ target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Nerd Reactor</a><br><br>\u201CReason\
      \ to love: It's The Thing in video game form. You're a group of humans trying\
      \ to survive and escape a space station, but one of you is actually an alien\
      \ in disguise, whose goal is to infect the other players. Love that premise.\u201D\

    review: The story of how this game died is pretty much the story of Macbeth. just
      replace King Duncan with the lead dev, Macbeth with the lead mod, and the community
      with Banquo.
