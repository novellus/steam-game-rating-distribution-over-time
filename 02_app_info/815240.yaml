    review: 'This is one of several games available from this developer and available
      in the Simulators Bundle on their storefront. Like most of the others games
      I have played thus far this feels more like a demo or a prototype than an actual
      game, which is unfortunate because it would have great potential if fully fleshed
      out into an arcade-like simulator game with aspects of business management.
      It is one of the cheaper games in the bundle, but I still cannot recommend it
      at its current full price.


      The handful of missions require you to chop down and cut up a number of trees
      within a certain time limit. It''s essentially rinse and repeat, and more along
      the lines of an arcade type of simulator. The game does add another level of
      play to it in that you can unlock several buildings in your "business" which
      increases the yield of logs you harvest and allows you to turn them into furniture
      and such. However, each mission only allows a set number of logs to enter into
      your inventory, regardless of the number of trees that you harvest (you need
      to harvest more with each mission), so it''s better just to farm the first couple
      of missions which only take a minute or two to maximize your production inventory.


      Once again, this is just another game that is fun for the hour or two it takes
      to beat the missions, but has no replay value or long term play value after
      that, so is only worth the price when included in the bundle during the big
      steam sales. It''s unfortunate that this is another game that starts with a
      great concept, but the execution simply isn''t followed through to the end to
      unlock that potential and bring something new and different to the simulator
      genre.'
