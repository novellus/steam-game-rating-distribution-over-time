Much more fun than I expected it to be. Imagine a board game, Lovecraftian horror, mystery novels and Film Noir thrown into a witch's cauldron, along with the usual eye of newt and milk of a dragonfly, and shaken really well!\n\nGameplay:\nThe game feels and plays much like a board game. You control newspaper reporters who are in fact part of secret outfit that protects against supernatural threats.\n\nGameplay is complex, and involves moving your agents on several locations on the map, equiping them with items and dealing with encounters/adversaries, supernatural phenomena, events, obstacles, etc.\nYou also publish newspaper articles with your exploits and photographs that you may manage to take while solving cases. This is one of your sources of income that allows you to equip, train and care for your reporters.\n\nThere is a big in-game manual that I advise everyone to read, before starting the actual game. It is rather big and impossible to digest entirely in one go (you will visit it again many times, for sure) but even skimming through it, will give you at least an idea of what it is that you are supposed to do.\nThe tutorial mission also explains a lot of things as you play but you will find yourself clicking the \"read more\" item on the cards that takes you to the relevant sections of the in-game manual.\n\nFully describing gameplay here would essentially need to rewrite the in-game manual. Rest assured the game features several mechanics that will keep you engaged.\n\nGraphics:\nIn the graphic department the game opts in for retro graphics with a film noir style (Did I mention one of your reporters is named Sam Spade? :D).\nI believe the style fits the game nicely but art style is something objective. It may not work for everyone.\n\nMusic/Sound Design:\nIn this department the game is taking a very casual approach. Like soft piano music playing in the background, mixed with somekind of eerie ambience and very minimal sampled sound effects like the occasional sound you would hear in a newspaper office during the 40s.\n\nStory:\nThere's really no consistent story. The game generates random cases that you have to solve. Each case is a short story involving the murder, the supernatural, cults etc.\n\nPros:\n-Manages to blend several elements in a very nice way.\n-Feels and plays like a complex board game.\n-Randomly generated content keeps replayability high.\n-Good in-game manual\n\nNeutral:\n-Retro style graphics are not everyone's cup of tea.\n\nCons:\nI really could not find something I could consider a con.\n\nConclusion:\nI have played many different games in the past 2 weeks and this one is the one I have enjoyed the most. Solid gameplay, intelligent and I love it's art style, the Lovecraftian and Film Noir references and basically everything about it!\n\nScore:\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nMusic: 5/10\nConcept/Story: 9/10","timestamp_created":1609138856,"timestamp_updated":1609138856,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhMyJ1PYCc7SCvgI="}
