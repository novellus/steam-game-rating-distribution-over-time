      \ Aspida\u2019s dangers, players will search the island for weapons and components\

    short_description: Ambrosia is an action game about fighting fire with fire -
      or science with science - with ingenius weapon building. As engineer Iris, craft
      screen-filling death dealers, single-fire precision weapons, or something altogether
      different. There are no wrong answers, just a lot of fun ones!
