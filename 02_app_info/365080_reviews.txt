(Picture [i] Inglorious Basterds [/i] in text form, stripped of verbal pizzazz, and with Leopold II taking the place of the fuhrer).\n\nI'll concede upfront that it's not a particularly good [i] game. [/i] The basic mechanic involves clicking on various villages, recruiting any of the locals that feel like joining your army, and then attacking whichever colonial official is labelled \"Very Easy\" at that moment. (The game calculates this automatically, depending on how many soldiers and weapons you've got with you at the time). The battles themselves require a bit of quick-thinking resource management, as various options pop up while the two sides trade attacks. Increase your defense, or call in reinforcements? Make yourself invulnerable for four rounds, or take a chunk out of your enemy's stamina stats? This is pretty much the only part of the game that requires any degree of skill, and the lack of clear instructions meant that it took me an hour or so until I realized that I was even supposed to be making some of these choices at all. Once you get the hang of it, though, the game becomes incredibly easy (probably mind-numbingly so for some players).\n\nThere's no animation or sound effects to accompany any of this, just a mournful classical music loop that gets pretty annoying after awhile. However, the game is just short enough (1-2 hours) that I didn't get bored, though that's probably due to the fact that I'm a history nerd with a soft spot for a good colonial uprising. I particularly enjoyed the way that the victories snowballed into each other, with your army becoming larger, more and more villagers joining your side, and the momentum of inevitable victory beginning to take hold. (None of this is really communicated by the game; my imagination had to do the work). The final battle against Leopold himself is totally ridiculous from a factual standpoint, but also cathartic: who [i] doesn't [/i] want to take some revenge for Congo's historical suffering, if only through a cheap Steam game?\n\n[i] Unheard Screams [/i] is a curio, and probably won't be enjoyable unless you've got a particular interest in both colonial history and experimental video games. I'm gonna go out on a wild limb here and guess that's quite a niche market -- but it also happens to be one that I squarely belong to. So it's a \"thumbs up\" from me, and a bit of a warning to everyone else.","timestamp_created":1514019554,"timestamp_updated":1554499208,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.606459617614746094","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtPDX9+kCeJmQkwE="}
