    review: 'A great game a little on the shorter side but as far as these visual
      novels go, it was amazing both the original and dragons treasure drew me in
      and i played them both for over 11 hours until completed, I highly reccomend
      these to anyone and if you haven''t played a visual novel before these are amazing
      starters. The writing and characters are just beyond amazing, and the story
      is exceptional. I hadn''t played a lot of visual novels before and after discovering
      these i am waiting with anticipation for the next ones.


      Edit: after playing more than just one route i have to say all the sables Grimoires
      are even more amazing than i originally believed, i find myself looking for
      even more like these stories, and have now played 20+ hours on each. after having
      seen the roadmaps i find myself wishing it could go faster but i am waiting
      with breath held for even more of these great stories.'
