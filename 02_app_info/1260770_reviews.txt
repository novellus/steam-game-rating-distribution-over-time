English subtitles are provided as well, and while the translation is a bit clumsy, they are clear enough to tell the story.\n\nThis story takes place in a country torn apart by war. It is winter, and food is scarce. The protagonist needs medicine for his family, and an acquaintance promises to provide it if he fetches a box with food from a nearby barn. While trying to do that, the protagonist ends up in an underground chamber with a radio unit.\n\nThere is almost no gameplay. At first you walk a few minutes along a linear path until you find the barn. A bit later you need to remove two barricades to get access to the radio unit. And then you listen to radio messages in Russian for 30 minutes, with long pauses between each message, while you don't have anything to do at all. Most of the messages aren't even related to the plot, they are just exposition to flesh out the setting, and they often introduce new characters that then don't appear again at all. After this, exactly one more action becomes available, and then the game ends.\n\nThe game does not have any puzzles, just 4 instances where you need to do very obvious interactions to open doors or break a barricade. There is no room to explore, as the entire game takes place on two extremely small maps with linear paths only.\n\nThere's little reason to talk about the graphics, as the screenshots already show most of what the game has to offer. Five of the six screenshots on the store page show the snowy scenery that you'll encounter during your 2-minute walk to the barn, and the sixth shows the room that you spend 30 minutes in while listening to the radio. The sound effects are fitting, and the voice acting seems decent, though that's hard to tell as I can't understand their language.\n\nThe game has no usability functions whatsoever. There is no way to rebind keys, no FOV slider, no y-axis inversion, and no way to save the game. Granted, for a 40-minute game with almost no interaction, most players can probably live without them.\n\nI can't recommend the game, as there is barely any content and almost nothing to do. This is more a proof of concept, or perhaps a short audio drama, rather than a game. That said, what's there is at least somewhat competently done, and it seems that the author would be able to produce something worth buying if he put more effort into it - a _lot_ more.","timestamp_created":1594319680,"timestamp_updated":1594320778,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.666218340396881104","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsY67mvMCe5SPlAI="}
