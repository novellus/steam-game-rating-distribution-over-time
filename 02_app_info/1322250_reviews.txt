It features an alternate start that integrates early acquisition of the Big Red carrier/dreadnought into both the story campaign and sandbox play. It is initially able to build the Vulture heavy fighter, Welder repair fighter, and Loader EMP ramming fighter. It starts out only armed with a heavy drill array for mining and ramming, and a small autolaunching hanger of Loaders to support disabling targets for ramming.\n\nFrom a quality of life perspective it can mine immediately on its own and automatically access the auto-dock feature of bases as an oversized ship. It can be heavily upgraded while docked at a base to add multiple turrets and unlock onboard production of the remaining Diggers ship designs noted in the DLC description. This is balanced by most of the upgrades being relatively expensive to obtain in the early game, and the carrier fleet upkeep cost being an ongoing drain of credits during the early game before you have a proper economy set up. \n\nFrom the story campaign perspective, uncomplicated direct access to a second ship list for variety is welcome. From a handling perspective, their ships are tough but generally focused on ramming and close ranged combat. Behind the scenes, the engine updates for this DLC add a few additional functions to the modder's toolbox that will be useful.\n\nUnfortunately, this DLC does not add the Diggers as an independent pirate faction on the map, and does not add bases for them. The DLC explains this away by presenting this as the last Digger carrier when you acquire it. The overall Digger ship list also lacks ships for the ship capture and base capture roles. The community will have to rely on modders to extend the Diggers for these aspects, hopefully doing so in a manner that does not rip off the DLC itself.\n\nMy only serious complaint is that the first person camera position for Big Red was set at a point on the ship model where a set of heavy safety cage bars are obscuring most of the camera. While 'realistic', it borders on unusable - it obscures too much of the screen from combat awareness, and gets in the way of lining up the drill array for mining or ramming. I found myself defaulting to chase camera view while piloting it, which is something I normally don't do for most of the other ships in this game.\n\nCertainly worth the value of the asking price, in my book.","timestamp_created":1591308422,"timestamp_updated":1608100207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.645365595817565918","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4mbuPtfYCee2YjAI="}
