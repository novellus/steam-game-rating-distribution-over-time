    review: 'Truly garbage tier level. It''s honestly a shock as to how much more
      awful it runs compared to the screenshots. It chugs like crazy, and the writing
      and voice acting, what little there was of each, was insanely bad. This was
      Unreal Engine 4!


      Story? Lol, what story?

      Any level of quality in gameplay? I wish.

      Did I enjoy this? How do I say this in Spanish? NO.
