    review: Loading this aircraft in, it looked great and the cockpit looks nice,
      but some autopilot functions like speed hold and flying with autopilot full,
      but no heading mode just do not work. there are some glitches that need to be
      fixed in order for it to be a complete aircraft. Overall this needs some changes,
      and one of them is a price drop
