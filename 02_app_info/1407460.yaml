    about_the_game: "Next Halloween is cancelled!<br />\r\nWhile enjoying a long holiday,\
      \ the Jack-O-Lanterns are confronted with a terrible truth. What is the purpose\
      \ of the Jack-O-Lanterns' existence without Halloween? The battle for the survival\
      \ of their identity has begun.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Jack-O-Lanterns work to\
      \ make money. They sell the local vegetables from the Halloween world to the\
      \ humans. This requires them to sort the vegetables they harvest by type. Please,\
      \ you can help them with that. Oops, there are some people who will interfere\
      \ with you during the game. Watch out!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA casual puzzle game\
      \ with the exhilarating feeling of continuous combos and dancing jack-o-lanterns\
      \ is addictive. Use the lever to switch the flow of vegetables flowing over\
      \ the conveyor to guide them to the appropriate box. Achieve your goal and get\
      \ your Halloween back!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can choose the difficulty level\
      \ by yourself. Even if you choose a stage with a low difficulty level, you will\
      \ be able to see the event until the end as long as you fulfill the conditions,\
      \ so it is recommended for light users. By the way, the stage in the promotion\
      \ video is the middle level of difficulty. Of course, there are more difficult\
      \ stages available. Even the most confident players will be satisfied with the\
      \ game!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is the story of a slightly strange world that\
      \ is a little off-axis from our world. When you have a little time, take a look\
      \ at this world."
