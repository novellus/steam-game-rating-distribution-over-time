    about_the_game: Tabletop Basketball VR brings a basketball experience that you're
      use to, from the TV down to a virtual table.  It's like having little toy basketball
      players come to life.  The game features a semi-simulation style basketball
      game.  The games are shorter than a normal basketball game to play a more action-oriented
      fast pace game that's a good fit for VR.  We are focused on quick play and fast
      load times to get you into the action as fast as possible.<br><br>Game Features:<br><br><ul

    review: "[h1]Experienced on the Oculus Rift[/h1]\n\nYou can view my gameplay &\
      \ review here: https://youtu.be/yOUnZmhBzjE\n\n[b][u]Positives:[/u][/b]\n+ Looks\
      \ beautiful\n+ Runs at a steady 90 frames per second\n+ Great concept (NBA Jam\
      \ / Playgrounds but in VR)\n\n[b][u]Negatives:[/u][/b]\n- It doesn't work\n\n\
      Yeah, LOL. It just doesn't work. I really wanted to like this game. It's running\
      \ on the Unity Engine, but it does look beautiful. There's only one court /\
      \ map / environment though. There's a few different teams, but the players look\
      \ pretty similar and they are difficult to distinguish. There's only one mode:\
      \ practice. Ranked does not work. The only settings available are the sound\
      \ settings. \n\nMotion controllers are used mostly as a gamepad. The only time\
      \ you're not is when you're using a \"circle\" laser pointer to help in deciding\
      \ where to pass it to or which defender to switch to. There is no locomotion,\
      \ so you're in only one spot, however you get a nice 3rd person view of all\
      \ the action so that's not a big deal.\n\nIt doesn't matter because like I said,\
      \ the game just doesn't work. Balls will bounce out of bounds on the majority\
      \ of missed shots. Dunks have a very high miss rate whether guarded or not.\
      \ Your opponent will sometimes get the ball back on made baskets or the ball\
      \ going out of bands (when they last touched it). The  ball will bounce on the\
      \ rim and get stuck on the rim. The AI will stay stuck and your opponent will\
      \ get a shot clock violation. You can double the opponent's ball handler and\
      \ they will never pass to the open teammate. The game will get completely stuck\
      \ and you'll have to quit and restart.\n\nAnyways, you can just see my video\
      \ and you'll get to see the bugs for yourself. Every game that I played was\
      \ bugged. Bugs are prevalent. There's so many that I can't possibly name them\
      \ all. I only played 4-5 games. It's in Early Access, but there hasn't been\
      \ an update since last September of 2019. [b][u]Refund requested.[/u][/b]\n\n\
      [b]Rate 2/10. It doesn't work. At least it looks pretty and runs well. [/b]"
