I just wonder who they're playing with. \nFor the last 3 days I have been sat at home under quarrantine so I've had plenty of time to keep an eye on this - The most I've seen online was 3 people. \nYes, 3. \nDuring peak hours too - 19:00 GMT. \nSo disregard my initial review that there's always enough players for a fun match and I re-iterate - a tragic shame.
