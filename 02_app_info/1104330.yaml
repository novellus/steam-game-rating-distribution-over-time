      \ they have nothing but the clothes on their backs. You take control and tell\
      \ them to gather materials and build walls, floors and furniture.<br><br>You\
      \ are not limited to predefined buildings! Design your own houses and style\

      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Raise your Family</h2><br>Villagers go through a lot\
      \ together, so they value their friendships very high. Some might even decide\

      \ the group!<br><br>The little ones are the future of the village, so make sure\

      \ /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Set up your Farm</h2>Food matters. Good food makes\
      \ colonists happy, wrong food makes colonists sick, little food makes colonists\
      \ slow, and no food makes colonists die.<br><br>Grow a variety of seasonal crops\
      \ and set up a kitchen to make delicious meals. Be sure to stock up before winter\

      \ for winter.<br><br>Try to keep production up so you\u2019ll always have something\
