    about_the_game: "STORY<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe world is dying. Many years after\
      \ the banishment of the evil that plagued the land, the world was hit by waves\
      \ of unbearable heat. Crops are withering, rivers and wells drying and the cattle\
      \ is slowly dying out from illness.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring his desperate\
      \ work to save his family farm from the heat, young farmer named Jory was suddenly\
      \ visited by a mysterious stranger claiming that the land could be saved and\
      \ that he is the one who can help save it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDespite his skepticism,\
      \ in desperation he accepted the strangers offer and was instantly transferred\
      \ to a strange flying metal contraption where three other people waited.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThe stranger explained to them that the thing that plagues\
      \ this world is not a natural, but man made disaster. An evil and immortal tyrant,\
      \ together with his evil legions from times past is manipulating the Sun that\
      \ heats their world and the very fabric of time. All to fulfill his goal of\
      \ utter time and space domination. Coming from a time where the tyrant already\
      \ established domination, the stranger known as Cooper came back in an attempt\
      \ to rewrite time and thus save both present and the future from utter destruction.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nHe explained to his four guests that even though they are\
      \ not warriors they all carry genes of great heroes of the past. Using his superior\
      \ technology he can make Jory and his new friends capable of combating any threat\
      \ that comes their way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGAMEPLAY<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach\
      \ character will choose his own unique class among the rich variety that &quot;The\
      \ Space Crusade&quot; offers. Despite this, they will not only be defined by\
      \ their class of choice, but also with their inherent abilities (i.e. farmer\
      \ Jory will be more sturdy then his companions, while grifter Laura will be\
      \ more agile then the rest). Every class will be able to use a wide variety\
      \ of abilities that will enable them to combat their more technologically advanced\
      \ foes. The number of possible encounters is fixed, so there will not be any\
      \ tedious level grinding. After each level up the player will choose new skills,\
      \ and with it the way their characters develop combat-wise. Goal of the game\
      \ is to reach the Sun where the tyrant resides while combating his legions,\
      \ both human and mutated monstrosities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCHARACTERS<br />\r\
      \n<br />\r\nJory - small town farmer with a wild youth, but after his father\
      \ died he settled down to run his family farm in his honor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nDante - young scholar with an interest in engineering. He accepted Cooper's\
      \ call to observe his advanced technology.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLaura - grifter\
      \ from the Capital City that joined Cooper to flee the guards chasing her after\
      \ her last scam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVictoria - initiate in a secluded temple\
      \ yearning for adventure and an opportunity to help her fellow man.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\nCooper - time-traveling stranger from a ruined future. He traveled\
      \ back in time to stop the problem at its root. Pilot of the vessel &quot;Solarius&quot;,\
      \ and leader of the team."
