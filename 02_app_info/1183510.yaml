    review: "Little Town Hero is Game Freak's recent outing from-\n\nOh? You didn't\
      \ want me to hear me talk about this game? You want me to talk about Pokemon?\
      \ Can that wait until the end please? Thank you.\n\nLittle Town Hero is Game\
      \ Freak's recent outing from their \u201CGear Project\u201D system. Mixing the\
      \ strategy from both card and board games, Little Town Hero offers a very unique\
      \ RPG experience. Even as someone who loves the game on the Switch, I can only\
      \ recommend it with caution because of the battle system. If you're into card\
      \ and board games that's long and has loads of strategy, then you can jump right\
      \ in, otherwise stay away from it. The lack of a free demo doesn't help either\
      \ because this is a game that sorely needed it. As of this writing there's an\
      \ issue with the pricing for certain regions, so don't spend over 30 bucks for\
      \ this until this is fixed. I even feel that the price is really steep, topping\
      \ on this being a divisive title is a gamble.\n\nThe battle system is something\
      \ I must comment on because this is the meat of the game. I'm aware that some\
      \ were turned off or intimidated because it sounds overly complex. The truth\
      \ is, the battles are easy to learn but VERY hard to master. Let me walk you\
      \ through it because this is the biggest thing I need to tackle the game for.\n\
      \n[u]Attacking with Ideas:[/u] You have three Idea types to use. Red is Attack\
      \ that can be used once per turn, Yellow is Defense that can be used many times\
      \ and Blue is Support that can do various effects while drawing a random Idea\
      \ from your Headspace (think of this as your draw pile). All your Ideas all\
      \ start out of Izzits. As long as an Idea remains an Izzit, they can't be used\
      \ but are immune to most attacks. You need to turn an Izzit into a Dazzit by\
      \ spending Power to activate them. At the start you can only use 3 Power per\
      \ turn, but every three turns it'll got up by 1 until you reach the maximum\
      \ of 6. As you can guess, more Power means you can activate a quantity of Dazzits\
      \ or more powerful ones in a single Turn. \n\nOnce you break all the enemies\
      \ ideas, then you can attack them if you got a leftover Red Ideas to use. This\
      \ doesn't mean a direct hit on the enemies Health, you also need to reduce their\
      \ Guts, which are shields to protect it. If you get an All Break but don't have\
      \ a Red Idea to use, you gain a Break Point instead, which can be used to swap\
      \ Ideas from your Headspace or Revive them.\n\nAs your Ideas are used up, you'll\
      \ eventually run out of them. You need to revive them by either using the aforementioned\
      \ BP, have your Hearts damaged or get it from some Support effects. Knowing\
      \ this, you need to your Ideas effectively. Keep in mind that due to the sheer\
      \ randomness of the game, you're not guaranteed to achieve an All Break on every\
      \ turn or you can strike the enemy.\n\n[u]Think Things Though:[/u] With that\
      \ said, this is where the battles show a weak spot. This game encourages you\
      \ to look at the fight from every angle. From the map view, to your Ideas, Support\
      \ and the enemies, there's a lot to consider and decide which is the best course\
      \ of action. If you don't take this into account and carelessly choose Ideas\
      \ left and right, you'll end up painting yourself in a corner when you get low\
      \ on Ideas and have no choice but to Struggle to either Revive them, or lose\
      \ the fight entirely. You don't want to do that. With that said, this game would\
      \ either make you feel clever for taking your time with things, or make you\
      \ feel stupid for making a rash move.\n\n[u]Eureka!:[/u] Starting in Chapter\
      \ 2, you'll gain access to the Eureka Tree which lets you spend Eureka Points\
      \ to buff your Ideas. While this is super helpful for fights later down the\
      \ line, the problem I have is that it's rather unbalanced on how much you get\
      \ them. After you fight bosses or complete side quests, you get Eureka Points\
      \ that you can use. The issue is that you're not going to be able to max everything\
      \ out at the end of the game unless you deliberately lose the fight, which gives\
      \ you more depending on how much damage you were able to deal to them.\n\nEven\
      \ worse is that some of the hardest side quests in the game (like Visualization\
      \ which lets you re-fight old bosses in a weaker state) don't give you enough\
      \ points to make it feel like it was worth it. The finding chickens quest? Gives\
      \ you 3 Points, but that's not a lot at this point in the game. That's really\
      \ generous compared to the really hard Visualization side quests, in which you\
      \ only get 1. There's two more Visualization bosses you get after beating the\
      \ final boss, but at this point you can't even use those points because there's\
      \ nothing left to do. I really feel cheated here because I feel that instead\
      \ of reaching my full potential by working hard, I had to take the easy way\
      \ out. This rookie mistake stood out to me the most. Having be able to max out\
      \ at the end would really make the adventure feel worth it because you're constantly\
      \ getting stronger, and I hate it when the game doesn't let me do that fairly.\
      \ It's not a deal breaker, but it's disappointing to me.\n\n[u]Sidenote:[/u]\
      \ LTH runs way better on PC. Unity games don't run as well on consoles for some\
      \ reason. The game is initially capped at windowed 720p, but can be changed\
      \ in the options on the main menu.\n\nAlright, let's talk about Pokemon so that\
      \ Gigantimaxed Copperjah will get out of my front yard.\n\nThis game was released\
      \ and developed around the same time as Sword and Shield. This wouldn't be an\
      \ issue if those games didn't have the infamous \u201CDexit\u201D controversy\
      \ that limited the number of Pokemon in the games. This made people assume that\
      \ LTH is why the cut happened. This is why Little Town Hero got so much hate.\
      \ Guys, let's be real here.\n\nGame Freak stated in several interviews that\
      \ Dexit was unavoidable because they can't stop adding new Pokemon in the games.\
      \ They even said this wasn't a decision they made lightly. LTH wasn't the cause\
      \ of it but the Pokemon games themselves. Remember Gear Project that I mentioned\
      \ from above? It's a system that allows Game Freak to make games outside of\
      \ the Pokemon mainline. They made Tembo, Giga Wrecker, Pokemon Quest and Pocket\
      \ Card Jockey during the development span of the 3DS Pokemon games, and the\
      \ Dex cut did not happen then. If Gear Project is to blame, then the cut would've\
      \ happened sooner when Harmoknight was developed during X&Y.\n\nEven if LTH\
      \ wasn't made during SwSh and GF hired more programmers, Dexit is still going\
      \ to happen. The decision to support a handful of Pokemon is to give the developers\
      \ a break from facing monotony to update all 800 species to get them to working\
      \ on the Switch's hardware. That's a horrible thing to put on them along with\
      \ crunch.\n\nGame Freak did not split the team in half when SwSh and LTH were\
      \ in the works. Not only LTH was made by 60 people, but the credits for both\
      \ games show that over 20 people worked on both titles, including key people\
      \ like Satoshi Tajiri, Ken Sugimori and Jun'chi Masuda. This misconception came\
      \ from the \u201CTeam A (Gear Project) and Team B (Pokemon)\u201D that was said\
      \ in one interview. It's just another way of saying that two different groups\
      \ are working on different projects within the company. It had nothing to do\
      \ with quality.\nProtip: Never say that the others teams is inferior to Team\
      \ A in any industry. You're basically saying the people in those other teams\
      \ are terrible even if they were assigned to them against their will.\n\nI can\
      \ go on but I'm hitting the review limit here. Criticize the game for flaws\
      \ and other issues all you want, but remember that game development is very\
      \ complicated and I only scratched the surface of it. I'll leave it that even\
      \ if Masuda wasn't the producer for SwSh, even if LTH wasn't a thing and they\
      \ got tons of people on board, they'd still agree that the Dex cut had to be\
      \ done. It sucks, even I was disappointed. Yet I understand why this has to\
      \ happen. It's not worth the stress of reviewing all 800 models and animations\
      \ just to continue the tradition Pokemon has up until now."
