    review: 'So there is a lot to say about this game, at the beginning i buyed the
      game because the idea was to buy a very skill/ability dependent and challenging
      game to play with my brother.

      the game''s graphics is not absurde or crisis-like but he has all that he needs,
      this isn''t a game born to have a beatiful visual, this is born to challenge
      you, stage after stage, world after world.

      the first 10 min with my brother was like:"meh, it''s cool but there isn''t
      anything special...", well at 15 min in the game, when the difficulty started
      to be pretty challenging, me and my brother were:"wow this is cool and hard
      but i''m better than you, how about a challenge?"; we made 2 profile on the
      same game and we started tryhard to finish all the game and his achievement,
      after the full finish of the game i was like:"let me see how much time we spend
      on this game..." i looked the timer and there was 150 hours so i decided to
      make a good review, so what can i say about this pure skill game... it''s fantastic
      in his context, very hard(very very very very hard) but also not too much frustrating,
      the controls are very fluid and there is also a lot of things too unlock(spaceship,
      powerups, guns, etc.) so you can adapt your play style to your ship and personalize
      your expirience.

      the artistic side is very good too, the ship are well designed, the music is
      very good.

      it''s all like an old 8-bit game like asteroid made in 2k17;


      the only cons is the story... it''s not very structurated and not well telled...
      but it''s not a big problem for the gameplay
