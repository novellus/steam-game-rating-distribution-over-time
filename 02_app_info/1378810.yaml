    review: "To start off with, this game is a cluttered piece of shit. The UI is\
      \ horrible, so is the object placement, and in general the jumpscares are actual\
      \ dogshit. The monsters look like autistic toys made by a 13 year old, obviously\
      \ just Unity assets and nothing else. Never buy this piece of shit game and\
      \ save your money for helping kids in Africa rather than supporting a shitty\
      \ developer. I'd rather stay in a class with a gorilla who teaches English and\
      \ has mental problems in a fucking 8th grade class instead of giving you my\
      \ money and letting you freely copyright strike any criticism related videos\
      \ towards your horrible excuse of a game that you can't handle like a real developer\
      \ should. \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0643"
