Resolution suffers a little in widescreen, but it's not distorted.  In this entry in the series, you head off to answer a distress call from your niece, whose long-time boyfriend has disappeared.  By the time you arrive, ravens are terrorizing the town, most of the townsfolk have disappeared, and there are weird curses (and sparkly HO scenes) everywhere.  The game blends a few genres, but it's mostly \"present world meets fantasy world that we just weren't aware of\".  The game has some weaknesses, but I have no hesitation recommending it.\n\nPros:\n- lovely art and scenery, nice music\n- standard but enjoyable story\n- bonus chapter is short but has plenty to do\n- hidden object scenes are varied and fun (shapes, word lists, and interactive)\n- minigames (puzzles) are varied, if on the easy side [and see under Cons, below]\n- interactive map and three choices of difficulty\n- in-game achievements\n- collectibles are the right level of difficulty (9 statuettes plus one squirrel per main scene)\n\nCons:\n- objects were rarely re-usable\n- one puzzle used throughout the game was \"connect the dots\"; this was neither fun nor interesting, and if I weren't a die-hard achievement hunter I would have skipped them\n\nNeutral:\n- there is more back-tracking than in some games, but it usually made sense; I only found myself going to the guide a couple of times, and only because I'd had to leave the game for a day and needed to re-orient; in casual mode, there isn't a problem, because the map will show you were you have actions to take\n\nOverall:  A standard HOPA game that's nice to look at and relaxing to play.  If it weren't for the connect-the-dot puzzles, I'd rate it higher. 8/10","timestamp_created":1606635216,"timestamp_updated":1606635357,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.624354362487792969","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tMC7ifYCcZuDtQI="}
