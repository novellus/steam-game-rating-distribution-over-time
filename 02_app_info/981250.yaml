    about_the_game: 'C.Q.C. - Close Quarters Combat is a fun and action-packed top-down
      shooter experience, which you can play together with up to four players in a
      local split-screen match. It provides a variety of maps divided into various
      settings, where each setting has its own Co-Op and PvP map/s. In each map, you
      are able to choose your player from eight different unique characters and equip
      them from a selection of six different guns, which you are able to upgrade after
      each Co-Op mission. C.Q.C. has a full controller support and can also be played
      with keyboard and mouse.<h2 class="bb_tag">Play with Your Friends in Co-Op</h2><strong>Connect
      up to four controllers, call your friends and let the zombie-hunting party begin:
      The Co-Op mode is here!</strong><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/981250/extras/COOP_Description.gif?t=1590825584"
      /><br><br>Make your way together with three friends in six different Co-Op scenarios.
      In each scenario, you have to complete objectives, kill zombies and fight a
      final boss at the end of the map.<br>During gameplay, killed zombies will drop
      different kinds of materials which you can pick up and improve your weapons
      with. Once you finish all six scenarios, you are able to play them again and
      again to gather more and more materials to make your weapons even better and
      beat the maps on a higher difficulty.<br><br><strong>But wait, what about the
      solo players?</strong><br>Each Co-Op scenario can also be played as a single-player
      experience, which doesn''t differ, a single bit, from the Co-Op gameplay.<h2
      class="bb_tag">Play Against Your Friends in PvP</h2><strong>You want to shoot
      your friends instead of playing with them in a Co-Op game? No worries, the PvP
      mode is the right one for you!</strong><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/981250/extras/Description_PvP.gif?t=1590825584"
      /><br><br>Each player is able to choose his weapon and select one from eight
      characters: a military guy and girl, a police guy and girl, a beach boy and
      girl and a business dude or women. Each faction has its own unique PvP skill
      which can be used during the match.<br>With this release of the game, you are
      able to fight on 9 different maps in different styles and settings.<h2 class="bb_tag">Let''s
      get gory!</h2><strong>What would be a zombie PvP shooter without a proper gore
      system?</strong><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/981250/extras/StoreDescription_Headshot.gif?t=1590825584"
      /><br><br>In C.Q.C. you can rip apart zombies by shooting them arms of or perform
      a nice headshot which comes with a sick slow-motion effect. Blood will splatter
      everywhere when you hit a zombie in Co-Op mode or another player in PvP mode.
      So go out and tint the world red!<h2 class="bb_tag">Upgrade Your Weapons</h2><strong>Co-Op
      and PvP is not enough, but you''re addicted to C.Q.C.? Then &quot;weapon upgrades&quot;
      is the answer!</strong><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/981250/extras/Description_WeaponShowcase.gif?t=1590825584"
      /><br><br>Gather five different materials by killing zombies in Co-Op game mode
      to upgrade your weapons with better stats and make them look more and more badass.
      With increased weapon stats, you are able to master higher difficulties, which
      will give you better materials to improve your weapons even more.<h2 class="bb_tag">So
      what you are waiting for? Grab your controller, get C.Q.C. and have a good time!</h2>'

      \ erschrocken \xFCber die Schlange in Bog Forest. Habe nicht damit gerechnet\
      \ :D\nDie Sniper geht richtig ab wenn die gelevelt ist. Mit der Tactical Axe\
      \ habe ich aktuell noch nicht so viel gespielt da es im PVP Modus einfacher\
      \ ist mit den Schuss Waffen. Im Coop Game ist es aber sehr lustig mit der Tac\
      \ Axe (nur wenn beide eine haben) :D.\n\nWeiter so!"
