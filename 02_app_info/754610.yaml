    review: "its all very buggy and rubbish, the idea looks great, but not been able\
      \ to get past the start of the story, it still needs more work, i dont recommend\
      \ buying this game yet, unless its sorted ,\n\nthere is alot to do as i said,\
      \ controls need to be able to be edited, the volume bar dont wory for the sound,\
      \ needs a volume bar per sound stuff, like sfc, music, voice, envoiment, i wish\
      \ i never purchased this, sadly lost out on the money paid for it, \n\nits fine\
      \ up until you done the check on the ventation system and then it blows up,\
      \ thats were it all started to go wrong, for me, i went back to my room and\
      \ my suit came off the ai that wanted you to go to the doctors the first time,\
      \ that part repeated it self , even  knnow half way the route it was cut off.\
      \ \nsorry i dont recommend it, i fully recommend ignoring it and staying away,\
      \ \ndo not purchase ."
