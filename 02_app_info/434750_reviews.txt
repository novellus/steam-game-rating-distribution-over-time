It's now 13 hours later... JUST BUY IT! \n\nAs a kid who owned a Spectrum 48k in the early to mid 80s, and the fact that I love R-Type, this game felt like it was designed for me. I dropped a few $ expecting a little shoot-em-up that would get my nostalgic juices flowing, and found a schmup that has all of that including a depth and a difficulty scale that is going to have me coming back for more and more. I can't recommend this game enough. Even if the Speccy vibe doesn't interest you, if you love schmups there is a lot to recommend here. (P.S. Loved the Horace, Willy and Jetman in the tutorial!)","timestamp_created":1487336855,"timestamp_updated":1609573334,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwv/+C4fYCdsKwcg=="}
