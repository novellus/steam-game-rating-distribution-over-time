Not yet-another-schematic-stuff. Same old sci-fi or fantasy setting.\n\nThis is basically twin stick shooter mixed with a lite rpg, but this last thing is optional. You like dark humour and reading? Don't skip the quest part. Don't like? Skip it. Kinda 2 games in one, almost.\n\n\nThe steering is much alike any other twin stick shooter, with a little difference needed to support camera rotation.\n\nAt the beginning you must watch out not to fall down, but once you get a grip, this stops to be a problem. \nThe game is easy at the beginning and becomes difficult around level 3, which I like. You can learn the basics fluenty, then just focus on annihilating enemies.","timestamp_created":1587929076,"timestamp_updated":1587929076,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.48908647894859314","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwktr82/ECdN7YgwI="}
