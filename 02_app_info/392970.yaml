    about_the_game: New York City, sometime in the 1950s. A wave of mysterious murders
      has swept through the city. At each crime scene, only a pile of ash remains.
      Witnesses claim to have seen a ball of lightning. Could a human being be capable
      of such a thing? Who is behind the cryptic killings? Are they connected with
      a strange incident which took place during an execution at the Sing Sing penitentiary?
      The police are unable to answer any of these questions... and so the White Stone
      Order takes the reins. Fearless journalist Laura is again brought in to investigate
      murders nobody can explain! Immerse yourself in an exciting crime story and
      visit uncharted locations from 1950s New York!

    reviews: "\u201CWe got to say, New York Mysteries: High Voltage has one of the\
      \ best detective storylines we have seen in a HOPA in quite some time. The story\
      \ was intriguing and captivating and kept us on the edge of our seats right\
      \ from the beginning to the end. Moreover, the fantastic plot is accompanied\
      \ by some amazing cutscenes, flawless character animations and solid voice-overs.\
      \  The production of New York Mysteries: High Voltage is also praiseworthy.\
      \ The game takes place in the famous New York City and most of the locations\
      \ in the game are real-life locations. Thus, the game feels pretty real - which\
      \ is a breath of fresh air considering the amount of all the fantasy titles\
      \ we have been getting lately. Besides, the graphics are also sharp and clean,\
      \ while the soundtracks are fitting for the theme.\u201D<br>4.5/5 \u2013 <a\
