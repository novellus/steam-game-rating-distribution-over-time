It does seem to have more animals than CC so if you like the setting, this one I would rate as a better purchase of the two.\n\nIt has a loud and noisy puma that's clearly scared of you in it. Thing is fast so you'll have to be quick if you want to get it. The other loud and noisy being is the parks 'warden' that keeps talking. But if you don't bother with the story much, it's a one-time thing.\n\nHowever, me personally, I'd rather play Vurhonga or Silver Ridge Peaks over this map. Like I said with CC - I wish Steam had a 'mixed' rating because that's how I feel, this is a 'middle/bottom of the pack' map compared to the rest. It certainly does look pretty though. Maybe I'll go back to it at some point. For now though, I'll rate this up since there's more that I like vs dislike.","timestamp_created":1609773885,"timestamp_updated":1609773885,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ45ISA5/YCd8+1wAI="}
