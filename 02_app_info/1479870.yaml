    review: Nice somehow primitive graphics, not user friendly. Hard to find where
      to click (it IS a point&click!), active zones not present until the story progresses,
      so you just have to roam all the locations availables at the time again and
      again. No map, no jump, just slow walking. Too short, too easy puzzles, even
      if some objects where really hard to find/catch because of scene construction
      and lack of zoom. No speed control for the text, I missed half of the dialogs
      because they scrolled too fast. I love HOG, but this is not one of the good
      ones, at least not this version.
