The game was developed by ERS Game Studio and published by Big Fish Games Studio.\n\nSince this is a collector's edition, it comes with extra features that are not available in its' counterpart; the standard edition.\n\n[b][u]The Game Review[/u][/b]\n\nGame Visuals\n\nI want to mention that the visuals in the game are nicely done. The visuals can be adjusted in the game's option menu.\n\nGame Audio\n\nI want to mention that audio for the game is well done. Even though the audio is somewhat simplistic and repetitive. The audio can be adjusted in the game's option menu as well.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are four different game difficulty modes to choose from: Casual; Advanced; Hard and Custom.\n\nThe notebook keeps track of progression in the game. Such as story events and clues.\n\nThere is an interactive map in the game. It allows the player to fast travel between each location quickly, It also indicates that there are tasks that can be completed at certain locations within the game. The interactive map is not automatically given at the start of the game.\n\nThere is a padlock feature that available to lock the inventory panel in place to make it stationary,\n\nThere are interactive items in the game. Some of these interactive items may require extra components before they can be interacted with. All interactive items are marked with a symbol in one of the corners.\n\nThe hidden object scenes consist of the following: Shadow items; Pair items; Fragments items; Find 'x' amount items; Traditional word lists. Some of these hidden object scenes can be replayed in the game's extra feature section.\n\nThe puzzles are fairly easy to solve without having the need to skip any of them. Most of the puzzles can be replayed in the game's extra feature section as well.\n\nThere is a collectible in the game: Christmas Presents. They are scattered throughout the game for the player to find.\n\nThere is a bonus chapter in the game. But it can be accessed only after the main story is completed.\n\nThere are thirteen different achievements that can be unlocked from playing the game. Each of these achievements does come with some requirements that need to be completed before they can be unlocked. These achievements are in-game only.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThere are extra features in the game: Bonus Chapter; Bonus Hidden Object Scenes; Bonus Puzzles; Soundtracks; Concept Art; Wallpapers; Screen Saver; Cinematic Scenes and Game's Strategy Guide. Most of these extra features can be accessed only after the entire game is completed.\n\nFinal thoughts: I have found the game enjoyable to a certain extent. The replay value for the game is low. I would recommend this game, but not at the game's full price value.","timestamp_created":1547070843,"timestamp_updated":1600538030,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.575155436992645264","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw+4Xg0/QCeeX1twE="}
