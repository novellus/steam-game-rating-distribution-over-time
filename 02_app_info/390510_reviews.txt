Stay alive, and in power, for as long as possible.\n\nSounds pretty easy right?\n\nWell the game is a sort of turn based game, where you spend each round allocating different resources to different official or unofficial government branches. Each time some you do so, you'll make some people happy, and some other people less happy.\nThe key is to try and keep most people happy, or at the very least, the people who can protect you happy.\n\nDifferent factions or groups of people can turn against you, as well as you closest advisors might try and take power from you.\n\nSo if you've ever dreamed about being a real life dictator, well here's your chance.
