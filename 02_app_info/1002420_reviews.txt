Just a decent little material simulation puzzley action game, unfortunately something that's been done bigger and more popular since Agartha came out. Several wildly different characters although they may not be super well balanced (I found some characters could handle almost any situation while others could handle almost no situations). A cool game if you want to shoot dirt and freeze water.","timestamp_created":1585512043,"timestamp_updated":1585512043,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.628803789615631104","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4n7r4k/ECfuSZ/AE="}
