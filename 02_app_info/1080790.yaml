    review: By far, one of the best games I've ever played, and certainly the best
      visual novel. With a visual style that I, personally, loved, characters that
      are just fun to interact with, and a compelling story, I found myself unable
      to take a break from the game. In short, my only lament was that the game had
      an ending. I'll be sure to check out and play anything by the creator, should
      they publish any more games. I absolutely recommend Jack in a Castle; it's a
      fantastic game that, if you enjoy stories, you'll be unable to stop playing.
