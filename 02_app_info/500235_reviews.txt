Bought it then closed down, next day used it 30 minutes max, then changed to another plane and continued playing. Filed for a refund because it is not realistic (crap is what it is...) and Steam said since I had played the game for more than 2 hours I couldn't get a refund. People who left positive feedback must have been paid by the seller.","timestamp_created":1588021562,"timestamp_updated":1588021562,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwqcHd3vECfOn3gwI="}
