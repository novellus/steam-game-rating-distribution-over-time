    review: "TL;DR If you're into otome games, you'll probably enjoy this. \n\nQuick\
      \ note: I had an issue where the menu said the controls were different than\
      \ they actually were. I was playing using a controller and it said that Y/triangle\
      \ was the skip button, and X/square was the menu. It was reversed for me. I\
      \ don't know if this is a common issue but feel it's worth mentioning.\n\n[u]\
      \ Pros [/u]\n[list]\n[*] Mostly voice acted aside from the main character (Japanese)\n\
      [*] High production quality\n[*] Good and consistent art style\n[*] While trope-y,\
      \ the characters are likable\n[*] Auto-play and skip read features are nice\n\
      [/list]\n\n[u] Could Be a Pro or a Con [/u]\n[list]\n[*] If you're into otome\
      \ games, you probably know which ones you want to romance by looking at them\n\
      [*] Some storylines are more romantic than others, and can lead to the main\
      \ character feeling more or less impactful on the other characters/plot\n[/list]\n\
      \n[u] Cons [/u]\n[list]\n[*] Your mileage may vary on this, but the game is\
      \ very loosely based on real people and events. The romance options are based\
      \ on actual people, and if that makes you uncomfortable, this might not be for\
      \ you. That said they're very anime-fied and fit neatly into standard otome\
      \ tropes so it is easy to look past.\n[*] This is a personal peeve but there\
      \ are some potential love interests that will walk into the plot and promptly\
      \ exit if you don't pick the options related to them, never to be seen again\
      \ (unless you want to romance them in another playthrough). Feels a little weird\
      \ to meet a guy for one scene and never talk to him again when the game feels\
      \ like it's yelling at you to look at him.\n[*] This game has a sequel, so if\
      \ you're enjoying it I recommend grabbing Hakuoki: Edo Blossoms to know what\
      \ happens. The good endings do not actually end.\n[/list]\n\nI highly recommend\
      \ Aniva's achievement guide if you're into achievement hunting or just want\
      \ to see different routes!"
