    developer_response: "Hello, thanks for reviewing the game. \n\nWe'll take a look\
      \ at the AI and see what kind of tweaks and improvements can be made to it since\
      \ it's very important for the enjoyment of the game.\n\nThere is also access\
      \ to a shuriken toss which can be used with 'i' or 'y' (depending on if you're\
      \ using a keyboard or controller).\n\nThe game currently has 8 levels which\
      \ are selected at random (level selection could definitely be added though so\
      \ thank you for you comment about it).\n\nThe game forces a minimum of 2 players\
      \ (default is 4). The number of players is selected by highlighting player count\
      \ and pressing left or right (which can be done in the main menu or match over\
      \ menu).\n\nEven though you did not enjoy the game, we're thankful for your\
      \ review as feedback is something that we always appreciate. Once again, thank\
      \ you very much for taking the time to leave your thoughts."

    review: "Gameplay is way too simple, can only move, jump, and \"slash\" attack\
      \ (shoots out a bullet).\nOne hit kills you and gives the attacker one point.\
      \ Falling off the map subtracts one point. \nAI players tend to walk right off\
      \ the map without attempting attacking, so there's no point playing with them.\
      \ \nYou don't get to choose how many (if any) AI players to include.\nIt seems\
      \ that there's only 3 maps, with no option to select which map to play on, or\
      \ to create your own"
