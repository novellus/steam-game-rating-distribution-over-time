    review: 'Amazing Game!

      I''m a sucker for Sci-Fi, but this just really hit the sweet spot. i love how
      the story progresses and how the land feels like an actual alien planet. its
      a great game and varies in difficulty. i especially plan on replaying the game
      and doing the extra levels.'
