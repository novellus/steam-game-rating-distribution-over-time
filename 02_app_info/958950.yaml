    developer_response: 'Hey Alex


      This is something that was supposed to be fixed already and will be by the end
      of tomorrow, the 21st.  Never did we have the intention of selling the game
      manual at such a ludicrous price.


      Apologies to anyone who thought of this as a cheap money-grab'

    review: 'Now with the manual being free, my negative review about it being $6
      is no longer relevant. If you want to see the original review with dev response,
      its below:


      $6 for a game manual? I get that the bundle discount of $12 USD essentially
      negates the price, but this manual should be free for everyone, not locked away
      to artificially increase the price of the digital deluxe edition.'
