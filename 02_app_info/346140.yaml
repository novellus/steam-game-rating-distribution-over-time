    review: "TL;DR: Like every other bundle ever, a mixed bag. I suggest getting it\
      \ on sale due to issues players have with some of the titles. \n\n\nSeven older\
      \ HOGs for less that the price of a new one? Yes, please! I've wanted to play\
      \ some of these for years, so it's a treat to get the chance. I got this bundle\
      \ in a bundle of bundles, but it would be worth the sales or full price too.\
      \ I'll post reviews as I make progress.\n\n_____________\n\nMountain Crime:\
      \ Requital\n\nDid you ever want to be a doctor? Now's your chance! Only your\
      \ patient seems to be missing, hmm. Fun, old school charm to the graphics, does\
      \ have an odd flicker to the cut scenes though.\n\nPluses: Nice music, the graphics\
      \ are old school pretty. Wolves everywhere. Mini games and hidden object scenes\
      \ seem straightforward, though they are pictures of the objects, not word lists.\
      \ A loyal wolf friend named Wolfy. OK, that's what I named the hint button wolf,\
      \ but he sure comes in handy and recharges quickly enough in regular mode. \n\
      \nMinuses: Has an odd jump to the cut scenes like an overused VHS. The graphics\
      \ in the hidden object scenes can be a challenge if you have low vision like\
      \ me. Penalty for misclicks. Scenes can be a bit blurry.\n\nRoughly four and\
      \ a half hours playtime.\n\n_________________________\n\nVampire Saga: Pandora's\
      \ Box\n\nA game so meta even your pointer is a hidden object! Seriously though,\
      \ mouse over to options and deselect the custom pointer. It can be done.  Once\
      \ that is done, well, the game has been pretty boring so far. It's just dull\
      \ in pacing and the muddy graphics make each object hunt a slogfest. \n\nPluses:\
      \ A free bonus game in the package.\n\nMinuses: The hidden pointer. Blurry,\
      \ pixel hunt in the hidden object hunt scenes and items that are mislabeled\
      \ like a lantern being called a lamp. Super slow hint button. Just plain dull.\
      \ I wanted to scream by the third visit to the first hidden object screen. No\
      \ voice acting. Hard pass.\n\nPlayed about forty minutes before giving up in\
      \ boredom and frustration.\n\n_________________\n\nBehind the Reflection 2:\
      \ Witch's Revenge\n\nThe witch is out of jail and she's stolen your son! No,\
      \ seriously, stop giggling, that's the plot. No voice acting, but super bright\
      \ setting and search scenes are a breath of fresh air. Unfortunately, this game\
      \ crashes at random. Try a Win 7 compatibility fix and keep your fingers crossed.\
      \ \n\nPluses: Music is decent, nicer graphics than the last title, interesting\
      \ if goofy plot. You have a faster hint button. Hidden object scenes range from\
      \ four to five objects shown as grey images, to bigger ones with word lists.\
      \ \n\nMinuses: It seems set up to the point where you can leave a hidden object\
      \ area, enter one within it, or the next one without completing a task. This\
      \ was confusing at first as I thought the rest of the needed objects were in\
      \ the next room, indicated by sparkles. Later on, you do indeed need to leave\
      \ the search area to find items, so super confusing game at times.\n\nHint button\
      \ is faster, but teeny tiny sparkles that can be hard to spot. A little murky\
      \ in some searches. Very little voice acting. Crashes at random. I got lucky\
      \ my first time playing but went back in. Sort of hobbles along on a Win 7 compatibility\
      \ fix.\n\nAfter the first chapter in the house, the game sort of got bogged\
      \ down in the second. You assemble a drawing, then a chainsaw, then a skeleton's\
      \ armor, then a key. I'm not sure what happens after that, I gave up as it just\
      \ seemed bogged down in one area. \n\nI played an hour and a half.\n\n________________\n\
      \nTwisted Lands: Shadow Town\n\nPretty sure my loving wife pushed me off the\
      \ boat to certain death. Well, jokes on her as she crashed into the same island\
      \ I washed up on. Ha! Pretty fun hidden object compared to the last two. At\
      \ least for a while, it can drag a bit in parts, but the atmosphere was excellent.\
      \ \n\nPluses: Hint button seems to charge factor, nice balance between puzzling\
      \ and easy to understand. At least at first. Pretty cool ending. \n\nMinuses:\
      \ Fetch quest, anyone? No fast travel map. Hint button lags at times, game drags\
      \ in parts. I ended with things in my inventory. That just feels wrong somehow.\
      \ Kind of feels like the game was released with parts missing or not completed.\n\
      \nPlaytime four hours.\n\n___________________\n\nSacra Terra: Kiss of Death\n\
      \nWhen you get up to answer the phone your boyfriend spots a book and decides\
      \ to summon a smoking hot she devil. You throw that ring right back in his face,\
      \ honey! For some odd reason, you go off to the island to save him. Everyone\
      \ so far in the game talks like a serial killer, looks like one, or is a demon,\
      \ so fun game.\n\nPluses: Voice acting ids excellent as is the artwork and music.\
      \ The puzzle are clever, but can be skipped. The hidden object scenes almost\
      \ always have a useful item and the story makes actual sense. The fast travel\
      \ map is the best thing ever, easily letting you see where you are, where things\
      \ need done, and if you've collected the otherworldly item in an area yet. \n\
      \nMinuses: Get ready for old school HOG mechanics where thirty seconds was the\
      \ fast hint recharge. Some of the items don't match the theme. You get a big\
      \ scary book covered with skulls that is a matching game of cute or generic\
      \ things. Ditto some of the items in the matching scenes."
