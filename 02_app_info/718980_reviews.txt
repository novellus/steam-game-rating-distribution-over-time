I can no longer 'Start Game', it just crashes to desktop.\n\nWhat I did get to play of Grey Zone was interesting, and I think there is a much larger game hidden behind the bugs (I hope so given the 300+mb download). At one point the Russian-English translation broke down completely in such a hilarious way that if I can ever get it to work again I will upload a screenshot.\n\nThe sound track is cool but you have to keep moving to avoid monotony.\n\nThe core game-play in Grey Zone is solid, the controls maybe aren't the best but I found myself getting better at a rate that matched the game's increasingly challenging arena style matches. I feel there could be a little more combat/cutscene in the first 15 minutes, but like I explained that is all I've been able to play.\n\nUnfortunately I am not able to recommend buying this game as it's (at least in my case) still quite broken. \nI would love to re-review this title once this issue has been resolved. \n\nAs a first release by developer A.Lepunov I feel Grey Zone has promise, But stability and localization are issues that need to be addressed. \n\nOn the whole (at the moment considering the problems) 2/10\n\n\n\n","timestamp_created":1508204882,"timestamp_updated":1508204882,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.606090843677520752","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwhYWBlN8CdYDBiAE="}
