The developer is engaged and accepts ideas, feedback, and bugs, and there is support through discord.  Since I have owned the game I have seen multiple updates and more are on the way . If you love survival games that challenge, this game is for you.","timestamp_created":1585494885,"timestamp_updated":1610032727,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.478380858898162842","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4vbjb7vYCe4OR/AE="}
