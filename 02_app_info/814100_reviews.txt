Revisiting the DLC pages also shows few, if any, reviews for these tables. Online highscores a week after purchase don't give a big indicator of enormous sales, but hopefully there are people buying these tables. This, like many others in the remake additions looks great, sounds good (apart from the voice acting) and will give plenty of enjoyment.\n\nHowever, this is yet another table where it feels like it needs that bit of extra....polish? Pinball is at its best when the ball just flows around the table. Your eye is drawn to the ball, being able to follow and predict where it goes...except where there are jarring elements like: pins that don't feel like they should be where they've been placed, overhanging bumpers that seem oddly wide - placed over the flippers, tiny curves at the end of loop lanes that send the ball off in unexpected directions, badly shaped metal rails that are incredibly difficult to shoot the ball into, and on this table, secondary left and right flippers that are overhanging the out-lanes! \n\nYes, break from pinball convention, but there are many elements of a pinball table that are in around the same regions 90% of the time, for a reason. Flow is important on games.\n\nHow about putting new tables out to regular buyers for play testing? I'm sure many regulars will be happy to offer feedback. It's like most of the work has been done but the end result is slightly disappointing and lacks the fulfilment of other tables. I'm aware the real Zaccaria tables often have quick drain times and occasional odd feature placement, but lengthier games whilst increasing the odd placement of elements doesn't remedy that.\n\nAnyway, if you don't expect balletic flow from your pinball experience, I'd recommend it for some fun.","timestamp_created":1520895084,"timestamp_updated":1520895084,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.640883982181549072","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw3qiajuICcuTFmwE="}
