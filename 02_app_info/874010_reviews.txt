This game would even be worth having Steam Trading Cards for (but not that the developers will ever bother with that).\n\nOne major problem though; despite being store-bought, the Achievements don't count towards the \"Perfect Games\" for your profile, so while I kinda recommend playing it, it's still your choice all the same, especially since the game developers won't bother fixing this problem...","timestamp_created":1603205574,"timestamp_updated":1603205574,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw1/Wfo/UCdpeIqQI="}
