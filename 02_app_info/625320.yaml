    review: 'This game isn''t good, and the price tag is a bit insulting for the quality.
      I was very interested in what a VR spot the differences would be, and this wasn''t
      what I was expecting. You transition slowly and choppily between two scenes
      and try to point at what is different between them, but the framerate drops
      when you transition and the transition itself isn''t quick at all so it makes
      the core element of spotting the differences really frustrating because you
      are timed and the transition takes all your time.

      The pointer isn''t very accurate when trying to point at some elements you might
      hit the element in front of or behind instead, and if you guess incorrectly
      you get a horrible buzzer noise and reduction in time, and when the timer hits
      0 you lose all your progress and start from stage 1. There is no pause menu
      or way to stop the timer so goodbye to your run if you want to take a break
      because you get motion sick from the choppy framerate.

      This game might not even be worth a tenth of its asking price, buyer beware.'
