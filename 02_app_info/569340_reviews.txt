I'd looked at the Steam page before, but the description never grabbed me. \n\nAfter playing it, though, I'm glad I did. Thing-in-Itself explores an idea I've heard a few different ways before - once by Kim Krizan in Richard Linklater's film \"Waking Life,\" and again in a statement I've read that's been attributed to both Ana√Øs Nin and the Talmud: \"We don't see things as they are...we see things as we are.\" Although I've studied some philosophy, I don't remember explicitly reading Kant - perhaps I should?\n\nEven so, I very much appreciated the way that Party for Introverts illustrated the idea through a game, depicting a deteriorating relationship - something familiar to many. The game has fitting music, and excellent voice acting that brings Molly & Ted to life.\n\nThe only con, for me, was the insistence that I contact Molly upon the [spoiler] death of my fish. I felt that she had made it clear that she was not interested in hearing from Ted, and I wanted to respect that. Ted instead created an awkward situation that only served to bring pain to both parties. [/spoiler] However, you live, you learn. And although Thing-in-Itself is a game that gives you a certain degree of agency, Party for Introverts has a specific story they'd like to tell.","timestamp_created":1603126400,"timestamp_updated":1603126494,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.459110468626022339","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJws6DyoPUCepLuqAI="}
