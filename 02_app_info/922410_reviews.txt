The theme is cool and the writing is cute but that's really all there is to it. The story lacks depth, the characters are shallow and mostly useless, the romances are forced and the developement of the villains seems weird and uninteresting. The only character I found interesting was Dreadbone the suffering and complaining dreadful and skeletal dragon.\n\nStill, I enjoyed reading it but that's because I like to read cute (and also because I really like dinosaurs, but even that does'nt seems developped lol), straightforward and simple things from time to time. I would actually put a \"recommend\" on this one but only for people who wants to read something simply enjoyable while not thinking too much.","timestamp_created":1559133335,"timestamp_updated":1559134226,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.513513505458831787","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5YjpgesCcY+jwgE="}
