    review: "This is the worst DLC ever. I do not understand why Steam is selling\
      \ this substandard DLC. It looks like it has been copied from a model railway\
      \ BR24 from M\xE4rklin or Fleischmann or so. The cab is a joke, 2D apparently\
      \ from MSTS vintage with what looks like photos of the firebox doors and some\
      \ other cab-details. Most of all the sounds are terrible and chuff sounds are\
      \ virtually non existant. There is very heavy/overdone/too loud rail rumble\
      \ from loco and rolling stock that is very disturbing and partly blanks out\
      \ the other sounds. This DLC even at the reduced sale price is a ripp-off."
