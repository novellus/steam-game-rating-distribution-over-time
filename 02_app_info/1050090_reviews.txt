You get 1024 MB memory for every fight with Fake Neptune and the quest is repeatable. It takes approximately 2 minutes to finish.\n\nThis way, you can unlock every single CPU candidate and recipe in your first playthrough.","timestamp_created":1602952248,"timestamp_updated":1602952248,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.518716573715209961","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrMfZm/UCd7S5qAI="}
