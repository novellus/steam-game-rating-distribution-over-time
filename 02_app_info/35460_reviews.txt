Nothing really happens in this game it's just boring puzzles and bad fighting mechanics that lead to a worthless and forgettable gameplay experience","timestamp_created":1609895264,"timestamp_updated":1609895264,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8IfP6vYCc7TvwAI="}
