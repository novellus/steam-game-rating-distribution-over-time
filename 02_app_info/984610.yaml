    about_the_game: This game is still in Alpha, and as an ambitious project will
      likely remain in Alpha for several years of development. <br><br><strong>Features</strong><br>-
      Pilot your own massive combat mechs.<br>- Customize your mechs with the expansive
      selection of weapons and equipment.<br>- 21 playable mechs.<br>- Run your own
      mechanized mercenary company.<br>- Choose contracts and complete missions to
      make money.<br>- Buy and sell mechs and equipment.<br>- Salvage mechs and equipment
      from missions.<br>- Hire AI pilots to assist in missions.<br>- Take up to 12
      mechs on missions.<br><br>In the 24th century, humanity comes to be dominated
      by 3 interstellar mega-corporations after a galaxy-wide economic collapse. Humanity
      had enjoyed a golden age for over 250 years, where things like war, disease,
      and poverty were considered a relic of the past. The galaxy is now divided into
      major regions, the industrialized core systems controlled by the mega-corporations,
      and thousands of small colonies that make up the frontier. The mega-corporations
      use mass consumerism to keep the core systems population in check, which requires
      a continuous flow of resources from the frontier, which in turn creates a conflict
      between the corporations and colonies over the resources on the colony's planet.<br><br>Amidst
      the chaos on the frontier, pirate factions have arisen around organized crime,
      black markets, and raiding resources.
