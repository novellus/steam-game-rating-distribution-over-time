I first played this game many years ago when a demo version with the first stage was included in a computer game magazine. Then I forgot about it for a long time until I stumbled upon [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRyPqyrZbR0] a trailer for this game on Youtube [/url]. I liked the trailer and bought this game after a while and well, here we are.\n\n----\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe main gameplay idea is this: On one hand, you cannot let too many enemies pass or else the mothership gets destroyed. But on the other hand if you take too much time destroying each enemy, you cannot finish the stage within the time limit, so it's necessary to find the right balance and often make sacrifices on one of these sides (for example, by boosting and ignoring some enemies). I think this is a pretty cool idea, but it can be quite stressful if you're striving for perfection, like when you play for a high score.\n\nMy favorite thing in this game is the boost. I just like the feeling when everything (enemies, bullets, the background) accelerates when you boost and I think speedruns of this game would be cool to watch if some people were to go for it.\n\nThe two weapon types (rifle and blade) each have quite different properties and require you to play in a different style. It's also really cool how some parts were designed such that one weapon has a clear advantage over another. Though in total I prefer the rifle. If you play with the blade weapon it's always necessary to get close to an enemy just to deal damage making it easy to get hit. With the rifle you can keep a safe distance and if you need to go for high DPS, point-blanking with the rifle is almost as good as repeatedly doing the 1-2-slash with the blade. In addition, repeatedly doing the 1-2-slash with the blade (which I think has the highest DPS) requires you to press the attack button with a specific timing which is a bit annoying. If you mess up the timing, you'll start the sword spinning attack which has low DPS and is useless for stronger enemies. It's also hard to set up bosses for the 16x score multiplier if you use the blade and on Hard difficulty enemies sometimes still fire suicide bullets even if they are in melee range. So yeah, in total I found the blade to be much harder to use and maybe it could have been balanced a bit differently on that side.\n\nEach stage is fairly short with a time limit of 180 seconds (3 minutes) and a full playthrough takes no longer than 15 minutes. For some people this might be too short, but I actually liked the brevity a lot. It allows you to play short sessions, and it's not too annoying if you fail an 1CC attempt. I had a lot of fun replaying and practicing the stages because of that.\n\nThe one big thing I don't like about this game is the stun animation whenever you get hit. You can't control your character during the animation, you get pushed in a direction and it lasts way too long. Because of that it happens quite often that getting hit messes up your strategy: Smaller enemies on the screen cannot be destroyed in time and leave the screen and more often than not you're left in a bad position where you have to take even more hits unless you fire missiles for invincibility (this happens even more when you play on Hard). I think this really could have been done better.\n\n----\n\nStory:\n\nThe story is pretty much non-existent in the game. There are some explanatory texts in the manual and on the [url=http://www.dwahan.net/Marsbound/cloudphobia/manual/index.htm]Japanese website[/url] of Marsbound for Stage 1, but the game itself only contains like 3 simple lines of text and some more or less cryptic images. I still don't really have an idea what happens storywise in the stages and how they are connected. But well, it's a shoot 'em up first and foremost, so this is probably not that important to most people. \n\n----\n\nDifficulty:\n\nI've just managed to 1CC this game on the highest difficulty (Hard) with both rifle and blade (after ~25 hours of total playtime, you can find replays of the 1CC runs on Hard if you look at the game's online leaderboards, sorted by score (rifle) or time (blade)). Though I have to say that my shoot 'em up skills aren't very good, so if you frequently play this type of games, you'll probably be able to do the same in less time.\n\nThe game is quite easy to pick up on Easy and becomes a bit challenging on Normal requiring a bit of memorization. However, when you play on Hard, there is a large jump in difficulty. Even after getting 1CCs on Normal, I couldn't get past the first stage on hard on my first attempts. Especially on Hard it is necessary to use the scoring system as good as you can (the most important rules being \"get the 16x multiplier by destroying red enemies and bosses with missiles\", \"destroy red enemies after white enemies\" and \"use the invincibility after firing missiles to avoid damage\") since the amount of health replenished after each stage directly depends on your score. So for me during the Hard difficulty 1CC, it was pretty much necessary to memorize all enemy spawns and sometimes even devise routes and strategies for bosses. But it is satisfying to see how you improve and survive longer with each 1CC attempt.\n\nIt should be noted that there are no continues in this game. If your mech gets destroyed, it's Game Over and stages are only unlocked for practice mode at a certain difficulty if you beat them during a playthrough on that difficulty. Though I guess this is not uncommon. \n\nSo in total the game is easy to pick up but becomes quite memorization-focused on Hard. I would have preferred if there was not such a large gap between Normal and Hard.\n\n----\n\nGraphics:\n\nOf course the graphics are behind the times when you compare the game to more recent shoot 'em ups, but I think for its age (even before it released on Steam) the game looks quite good. Some of the extra effects (like the rain drops in Stage 1) are pretty to look at (although Stage 4 might have been better without the screen shaking) and the design of the stages is pretty cool. My favorite stage in that regard is Stage 2 with the purple, sunset-like atmosphere, especially when you're boosting.\n\n----\n\nMusic:\n\nThe music is also pretty nice, you can even download the soundtrack for free when you get the game. My favorites are the music for Stage 1, 2 and 4 (which contains some nice musical references to Stage 1). Not too fond of the Stage 3 music though because it sounds very different from the rest of the soundtrack.\n\nIn total, the game has its quirks, but looking back on my time playing it, I had lots of fun and enjoyed playing this game. It's a pretty cool game, so it gets my thumbs-up.","timestamp_created":1608369603,"timestamp_updated":1608370297,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4iuOVvfYCfemxuwI="}
