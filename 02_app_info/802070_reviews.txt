I'd much prefer this instead of only being able to point the turret with the arrow keys.\nIf you do somehow set up multiplayer (co-op, points duel, or deathmatch, etc) you're going to need moar wepons.\nAnyway, excellent job and worth the 99 cents.","timestamp_created":1600648905,"timestamp_updated":1600648977,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4pqOH1/QCfOSLowI="}
