    short_description: Spheroids is a 2D sidescroller that mixes mechanics from classic
      platformers such as Super Mario Bros or Umihara Kawase with 'combat' sections
      inspired in Pang! (or Buster Brothers), within a comical science-fiction setting
      inspired by films and series such as Futurama, Rick &amp; Morty, Ghostbusters,
      Back to the Future or Spaceballs.

    review: 'I don''t quite understand why you''d want to play this game when [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/350740/The_Bug_Butcher/]Bug
      Butcher[/url] does the same thing, has a much more polished UI, costs the same
      price and doesn''t require useless and clunky platforming.


      [edit: Fixed the Bug Butcher URL]


      At nearly $10, this game is way overpriced. It''s more like a choppy android
      game that someone developer pooped out over a weekend than a real game. Just
      look at the UI graphics and tell me it doesn''t immediately come off as a default
      stock option from some dime-a-dozen "build a game" program. The developer does
      seem to try, but their efforts are put in the wrong place, because the "main
      menu" is just straight up clunky and drives home the point of "just because
      you can, doesn''t mean you should". The game sets a very poor first impression,
      and it only goes downhill from there.'
