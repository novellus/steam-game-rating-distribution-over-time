      \ on Earth? Bohemia Interactive presents: Arma 3 Contact \u2013 a spin-off expansion\
      \ about the most important discovery in the history of mankind. As a soldier\
      \ deployed to Livonia\u2019s militarized Nadb\xF3r region, you will be among\
      \ the first to study our alien visitors and determine their intentions. However,\
      \ amid the tension and chaos, armed conflict inevitably unfolds. Arma 3 Contact\u2019\
      s military science fiction campaign arrives together with a massive new terrain,\
      \ and introduces new factions, weapons, vehicles, outfits, equipment, and more\
      \ to the wider Arma 3 sandbox.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"\
      bb_ul\"><li><strong>Singleplayer Campaign &quot;First Contact&quot;</strong><br>Ever\
      \ fantasize about what would happen if aliens arrive on Earth? The story-driven\
      \ \u201CFirst Contact\u201D campaign places you right at the center of a mysterious\
      \ event that will forever change the face of human history. As Specialist Aiden\
      \ Rudwell, you are a NATO drone operator taking part in a military training\
      \ exercise on Livonia. When a massive alien vessel enters the atmosphere, you\
      \ are sent on a reconnaissance mission to investigate the extraterrestrial presence.\
      \ The priority: to learn who or what they are, and find out why they are here.\
      \ However, with our very existence in the balance, different interpretations\
      \ fueled by a region-wide blackout quickly prove to be a surefire way to conflict.\
      \ Over the course of this campaign, you will engage in field science, electronic\
      \ warfare, and combat recon, in an experience delivered in authentic Arma 3\
      \ style.<br></li><li><strong>Livonia Terrain</strong><br>Dense forests, wide\
      \ open fields, and plenty of interesting landmarks \u2013 get ready to explore\
      \ a fresh temperate summer environment ideally suited for combined arms warfare.\
      \ Arma 3 Contact\u2019s 163 km2 Eastern European terrain covers the partly abandoned\
      \ <i>Nadb\xF3r</i> region within the larger Polish-speaking country of <i>Livonia</i>.\
      \ This landlocked NATO member state shares borders with four other nations,\
      \ including the Russian exclave Kaliningrad and CSAT partner Belarus, which\
      \ inherently makes it a place of great geo-strategic importance. Its woodland\
      \ locale is composed of a big set of completely new structures, props, and natural\
      \ objects, complemented by objects from other Bohemia terrains.<br></li><li><strong>2\
      \ Factions</strong><br>With the new terrain come two relatively smaller but\
      \ highly capable new military factions. Specifically, the <i>Livonian Defense\
      \ Force</i> and <i>Russian Spetsnaz</i>. The LDF equips its soldiers with high-end\
      \ protective gear in a distinctive woodland \u2018geometric\u2019 camouflage\
      \ design. This includes new fatigues, plate carrier vests, and advanced modular\
      \ combat helmets with optional ear protectors and so-called \u2018Spartan chops\u2019\
      . Meanwhile, the Russian Spetsnaz operators wear a new lightweight two-tone\
      \ suit, a durable helmet based on CSAT design, and a chest rig which sports\
      \ a cross-drawn chest holder for sidearms. Each faction is further enhanced\
      \ by reskinned variants of existing Arma 3 assets, and made complete with new\
      \ character faces and Polish or Russian radio protocols.<br></li><li><strong>5\
      \ Weapons</strong><br>The Contact expansion adds 5 weapons to your Arma 3 arsenal.\
      \ The LDF makes use of the <i>Promet Assault Rifle</i>. This modular bullpup\
      \ rifle is known for its unique detachable carry handle with integrated scope\
      \ and can be fitted with an under-barrel grenade launcher or shotgun attachment.\
      \ Then there are two additions to the AK family, which are primarily used by\
      \ Russian Spetsnaz. The <i>RPK-12 Light Machine Gun</i> features a distinctive\
      \ 75-round drum magazine, elongated barrel, a modified stock, and added foregrip.\
      \ The <i>AKU-12 Rifle</i> is a lightweight carbine with a shorter barrel and\
      \ a special muzzle brake. Lastly, Livonia\u2019s civilian hunting enthusiasts\
      \ bring in their own two weapons. The <i>Mk14 Classic Hunting Rifle</i> is a\
      \ single fire walnut stock version of the military-issue Mk14, while the <i>Kozlice\
      \ Shotgun</i> is a traditional break-barrel 12 gauge that can fire slug or buckshot\
      \ shells, and comes in a regular and sawed-off variant.<br></li><li><strong>2\
      \ Vehicles</strong><br>Say hello to an unlikely pair of new vehicles. First\
      \ up is the <i>ED-1 Mini UGV</i> (Unmanned Ground Vehicle). This small tracked\
      \ electric robot is built to traverse complex terrain, and can transmit a live\
      \ camera feed so that its operator can remotely assess the situation. Wielding\
      \ its multi-joint swivel arm, the UGV\u2019s two primary uses are CBRN Defense\
      \ and Explosive Ordnance Disposal. The Science variant, the <i>ED-1E</i>*, is\
      \ essentially a driving laboratory with sensors, a sampling laser, and a biopsy\
      \ probe. For military use, the <i>ED-1D</i> variant comes prepared with a mounted\
      \ Disruptor shotgun; ideal for demining operations and close encounters. On\
      \ the opposite side of the vehicle spectrum drives the <i>Tractor</i>. This\
      \ reliable Diesel workhorse from Arma 2 returns with a major upgrade to its\
      \ model and textures, and might prove unexpectedly useful in certain circumstances.<br></li><li><strong>Gear</strong>*<br>In\
      \ response to First Contact, this spin-off expansion also hands you a variety\
      \ of new gear. Perhaps most striking is the equipment related to <i>CBRN</i>\
      \ (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear) defense. This involves an\
      \ oversuit \u2013 available in multiple colors and camouflage designs \u2013\
      \ and includes Air Purifying Respirator face masks and breathing apparatus backpacks.\
      \ Another notable addition is the <i>Spectrum Device</i>. This is a handheld\
      \ transceiver that can act as an electromagnetic spectrum analyzer. It can send\
      \ and receive a myriad of signals at various frequencies, while \u2013 depending\
      \ on what antenna is fitted \u2013 it can also be used for jamming or deception.\
      \ As such, it is essential when it comes to scientific study, communications,\
      \ or engaging in electronic warfare. Additionally, there is a <i>radio backpack</i>,\
      \ prisoner <i>blindfold</i>, and, of course, the most proven measure of defense\
      \ against alien interference: the <i>tin foil hat</i>.<br></li><li><strong>Classified\
      \ Intel</strong><br><span class=\"bb_spoiler\">Little is known about the extraterrestrial\
      \ visitors, but their largest observed vessel is hard to miss. Presumably employing\
      \ a form of gravity control, it appears to have little trouble maintaining levitation\
      \ despite its massive size. It is unclear whether Livonia is the only arrival\
      \ site on Earth, but the UFO is believed to purposely hover above an underground\
      \ alien network that spans at least several kilometers. This network\u2019s\
      \ purpose and origin are entirely unknown, but it appears to be incredibly old\
      \ since it has gone unnoticed for the longest time. Recent reports also mention\
      \ sightings of highly advanced car-sized alien entities surveying the UFO\u2019\
      s nearby environment. However, much more information is needed before their\
      \ true capabilities and purpose can be evaluated.</span><br></li><li><strong>Additional\

    review: All the other DLC is pretty good, but this one sucks. I bought it for
      the new map and feel like I got ripped off even at 50% discount. Small map that
      looks poor due to the fact they filled the background with barren green mario
      hills.
