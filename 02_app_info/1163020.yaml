      \ /><br>The world is coming to an end. Everything is lost and destroyed, humanity\
      \ is in disarray. Somewhere in this world there is Tortura \u2013 giant forest\
      \ that devoured monuments of civilization of the past. Tortura is a dangerous\
      \ place, not many people decides to live there, and those who dare, are hiding\
      \ behind thick walls, sleeping with their guns. There is also a group of people\
      \ that are desperate or courageous enough to bet their life and roll few dices\
      \ for a promise of riches \u2013 Looters, scavengers with a bit of morality,\
      \ just enough to extend a helping hand and not stab each other. They are roaming\
      \ forest with a hope to find artefacts of the past: books, clothes, lost technology\
      \ \u2013 everything that can be traded for food, water, ammo, a little bit of\
      \ luxury, until they run out of luck. <br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1163020/extras/steam-story.gif?t=1599555280\"\

      \ emissary of local magnate. The job is to find cure for magnates disease, that\
      \ supposedly should be in monastery \u2013 a place where even looters don\u2019\
      t dare to venture. The journey starts. While making his way through Tortura,\
      \ protagonist is attacked and critically wounded by strange creature. With no\
