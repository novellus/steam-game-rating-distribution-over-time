    review: "You are an investigator called in to help when most of a family (the\
      \ Flatburys) disappear from their castle. The lone person left is the youngest\
      \ daughter. And there are strange things going on in this place. Perhaps even\
      \ a curse from the mason who built it\u2026\n\nHO scenes are challenging, minigames\
      \ fun, and the plot intriguing. Worth a try."
