    about_the_game: "Dungeon Display lets you design and play through functional maps\
      \ with your friends. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Maps can use any image asset that\
      \ you want in your game. Have a set of tokens or some really cool art you want\
      \ in your dungeon? Your free to put all of that cool stuff in! You can also\
      \ use tile sets to change the entire look of a dungeon instantly.<br />\r\n\
      <br />\r\n- Shadow system that can be easily edited. When you load a map, shadows\
      \ will automatically be created on wall tiles, and then lights can be placed\
      \ in the map to create the shadow effects. Also, there are tools to create areas\
      \ that players will always be able to see, and a shadow tool for custom maps\
      \ that lets users create their own shadows.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Save and load\
      \ any of your maps.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Play online with friends. The host\
      \ has certain privileges like toggling global lighting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      -  Import a variety of files to use as maps. Add an image file where each color\
      \ pixel represents a certain tile type (ie. green = wall). These maps are very\
      \ easy to make and add to your game. Add a text file which marks tile types\
      \ by having 'w' be wall, etc. The in game guide tells you how to make these\
      \ maps easily. Lastly, you can simply upload a pre-made map image for full personal\
      \ customization."

    review: I will Say i got What i payed for. If this had a few features this would
      be exactly the way i would prefer to play DND but as it is now it can be urksome
      and troubling  to fully understand. I got use to it in the half hour or so i
      used it and manged to use both the free form and Pre-generated maps. I will
      leave the features i will like in the discussion but i would not recommend with
      out further updates
