Good cute graphics and i love the sound track. Really fits the game.  Think of a drunken frogger like game. Needs just a few little tweaks here and there and it will be perfect. Game hung up a few times after playing it for awhile but nothing major. I would like to see some holiday dlcs for this game. Halloween, Christmas etc. How about a drunk Dracula and Santa? Haha and a few drunks sitting outside the pub just for fun. Also you really need a controller for this game. Its not happening with a keyboard. Anyways i hope the Devs keep working on this game. Its a lot of fun and i plan on playing it a lot more this weekend!!  :)","timestamp_created":1478851138,"timestamp_updated":1478851138,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.491145223379135132","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwnbKZqdgCeKObZQ=="}
