N3V should change the whistle though as it is the one from the N&W Y6b on the DLS. It is the same thing without the annoying generic bell from the first version of the game. Keep in mind N3V is not very accurate nor do they put much, if any effort, into making custom sounds for their DLC trains.\n\nI recommend this as it is the only LMS and/or BR Duchess available.\nIf there was a better one, I would have gotten that. However, there doesn't seem to be enough interest for anyone else to take on making their own Duchess. The main plus is the interiors as most content does not have interiors...due to them behind annoying and difficult to make.","timestamp_created":1577044286,"timestamp_updated":1577044286,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo8PKl+8CepWX5gE="}
