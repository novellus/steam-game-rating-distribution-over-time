    about_the_game: "This DLC includes five beautiful new skins that can be applied\
      \ to blocks in Trailmakers. The skins are: Camouflage, Brick, Wood, Glow and\
      \ Metallic. While a block has any of these skins, it can also be colored to\
      \ change the color of the glow, the sheen of the metal, the type of wood etc.<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nPurchasing the Skin Pack supports the development of Trailmakers\
      \ and future games from Flashbulb. Thanks for the support :)<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nThe skins can be applied to the following blocks: Block 1x2, Block 1x3, Block\
      \ 1x4, Block 2x4, Block 2x2x2, Block 4x8, Cylinder 1x1x2, Shield Plates, and\
      \ all the blocks in the Aerodynamic Category.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe skins do\
      \ not change the physical properties of the blocks in the game - it is purely\
      \ a cosmetic change. Players who do not own this DLC cannot edit a vehicle that\
      \ uses the skins, but they can still take the vehicle for a drive. To edit a\
      \ vehicle that uses a block skin you do not own, you must either remove the\
      \ blocks that uses the block skins, or purchase them for yourself."

    review: 'Highly recommended for anyone who has the base game. Would advise a good
      graphics card.


      Edit: I just noticed that the skins can not be applied to the 1x1x2 cylinder.
      This is said in the description of the DLC to be that the skins CAN be applied
      the the 1x1x2 cylinder. This may be a bug or a wrongly implemented feature,
      however it isn''t what they have said. Just be warned if you want to get the
      DLC for that reason.'
