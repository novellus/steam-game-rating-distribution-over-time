It's filled with variety, charm, and challenge all mixed together just right. The soundtrack is also stellar and I find myself listening to it still on occasion. One thing I personally had trouble with was the keyboard controls. They are personally uncomfortable to me, so I would highly suggest using a controller for this game. With a new update having just recently launched, adding a bunch of new, quality, content, I'd say now is better than ever to pick up this game, especially for $5.","timestamp_created":1504221207,"timestamp_updated":1561402982,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.552481651306152344","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw59e3xesCfJyVhAE="}
