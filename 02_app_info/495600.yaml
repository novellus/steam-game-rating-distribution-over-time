      /><br>Play in online matches with your friends in a team against others. Ranked
      games are played 2on2 and 3on3, custom games can be played 1on1 and up to 3on3
      with bots. Different play modes like e.g. capture the flag, last man standing,
      etc... are planned in the future.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/495600/extras/UI_teams.png?t=1586532707"
      /><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/495600/extras/XP_Items.png?t=1586532707"
      /><br>You gain XP for every round of Asteroid Fight you play. When you reach
      a certain amount of XP you are <strong>rewarded with a new item</strong>. Every
      item has its own values and modifiers - so even if you get the same item twice,
      it means it will have a different effect on your commander and furthermore,
      the item per se will be different!<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/495600/extras/emp.png?t=1586532707"
      /><br>Mounted items will grant you special abilities. For example, the warp
      drive will allow you to warp quickly to another location.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/495600/extras/endless_possibilities_2.png?t=1586532707"
      /><br>All items vary in their own attributes (e.g. reload time, strength, range,
      ...) and also modify the attributes of other items through the four modifiers:
      <strong>attack, control, utility, and support.</strong> <br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/495600/extras/Items.png?t=1586532707"
      /><br>Furthermore, with the before mentioned modifiers the hull values are altered.
      So if you mounted items with good support values, for example, it means your
      hull''s maximum health is increased and if you also mount the repair droid,
      it''ll be able to restore more health.<br><br>With an increasing amount of items
      you obtained through playing the game, <strong>your possibilities will steadily
      increase</strong> and become a great way to outsmart your enemies by combining
      the right items.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/495600/extras/CommanderFactory.png?t=1586532707"
      /><br>Assemble your commander with the unique items you earned from previous
      battles. However, you can''t mount all of your items on your commander''s hull,
      so choose wisely!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/495600/extras/commander.png?t=1586532707"
      /><br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/495600/extras/leveling.png?t=1586532707"
      /><br>There''s also a different kind of XP: During a round of Asteroid Fight
      your team as a whole will earn <strong>XP for every kind of activity</strong>
      you do - be it fighting, healing, base building, ... When your team reaches
      a certain amount of this XP it will LEVEL UP as a whole, enabling everyone to
      choose an upgrade for one of its mounted items.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/495600/extras/actionpanel.png?t=1586532707"
      /><br>So, if you decided to mount 3 attack items and 1 defense item, but during
      the battle there emerges the need for more defense, you can still specialize
      more on your defense by upgrading this particular item!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/495600/extras/economy.png?t=1586532707"
      /><br>Colonize asteroids and build up a strong economy that will support you
      and your team members with <strong>various specialized units</strong>. Use freighters
      to transfer minerals from asteroids with lots of minerals to those, where you
      can build a giant system of factories.<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/495600/extras/trading.png?t=1586532707"
      /><br>The combination of a working economy and the proper utilization of your
      commander''s unique skills is of great importance if you want to succeed in
      this game!<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/495600/extras/warpgate.png?t=1586532707"
      /><br>The ultimate goal of every round is to destroy the enemy''s warp gate
      - and to defend yours ;-)<br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/495600/extras/gate.png?t=1586532707"
      /><br>To get through to the warp gate, one must first pass the <strong>defense
      turrets</strong> and destroy the <strong>doors</strong> that prevent enemies
      the entrance to the warp gate''s base.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/495600/extras/mapeditor.png?t=1586532707"
      /><br>You will be able to build your <strong>own custom maps</strong> for Asteroid
      Fight with the popular map editor &quot;Tiled&quot;. For more information on
      how to use the map editor please find a download link and instructions in the
      Community hub.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/495600/extras/bots.png?t=1586532707"
      /><br>Practice against AI opponents to try out game mechanics, new tactics or
      new items. You can use the training also to explore new maps beforehand.<br><br><img

    developer_response: "The disabled edge scrolling is meant to help people find\
      \ their objectives in the tutorial. \nYou\u2019re right, XP should be granted\
      \ also after the first 3 training matches. We will change that and push an update\
      \ shortly."

    review: "EDIT: Heres the content of the previous negative review. I've heard some\
      \ of these issues have been fixed but I havent had the time to try them out\
      \ yet. Update pending, please disregard for now\n\n\nShort version. RTS elements\
      \ are minimal. \n\nI'm leaving it as negative because there isnt a \"meh\" option\
      \ and because I wish there more more RTS elements. I'd suggest waiting for more\
      \ content since its in early access.\n\nEDIT: This was fixed no longer earn\
      \ xp and unlock stuff in training mode."
