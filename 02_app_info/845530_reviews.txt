No save to or load function. No instructions or tutorial, not clear what is the point of doing anything is. Also, the land purchase is always cheaper that other options. But things randomly do not work. I think the game designers have a very long way to go, and a lot of rethinking before this is anywhere near ready for retail. It is very cheeky to be selling this junk at this stage. Overall, it could have been an interesting game but at present it is far from recommendable.","timestamp_created":1593763538,"timestamp_updated":1593763538,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.476449429988861084","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwxbTtifMCf9izkgI="}
