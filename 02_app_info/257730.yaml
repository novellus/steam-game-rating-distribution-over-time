      driven to deliver on an experience worthy of our IW players, and with current
      technical limitations on the old project being too much, we have no choice but
      to move past them. As a result, we've been putting a lot of time into Infinity
      Wars 2, which is currently in pre-production, and will be designed to solve
      some of IW's biggest technical issues, and expand on the game that our players
      were passionate about.<br><br>Check out IW2 on Steam, and add it to your wishlist
      today, and we'll be seeing you there some time in the future, Rift Runner!<br><br><a
