Found the game to be pretty slow and overly 'gamey' with scores and multipliers. If you like Match 3, which I don't, you might enjoy this game.\n\nI also consider the game to be too easy, with too many hints and what not. Not my idea of a challenging or even fun puzzle game.","timestamp_created":1609735124,"timestamp_updated":1609735124,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1609785686,"developer_response":"Thank you for your feedback! While it might not be the game for you, we're going to take your criticism into consideration for further balancing. We definitely want it to be a challenge, especially as players progress into the higher levels!"}],"cursor":"AoJwwpbs5fYCe6ylwAI="}
