      /><br><i>     In the depths of a dark and unforgiving forest, an exiled princess
      whiles her time in solitude. For a girl raised in the lap of comfort, the woods
      are impossibly harsh, and day-to-day survival is the most she can manage. One
      day, however, a mysterious, beautiful maiden appears, throwing her world out
      of its already delicate alignment. The princess is instantly captivated by this
      stranger, and begins to fancy herself the heroine of a fairytale, even as the
      maiden proves herself to be less and less of a fantasy.<br><br>    Foolish princess.
      She should know by now that her life is no fairytale.<br><br>    In seven days,
      the wheel of fate will splinter. Seven days, for better or worse... </i><br><br><img
