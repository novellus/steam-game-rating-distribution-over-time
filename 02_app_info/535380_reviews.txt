The thrust buttons do nothing meaning you'll never get any powerups and your a sitting duck AND your emergency \"get out of the way\" button is almost instant suicide.\n\nGood idea, terrible balance. All it would need is for the thrust to actually have some noticeable effect and for the \"oh shit\" button to not hurt quite SO much.\n\nEdit:  I didn't give this enough of a chance.  At first it was slightly unintuitive, but it's really not that bad.  I was only thrusting backwards, to be honest I feel a bit silly now.","timestamp_created":1602951160,"timestamp_updated":1604025947,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1602964410,"developer_response":"Hi Zasek,\n\nThere is thrust power available to move you about, but it sounds like you're having trouble spotting the activating buttons.\n\nIf you're using the Vive wand controllers, thrust can be activated from the 'grip' buttons found on the side of your wands.  If using another controller (e.g. Oculus), experimenting with the buttons on your controllers should spot the right trigger for you.\n\nHyperspace will cut your health in half, but it's not 'insta-death' (more a penalty to discourage constant use).\n\nDid trying those thrust buttons work for you?\n\nThanks,\n\n  -Charles\n\nCharles O'Dale\nFounder\nA-Blast Games"}],"cursor":"AoJ4t7LZu/UCeP24qAI="}
