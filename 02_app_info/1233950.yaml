    review: Oh man I loved everything about book two, hell I cant say I like either
      one or two more as they are both necessary to get the full experience. I was
      very salty at the cliff hanger kinda ending with my romance, the game did promise
      romance but with the person I chose I felt like most of the "romance" was just
      edging me into a hopeful steamy scene only for it to be delayed and delayed
      only for it to never happen. I will probably do a second play through with another
      character and see if this is similar to the others. I still HIGHLY recommend
      both Wayhaven books, they are just too good to pass up even with my small gripe.
