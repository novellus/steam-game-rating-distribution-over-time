I'm going to tell you right now that the short answer is... Oh boy this one was [i]tough[/i]. To be honest, I have no idea if I'm recommending this or not as I type these words. This is definitely one of those times I wish Steam allowed neutral reviews.\n\nPros\n– the characters. Thankfully one of the most important elements of any visual novel (or really, any story driven narrative) is done decently well here. Our heroine, Juliet, is a riot. Both her dialogue and internal monologues made me laugh out loud more than one and she has a distinct, memorable personality which many player characters in this particular genre of games generally lack. She also grows as a character no matter which route you're playing[spoiler](although it is especially evident in Kadin's route where she decides to give up pranking on her own accord instead of getting in trouble and being forced to quit like in the other routes).[/spoiler]The love interests are great too with each having their own motivations and feelings. Romeo our animal loving honor student with a hidden troublemaking side, Richard the sweethearted bad boy wannabe who's lost in more ways than one and Kadin the lovable loyal bubbly friend with a few hidden secrets. Each guy was great in their own way and I couldn't help but love them when I was on their routes. No matter how sloppily told those routes were (but we'll get to that) I also even like the side characters who had their own personalities and feelings too. \n– The humor. This game is really good at pulling the unexpected laughs. Especially with how creative some of the pranks ended up getting and just general the romcom tone of the whole thing. Even when you [i]KNEW[/i] what was going to happen, someone or something unexpected would come around and make the moment feel fresh and original.\n– The art. It's not groundbreaking or anything but it is pleasant to look at and even with several characters being related to each other and looking similar. Everyone had a distinct look even though two characters looked almost identical (again will get to that). The chibi art was the best.\n– The menu. Very user-friendly so even if you're not visual novel savvy it's no trouble to get used to it.\n\nCons\n– the story. The story in this game is [i]absolute[/i] cluttered mess! Basically the premise is Juliet is constantly moving around with her parents who are big Shakespeare fans and writers and they just moved into a town that they use to live in an Juliet ends up running into three boys who all knew her at one point in her life and she also has amnesia and can't remember anything before the age of seven. Yeah, see how I tagged amnesia as kind of a side note; that's what the game [i]does[/i] even though that's supposed to be the main underlying plot of the whole thing. The worst thing is only[spoiler]Romeo's[/spoiler]route [i]actually[/i] addresses the cause of the amnesia and the big reveal of the plot (which makes me think that it's the true route of the game) while the other routes barely even touch upon it.[spoiler]Now this somewhat justified in Kadin's route because he met her after she got the amnesia and already knew about it beforehand but this doesn't make [i]any[/i] sense in Richard's route because he was THERE when this happened! He knew her too so the fact that they don't really mention it at all in his route makes zero sense from a narrative or logical perspective.[/spoiler]Then there's also another girl that looks almost identical to Juliet also named Juliette. When you play[spoiler]Romeo's route to find out that she's actually named Rosa and that you knew her after you got sent to the hospital but it's never explained why she looks like you or why she has the same name just spelled differently and it's also not explained why Richard knew the name Rosa even though she never shows up in his route which is just beyond confusing.[/spoiler]Also they never explain if[spoiler]Kat is really psychic or not or if she has multiple personalities and her other personality never shows up in her brother's route which I thought was really strange because you think that the other personality will show up the most in that route but nope.[/spoiler]\n– The presentation. Okay this is where the game really tanks. The way the game tells the story is in a series of vignettes which is not a bad way to do it. However, many times the scenes seem like they're caught off or just jump to the next thing without having a proper conclusion many times. Sometimes it seems very deliberate. Like they're trying to do a cliffhanger but other times just seem completely random and it's jarring as hell. There's also different variations that can happen in routes depending on what you choose so sometimes characters will mention things that you would've never [i]seen[/i] happen because you chose the wrong choice.\n– The endings. Again not in themselves are they bad but the normal endings almost felt better than the so-called good endings. I think that they should of done two good endings and two bad endings.\n\nNeutral\n– the music. It sets the tone and has a distinct charm but not much else. It's also pretty catchy.\n\nAlright after all of that... I think I will recommend the game but only for the characters and definitely on a discount of at least 50%. The only reason I do this is because I thought the game has good characters and good humor even if it's story is all over the place and its editing is terrible. If you do want to try it they have a demo so if it's really not your thing then you should be fine.","timestamp_created":1552876436,"timestamp_updated":1552876436,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.625712096691131592","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwor+px+kCd+6mvQE="}
