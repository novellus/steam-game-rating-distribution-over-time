    about_the_game: '<strong>Bombergeddon</strong> is a high-level strategic simulation
      of Nuclear War between the USA and USSR during the pre-ICBM period (1950s).  Take
      control of the bomber fleets of either the USA or USSR and try to inflict the
      highest percentage of casualties in the enemy''s top 50 cities.  Your country''s
      survival is in your hands.<br><br>Bombergeddon is a clicker-style strategy game
      that uses simplified graphical interfaces to display the progress of friendly
      and enemy bomber fleets towards their assigned targets.  Underneath the interface
      is a simulation engine that calculates bomber / radar engagements results and
      bombing results (including blast effects, immediate radiation effects, long
      term radiation effects, and starvation effects). <br><br><strong><u>BASIC PLAY</u></strong><br>Choose
      a short, medium, or long war length (3, 6 or 9 rounds of action).  Each round
      consists of 10 turns where both friendly and enemy bombers flights approach
      their target city.  Before each round begins you will have the responsibility
      of allocating your country''s resources between <u>Production</u>, <u>Civil
      Defense</u>, and <u>Espionage</u> categories.  <br><br>During each round you
      will move your bomber flights toward enemy cities on the interface''s flight
      progress board as well as make important choices during friendly and enemy bomber
      / radar station engagements.  After all ten turns any remaining friendly and
      enemy bombers attempt to deliver their nuclear ordinance.  Bombing results are
      calculated and displayed on scrolling teletype screens and cathode casualty
      counters.<br><br>After each round is over the system prepares <i>War Reports</i>
      for your review.  The <i>War Reports</i> include the current round and point-in-time
      war result as well as detailed round statistics for both friendly and enemy
      flights, resource allocation and remaining production capacity.  Review this
      information carefully to decide if your current war strategy needs to be adjusted
      to achieve victory.<br><br>When the last round of the war has completed the
      sim will prepare a special <i>End of War</i> report.  The report includes the
      final war result (major defeat, defeat, minor defeat, draw, minor victory, victory,
      major victory) based on the variance of the percent of USA and USSR population
      killed.  Also included are offensive and defensive stats and grades (A to F),
      an overall war resource allocation breakdown, as well as a tongue-in-cheek critique
      of your performance.<br><br><strong><u>SPECIAL FEATURES</u></strong><br><ul

    review: "+\n4 hours to play first 3 wave turn based game, and didn't even read\
      \ the manual so pretty straightforward. [Includes time making many cups of coffee.\
      \ There are options to make the waves much much faster.]\nAtmospheric. 1950s\
      \ not 1980s, so teletype and bombers not ICBMs. If born in 1960 (like me), you\
      \ will appreciate this a lot. \nMake sure your main strike unit has H-Bombs\
      \ and countermeasures.\nOption to play 3 to 9 waves. Detailed things like killing\
      \ radar stations, deploying spies / saboteurs might be more useful in extended\
      \ play.\nDead body counter racks up the megadeaths.\nNot an all action game,\
      \ more a gradual build up and then the bombs drop. Then you get two reports\
      \ typing out at once! \n++EDIT: Designer actively doing updates. Map choices\
      \ excellent.++\n-\nAt first wave the game seems entirely random... [ But by\
      \ second wave you will see thought is required!]\nThis is nothing like Command\
      \ and Conquer, so might not suit pew pew kiddies... Might look like Battleships\
      \ but isn't.\n\nFirst try:\nEnjoyable, 4 hour 3 wave game. I won!  16 million\
      \ red dead commies to only 11 million hero Patriots.  I admit the win came when\
      \ I H-bombed Moscow on the last turn. I'll read the manual for the next game.\
      \ Darned reds under the bed kept sabotaging me...\n\nKept thinking of the old\
      \ black and white movies like Dr Strangelove, Fail-Safe and the Bedford Incident.\
      \ I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb."
