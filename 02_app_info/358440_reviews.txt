I don't mind cheap tricks in a video game, but due to the limitations at the time, avoiding the enemies and pits throughout the experience is more of a hassle than fun. It also doesn't help that the health you have at the end of one level carries over to the next level, meaning the challenge is increased to further tedium.\n\nOverall, I can't complain too much about the game since it's free these days, but I can't let these problems go unnoticed.\n\nI'll set my review as a recommendation based on it being free and a relic of its time. You shouldn't expect to have a wonderful experience from this title unless you had fond memories of it at the time.","timestamp_created":1440728535,"timestamp_updated":1568573678,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwm9yRm+0Ce+TZQw=="}
