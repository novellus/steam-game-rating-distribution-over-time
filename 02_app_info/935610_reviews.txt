The game is basically a \"Mastermind (board game)\" minus the \"mind\" part. You have to guess what gene you just unlocked and what genes the mission tells you to find (or mix). The game is destined to have a repetitive play. There are bits of Huxley's book here and there and some satirical pieces here and there. On a side note I had this game in my wishlist for a good while and I am disappointed overall.","timestamp_created":1597001148,"timestamp_updated":1597001148,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5vSr6vMCe+a6mgI="}
