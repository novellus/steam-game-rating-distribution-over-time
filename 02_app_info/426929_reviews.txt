It's one of 2 fluff DLC in the 29 \"Collection\" bundle.\n\nMain: This DLC includes 3 of each specific CC (Crowd Control) counter item. (minus hate drink) You are given these at the beginning of the game or when you activate the dlc.\n\nThe CC counter items gradually becoming available for purchase at the shop when you are introduced to a mission that debuts one of the CC mechanics.\nSome CC's are debilatating effects for 3 turns, others a permanent until the match is over. \n\nGoing into a mission and being afflicted by CC 'could' lead to a game over in a drawnout and painful manner if lacking the counter, dispell, or immunity through Party Wide Leader effects/Discs.\nPanacea and variants (cure-all) becomes available to craft/buy as progress is made.\n\nOpinion:\nIf you feel like supporting ifi, CompileHeart & Co. Get it with the bundle.\nAlone, it doesn't add to the game as it's safety net dlc, fluff. With the bundle... it's there.","timestamp_created":1466902052,"timestamp_updated":1466902181,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.620390474796295166","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4yN6LxdUCf5bqWg=="}
