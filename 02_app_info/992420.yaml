    about_the_game: <strong>Cotropitorii</strong> is a third-person multi-player action
      shooter game that celebrates Romanian communism. Up to 32 players can join and
      pick between two factions and battle it out in death-match mode with over ten
      different weapon. The game features a communist-inspired theme backed up by
      period communist Romanian music, allowing you to envision yourself in the shoes
      of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.<br><br>The game is relatively unfinished. It
      currently features a single map.<h2 class="bb_tag">The Backstory</h2>The story
      starts in 1988. During Ceausescu's reign Romania had been brimming with apathy
      and fear. To give hope to his people, as well as follow through with his own
      diabolical plan, Ceausescu started building up his army.<br><br>In 1989 a war
      broke out. Not between Romania and its neighbors, but between Romania and the
      United States of America. Fueled by the hate Romanians have toward Americans,
      gained during the Second World War when the Americans failed to protect Romania
      from Stalin, millions of them enlisted in the military.<br><br>Today, the war
      rages on as more and more of US territory is trampled by Romanian tanks. In
      the winter of 2024 the Romanian air force reduced the United States Air Force
      to less than 10% of its former power, leaving the remaining US Army only with
      tank and infantry support. In the summer of 2025 one million troops and two
      hundred thousand tanks were ready to  take the battle even further as Ceausescu's
      plan to overtake Texas was en-route. <br><br>You are part of an elite few, the
      Romanian Mountain Hunters, the highly-trained special forces of Ceausescu's
      army. You are here to hunt down and destroy Americans, wherever they may be.
      Your immediate task is to infiltrate enemy territory and deal a swift blow to
      the American infantry. This has turned into guerilla warfare, as the streets
      of once proud American cities are now ruins under Romanian gunfire.<h2 class="bb_tag">Details</h2>The
      game will run on a Pentium III or AMD 1 GHz machine with Windows 2000/Me/XP
      on it. It will require 256MB RAM and a 64 MB DirectX 9 compatible video card.
      Yes, it does require DirectX 9.0c. We recommend a Pentium IV with 2,53 Ghz machine
      and 1 GB RAM and a 128 MB video card for the best performance.
