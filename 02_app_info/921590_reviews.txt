So i'm going to make this quick. \nThe multiplayer: I played this game with a few friends, with and against and I gotta say. it's frustratingly fun. It's a great multiplayer game. Against A.I. with a friend of mine (who was new to the series) also found it fun. The frustrating part is that sometimes the A.I. seems to either give up or go all out. But I had a blast playing it either way. \n\n  The versions: \n F2P: you only get 4 or 5 playable characters \"I don't remember\" and can only do gauntlet mode, or online. The characters are: Shantotto, cloud, jecht, and someone else (idr who). But try it on f2p with friends first.\n\n Paid: You get the base characters only. I dont remember who is all in the base version. You also unlock the story and you're able to get treasures to get random items from the store. if you get the season pass, it gives you a most of the characters that arent in the base paid version, and the rest of them like zenos, Ardyn, Gabranth are separate. All of the characters are like 5$ or 6$ I dont really remember. (could check. but too lazy too meh).\n\n The story: very bland, boring, and frustrating as hell. Theres only a few parts where I have found it fun. To progress you gotta play online to get levels, or just do offline. (I have just got the right amount to beat the story and will when I get back from work, may update it idk). It just failed in my eyes. should have been the same premise. Like as in the first 2 you got gear, leveled up, and actually gave more of a reason to play and use gil instead of using it for music or player icons.\n\n The gameplay/graphics: Looks gorgeous, and gameplay feels really clunky and frustrating when stuff just doesnt work, and you get 3 people on you at once. Yeah no, should atleast have 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3. The story mode only has 2v2 in it and it is a BLAST. Just 3v3 just has too much chaos. I think that everyone needs to be incapacitated to lose so you still have a chance to win a 2v1.\n\n The summons: \"A HUGE dissapointment but still a spectacle\". I was hoping they'd have more than just a hand select few. I hate the cutscenes and love them they're so cool to see, and still awe inducing after hours of gameplay and seeing them thousands of times. But multiple times in a play session gets really meh to frustrating FAST. Should allow to turn them off or add a skip summon cutscene in the lobby options. \n\n  My total rating of this game:\n Music: 9/10 (coulda had more songs from the older dissida games sadly.)\n\n Multiplayer: 7.5/10 (very fun with a buddy to play with or against. A.i. still has some bs methods to it. \n\n Solo: 4.5/10 (very boring, gauntlet has a difficulty system that goes bronze to ultima bots level with you)\n \n summons: 6/10 (looks good, and the summon fights suck)\n \n Story: 2/10 (very stupid method to progress. Just an arcade game with story tacked on)\n \n Graphics: 10/10 (for the time)\n \n Grindy-ness: 1/10. (very boring and too much padding to keep people interested)\n\n Final result: Needed to have Final fantasy elements, like a full on RPG game to satisfy fans' needs. Let's just hope for a dissida 4 and they go through with these graphics \"if not better\" and plays and has a system like dissida: doudecim. \n\n  (I know you peeps probably don't care bout my personal review. But I just wanna let you know I love the dissidia series and simply end with this game. Sad thing is I think it's just a test for graphics than gameplay. It was a graphics first gameplay second game sadly. Fingers crossed they use these models if they ever make a new dissida. I really think the concept of the  characters, that replace cosmos and chaos they're cool I guess. Overall the game's still a blast to play, try gauntlet on f2p to learn and because online is pretty much dead. REASON WHY I RECCOMEND. ||MULTIPLAYER|| ||MUSIC|| ||GOOD GRAPHICS||)","timestamp_created":1609922123,"timestamp_updated":1609922123,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4z8K16/YCc9f4wAI="}
