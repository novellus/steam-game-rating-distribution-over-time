      \ in the mid-21st century revolutionized all technologies, allowing for the\
      \ perfection of piloted humanoid robots called [GEARs].<br>With the outbreak\
      \ of the World War Four in 2050 and the loss of control of the [GEAR System]\
      \ that followed, the world changed completely.<br>The berserk [GEARs] became\
      \ know as [RAGE], and combat GEARs around the world began a total massacre of\
      \ humanity.<br>Humanity was pushed to the brink of extinction, but a few survivors\
      \ escaped underground and began analyzing the GEAR System to prepare for a counterattack.\
      \ The war between humans and RAGE was exceedingly fierce, but thanks to the\
      \ counter-RAGE organization [Freyja] and a certain GEAR mercenary, they steadily\
      \ began recovering key locations on the surface. In 2112, over 50 years after\
      \ the war began, humanity reclaimed Japan from the RAGE. 30 years later, in\
      \ the [Cosmopolis] built upon Osaka, a pilot with an inherited [GEAR] and huge\
      \ [debt] sets out with his Operator to become a Ranker in the Arena. It will\
      \ not be a story for the history books, but simply a battle for their freedom...<h2\

      \ is to repay the hero's significant [debt] before the due date.<br>In the [Cosmopolis],\
      \ GEAR pilots fight day and night in the [Arena] for large sums of Eyn(this\
      \ world's currency). The hero will participate in the Arena as a Ranker, aiming\
      \ to use the prize money to repay his debt.<br>Once per day, the hero can choose\
      \ to go on a [mission] or enter the [Arena].<br>In [missions], you explore dungeons\
      \ to collect new parts, while you can win prize money and rank up by fighting\
      \ in the [Arena].<br>Use [missions] to enhance your GEAR, and earn prize money\

    review: "This game was really close to being good, but there were so many bad\
      \ ideas thrown into the mix. \n\nThe first is that the game loves to waste your\
      \ time. Mission quality is dependent on arena rank, but the arena gets closed\
      \ for half the plot so you better be high rank before that happens or you won't\
      \ be able to level or gear up properly. You aren't allowed to level up until\
      \ halfway through the loop regardless of if it's your first time, which keeps\
      \ you from challenging deeper levels until it gets re-enabled.\n\nSecondly the\
      \ combat is 90% rubbing your numbers against theirs. Proper piloting helps,\
      \ but usually one of you nullifies the others' damage and can just sit still\
      \ while firing. Guns seem to scale way worse than armor, so eventually fighting\
      \ devolves into a never ending series of 'DODGED' texts popping up"
