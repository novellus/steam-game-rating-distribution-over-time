None of the songs are very challenging, but they would be great for a learner as they only contain the occasional slide, hammer or flick.\n\nWhile most rocksmith packs seem to contain songs varying in difficulty, this one does not really have any song that stand out as being much easier or much harder. On bass, Ball and Chain and Bad Luck are easier than Reach of the Sky and Story of my Life, but only marginaly.\n\nI think this is actually a great pack if you want to reinforce your punk bass playing, and you'll have 4 songs to do so which will allow you not to get sick of any one song. Outside of that, I can't really recommend it for players who are more advanced and don't want to play songs with more variance in it.","timestamp_created":1439983710,"timestamp_updated":1439983710,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.555436491966247559","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw8/Xtos8CeZOYQw=="}
