    developer_response: Hi Warlord_Zap. Thank you for your feedback, would you mind
      going into more detail about the control issues you experienced on the Oculus
      so that I might be able to make some adjustments. Feel free to DM me, or post
      on the twitter account. Thank you again

    review: This is basically a trap shooting simulator, and its pretty decent for
      that. The controls feel a bit fiddly on oculus, but once you figure it out its
      ok. I'm bad at trap and don't get to practice much, so have been enjoying the
      ability to get some practice and learn my holds. Overall I'd recommend for the
      price if your interested in real life shooting sports.
