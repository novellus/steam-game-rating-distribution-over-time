Seriously, they're definitely not an alien. They're an indie game developer and are well known within their small community of game devs. This was originally a Flash game that they ported to something a little more playable.\n\nYou definitely want to keep any eye on this guy. He will make quality games for years to come.","timestamp_created":1606422279,"timestamp_updated":1606422279,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tdaOg/YCc4TvsgI="}
