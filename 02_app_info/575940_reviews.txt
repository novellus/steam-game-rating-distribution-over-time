The story is cool and i enjoyed the Card Game inside the game. Just fully completed the game today and thought id post a review on my opinion on it.\n\nIts a shame when in POST Game you still have to know roughly where to go and go through annoying levels and encountering annoying battles that last like 10 minutes to long just to get to somewhere. The game should have had a fast travel for players that have cleared the game to jump to all places. \n\nMy final thoughts are this.\n\nIf you are looking a game with a decent story then this is for you.  If you dont want to sit seeing the same screen and almost never ending enemies then this isnt for you. \n\ngame 7/10","timestamp_created":1609875333,"timestamp_updated":1609875333,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+IOD6vYCc/nlwAI="}
