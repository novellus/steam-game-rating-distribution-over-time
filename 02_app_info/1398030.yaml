    about_the_game: 'The main purpose of this game is to promote an idea --- darkness
      and light. Human beings like light, but light can bring people sunshine, so
      that they feel warm. And the cold brought by the darkness is repelled by people.
      However, it is really dark that makes people feel warm. Why do you say that?
      People''s perception of warmth and cold is antagonistic, as long as the two
      are missing, the other will not exist. Just like justice and evil, only when
      there is evil can justice be highlighted. When the world is peaceful, justice
      will not be highlighted. Only after experiencing the cold brought by darkness
      can we successfully feel the warmth brought by light.<br>This is just an example
      of darkness and light to illustrate the hidden thoughts. All emotions created
      by people have their opposites. When the opposite of an emotion disappears,
      the emotion will disappear.<h2 class="bb_tag"> game type<br>The game includes
      many elements, including build, fight, sandbox, shooting, parkour, editor, decryption,

      you defeat a dark creature, you get what it devours. These objects can be placed
      in the scene to provide light points and expand their territory. You can also
      exchange these for potions, bows and arrows to defeat dark creatures more easily!
      Finally, a piece of open space will be expanded into a forest. When the light

    review: "Eternal Dark Winter ist definitiv nicht weiter zu empfehlen. Das Tutorial\
      \ ist ungenau und man versteht nicht wirklich was man machen soll. Ich finde\
      \ die Tastenbelegung ebenfalls etwas merkw\xFCrdig. Die Einstellungen sind auf\
      \ 'p', Waffe wechseln auf der Rechten Maustaste und irgendwelche Tr\xE4nke (zu\
      \ denen nie eine Erkl\xE4rung kam) auf 1, 2 und 3. Ich habe das Tutorial  fertig\
      \ 'gespielt' und wusste danach nicht wirklich mehr. Am Ende des Tutorials wird\
      \ gesagt man soll sich mit den Tasten vertraut machen und danach im Hauptmenu\
      \ ein Monster ausw\xE4hlen gegen das man k\xE4mpfen will. Jedoch findet man\
      \ im Hauptmenu nur Beschreibungen zu den verschiedenen Monstern. Im gro\xDF\
      en ganzen ist die Grafik einfach nur schlecht und das Spiel wirkt unfertig."
