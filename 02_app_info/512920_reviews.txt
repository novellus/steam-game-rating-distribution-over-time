The dev was nice and responsive initially but stopped responding after August 2017.\n\nI can't personally recommend it, based on my limited experience with it. You may want to give it a look if you want to try something a little slower and different in the twin-stick shooter category.","timestamp_created":1518360638,"timestamp_updated":1518360638,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.54964292049407959","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwo5bWwuECcY7NmAE="}
