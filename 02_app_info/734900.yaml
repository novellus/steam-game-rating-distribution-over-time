    review: "Chemically Bonded is a romance visual novel developed by UK creator ds-sans,\
      \ who has previously worked on other titles that I should get off my ass and\
      \ play, Sounds of Her Love and Lost Impressions. However, Chemically Bonded\
      \ was successfully funded via Kickstarter and stars, you, the unnamed transfer\
      \ student at an unnamed school who hasn\u2019t taken to anyone yet.\n\nOne afternoon\
      \ after school, you take it upon yourself to clean up the classroom because\
      \ it\u2019s irritating you. You see, whoever was on cleaning duty has been slacking\
      \ on the job. In your hunts for supplies, you stumble across a girl using the\
      \ lab equipment. That\u2019s our star, Kiyoko Ishikawa, and she\u2019s desperate\
      \ for new members to join the science club, which currently is comprised of\
      \ well, just her. So you join her. The other heroine of this story is Naomi\
      \ Sato, a former friend of Kiyoko\u2019s, who doesn\u2019t like you being close\
      \ to her.\n\nThe themes of broken bonds and missed opportunities raign true\
      \ in these moments of character development, which did catch my attention. Still,\
      \ the cast ends up being somewhat limited, featuring two leads and a handful\
      \ of minor characters who don\u2019t stick out. That said, this is a lot more\
      \ than other visual novels of this type present, which is commendable. And when\
      \ I say, \u201CThis type,\u201D I mean a short, sweet romance story with a faceless\
      \ protagonist and plenty of soft and fluffy story scenes.\n\nThe leads of the\
      \ story are incessantly cute and wholly relatable, whether it be to the one\
      \ who shuts themselves away from other people or one who overthinks simple communication-based\
      \ tasks and never asks for help. The central conflict here is a communication\
      \ break down and your goal is to fix that, with a little romance on the side.\n\
      \nI was initially hesitant on how this would be executed, considering most cases\
      \ of this I\u2019ve seen in fiction turn out to be a little soapy. However,\
      \ I was pleasantly surprised by just how down to earth the game was. The romances\
      \ might move a bit fast if you\u2019re counting days, but they\u2019re a lot\
      \ less ridiculous than tropes that I\u2019m used to seeing. Hell, the craziest\
      \ thing in this game is the masterpiece that is resident \u201CJoke\u201D character\
      \ Ken and his refusal to wear shirts. He has no plot relevance at all; he\u2019\
      s just great.\n\nPlayers do end up having an impact on the plot; after all,\
      \ it is a romance. This leads to a few choices to discern, which leads you to\
      \ want to pursue. These choices are cleanly spread out, and the effects of the\
      \ choices aren\u2019t entirely in your face, which I enjoyed. After all, the\
      \ premise of the game is to fix someone else\u2019s relationship, not pursue\
      \ one yourself. You\u2019re not talking to Naomi so that you can end up with\
      \ her; you\u2019re talking to her to find out more about what happened between\
      \ her and Kiyoko. It feels quite natural, with dialogue being shuffled around,\
      \ so the plot always progresses at a steady rate no matter your choice.\n\n\
      Unfortunately, the game is a little bit short, and the only real way the game\
      \ has of extending its length is to throw a strange bad ending your way. I found\
      \ it a bit bizarre that if you didn\u2019t interact with Kiyoko enough, on what\
      \ is essentially her path, you wouldn\u2019t be able to get her Good ending.\
      \ It\u2019s a weird design choice because the justification is the protagonist\
      \ not being able to understand his feelings.\n\nStill, he\u2019s a faceless\
      \ protagonist with next to no character outside of some wholesome quips, so\
      \ it took me out of the experience. I thought the voice acting would help with\
      \ the immersion, but Kiyoko was a bit high pitched at the beginning of the story,\
      \ and the teacher sounded lackluster. However, I later felt that the actors\
      \ were enjoying their roles and ya-know what they say, \u201Cfun is contagious.\u201D\
      \ Well, at least it is for me.\n\nThe art in this game is exceptionally soft,\
      \ and I love it. The backgrounds are fabulous, with each character showing a\
      \ variety of poses in different outfits to keep things fresh. Surprisingly,\
      \ the character CGs are charming without having to resort to lots of pinks or\
      \ more stylized proportions. Seriously, my only complaint with them is that\
      \ there aren\u2019t enough of them.\n\nChemically Bonded is an adorable game,\
      \ but comes off as a little stilted. The great leads, art, and some very fun\
      \ piano pieces make for some good energy that ends up going a bit unused as\
      \ the story unfolds. Although, the game\u2019s runtime leaves little room for\
      \ these characters to grow their relationship. Still, I thoroughly enjoyed my\
      \ time with these characters while it lasted."
