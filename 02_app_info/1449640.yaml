    review: 'I played this game because I quite like the first one, here comes the
      (first?) review:


      [h1]Character[/h1]

      3 characters, no hidden character or such.

      Each has different style of punching combos.

      I like the fact that you can spam a flykick-uppercut combo from early stage,
      but in later stage you can''t because all the enemies start blocking.

      Also make me think, how come they can block attacks but I can''t, that could
      be useful.


      Compare to the first one, no unlockable characters, which is a little disappointing.


      Saul''s special attack is a little broken, make him outright more OP than the
      other two in my playthrough.

      Air combo is quite interesting in this game, because both you and your enemies
      can be hit mid air.

      However, when it comes to you being in air, enemies can really spam that on
      you.


      I remember in the final stage a big guy just spam a knock down punch to my death
      while I''m in air, which is less enjoyable.

      It would be nice to have a break in-air stance too.


      [h1]Enemies[/h1]

      Enemy sprite design is a real gem of this game, you can still see new lesser
      enemies popping up even in the final stage.

      You need to remember who can fly kick, who can break grab, those was quite fun
      in my playthrough.

      It would be good to see some enemies that can grab you or dodge attack using
      backflip... those moves I remember seeing in my favourite old school beat''em
      up games.


      [h1]Boss[/h1]

      Bosses are quite interesting. I can see the developer actually put a lot more
      effort on the first boss to make him look bad ass.

      Seeing a little of that after the first one though, even the final boss, doesn''t
      have a 2nd stage like on the previous one.


      Still quite enjoyable. I like the female boxer boss where she is super fast
      and try to approach you for a undercut constantly. Which really stands out on
      the rest of the playthrough because normally I''m the one chasing the enemies.


      [h1]Overall[/h1]

      Not a bad game, what more do you expect for 2 dollar? And developer certainly
      put a lot of effort on the graphic design.

      Consider it is a bit more pricey than the first one, you would expect a bit
      more, but this game certainly offers a lot less replayable values: no unlockable
      modes, no unlockable characters, which is a shame considering that''s a lot
      cool sprite designed.


      Still worth a try, keep on the hard work! Looking forward to the 3rd one as
      well! (Was that 1st of May or 5th of January? I can''t get that date format
      right in the Easter egg :D )'
