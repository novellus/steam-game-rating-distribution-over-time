    review: "I don't usually refund games this cheap, I'll typically suffer through\
      \ them just for the achievements. But seriously this game annoyed me so bad\
      \ within the first 10 minutes that I don't even want this in my library; and\
      \ I've kept some really bad games simply because they were cheap.\n---\n\nBefore\
      \ I begin, let me note: I used to play tons of scrolling shooters when I was\
      \ younger and while I don't play them nearly as often anymore, I still like\
      \ to pick one up from time to time for nostalgia. What attracted me to this\
      \ the most was the trailer which has a cool hard-rock soundtrack reminiscent\
      \ of the late 1980's early 1990's shooters.\n\nFirst of all, right from the\
      \ start even with English set as the language the menu and interface are a mix\
      \ of languages, some of English, most of it, not. I don't know what most of\
      \ the buttons say and they don't even seem to be consistent between menus. This\
      \ is a low effort poorly translated mess and it's not making a good impression\
      \ even just trying to start the game.\n\nSecondly once you figure out how to\
      \ navigate the menus, you are presented with leader boards to show the top players\
      \ rankings for each difficulty before you even start the game. Those leader\
      \ boards are 100% cheated. There's a single player taking up every top score\
      \ on all three difficulty selections so that no one else can use them at all.\
      \ Hey, I understand anti-cheat is hard to do; but maybe don't have the leader\
      \ board be such an up front in your face display. It's insulting that before\
      \ you even start the game this is presented to you like this. Also, who makes\
      \ a leader board where the same person can take up multiple places anyway? It\
      \ should only display each person once with their best score. Otherwise even\
      \ if they didn't cheat the best player could still make it so no one else ever\
      \ appears in the list. (except in this case it's very obviously cheated, as\
      \ in there's 100 of the same perfect identical score repeated on every board\
      \ from one guy)\n\nSo, let's ignore those issues and start the game:\n\nUnfortunately\
      \ the next thing I noticed was the music wasn't anything like what was shown\
      \ in the trailer, maybe something like that shows up later in the game but it's\
      \ not even in the same style. The music isn't terrible necessarily, but it's\
      \ a much more routine and generic choice than the trailer would lead you to\
      \ believe. I could over look that but it was definitely disappointing. \n\n\
      Next comes the poor design choice of how to collect points. You don't get points\
      \ for shooting/killing, you get points for collecting bits after things die.\
      \ But those bits \"shoot at you\" for you to collect them. They streak at you\
      \ just like the bullets, lasers and other attacks from the enemy.\n\nThis is\
      \ a bullet-hell shooter and the points you are supposed to collect look like\
      \ the bullets you are supposed to dodge and they shoot at you in a similar way?\
      \ What kind of idiot design choice is this? In a game where you need split-second\
      \ decision making and perfect timing to avoid being hit by little streaking\
      \ lights on screen, they start swarming you with little streaking lights on\
      \ screen that you are simultaneously trying to collect. \n\nEven taking the\
      \ time to learn the color differences it's deliberately stressful trying to\
      \ pick through at high speeds which light streaks to dodge and which ones to\
      \ pick up.\n\nCan you learn to navigate through this mess? Yes. Is it fun to\
      \ do so? No.\n\nThis is a functional but ultimately boring side scrolling shooter\
      \ marred with horrible design decisions and lazy presentation at every step\
      \ of interaction from the interface to the game play.\n\nAnd I still might have\
      \ kept it if the soundtrack matched the trailer, but nope; they couldn't even\
      \ get that right. I play a lot of bad games, many I will suffer through for\
