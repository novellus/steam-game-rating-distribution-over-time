Some old music and cliche tag lines are thrown in there to mask the criminally lazy production. \nA peice of junk made  to steal from the suckers like me who are bored on a sunday.\nMy advice, don't buy this even if you are bored. It's worst than the worst filler. It will make you feel dumb for the purchase.\n","timestamp_created":1491241721,"timestamp_updated":1491241721,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.390850722789764404","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4ytu7mtsCcaz9dQ=="}
