Randomization in this game is very repetitive.\n\nEnemies are too much sloppy, and the regdoll is just a quick solution for death animation that honestly has nothing to do with ps1 era games and is very unpleasent to see like a fly in the soup. \n\nThe bad part by the way are the controller. I'm used to all the tank controller that were available for ps1, n64, dreamcast, pc and whatever game you can remember from the 90s but the rotation of this game is too sensitive, not impossible to handle but the fact that someone has tested it and though that the rotation was ok...sorry but it needs to be fixed (probably the problem is with the acceleration). Is very frustrating to pass from one indie game to another, and not one single of them have controls that work decently, and this is said by someone that has implemented better tank controller for game prototypes.\n\nI will conclude by saying that i always appreciate the work beyond hobbyst and amateur games also if they are not good but for the customers that want to buy it, my impression is that \"Vaccine\" is very close to not beeing a game but just some rough game mechanics attached togheter.","timestamp_created":1603380895,"timestamp_updated":1604078958,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw286jvfUCdOe4qQI="}
