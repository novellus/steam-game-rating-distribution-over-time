Quit to find the devs made the puzzle impossible!!!! \n\n2) Re-entered the game to find all of my progress had been lost. \n\n3) Finally got to where I was. Put some important papers on an object. Solved the object to find that a thing came out the top of it and clipped through my papers. Now they're missing. Have to restart AGAIN!!!!\n\nThis game is not about fun, it is about agro.
