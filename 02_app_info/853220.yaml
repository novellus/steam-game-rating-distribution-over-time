    review: 'I don''t write Steam reviews often, but since there aren''t many in English
      I figured I could share my experience with this game.


      This is specifically a review of the port. The original Doors & Rooms on iOS
      is a near 5-star game, with my only issue being the logic of a few puzzles,
      such as a room in Claustrophobia that requires you to know binary to escape.
      This Steam port actually recreates the game quite well, but I cannot recommend
      it because of a few major bugs and design changes that ruin the experience.
      I''ll list off the ones I found, starting from the most game-breaking:

      - The keypad in room 5-8 inputs a value that is one lower than it is supposed
      to. This causes the number "1" to input the impossible value of "0," and every
      other button to input what the previous button should. This is game-breaking
      because you are required to input "9" at least once in order to escape, which
      is an impossible value to achieve with this bug. This renders 5-8 and the rest
      of the game impossible to complete. It doesn''t matter that this happens near
      the end of the game, it''s still an unacceptable problem.

      - It is impossible to manually close the combination window in 2-5 after interacting
      with the bear on the operating table. The only ways to get around this, from
      my understanding, are either to restart your progress on the room or to know
      the right combination and put it in, which automatically closes the window and
      resumes progress.

      - It is sometimes impossible to retrieve a placed item from the box in 4-8.
      This bug only occurred once for me, but it still required me to restart my progress
      in the room.

      - It is possible to click above the keypad in 4-6 to retrieve an item through
      the door. This doesn''t break the game, but nullifies the challenge of this
      room. I didn''t run into this bug in any other areas, though I suspect that
      it may be possible elsewhere.

      - It is possible to ignore the key requirements for bonus levels if you simply
      exit to the chapter select menu and select the chapter you just left. It''s
      worth mentioning now that this new chapter select menu is inferior to the menu
      from the original game, since you are not allowed to select individual levels
      and the ability to select chapters in any order is bugged, trapping you in a
      linear progression and causing issues such as the levels after 5-8 being inaccessible.
      The order of these chapters makes no sense either; The Kingdom is the hardest
      chapter in the collection, yet it is the third chapter in this port. Again,
      this would not be a problem if the order of levels and chapters was not linear.

      - The puzzles are all timed, and I feel that this is a change made to the port
      that reduces its quality. Completing levels fast grants you keys which, as mentioned
      previously, are bugged from the start and would unfairly block progression if
      they worked properly. Completing levels slowly punishes you by triggering a
      "Game Over," but it also rewards you with hints. I feel that a time system could
      work but, first of all, it should not force you to restart the level. Rather,
      it should merely reduce the number of keys you acquire, and instead of the keys
      unlocking later levels, they should be a currency that enables the player to
      purchase hints if they need them. Also, the keys granted upon replaying a level
      should be minimal.

      - I doubt I need to mention this, but the Steam achievements all unlock the
      moment you buy the game. They''re Steam achievements, so who cares, but still.


      Although I recommend the iOS release of Doors & Rooms over this port, I do feel
      that the port isn''t too far from being as good if not better. I''ll list a
      few things that the port improves upon before I go:

      - BGM is a nice inclusion for those who want it. I played with BGM off to replicate
      the atmosphere of the original, but I understand that not everybody wants to
      play a game like this in silence.

      - The inventory has been given a much better design. It''s great that I can
      look at puzzles and check my items at the same time, and I also appreciate that
      having the inventory open stops the timer, even though this feature can be abused.

      - Rusty Key and The Kingdom have been remade flawlessly, from what I can tell.
      Not even the Android port got this right, so it''s clear to me that the developer
      has what it takes to iron out the rest of this port.'
