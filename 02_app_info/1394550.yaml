    about_the_game: "Tales Of The Under-Realm: Hazel is a dark themed yuri visual\
      \ novel  that takes place in the fantasy world of Aravorn (already seen in games\
      \ like Loren The Amazon Princess).  A mysterious entity known as the  Nameless\
      \ God serves as the main narrator of the story, having the  ability to peek\
      \ in on the life of deceased souls and discover what  brought them to a premature\
      \ death.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn this  case, the Nameless God takes an interest\
      \ in the fate of a witch named  Hazel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCaptured, she wakes\
      \ up in a prison somewhere in Aravorn.  She's  not alone though.  Locked in\

      \ beautiful.  But can Hazel trust her  just because they're in a similar situation?<br\
      \ />\r\n<br />\r\nThe  alternative is putting her faith in the paladin interrogating\

      \   Or can she really use that bond to escape?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe answer\
      \ is no,  of course.  Hazel did end up in the Under-Realm one way or another.\

      notes: "While the base game has been censored so that no nudity/genitals are\
        \ shown, the game still contains partially nude characters and depictions\
        \ of sexual acts.  All characters included in the game are over the age of\
        \ 18.  \r\nAdditionally, one of the game's endings contains a suicide.  There\
        \ are also a handful of scenes that include blood and violence."
