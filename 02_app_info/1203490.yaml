    review: 'This is a tough one to rate.  I thought I was buying a builder.  Instead
      it is a unique take on Real Time Strategy in which prices from the independent
      market are the key drivers in determining how you build a functioning economy
      to support the war machine to take down your rivals.


      The approach is creative and unique. You have to focus on staying profitable.
      Whatever resources you need you can buy in the market. However, to buy in the
      market you need positive cash flow or sufficient assets to access credit. You''ll
      bankrupt yourself quickly if you ignore the price signals from the market to
      focus on building the production chains you need.


      Positive cash flow comes from cleverly building things that are in short supply
      and otherwise manipulating the market. Building whatever is in short supply,
      and thus expensive, either lets you supply your own economy at below market
      prices, giving you an advantage, or selling into the economy at high prices,
      giving you more money which you then use to further develop your economy.


      You can also directly play the market, buying low and selling high or investing
      in short supply production hoping to profit. Done right, this will also generate
      cash which can be used to dominate the other players.


      At the same time, workers get paid, buy what they need in the market and accumulate
      their own surpluses. Some of them become entrepreneurs and establish their own
      businesses to supply demand indicated by high prices. If they do this in the
      area you control, you tax them to generate more profit and some of the high
      costs they impose on you come back to you in taxes - including taxes on what
      your enemies are paying for their expensive production.


      The workers themselves are independent operators.  They''ll work in the facilities
      that offer the best deal, including those of your enemies.  You''ll need competitive
      wages, decent housing, health care and education to attract the workers needed
      to run your war machine.  Too generous and you''ll bankrupt yourself, too stingy
      and ''your'' workers move for the better wages and conditions offered in the
      factories of your rivals.


      All this in the context of a real time strategy game, keeping sufficient military
      to defend your base and taking the fight to the enemy.


      The game forces you to think very differently about how to tackle the challenge
      of ''painting the map''. You don''t, for instance, necessarily build a power
      plant and a sand facility as part of the supply chain to support the cement
      plant which supports building production. Rather, you buy sand and power on
      the market, but notice that sand is crazy expensive...so you priorize building
      a sand plant to take advantage of the high price (and lower your cost of cement).  Meanwhile,
      if power is really cheap you gorge on low cost power buying from whichever chumps
      over-built power, hopefully losing money but selling for them is better than
      losing even more money by mothballing the plant. There are many more production
      chains than just the one that ends in cement, used for building production.  So
      sand is but one example of dozens of potential supply, demand and price manipulation
      scenarios.


      You can''t embargo your enemies. Rather, you hope that you own, for instance,
      all the sand production and that sand is overpriced so they are forced to pay
      crazy sums for sand if they want to support the cement production they need
      to build. You also pay the crazy price for sand, but if you own all the sand
      plants you''re just paying yourself the money. In turn, you use the money being
      paid for expensive sand to build and support the war machine you will use to
      take out your rivals.


      All that said, as a game I''m just not finding it fun at all.


      However, it is early in Early Access with the developers promising way more
      to come.  Plus, RTS is not my thing, so if you were into RTS this might be just
      the fresh take on the genre you are looking for.


      As a design experiment, it breaks new ground with some creative, clever ideas
      that could be very usefully applied in other games, particularly builders.


      Net - recommended on the grounds of unique and clever ideas for a functioning
      economic model that more games should emulate.'
