It definitely has it's bugs and quirks (some can be pretty frustrating) but the aesthetic and charm definitely outweighs the downsides. I bought this game a long while back and decided to revisit it. A lot of the huge game-breaking issues that drove me nuts have been polished out and they've added a good amount of content. I only wish more people played it so the wiki would be filled with more helpful info because I still find myself being confused by some aspects of the game.","timestamp_created":1609913614,"timestamp_updated":1609913614,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw64eV6/YCcvn1wAI="}
