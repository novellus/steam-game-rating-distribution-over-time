    review: "I'm giving this a 9/10, its free, and very cleanly made.\n\nMy only critisism\
      \ would be the lack of updates and the lack of more general models, for example\
      \ differential equation graphing. Maybe fourier, legendre transforms, etc. That\
      \ would probably make it EXTREMELY useful for College of Science applications\
      \ in Universities. \n\nKeep up the fantastic work and I'll be keeping a close\
      \ eye on this :D"
