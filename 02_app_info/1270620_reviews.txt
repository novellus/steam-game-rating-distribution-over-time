Hopefully this message will reach devs so there is my opinion written 25th Dec 2020:\n- game looks like it was designed 'mobile first' which makes rather poor experience for PC with average 34\" screen\n- interface is terrible (wsad for movement in 3D environment with dull, gray background without reference XYZ axes, compounds are unmovable, no way to rearrange compounds but only to wipe all the table altogether)\n- an overlay menu to pick compound breaks user connection with the 'table' not mentioning the 'quest'\n- a better metaphor like table and vials would be better for example: available (source) compounds on the left, components picked for reaction in the middle, objective on the right or bottom of the screen; and all of these 3 should be visible all the time\n- rotating compounds were fun for a moment but later they are just annoying and make me feel dizzy; screen is cluttered with rotating compounds that cannot be moved or rearranged; screen with them is useless to solve reaction given by quests;\n- seems like in quest mode not all possible reactions (even very simple ones that you can find in Wikipedia) are available because perhaps they ain't \"discovered\" yet; so it's like devs designed quests in \"my way or highway\" manner;\n- GUI and UX are too chaotic right now to consider it as a learning tool; as a game it looks too dull and demanding to be fun (no puf! when exothermic reaction works, just a message that seem more like Dilbert boss saying: \"m'kay, one more reaction solved, go to the next one and same tomorrow 9 to 5\")\n\nAfter some more time I decided to change my vote. There are just too many bad decisions about UI/UX deign it makes me cry to use this app anymore. I don't feel like I learn anything (revise actually) from chemistry and I don't find it fun game-like experience either. For now it is just so much wasted potential that could be easily fixed. Hope to see that happen.","timestamp_created":1608929065,"timestamp_updated":1608998485,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52520376443862915","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4wI/yz/YCdJCVvQI="}
