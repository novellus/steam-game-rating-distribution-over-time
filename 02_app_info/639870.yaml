      \ and industry leading technology. All locking arms to make up what is a truly\
      \ cutting edge team. They sweat at sea and in gyms, they study on board and\
      \ at the white board. And, they tune their designs for the best possible performance,\
      \ simulating scenarios before hulls ever hit the water\u2013all giving Artemis\
      \ a valuable competitive edge in a sport where you can\u2019t afford to leave\
