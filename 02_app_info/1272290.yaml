      bb_ul\"><li><strong>Explore the galaxy</strong> - Discover planets, abandoned\
      \ space stations and visit strange settlements. Upgrade your ship to reach further\
      \ into the unknown. Feeling crazy? Why not chase a high velocity chrystalline\
      \ asteroid? High risk, high reward!<br></li><li><strong>Farm mysterious plants</strong>\
      \ -  Find unusual seeds on distant planets and nurture them in your farm until\
      \ they\u2019re ready to be harvested. Take good care of them though, or they\

      \ discover valuable resources needed to build that giant thruster grill you\u2019\
      ve always dreamed of. But beware, there are others out there who want them as\
      \ well.<br></li><li><strong>Prepare for space combat</strong> - Upgrade your\
      \ ship to defend yourself against pirates and competing food delivery services.\
      \ Or join the pirates and get some very lucrative \u2014and highly illegal\u2014\
      \ missions. Beware of the galactic police!<br></li><li><strong>Craft awesome\

      \ a SentryBot. Bleeding out? MedBot is on the way. Find rare electronic parts\
      \ and build yourself a best friend in no time. <br></li><li><strong>Customize\
      \ your home</strong> - Where you work is where you live, so make sure it is\
      \ cozy. Collect decorations from around the galaxy and, if you\u2019re really\
      \ lucky, you\u2019ll even find a talking plant to keep you up at night.<br></li><li><strong>Meet\
      \ hungry characters</strong> - On your journey you\u2019ll meet several interesting\
      \ human and alien characters. Some will help you, some will need your help,\
      \ but all of them have one thing in common. They need food!<br></li><li><strong>Keep\
      \ track of time</strong> - Each planet has its own day and night cycle. Certain\
      \ creatures and plants are only accessible at certain times of the day. Also\
      \ make sure to watch the morning report for the latest on passing traders and\
      \ dangerously lucrative situations.<br></li><li><strong>Find out who blew up\
      \ your kitchen</strong> - Use your limited detective skills to find out who\
      \ wanted you out of business. Who\u2019s that suspicious guy at Zlurkas bar\
