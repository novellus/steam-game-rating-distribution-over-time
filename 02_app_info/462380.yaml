    about_the_game: "Music of the Spheres is a game about solving puzzles with bouncing\
      \ bullets. It is also about Islamic art, and about sound.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\
      The controls of the game are simple: you can fire bullets in eight directions.\
      \ The bullets bounce, and when they bounce, a musical note is played. Your goal\
      \ is to hit some rather intelligent moving targets with your bullets. Here's\
      \ Rock, Paper, Shotgun:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s a beauty in the\
      \ apparent simplicity of the design, which like much that is contemplative is\
      \ far more complex than it first appears. It\u2019s somehow reassuring to play\
      \ a puzzle game that is entirely disinclined to frustrate, hoping to create\
      \ mindful, soothing spaces instead.\u201D<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPuzzles are designed\
      \ to show you as many interesting things as possible, as concisely as possible.\
      \ Nothing is repeated, and nothing is meaningless. Wherever possible, environments\
      \ are composed to embody some pattern."
