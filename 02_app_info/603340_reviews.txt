You figure out the enemies movement pattern, and dodge and attack accordingly. But it's way cheaper, and lets you jump right into the action with no need for tutorials. The production value is inferior, of course, but it's pretty fun and quickly makes you work up a sweat.\n\nYou're standing on a small island of non-lava. In real life, it's a little over 3 meters wide. So this one really pushes your roomscale to the limit. The good thing, though, is that you will jump to the left to avoid a demon fist to your right. So even though you will then be standing next to your left wall, you're going to hit the demon fist, which are to your right. So you won't attack your wall.\n\nA doormat at the center of your playspace will help a lot. You will need to reorient yourself at the center, so you know where to jump to before the next attack. You won't have to move all that much to the side to dodge if you just start out by standing on the mat.\n\nAt your feet, you'll have a HUD with the life points of yourself (green), the life points of the demon (violet) and the current time. Sadly, the game doesn't display your progress on game over. There is some kind of best time score, but I don't really get how that one works. \n\nThe demon has very few moves, which makes it a triffle tedious once you got them. Still, I had fun! Pretty good cardio, if you got the roomscale for it.\n\nThe game only lists HTC Vive as its supported headset, but it worked fine on my Oculus Rift CV1.","timestamp_created":1546553667,"timestamp_updated":1546553667,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ424XyiugCfqm1twE="}
