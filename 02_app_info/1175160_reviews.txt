Lots of hidden object mini games.  Game play offers hints, a strategy guide, and a location status map.  Bonus section follows completion of the main game.  The game is somewhat anti-climatic at the conclusion, but still enjoyable to play.\n\nNegatives:\nGame appears to only support 4:3 ratio resolution.  Installed this game on 3 different computers and all 3 came up in a 4:3 resolution instead of filling the more modern widescreen 16:9 monitors.  Game does offer different monitor resolution settings and options, but still unable to take advantage of entire monitor screen real estate.","timestamp_created":1609301036,"timestamp_updated":1609301036,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwvqH02PYCd/vUvgI="}
