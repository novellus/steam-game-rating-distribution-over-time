    review: "This is a game that's always been dear to my heart ever since playing\
      \ it as a child, back when I got the GBA version. It's so obscure though that\
      \ not many people know about it, and the only playthroughs I've seen of it online\
      \ are people playing it for the first time, with little to no knowledge of the\
      \ game. I always wanted someone to make some sort of guide of this game (someone\
      \ that knows enough about the game to talk about almost everything, anyway),\
      \ but got so fed up waiting for one that I decided to use the knowledge I got\
      \ playing this game for hours as a kid to make one myself. Despite this, I figured\
      \ not many people would care about it because this game never got any sort of\
      \ sequel or remake, and any hopes of one were shattered when the company that\
      \ made it went out of business.\n\nSuffice to say that the last thing I'd expect\
      \ was a Steam port of this game to ever exist someday... And to my surprise,\
      \ I found out that it did! Obviously, the first thing I did when I found out\
      \ about it was to play it immediately and see if there were any changes from\
      \ the original version...\n\nThere weren't any changes at all. Not really anyway.\n\
      \nThere are some things I'd like to talk about the game here though. Keep in\
      \ mind from here on out this will be a \"review\" of this port of the game in\
      \ particular. Also, I'm not going to bother making a \"Pros and Cons\" list;\
      \ I'm just going to put together all my thoughts here randomly. Sorry if that\
      \ bothers anyone.\n\n- Saving in this game doesn't work for some reason. You\
      \ can only save progress with the \"save-state\" option provided by the Steam\
      \ version by pressing Escape. The only downside to this really is that you have\
      \ no way of playing a cleared file of the game (after beating the final boss).\
      \ All this does is let you re-fight the bosses though, so whatever.\n- You can\
      \ also press Escape to change the controls of your controller/keyboard. The\
      \ default is the same as the GBA version, except the A and B buttons are switched\
      \ for some reason (probably for Xbox controller users). Also, there's an option\
      \ to choose what you want the Select button to be, even though that button does\
      \ nothing in this game.\n- As much as I love this game, even I have to admit\
      \ its price is a bit too high. I ended up buying it when it was on sale for\
      \ about $5, and assumed that was its actual price at first without questioning\
      \ it.\n- The audio quality at times is a bit... weird. And not in a good way.\
      \ It's most noticeable during the Jackbatlar fights and in Militar/bomb race\
      \ missions.\n- The screen when playing has this weird, \"90s TV\" quality to\
      \ it as well, which I also don't like very much because it kind of hurts my\
      \ eyes. The border surrounding it is pretty cute though, and it reminds me of\
      \ the ones you see when playing in the GB Tower in Pok\xE9mon Stadium.\n- There\
      \ was another person who reviewed this port that mentioned that you can only\
      \ have a max health of 5. I've confirmed it's 10 (which means 7 health upgrades),\
      \ just like the original. I have no idea what made that person think it was\
      \ 5, when a lot of people don't even know you can get any health upgrades at\
      \ all. By the way, I confirmed it was 10 with the golden hotdogs; I have no\
      \ idea if playing mini-games can increase your health as I've not played them\
      \ yet. Considering how my playthrough of this port went I'm assuming that's\
      \ unchanged as well.\n\nSo, those are the things about this port I wanted to\
      \ talk about, assuming I didn't forget about anything. Now, would I recommend\
      \ this port? I mean, considering this is pretty much the only viable way to\
      \ get the game (legally) at this point, I suppose so. Considering the quality\
      \ of this port and the game in general, I'd recommend waiting for it to go on\
      \ sale first. I'm still really happy that this game got a Steam port though,\
      \ as this'll potentially give it more love from others; love I think it deserves."
