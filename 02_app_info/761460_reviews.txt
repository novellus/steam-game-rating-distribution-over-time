This means you won't easily get stuck and you will never end up in the \"combine every object with every other object\" situation. However, it still managed to feel like just the right level of challenge, and the story felt very well-paced with constant progression and new discoveries. Each case offers up several potential solutions where it's up to you to decide if you've uncovered the whole truth yet or not.\n\nIt's not the longest game out there but every moment of it was truly enjoyable. I would attribute much of this to the fully voice-acted dialogues (of which there are plenty) that are mostly very well done. The script and voice acting for Bill - one of the main characters in the game - is my definitely a favourite of mine when it comes to voice-acting and script writing in a game!\n\nThe only negative thing I have to say about the game is funny enough also about the voice-overs, but it's not a huge issue. I understand the need for using the same voice actors for multiple roles in an indie game, but I think some choices could have been better planned. To me, some voices didn't feel like they quite matched their characters and one particular scene lost a bit of its tension to me because of the same voice actor doing two very important parts in it. Other than that, I truly enjoyed every bit of this game and it is definitely one of my favourites in a genre of games that I cherish a lot. I will definitely be looking for more from this developer!","timestamp_created":1609687813,"timestamp_updated":1609687813,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4uNm35PYCdvaMwAI="}
