    review: 'Developer is responsive to requests, and in the few weeks since launch
      has put out opt-in patches with a host of new options, accessibility features,
      and rule customizations.


      This game is similar to Billion Road and Momotaru Dentetsu, but with a Euro
      theme and easier to pick up and play. With the updates since launch, its well
      on the way to being a viable alternative in the genre, and is cheaper to boot.'
