The Class 50 was 50007 SIR EDWARD ELGAR. Here we have Izzy in very fine form sporting the bespoke GWR colours as it was the last of the Class 47s to do so. This rendition runs fine - though limited to 75 MPH being a Special Workings (DCWW) machine towards the end of it's service 47484 was used on charter trains frequently where dispensation was granted to operate at 95 MPH. Would I recommend 47484 to a friend? Yes and especially if they ever got to know this locomotive (as I did whilst working on the Western once) as Izzy. I paid for my DLC instead of receiving it free or in a bundle etc and do not regret the Â£4.99 expenditure to get this little gem onto my Train Simulator.","timestamp_created":1477287207,"timestamp_updated":1477287207,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.572192490100860596","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4hbzL+tcCeor2Yw=="}
