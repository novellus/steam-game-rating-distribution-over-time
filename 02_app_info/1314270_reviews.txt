This honestly drives me nuts, especially because the game gives you a little star rating if you make no mistakes. This is weirdly common in so many digital puzzle games and I don't like it.\n\nHowever, if you are wiling to play carefully the multi-color nonograms are designed well and you often have to switch colors to figure out some portion of the puzzle, then switch back. The puzzles are honestly well done. There is also a fairly forgiving hint system if you get stuck or find the puzzles too difficult. The game is honestly quite relaxing, and I enjoy it very much, even though I wish it didn't punish misclicks so heavily.","timestamp_created":1597227579,"timestamp_updated":1597227579,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.482509046792984009","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ459aL8fMCeeL8mgI="}
