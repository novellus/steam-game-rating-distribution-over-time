No game does that (now I stopped playing though because my left thumb hurts like hell and I might consider seeing the doctor). When I get back I will certainly find a way to continue. \n5$ is a great price for this, cannot wait till I reach the exiting looking areas shown in the trailer video.\nRecommended!\n\nEDIT: Played almost 3 hours (got to Level 9) at this point and the controls still don´t feel comfortable. Especially the jumping/sliding up and down feel like they happen completely random, don´t even wanna know how a person with bigger fingers feels about this.","timestamp_created":1521839219,"timestamp_updated":1522164615,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ49ZiFtOICeKu0nAE="}
