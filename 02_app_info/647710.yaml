    about_the_game: "After the death of his father King George V (Michael Gambon of\
      \ HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE) and the scandalous abdication of King\
      \ Edward VIII (Guy Pearce of MEMENTO), Bertie (Academy-Award\xAE-winner Colin\
      \ Firth) who has suffered from a debilitating speech impediment all his life,\
      \ is suddenly crowned King George VI of England. With his country on the brink\
      \ of war and in desperate need of a leader, his wife, Elizabeth (Golden-Globe\xAE\
      -nominee Helena Bonham Carter), the future Queen Mother, arranges for her husband\
      \ to see an eccentric speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Academy-Award\xAE-winner\
      \ Geoffrey Rush). After a rough start, the two delve into an unorthodox course\
      \ of treatment and eventually form an unbreakable bond. With the support of\
      \ Logue, his family, his government and Winston Churchill (Timothy Spall of\
      \ SWEENEY TODD), the King will overcome his stammer and deliver a radio-address\
      \ that inspires his people and unites them in battle. Winner of four Oscars\xAE\
      \ including &quot;Best Picture&quot; and &quot;Best Actor,&quot; The King's\
      \ Speech is based on the true story of King George VI's quest to find his voice."
