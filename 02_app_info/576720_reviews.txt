It's a shame because it does seem like this dev has been updating the game for a while, which is unusual to see in VR. However, it's just not a good VR music visualizer. There are much better options out there.\n\nThe visuals are bad. I did not find a single environment or visualization to be pleasing. I don't even think it was really all that well-synced to the music. I don't think I would ever want to listen to my music with this app. There aren't enough drugs in the world to make it bearable.\n\nThere is a free VR music visualizer called Vision that is much better. There are other good ones out there as well. I'm not sure why this is rated positive by Steam reviewers, especially at the normal price of $8.99 USD.\n\n[b]Rate 4/10. At least I only spent .89 cents on this.[/b]\n","timestamp_created":1552111044,"timestamp_updated":1552111044,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.529797732830047607","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1552223923,"developer_response":"Thank you for the review, although you only tested out a few old environments.\nThe environment-Menu is scrollable. There are a ton more surroundings available.\nI tried to build as much as possible to fit different tastes.\n\nThe music detection will improve as soon as i integrate a analysis of the track before it get's played. It's hard to pick the beat in realtime, but for a lot of music tracks i does well :)\n\nSad i wasn't able to serve you the experience i intended. Hope you will look into it after some more updates that will come ;-)"}],"cursor":"AoJw2uDBsOkCdv/QvAE="}
