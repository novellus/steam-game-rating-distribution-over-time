    review: 'Everyone has their own preference of music style, especially for a game
      like Beat Saber.  For me, this is currently one of my favorite songs to play.  The
      song has a smooth, funky groove to it and the rhythm of the block cutting works
      well with it.  The block patterns felt varied and interesting without just being
      a stamina check for my shoulder muscles.  It just feels good to play, if you
      like this genre of music.


      I''ll respond to some critique that this music pack in general doesn''t provide
      a sufficient challenge.  At least with respect to this song, I would agree that
      Expert difficulty didn''t feel quite as demanding as tracks from the other DLC
      packs, but I would disagree that it didn''t provide a satisfying challenge.  It
      may be worth remembering that a lot of Beat Saber players who invest in music
      packs are playing consistently at the expert/expert+ level, so they might be
      getting SS on this song fairly quickly and viewing that as "insufficiently challenging."  In
      my opinion, I don''t care so much for how "difficult" a beat saber track is,
      as long as it''s fun to play.  And in that respect, I think this track wholly
      succeeds.'
