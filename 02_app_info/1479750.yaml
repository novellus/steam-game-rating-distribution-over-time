      Features</strong><br><br><strong><i>Sphere from an unknown dimension</i></strong><br>Using

      marks on your hands hold even more power than one would believe, burning once
      you stop momentum abruptly due to the sheer volume of force this ancient mark
      can hold. You can almost feel the magnitude of momentum reflecting to yourself.<br>Once

    review: "Game concept is great -\n\nPOSITIVES:\nLevel Design\nMechanic Functionality\n\
      Art\n\nNEGATIVES:\nSome mechanics seem to be used just for the sake of it being\
      \ used. \nMechanics, whilst cool, feel unpolished. \nLevel transitions\n\nComments:\
      \ \n\nProps to the level designer, mechanics were utilised in an interesting\
      \ way - although I found that the ball-on-button mechanic seemed to be used\
      \ frequently just for the sake of it - what is the point of the ball spawning\
      \ right next to the button at the end of some of the stages? It just seems like\
      \ an unnecessary step to opening the portal to the next level.\n\nJumping off\
      \ the walls is inconsistent, and feels even more strange given that you can\
      \ give yourself a lot of height, but not a lot of forward velocity. Also a little\
      \ buggy, in certain cases I would rotate around the walls when attached to them.\n\
      \nNeeds a cross hair - launching the ball forwards is good, but if you just\
      \ miss a jump it's a bit hard to replicate the velocity without a cross hair.\
      \ \n\nA few jarring transitions - mainly just when loading levels and restarting\
      \ the stage (though I can understand this if just for the sake of getting the\
      \ player back into the action without a pause). \n\nCould use some music.\n\n\
      The sheer amount of achievements is also not needed, getting one every time\
      \ I finish a stage takes the \"achieve\" away from them. \nGreat performance,\
      \ not a demanding game at all. \n\nOverall, concept is cool and is fine for\
      \ a first game, though the mechanic inconsistency made me want to stop playing\
      \ as it felt like I was just repeatedly yeeting balls at the wall until I got\
      \ lucky and got it in just the right spot. If these are fixed, then I may return\
      \ to finish."
