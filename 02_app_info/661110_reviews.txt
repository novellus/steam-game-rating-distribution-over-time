I seem to miss a lot of our hits but that could be because it takes getting used to the controls. Interesting concept as far as combat goes, I don't think I've played a game like it. I believe it will pick up speed with time, but I was a bit confused with the tutorial but I also am not the most attentive player. Check some gameplay for it and make your own decision. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRnLb3QI-yM","timestamp_created":1498706212,"timestamp_updated":1498706212,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.417694568634033203","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyr72+NwCc/zifQ=="}
