    review: "This is not a game. It is a blatant money grab by a \"developer\" who\
      \ uploaded multiple no-effort titles within a few days of each other, all under\
      \ different dev names in order to disguise himself. Forest Monster, Zombie Variant,\
      \ Devil Flight, Urban Riots, Undead Zombies and \u53BB\u6B7B\u5427\u8759\u8760\
      , Escaping maze are other examples. There are more.\n\nThis one is a tiny Unreal\
      \ level packed with so many skeletons that you can hardly move. There is no\
      \ advertised wagon, trade goods, combat or roleplaying; all you can do is slog\
      \ your way through a circular canyon until you get struck down in four blows\
      \ (each hit takes off exactly 30% of your health, which is noted by a tiny piece\
      \ of text called \"PH\", I assume for \"Player Health\").\n\nThere's one spot\
      \ where you can escape the map, where you will then find yourself in a wondrous\
      \ land of invisible walls and missing polygons.\n\nThere is no options menu;\
      \ starting the app just throws you into the game, which is set to a very high\
      \ detail level and completely unoptimized, meaning sludgy framerates even on\
      \ a  high-end machine. This also means it's not possible to quit without pressing\
      \ ALT+F4, resetting your computer, or smashing it with a hammer."
