To me, this is a game design dream come true. Everything is laid bare, and in a few cases I can feel the game outright mocking the idea that you might want to 'complete' a vignette or be rewarded for doing so.\n\nNot recommended if you're looking for a nice fun videogame experience, but I truly love Rooftop Cop and recommend it with my entire heart if you're interested in... well, whatever the hell it is. It speaks to me about the nature of videogames, so it's not \"for people who don't like videogames.\" Maybe it's for people who are acutely aware that they like videogames TOO much.","timestamp_created":1606337403,"timestamp_updated":1606337403,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527559041976928711","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4h/PKgPYCeYz8sAI="}
