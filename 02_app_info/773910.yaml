      \ control of Anaesse, a powerful magic user tasked with destroying a flying\
      \ fortress which floats from village to village, consuming the people below\
      \ to keep itself standing. A newly entrapped resident of the Labyrinth, you\
      \ must destroy the fortress using the guidance of the long term captives. <br><br>Players\
      \ will be tasked with a series of strategic encounters against a robotic army\
      \ which will challenge their ability to think quickly. Using Anaesse\u2019s\
      \ abilities, you must fight your way out of a necromancer\u2019s sky fortress.\

      >A Fascinating New World</h2>The Short Story takes place in a floating Labyrinth,\

    review: 'The Short Story of a Drifting Labyrinth is an isometric brawler which
      is passably okay, but is dragged down heavily by very bad combat mechanics and
      a complete lack of progression. Not much to say about this one beyond that -
      it''s about halfway to being fun, but the controls and your four "spells" are
      all very awkward, often missing despite seeming to come in contact with the
      target, and it''s incredibly easy to fall off a ledge while trying to dodge
      and reset the room. There''s also a lot of random fights against enemies which
      come across as just grind, except there''s almost no progression and thus very
      little to grind for.


      I was still trying to stick with it, though, until I hit the first boss, which
      has one part teleport around often enough to be very difficult to deal consistent
      damage to and the other part fly in the air immune to damage until the first
      part has been sufficiently damaged. Both times I attempted this boss, after
      several minutes of fighting I either died or fell off a ledge, resulting in
      its health being fully restored.


      So, yeah. Enough of that. Not recommended, but maybe the designer''s next game
      will be less awkward to play.


      (As noted, this is a review where I haven''t completed the game. I got frustrated
      enough with it that I''m not going to try again, though. I''m not sure how far
      I got - the game mentions 450 encounters, and I certainly did what felt like
      at least 100, but also 10 bosses, and I gave up on the first one.)'
