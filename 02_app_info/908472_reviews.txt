However, for anti tank operations i do not recommend using these tanks. The french tank is very slow and can not move quickly into a battle or move out of enemy fire. The British tank is quick, but only has  .303 and .50 cal guns which do little to no damage on even enemy light armour. All of the light tanks have weak armour, which means that they will be disabled after half a dozen AT rounds, or a couple ET shells. \nHowever, I still recommend buying these tanks. They are almost always in supply and do not require an armour division to use. Even when we are under heavy attack and have only a few units left, these light tanks are among the final units in supply and thus can be the turning point in a battle.\nThey also move great for marking and camping an enemy spawn, or MS or FOB. This can be a deciding point in your defence tactics. Thus these tanks are perfect for anti infantry defence.\nThey also are great on the attack when the enemy has only light armour and infantry. You will be able to move and fire onto the light armour and be able to mow infantry. Perfect to cover an advance onto a CP and to disable enemy AI Towers and Gun Pits.\n\nGreat pack, would recommend purchasing along with the Medium armour pack and the AT Pack to really have all bases covered.","timestamp_created":1550657315,"timestamp_updated":1550657315,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4i5yYhekCd++uuwE="}
