    about_the_game: Experience the End Times in style! This DLC contains a bold new
      look for the Dwarf Ranger Bardin Goreksson. The new skin is applied when downloaded
      (to revert, simply uninstall).<h2 class="bb_tag">Studded Leather</h2>To survive
      on the harsh mountain slopes without the security of a nearby hold to fall back
      to, Rangers have learned to be stealthy and to fight in a manner unique for
      Dwarfs. They are ambush-hunters, experts at approaching the enemy from unexpected
      angles. Where possible, they will trigger avalanches, misdirect wayward foes
      over cliffs, or lead them into the teeth of an oncoming ice storm. Rangers are
      walking arsenals and carry a slew of different weapons - crossbows to skewer
      foes at long range, an axe for close combat and, for truly imposing foes, great
      axes. They have learned to keep bedrolls, pots, pans, and climbing gear secreted
      in camps hidden along their mountainous routes, yet still, they must carry all
      their provisions on their backs as well.
