This developer has like no clue how to interact with the player in a casino theme in a reasonable and most important fun way, there are not even players to actively play with to host this type of events in a fair sense. \nThey like Grand Slam you in the face (makeing your hard works get balled with no players to play with).\nSince PhanthomEFX closed their casino, I was looking for a new one as side game and started this one. \n\nI can really say it is not a casino, it is way to static, way to low without any major luck rewards a real casino has to offer. The developer keeps telling it is a casino in many forum posts on Steam, but everytime they do makes me wonder more if they did ever play in a casino. \nThis is not a MMO for structural economy systems like they tend to present here and rather force you into a spending then give you freedom to make that choice. Mini games are hardly any fun at all, its not an excitement to wait the daily slot reward for most times 25 chips, as is the hourly 25 chips. If you look for a casino game there are web games that serve you the theme feel better, there is no value to have a 3D world with abit clunky avatar to play with without casino feel. \n\nThere are no jackpot slots to play and probably will not be any in the near future, the slots graphics is cartoony in so bad way not even the bet lines have diffrent colors. The casino casino floors have duplicate sides for the reason it is faster created at the cost of feeling comfortable and epic, this may be a personal preference feel. Even if you would look at it being in early acces development the start seems to be not promising if you want to have a full experience in this. \nThey are a small team so priority choice is a mandatory aspect to guide the project to victory, I don't see that victory come in the near year as with every addition that come out there is already problems or unrealistic visuals.\n\nHouse edge is pretty huge on any games. Even poker is not realistic 70%/30% or 60%/40%. \n\n\nAbout the All-in pack content summarize.\n\nFounders Jacket:\nAt first it is something exclusive, but wearing it a week then it give you a feel the suit gets like itchy, many people who bought it use diffrent clothings and feel more comfortable in them.\nDoes not mean its a bad suit outfit, not at all but you could do without it because it comes as an outfit that is not costumizable with seperate pieces or colors unlike other clothings in the shops, personaly I believe looks can be more exclusive with a personal touch to it.\nIf you are a collector then by all means it must be in your collection.\n\nBeing among the first for closed beta invites.\n\nI think that part of the pack seems irrelevant as the game is avalible in early acces for everyday until the official launch to play when you purchased the basic game version.\n\n\n\n200 000 chips.\nWhile this would possibly be the main reason to purchase this pack it does not feel so rewarding to spend money for it as the game force you to spend small in most places, doing it high in craps with a 2k bet may burn this investment real fast with little reward.\n\n1500 Reward points, or RP\nThis is real easy to get when playing the game and is by far no reason to purchase this pack ahead for that bonus.\nThe items in the shop are not exclusive as presented in the advertisement, it is the common currency you gain with playing for shopping.\n\nVIP Acces 1 month.\nThis does not add alot of exclusive feels to pay this pack for it, the games are the same with two new games like baccarat and single deck blackjack avalible only in the VIP room at the moment, maybe subject to change thats why \nI leave it open.\nTo earn VIP you can also play alot in the game to reach that for free, please do note it can reset monthly if you do not meet the requirements to maintain it.\n\n10 VIP guest passes.\n\nThese are in-game passes you can give to other players in the game, DO NOTE it is required for friends or players to purchase the basic game before you can give it to them at this stage of the game not being released officialy yet.\nShould not be a main reason to buy this pack as unbelievably they will EXPIRE after 30 days unused, and you will recieve 3 free passes a month being a VIP.\n\n\n\nMy Final opinion after an unpleasant interaction with the developers in Facebook.\n\nI would advice to not purchase this pack before trying the basic game for a while, the developers see negative revieuws \nas an insult of letting them work harder or listen more to those.\nIt is very unseen a developer to write such words directly to you that basicly is a whole insult to investing in their project to make the experience the best to what you wish it to become.","timestamp_created":1427836324,"timestamp_updated":1430298535,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.488044321537017822","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4xfSbgs0Cd+HjOQ=="}
