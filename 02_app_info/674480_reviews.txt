Almost every attack feels like a heavy attack with a big weapon, even the twin daggers. It makes the game unneccessarily frustrating cause more than often it's simply impossible to avoid attacks because your own attack animation hasn't ended yet. That issue eventually caused me to quit at the Supervisor boss because seemingly there's no way to get a hit in without getting hit first. Major disappointment!\n\n- There seems to be no parry or block mechanic, which is an essential part of souls combat (if there is then I couldn't figure out how to pull it off)\n\nPositive aspects are visuals, sound, atmosphere and (if present) music\n\nThe base is there but this game needs work, especially the combat mechnics.\nAs of now, I can't recommend it!","timestamp_created":1608927921,"timestamp_updated":1608928109,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4nNTlzfYCeL6UvQI="}
