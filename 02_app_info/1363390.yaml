    review: "Well let's not beat around the bush shall we? This ain't no AAA game\
      \ it's an Indie  game and a (rather short one) it has it's pros and it's cons\
      \ but it general it's an OKAY game it reminded me of when I first played The\
      \ Forest but it clearly shows you that this game was made within a budget (or\
      \ simply as a prototype).\n\nIn general it's a short and simple game that has\
      \ good intentions but it's kind of lacking. Do I recomend it? Kinda since it's\
      \ an Indie game by a ultra small studio and I did like the whole idea of the\
      \ game. But it's not like I can't point imperfections, bugs, mistakes or just\
      \ plain simple bad ideas within the game. but give it a try you may find yourself\
      \ entertained by it or not IDK.\n\nPT-BR\nJogo simples e curto tem algumas coisas\
      \ boas em seu favor, mas tamb\xE9m possui erros/imperfei\xE7\xF5es vale a pena?\
      \ Sim e N\xE3o... Sim j\xE1 que vai te entreter por sua dura\xE7\xE3o N\xE3\
      o por que pode n\xE3o ser muito sua \"praia\"."
