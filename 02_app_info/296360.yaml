      /><br><br>Welcome to Kodiak Station. Lush, thick vegetation dominate the large
      and open biospheres running down a central ravine. Hangar bays, water production
      areas, asteroid tracking centers, and more branch off from that ravine. The
      dense foliage of the biospheres provides ample hiding places for Skulks and
      other alien lifeforms.<br><br><img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/296360/extras/50players.png?t=1468540998"
