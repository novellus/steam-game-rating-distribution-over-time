    about_the_game: A gang of animals go on a rescue mission to find their lost pheasant
      friend. Their search goes deep into the dark new landscape of Meadow, where
      only a mystic trail is their guide. <br>Illustrator Lisa Richard offers her
      own take on the Meadow style, where the symbol driven language of Meadow communicates
      the story. A story of determination and the bonds of friendships. <br><br><strong>Before
