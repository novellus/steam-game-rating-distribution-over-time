    review: "This is a very interesting game.  It is one of the first games I had\
      \ ever bought here on Steam, while this is a very good game, there are also\
      \ some drawbacks.\n\nI really like the mechanics of the main character being\
      \ blind and how you need to be very careful about the steps you take around\
      \ the enemies or else you get caught.  I also really enjoy how each of the interactable\
      \ characters, like the enemies and the people that stand on the buttons, all\
      \ are blind and use their different senses to try and find the main character.\
      \  This is the first game I have played that has that.\n\nThe puzzles are also\
      \ very interesting, and I enjoyed playing through them.  There were some puzzles\
      \ that were very monotonous and were difficult to get through because of the\
      \ miniscule details you had to input in order to solve a level.  However, I\
      \ thought they were interesting.\n\nWhile the game itself was very good, and\
      \ very puzzle oriented, I honestly had been struggling to finish this game because\
      \ there really wasn't anything driving me forwards, no story I could really\
      \ see.  The puzzles also started getting mildly frustrating as a result because\
      \ they would get more difficult, but I never knew what I was doing, outside\
      \ of escaping some sort of prison.  \n\nThat being said, the very last level\
      \ before the credits was absolutely incredible.  While it was just a walking\
      \ scene with the enemies chasing after you, the poetry being spoken in the background\
      \ really changed my perspective on the game I was playing, and made me realize\
      \ how I was viewing life.  I've even gone through and just held the right arrow\
      \ key to move and closed my eyes so I could focus and listen to the words more\
      \ (and I've done this several times as of now).  \n\nI do recommend playing\
      \ this game, if you do enjoy puzzles, though especially for that final level.\
      \  I would give this a 7/10 for sure (that last level really bumped up the score\
      \ because of how good and worth it the gameplay became)."
