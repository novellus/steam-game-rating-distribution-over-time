    review: "Rivals is a short (about 2.5 hours) long detective game about piecing\
      \ together the events surrounding two fictional musicians. The music samples\
      \ and voice recordings made me immersed into the time period and the events,\
      \ which is the greatest achievement of this game. The bulk of the gameplay is\
      \ about cross referencing dates, making notes and connecting separate events\
      \ into a neat timeline. After all that the story opens up to be a very human\
      \ story of two friends living their lives in each others shadows. \n\nI would\
      \ easily recommend the game to any fans of detective games."
