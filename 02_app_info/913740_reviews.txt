The art is well-done, stylistic and fun to look at. There's some great writing, fantastic atmosphere and a well-measured amount of comedy relief and a fun sense of humour. The items work well, the difficulty options ensure anyone can play, and the learning curve is pretty shallow, so you don't have to be intimidated. There's plenty of stuff to unlock, plenty of stories to explore, tons of ways to customise and randomise every playthrough and most importantly you can boop him snoot. If you're a long-time horror fan or even have a budding interest this game is right up your alley. seriously, buy it now before they realise it's worth more than what they're selling it for.","timestamp_created":1593475102,"timestamp_updated":1610034351,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4udHh7vYCcuS9kQI="}
