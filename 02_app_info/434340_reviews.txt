The goal is to escape each level by powering the engines that enable the exit. Different surfaces effect how your ball moves and some blocks can be destroyed to open new pathways. There are loads of levels and the bronze, silver, and gold times to beat will provide replayability for the completionists.\n\nI played this with keyboard and mouse for a YouTube video because I didn't have a controller available. The game recommends a controller and I think that is probably the best way to play it. The levels are quite challenging and I think it will be difficult to get gold scores in all of them. The game is a Unity game and is lacking some expected options such as volume control for the music (it can either be on or off), but the music is only present on the menu screens. Some ambient music would be a good addition. Some of the graphics on the menu screens seem a bit unpolished. I enjoyed it and will play more on a machine that has a controller connected.\n\nCheck out my first 20 minutes with the game in my Twenty Minute Tryout video on YouTube...\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NSofnqC4jOg","timestamp_created":1459780492,"timestamp_updated":1459780492,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.53721994161605835","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwrtPs8NMCfPfpVA=="}
