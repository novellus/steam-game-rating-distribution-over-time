      game features at least <strong>6 different maps</strong> with 18 holes each:
      Grassland, Winterland, Graveyard, Mines, Pirates Cove and Jade Temple. Every
      map has unique gameplay features and different aesthetics. Every asset of each
      area and more will be available for you inside the Multiplayer Editor and you
      are free to mix them all together to create the map of your desires! Currently
      there are over <strong>2.300 placeable objects</strong> inside the Multiplayer
      Editor!<br><br>To have a more fun and different experience each time you play,
      we are using a ball hitting system which is based on the speed of the mouse.
      The faster you swing your mouse the harder you will hit the ball. It takes more
      experience and practice to hit that precious hole in one every time.'
