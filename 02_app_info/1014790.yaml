    review: This game is simple to pick up but hard to put down. I don't normally
      play puzzle games, but I find myself saying, "alright, just one more level,
      then I'll put it down and get some work done." The first few levels are deceptively
      easy. Then they get trickier, although always well designed so you get that
      satisfying "aha!" moment when you figure it out. I've put more time into the
      mobile version, but after playing the PC version I prefer its keyboard/gamepad
      controls. The mobile's touch controls work great; I'm just more of a keyboard
      person. If you're looking for an addictive, casual puzzle game that you can
      play in short bursts, this is a really good one.
