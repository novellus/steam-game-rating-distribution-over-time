      the cemeteries were overcrowded with the bodies of the dead, came the one who
      was called The King. Thanks to his unyielding will, The King managed to subdue

      power and immortality didn''t leave his mind. The King realized that power over
      the living was not enough for him.<br>The King decided to get the powerful artefact
      known as the Death Crown. Thus begins the War of the Death Crown.<br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/814530/extras/banner-for-steam-medium-3.gif?t=1605260124"
