Some can really challenging. I wish there was a bit more interactivity with the environment. As is, the mansion feels more like a hub world for cutscenes and finding puzzles. Sometimes, Stauf berates the player to the point of annoyance in certain puzzles. However, the puzzles themself can be clever. Love the CGI and FMV visuals. Love old horror games like this.","timestamp_created":1609672474,"timestamp_updated":1609672474,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw2Zf94/YCf9iEwAI="}
