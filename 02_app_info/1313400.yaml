    review: "You can notice it's new, still many improvements can be done. I played\
      \ through the logic puzzle 4 times, the last on the hardest level and it took\
      \ me only 25 minutes. So it's need more progression in the game. But for 1,5\
      \ \u20AC it could be worth 2 hours of fun. Don't think I'll play it again until\
      \ they have made some more levels somehow"
