      \ those screens. While this review did not include running through our training\
      \ level, we have added a training video to our main page. Playing through this\
      \ training level would have explained things about murderers such as killing\
      \ an innocent person you encounter (who is not carrying a weapon) will brand\
      \ you as a murderer. A book in the training level (as well as the library) will\
      \ explain how to correct your misdeeds. While we didn\u2019t find sound effects\
      \ to be too loud, we have our volume turned to a comfortable level. If anyone\
      \ finds specific sounds that are out of balance, please let us know so that\

    review: 'While I would love to have something positive to say about this "game",
      those positive things don''t exist.

      The gameplay is awful.

      The sound effects are WAY too loud and terrible.

      The enemies appear out of nowhere and march very slowly toward you.

      The control scheme is awful with THREE different interaction buttons depending
      on what you are trying to interact with.

      Bleh.
