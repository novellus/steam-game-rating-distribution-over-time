However, along the way, a minor landslide knocks her unconscious, and when she wakes up, she finds herself alone in a dark and scary forest. Looking for shelter, she finds a strange and haunted-looking mansion looming up ahead. Is there really more to the mansion that it seems, or will Cara Lee uncover something sinister about the house and its inhabitants?\n\nOverall Thoughts: Short little romance released for halloween. The second half of the all the routes felt rushed to myself. \nViktors route is way shorter compared to the other two, but feels like the True End for the story. \nWasn't for me as I'm enjoying Rising Angels and once on a Windswept night, which are on steam for Free Romance options. \n\n5/10 Decent","timestamp_created":1487907677,"timestamp_updated":1487907677,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.429467827081680298","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4tKyNt9oCeqz5cg=="}
