    review: "Ahh the nostalgia!\n\nI remember playing this for hours and hours when\
      \ I was a kid, and now that I'm all grown up, I still love this game. Definitely\
      \ the best Army Men game out of the series without any doubt. Love the voice\
      \ acting. Unit's AI sucks big time, but enh, it can be ignored. \n\nGame still\
      \ holds up in terms of play-ability.\nRating: 7/10"
