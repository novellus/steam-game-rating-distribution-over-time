    review: What a load of crap.  The map is small enough to walk in 10 minutes from
      one end to another.  The graphics are subpar and the whole gameplay/combat system
      is horrible.  You can get  stuck on artifacts, zombies will go through the same
      artifact that you are stuck on and kill you.
