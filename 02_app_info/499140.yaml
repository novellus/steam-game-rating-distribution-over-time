    review: "This is an interestingly different puzzle game. The basic mechanic -\
      \ lines of light and redirectors - is both simple and, at times, a challenge.\
      \ As such, yes, it's a good game.\n\nBut\u2026 Well, it could do with a few\
      \ improvements to the interface to make it less annoying without detracting\
      \ from the game-play. A way to trigger all the lines that need to be solved\
      \ together [edit: turns out there is one - double click or space bar, not that\
      \ it's documented), and those lines advancing significantly faster than they\
      \ currently do. (Presently, the proof of solution is so languid as to have put\
      \ me borderline as to whether I would recommend it.)\n\nAdditionally, it has\
      \ a bug whereby in full screen - at least on my dual-screen setup - the mouse\
      \ doesn't interact with the game. Getting it out of full screen mode was, in\
      \ itself, a significant challenge.\n\nOn further play, it gets that bit too\
      \ tedious, dropping it from recommend to not\u2026"
