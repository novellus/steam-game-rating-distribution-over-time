And to this day, I still love and play it. From the art to the music to the characters, I've adored this game for almost ten years now. It's a game that will always have a special place in my heart.\n\nIt's a stat raising VN which is a hit or miss with most people. But with the power of save-scumming, getting the stats you need is not an issue. It's sad that the original walkthrough is gone. But in short, get to 70+ for all stats to get A's on the mock and 130+ for the finals. 130+ is also the min of most characters for their best ending. (With Beck being the exception, the tough bastard D:)\n\nThe dialogue definitely shows the game's age. With the use of ret*rd and slut-shaming, it has a few cringey moments. But those are so few and far between, and if you consider how teenagers are, those moments fade away.\n\nIn short, I'd recommend this game 100%. It's a little harder for completionists without a walkthrough, but that's what replays are for right ;D","timestamp_created":1607402219,"timestamp_updated":1607402219,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ43+yooPYCcKiOuAI="}
