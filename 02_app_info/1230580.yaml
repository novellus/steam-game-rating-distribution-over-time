    review: I'm gonna be straight up and say that I bought this because I like the
      artist and want to support the game, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't buy
      it. Chipocrite really brings together chiptune and running on a dragons back
      through space without a space suit after jumping out of a spaceship. If you
      haven't bought the game, buy it; if you haven't bought the soundtrack, I would
      recommend it.
