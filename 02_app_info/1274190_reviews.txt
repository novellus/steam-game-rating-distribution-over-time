Your hitbox is the ship's cockpit, so somewhere in the front, not centered.\n2. Powerups drop randomly\n3. Soundtrack is stock GMidi (I haven't heard this in a looong time!)\n4. If you die, you restart the entire stage\n5. It crashed to desktop when dying the 2nd time at stage 4 boss, that seemed like a fitting end!\n\nIts hilarious.","timestamp_created":1601193121,"timestamp_updated":1601193121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.525862038135528564","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zoKj5/QCcruvpAI="}
