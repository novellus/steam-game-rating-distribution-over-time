      \ asteroids, and expand the population to grow your economy by building energy\
      \ spheres, harvesters, and ringworlds.<br><br>Learn how to thrive in beautiful\
      \ procedurally-generated star systems by building hyperlanes to other stars\
      \ and adapting to constant changes with asteroid fields depleting, new stars\
      \ being born, and ancient ones going supernova.<br><br>Capture mysterious space\

      \ the 4X space strategy genre with fast-paced battles without tedious micromanagement.\
      \ Forget about hexagons and build hyperlanes directly to other stars...as long\
      \ as you have enough energy!<br><br>Every time you finish a turn, one million\
