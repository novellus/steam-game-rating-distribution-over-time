I love the music for this game, it knows exactly how to set the mood. I like the visuals, especially the items, though sometimes i wish the enemies were 3d with a shader (like the environment seems to be). Slasher's Keep can seem frustrating or confusing at first, but if you put in the time to discover better ways at playing the game it becomes really satisfying. Minorly buggy, had a couple of enemy encounters where enemies were stuck healing infinitely, and had my game crash at the end of my first complete story playthrough. Also there's a ton of replayability! Very much recommend!","timestamp_created":1609820738,"timestamp_updated":1609820738,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwneKy6PYCdtzMwAI="}
