    review: Short passable side scrolling action game with a lot of mostly dull platforming
      but a nice unique art style that looks really good in its few on rail shooting
      segments. Loses the western theme fast to have you fighting ninja, on top of
      dinosaurs, on sinking ships, and in areas with shifting gravity. Good for the
      low price, but nothing really memorable mechanically or to keep you coming back.
