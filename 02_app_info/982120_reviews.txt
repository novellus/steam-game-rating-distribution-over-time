Basic concept that is fun in its own right but then they add the scaling mechanic where the player can shrink down very tiny and get to places they couldn't before, like Ant-Man! Really fun to explore the levels and have to play with your scale to find everything, makes you think in a different way. Also always appreciate a VR game where I can play at any pace I want, which this definitely is.\n\nGood buy, I am enjoying it and there is always more stuff to find!","timestamp_created":1544831016,"timestamp_updated":1544831016,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwxNPG1+cCcOOptQE="}
