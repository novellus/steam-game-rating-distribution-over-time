    about_the_game: "The main character's name is Pixie. She is a young woman who\
      \ lives in a peaceful city with her mother and younger sister. But when she\
      \ wakes up one day, she finds her precious garden being invaded by a horde of\
      \ monsters! Now she must use the powers that her late grandmother passed to\
      \ her to fight against the monsters and discover who is behind this invasion\
      \ and save her garden.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPixie Panic Garden is a fun and challenging\
      \ action game in the style of classic bomberman games from the super nintendo\
      \ and genesis eras. In PPG, that classic formula is spiced up with the addition\
      \ of equipable skills for the main character, enemies each with their own set\
      \ of malicious tricks and behaviour, levels with specific objectives to keep\
      \ you on your toes and different stages with secrets and hazards that will put\
      \ your abilities to the test.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPixie Panic Garden also features\
      \ many 16-bit style, erotic pixel sprite animations for a variety of fetishes,\
      \ with a unique animation for every enemy in the game, ranging from monsters\
      \ and creatures to humanoids both male and female, retro style CG's for the\
      \ bosses with different variations and a gallery mode where you can enjoy all\
      \ of this content at your leisure, including an option to sync the sprite animations\
      \ with their respective CG versions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith a catchy soundtrack\
      \ to keep your spirits up, a mix of strategy and action to suit your gameplay\
      \ urges and cutely draw, animated and voiced erotic content, PPG will for sure\
      \ bring entertainment and enjoyment to you! I hope you have a great time playing\
      \ it!"

      notes: "Pixie Panic Garden contains 2D pixel sprite animations depicting both\
        \ consensual and non-consensual (hypnosis/mind-break) sexual acts. It also\
        \ has a number of scenes and 2D images of the same nature.\r\n\r\nSexual acts\
        \ involve the main character (female) and other humanoids (female/male) as\
        \ well as fictional creatures and monsters.\r\n\r\nThe entire mature content\
        \ of the game can be enabled/disabled at will by the player, and individual\
        \ animations can be canceled/stopped as well.\r\n\r\n"
