      \ girl wakes up, groggy in an unknown room. A talking dog appears before her\
      \ and she becomes startled by the revelation he tells her: They are gods and\
      \ it is their duty to change the fate of any humans that ask for their help.\
      \ Letters appear in the mail and with pen in hand she begins her job.<br><br>People\
      \ who believe in this legend live all over the world, in every shape and form.\
      \ They write and pray to the gods, seeking help for their troubles:<br><br>A\

      \ who\u2019s lost all hope and contemplates suicide.<br>A rookie police officer\
      \ who burns with justice and hopes for his first big case.<br>A young woman\
      \ desperately chasing her dream against all odds.<br>Evan a stray cat who would\
      \ be simply satisfied with some dried fish to eat.<br><br>They say that a god\
      \ is good and makes choices for the greater good. However, are these really\
      \ the best choices for mortals?<br><br>With the power to change the fate of\

      \ help but remember, changing someone\u2019s fate will have an effect on others\
      \ whether they are interconnected or not. As you read through each story, perhaps\
