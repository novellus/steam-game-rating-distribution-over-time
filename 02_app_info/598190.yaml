    review: "The soundtrack is amazing. \n\nHowever it doesn't contain all the tracks\
      \ of the game. I mean the track of the Path of Pain is part of Sealed Vessel\
      \ in its [i]normal[/i] version. If you want to hear the evolution of the track\
      \ as you heard in the Path of Pain you have to hear it on YouTube. But it's\
      \ a detail.\n\nFlac available."
