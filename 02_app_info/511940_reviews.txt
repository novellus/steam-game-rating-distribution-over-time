So in the interests of lowering the number of thumb-downs for the review about to occur, let me say that: a. I am in no way affiliated with anyone who made the film, or anyone who works for Dwarven Forge (though they can send me free stuff, should they be so inclined), b. I watch a lot of documentaries, read a lot of non-fiction books and magazine articles, and listen to no end of commentaries on DVDs and Blu-Rays, so I actually do dig this sh*t, and c. anyone who thumbs down my review PURELY because I gave this product a positive response, without so much as even reading it, is a puerile, knee-jerk C*NT-F*CK who can EAT MY A*SE-PELLETS for all I care. \n\n   At least do me the common courtesy of sticking with me for another paragraph or two, THEN thumb me down. Cheers in advance.\n\n   Okay, so I'm in my early forties and grew up playing...well, not strictly Dungeons & Dragons, but certainly a wide variety of tabletop roleplaying games, all of them undeniably owing their lineage to that great, wise ol' grandaddy of RPGs. While I don't roleplay too often these days, such tabletop games hog a HUGE sentimental spot inside my heart, and this is a documentary about another childish w*nker in his forties who refuses to grow up. \n\n   What's more, it's a very WELL-MADE documentary about a childish w*nker in his forties who refuses to grow up, which captures the youthful spirit of such dreamers very, very nicely indeed. It's perhaps not the BEST film about the subject in question - there's a recently-released fiction film called Zero Charisma which probably deserves that honour - but it is of indisputably good quality.\n\n   Two questions still remain, though: is it worth ten dollars to purchase, and should it be on Steam?\n\n   Hmmm...tricky questions, to be sure. To me, ten dollars? Absolutely. I didn't grow up in an entitled, selfish generation which believes it should get everything for free. Sure, I dubiously download plenty of stuff, but sometimes I'm willing to acknowledge that it took someone longer than 0.9 nanoseconds of their time to produce a product, and henceforth I'm happy to give them a small slice of what little money I have. \n\n   Trust me when I say that this documentary is unlikely to make anyone filthy rich, so this is clearly a labour of love. Henceforth, it doesn't deserve your vitriol as much as, say, I don't know...Bill Gates' recent pet virus, aka \"Windows 10\"? Whoever made this movie made it to share something with other human beings, not to buy more third-world, ten-year-old sex slaves to fill the basements of their many mansions. Save your cynicism for the big guns.\n\n   Should it be on Steam? Hmmm...a harder question. Given that there seems to be no end of short and feature films with LITTLE TO NO RELATION TO GAMING on Steam of late, I'd say this one easily qualifies as \"relevant\" by comparison. Put it another way: without Dungeons & Dragons, there almost certainly wouldn't be f*cking SKYRIM, or even Dark Souls for that matter. But for anyone who wants to make a lucid, mature argument that perhaps Steam isn't an appropriate platform for distributing videos, period, I'm not necessarily going to argue with you.\n\n   In all honesty, this product was an impulse buy, and partly because I had Steam dollars just sitting there waiting to be spent. Do I consider it ten dollars well spent? Absolutely. Could I have just downloaded it for free from somewhere else off the internet? Probably. But somebody, sometime, should perhaps pay for this sh*t, or else people will stop making movies altogether, and whoever made this isn't Michael f*cking Bay. Ten bucks isn't a lot of money, and once Valve takes their cut, I sincerely doubt that anyone involved with this film will be buying their Mum a new mansion with the proceeds.\n\n   Short version: if you're looking for a Steam-distributed video to hate on, this really isn't the one. Start your battle elsewhere, and perhaps slowly make your way back to this if your vitriol carries you that far. As far as I'm concerned, any GAME-related (and not just VIDEO game-related) documentary has a place here. You don't agree, then don't buy it. Surely you have better things to do with your time than troll Store pages.\n\n   Cheers to anyone who bothered to read this far - I know this review has a few more words and far less pictures than your average Facebook post - and if you still think I deserve a big, fat thumb-down, go for it. I'll be the first to admit that I do enjoy a good rant. Cheers to Steam for giving me the space in which to do so (hey, whadya know, it IS still a \"free\" world after all...for another fortnight or so, at least)!!\n\nVerdict: 8/10.\n\nUPDATE: I've just finished watching this documentary for the third time, and I gotta say, I love it. It really is a fantastically well-made doco about chasing one's dreams, and what it takes to hold on to them. Let's raise that 8 to a 9, eh?\n\nRevised Verdict: 9/10.","timestamp_created":1498043617,"timestamp_updated":1535721014,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.65691840648651123","comment_count":5,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwr+CGyOUCdby1fA=="}
