I never expected it to be as difficult as it is and I have only gotten to play it 2 player thus far but I already know it would be a riot to play this thing with 4 people. I also thought it would be a rather simple mash a few buttons and win kind of game but it actually takes a hot second to think on the fly what you need to do to win. It's such a wonderful suprise of a game although I don't think I'd ever play it singleplayer.","timestamp_created":1608703722,"timestamp_updated":1608703722,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwodiNx/YCfZCvvAI="}
