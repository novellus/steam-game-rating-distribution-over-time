I thought the voice acting was great in that \"cheesy\" kind of way. I really wished the game was longer. And considering that this was free, there is absolutely no reason to not give it a try. As for the puzzles, they're relatively self-explanatory. I don't recall being stumped by anything, and I'm kind of an idiot, so if that's your concern you should be fine. If for whatever reason you DO get stumped, there are great community guides to help you along. Try this out. The file size is small and, even if you hate point and click adventures, I think the charm of the characters will win you over. \n\nThis is not a \"so bad it's good\" game. I think this was a legitimately great game, and I had a wonderful time with it!","timestamp_created":1488143129,"timestamp_updated":1488143129,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4msOPvtoCcJKdcw=="}
