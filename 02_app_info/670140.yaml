    about_the_game: <strong><i>THE STORY THUS FAR:</i></strong><br><br>Since the dawn
      of time, the power of the Blue Wizards <br>has been known to all folk. Life
      was peaceful for many years until an evil being known as Darklin came into the
      realm of the Vale Islands <br><br>This was known as the &quot;Darkest Hour&quot;.
      <br>Many perished...men...women...and children. <br>The battle between the powerful
      Blue Wizards and the <br>force known as Darklin waged on for many, many years.
      Until finally, the Wizards drove off Darklin and he was banished to another
      realm.<br><br>Even though he was defeated, he was not dead. <br><br>The Wizards
      sealed him away. The only way he could be brought back is by sacrificing a Wizard.  By
      sacrificing a Wizard, their power could be used to release the powers of darkness.
      <br><br>This would break the seal that binds Darklin. <br>Knowing this knowledge,
      the Wizards decided to shut themselves away from everyone. <br><br>They decided
      to live in secret so that no force, good or evil, can know where the descendants
      of the Wizards lived. <br>Our story begins here, where the Wizards reside in
      peace and in secret....<br><br><strong><i>FEATURES OF THE GAME:</i></strong><br>*
