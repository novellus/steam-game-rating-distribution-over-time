    review: 'Many people say that it''s just an easy RPG-maker project, but if you
      are just starting with RPG games whatsoever, or you haven''t played one yet
      it''s a great choice!

      The story is casual - it makes the main goal easy to understand

      You don''t need much to get what''s going on

      If you search for something that will help you get into RPG games - this may
      be it!'
