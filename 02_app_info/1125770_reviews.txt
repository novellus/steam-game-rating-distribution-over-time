Each trip is a hellish unneccessary detour. Obstacles are placed mean to just slow you down. Each bump into an obstacle means one death (of max 4). Besides of repetive asset flips this could be an exciting tire-spinning adventure - but nah. Devs decided to make it as much unforgiving as possible and the clunky steering car is nailed to the street. Snoar.","timestamp_created":1584445811,"timestamp_updated":1584445875,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.618230521678924561","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4s6yV9PACe7Dd+AE="}
