    review: "Edit: Okay well thst's awkward.. I just loaded the game up and there\
      \ was no game available in the load game slot :| To the dev, you may wanna make\
      \ it WAY more clear when/how the game saves. I died and it kicked me back to\
      \ the start of the room I was in, so I assumed it was 'saved' in some way, since\
      \ there was no \"this is a save point\" or anything like that and Alt-F4'd,\
      \ which I guess totally didn't save anything at all. :( The little heart-thing\
      \ in town, which spins and boops when you hit it, apparently also isn't a save\
      \ point? Kind've an annoying thing to have be so unnecessarily unclear. \n\n\
      Upon booting it back up I see in the start/escape menu there's a \"Save and\
      \ quit\" while playing - a simple \"Be sure you save and quit from the menu!\"\
      \ warning would help alleviate that. It does seem to 'autosave' in that if you\
      \ die or something you get pushed back a bit, and I guess the spinning heart\
      \ in town is maybe a heal or something and not a save?\n\nAlso, having to constantly\
      \ hold a button to sprint gets tiresome, there's almost no times I find myself\
      \ not wanting to be sprinting, and it's kinda annoying to have to mash a button\
      \ constantly to avoid going at a crawl.\n\nA pretty cute little game from what\
      \ I've seen so far. It popped up the other day and I kept an eye on it for reviews\
      \ and such and figured since nobody else had and it wasn't very expensive I'd\
      \ take a shot at it.\n\nFirst and foremost, it plays/runs smoothly. I wasn't\
      \ fighting with any technical issues, lag, controller/mouse/keyboard fiddling\
      \ or anything - it loaded up full screen, ran fine, etc. right from the get\
      \ go, so I quite appreciate that.\n\nThe UI and text and everything feels appropriate\
      \ for the games art style - there's not a jarring variation in he aesthetic,\
      \ fonts, or anything else.\n\nThe music is a little bland in some of the first\
      \ couple areas and repeats pretty readily, but I get the impression this was\
      \ a game made by a fairly small team, so I can give a pass there, especially\
      \ as it wasn't extremely bothersom or anything.\n\nYou can think of it kina\
      \ like the SNES Zelda and it's ilk, but with more of a variety of weapons and\
      \ items as the selling point. There's a bit of story and all, but any 'serious'\
      \ feel to it is thrown off by the NPCs who mostly just kinda say kinda wacky\
      \ or silly things - the writing isn't bad, but it's probably not the game's\
      \ strongest suit.\n\nIf you are looking for a top-down game where you run from\
      \ screen to screen killing enemies and finding items with a range of effects/ranges/stats,\
      \ a bunch of crafting/gathering materials and blueprints to upgrade/make your\
      \ weapons, all while having a pretty classic SNES-esque \"find the things to\
      \ put in the place\" storyline of sorts, then this is a solid little indie title.\n\
      \nMy biggest complaint is a personal preference, but I can't stand heavily gradient/rendered\
      \ lighting effects on pixel art, it just drives me up the wall, but most people\
      \ seem to not really care, so whatever on that one I suppose."
