You do the most simplest task: walk in a line. But everything's out to get you, so you have to check every single thing and save after every single puzzle you solve, because you have no clue what's going to murder you. Artwork is also cute, and the endings were good & funny. Also the menu music slaps. Maybe we should get a Nyanco hentai.\n\nAll in all, it's a quick play, took me about an hour. It's worth the two dollars.","timestamp_created":1609490929,"timestamp_updated":1609492242,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5dPN3vYCeOervwI="}
