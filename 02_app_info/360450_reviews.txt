The game fails to simulate counter time, and parry-riposte seems clunky, but distance management, counterattacks, feints with blade and tactical feints, even true time (a fencing concept, in which attack lead by blade is good, and attack lead by feet / body is stupid) simulation - everything is on point. If You're into kendo, kenjutsu, aiki-ken or even just samurai cinema - You will feel at home with this game.","timestamp_created":1609606692,"timestamp_updated":1609606692,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwyp+C4vYCcaPkvwI="}
