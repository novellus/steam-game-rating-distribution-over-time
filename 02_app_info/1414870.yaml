      /><br><br><strong>Jidousha Shakai</strong> is a sandbox racing game that provides
      high quality driving physics, huge amounts of vehicle customization, and various
      open worlds to explore and race in.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1414870/extras/SteamStore_Customization.png?t=1608140251"
      /><br><br>Customization is the forefront experience in Jidousha Shakai. You
      can stick to the basics and upgrade your bumpers, wheels, wings, lights and
      paint. If you are feeling you want more, you can take advantage of the advanced
      customization features within Jidousha Shakai and modify hoods, roof, windows,
      grills, tires, engine, exhaust, <strong>and much, much more</strong>. Literally
      every inch of your cars look and performance is at your fingertips to make something
      truly <strong>unique</strong>.<br><br><img src="https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1414870/extras/SteamStore_Physics.png?t=1608140251"
      /><br><br>The physics and simulation in Jidousha Shakai are meant to provide
      a realistic but fun driving experience. There are no scripted events or hand
      holding when it comes to driving. Because the simulation is accurate, you can
      upgrade your car as you see fit and it will perform how you would expect. Your
      engine will stall if you don't clutch correctly while driving a manual transmission
      car. Your differential choice plays a big part in how your car over-steers.
      Your engine is physically modeled after real world data and you have access
      to everything by using the advanced &quot;chip tuning&quot; system to set your
      engines rev limit, fuel ratio, and much more. All of this is accurately simulated
      without taking away the fun factor that is lacking in other driving simulators.<br><br><img

      /><br><br>Take your fully customized car on to one of the many hand crafted
      open world maps. Explore hot spots from your world map that include meet spots,
      drift spots, drag spots, speed challenges, and time trials. The open world can
      be fully autonomous or you can have full control over the traffic density, the
      time of day, weather, and many more options that affect the world.
