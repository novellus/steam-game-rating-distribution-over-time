    review: 'Expensive 5-cost or 4-cost heroes with two tiers of abilities, one than
      triggers when bought, and the other in scrapping reserve for later. Both activate
      faction abilities, so you usually want to time your purchase to help trigger
      combos.


      The tertiary abilities on some heroes are more interesting than the base heroes
      set, mimicking some of the less-prevalent abilities for their faction, such
      as blob scrapping trade row stuff, or the trade fed hero that allows you to
      purchase a 3-cost card for free and put it on top of your deck (think Customs
      Frigate), to the star empire card allowing for draw-and-discard card cycling.


      Except for machine cult. Machine cult is just scrapping for days. And I''m okay
      with that.'
