    review: "To begin, I really like this game. It also has a lot of potential. I\
      \ wouldn't say things are outright bad, more like meh.\n\nFirst of all, it's\
      \ a lot of clicking. It's a match-1 and that makes it a lot easier than if it\
      \ were a match-2 type game. Matching tile 2+ is not necessary to advance, but\
      \ it eventually hinders you if you do not. The fighting is so unengaging that\
      \ I end up clicking through tiles quickly and missing the details about my health,\
      \ mind, and status effects. I think this is because they're so tiny and the\
      \ clicking can be mesmerizing. It bothers me a LOT how time moves in game. I\
      \ just made it to level 100 and it has supposedly been [b]26 years[/b] in game!\
      \ That feels so disjointed from everything else in game. It bothers me. Time\
      \ doesn't matter, beyond for bonuses.\n\nThe characters are that JRPG-side-side-character\
      \ kind of shallow and sort of childish. They are't really fleshed out. It takes\
      \ forever to get the story bits out of the game, and the character development\
      \ is so minuscule to begin with. It leaves me feeling like I'm not getting much\
      \ out of it.\n\nThe item mixing mechanic has so much potential, so many cool\
      \ items with very useful effects, but the actual mechanics don't get explained\
      \ very well if at all, and there are so many variables going on at once that\
      \ it makes it hard to distinguish what exactly is going on with your results;\
      \ it's hard to figure out what to mix so that I can achieve what I want. \n\n\
      The art is kind of different (in a good way), and the coloring gorgeous, but\
      \ it seems like the artist(s) for the characters didn't fully understand angles.\
      \ For example, the art is just funky underneath and around the torso and chest\
      \ areas for several characters (like Monika). \n\nOverall, it's playable and\
      \ enjoyable honestly. There's enough content and it's understandable enough\
      \ to enjoy. The clicking is soothing and mesmerizing. While making it a match-1\
      \ rather than a match-2 makes it more easily playable, I wonder if they could've\
      \ given us the option for that difficulty to give us some more fun.\n\nI like\
      \ it enough to keep playing it. You might too. Maybe grab it on sale."
