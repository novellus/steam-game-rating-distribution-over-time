As someone who enjoys text-based projects, I found the attention to detail effective and at times even experimentally poetic. The character development was astonishing considering the lack of visual detail; these kind of projects prove that nothing, no strong graphics nor interesting music nor slick controls, trump good writing.\n\nMAJOR/MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD.\n\nI particularly liked all the details that went into the poltergeists 'riddle' and the following optional quest. These were perfect; you could guess them without help, yet they weren't ridiculously challenging in the way videogame text-based puzzles often are. \n\nThe details with the teenager's mental health also stood out to me as a relatively fresh take on magic, technology, and boundaries. Very cool. This game is made with a lot of forethought and empathy, two things that are as difficult to capture as an elemental firewall.","timestamp_created":1609985375,"timestamp_updated":1609985375,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4seem7fYCeZyVwQI="}
