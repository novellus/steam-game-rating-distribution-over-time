The writing while feeling somewhat better than the first game also feels somewhat lazier at times, example being how you keep recruiting these incredible people that should probably be staying in their home country to help... Also using the oldest villain cliche in the book of wanting to end the world to bring back their dead lover? The first game had a much better sense of whimsy, but I did like the tributes and references to the first game's events.\nI really liked the addition of building up your kingdom, felt kind of like \"My Life as King\" but better.\nI was going to wait to write this until I finished the game, but I'm 72 hours in and still not done, so\nI'll just have to edit this later with my final thoughts assuming it lets me (doesn't always), it certainly\nhas enough padding that's for sure, aside from mandatory grinding to not be murdered in battle\nI've mostly been doing recruitment side quests only!","timestamp_created":1609917600,"timestamp_updated":1609917600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwkKKk6/YCdpf3wAI="}
