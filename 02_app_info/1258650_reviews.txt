The enemy bullets on the are relatively everchanging. Sometimes when the player wants to press the bomb key, it is often too late.\n\n-It's suggested to give 3-ups and 5 bombs at the beginning of the game, otherwise it may not be enough to use at the back, especially when the players had finished several stage in an arcade-play.\n\n-It is strongly recommended to reduce the difficulty of the stage 6(before the boss battle), and add fixed 1-up awards in the game. Also,chances to continue when lose all lives are suggested(actually three credits is enough,especially for the players who are not good at Danmmaku games). well,it's confirm that on the difficulty of the game, the hardest two difficulties can make most of the players failed to react in time when dodging(even for those good-skilled players).And, even though the simplest two difficulties are still \"not-unfriendly\" for other players, most of the \"newbie\" players are often completely got stuck on the stage 6 even in easy,no matter how many time they try---this is why I recommended to reduce the difficulty of this stage.\n\n-It is recommended to optimize the enemy's barrage. Sometimes, when hiding from the super dense sniper bullets, the position is often locked by the enemy's aircraft coming from above. (especially at the beginning of 6th stage, it is suggested to reduce the number of enemies there.It often cost many player's bombs)\n\nIn fact, I'm optimistic about this game. It has high development potential.","timestamp_created":1589632611,"timestamp_updated":1589632611,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.561403512954711914","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4q5bfjvICcdCNiAI="}
