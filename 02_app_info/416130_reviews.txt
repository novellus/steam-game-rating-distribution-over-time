This visual novel is utter crap. Hmmmm... It is visual. But a novel? Nah. \n\nThe \"story\" is too superficial and the characters are barely even existing as such. You \"play\" as Azure, a japanese (at least I assume so) schoolgirl that looks like 10 albeit actually being 18 (what a coincidence). She is bored, her life is crap. Typical teenager stuff. But also she is borderline stupid and has a rather interesting relationship with her father, who she kind of loves (her mom is dead boohoo) but also kind of despises (he gets \"angry\" for her bailing on school). She isn't even sure herself. But meh, life goes on and so she decides to sneak out. Though various mischiefs caused by her sheer stupidity she gets to meet a girl from another planet: the Queen of Mars. Another borderline stupid character that constantly changes her motivation and presents a poorly written plot about some war on Mars.\n\nSkip.\n\nAnd then finally, after about 20 minutes of stupid, poorly written \"dialogues\" and \"characters\" and lots of tootling \"music\", you get to why you downloaded this \"game\" ahem \"visual novel\" (IT'S FREE!!!!(thank god)) : the obligatory yuri sex scene. It's OK actually, compared to the rest of this \"beautiful experience\". But if you're a fan of yuri stuff- and I mean REAL yuri stuff- then it's also garbage. It feels like something written by a porn-addicted 15-year-old who you imagine gulping down his saliva every now and then whilst figuring out the words to write.\n\nIf you decided to make your own \"visual novel\" it would probably come out more than just better written. You'll enjoy it more and you would have accomplished something instead of just having wasted your time. Don't get me wrong, the two girls in Written In The Sky are rather attractive and some of the backgrounds look decent but this changes nothing.\n\nWritten in the Sky is not a game. It is not a visual novel. There is no interactivity whatsoever. Most of the backgrounds look like crap, the music is irritating to say the least, the big pink text box covers up the t***ies and the writing is beyond awful. But you get to \"play\" for only half an hour to get the two achievements. That's cool.\n\nSo what is Written in the Sky exactly?\n\nEhm... Visual.... Pulp.... fan-fiction-like? This really is a tough question. It'd be best if you see for yourself. It barely even lasts for half an hour. But half an hour actually is a long time you could spend doing something else. In fact I procrastinated on studying in order to \"play\" this. \n\n2/10 because I like yuri lol\nand also the trailer is really funny - probz to those who made it\n\n[h1]WARNING: DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME[/h1]","timestamp_created":1488314650,"timestamp_updated":1587812572,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.577059030532836914","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtqPA2PECcr6xcw=="}
