    review: "UPDATE: *Special K can improve the FPS issue, but there's no cure. Some\
      \ areas are just as slow, so I can't recommend it to everyone. Another thing\
      \ that bothered me was the difficulty of the last battle, which was further\
      \ complicated by the FPS. When modded, this version is excellent, and the game\
      \ as a whole stands out as one of the best in the franchise. The *3x Boost was\
      \ a slam dunk. \n\n*Scroll down for a guide on how to improve the FPS. \n*If\
      \ you haven't applied the mods yet, keep reading.\n\nMODS\nThe best tutorial\
      \ for explaining the mod process can be found on Youtube. These videos are easy\
      \ to follow & will explain everything you need to know, including where to download\
      \ the files.  \n1. Start with *Fans Remaster Final Fantasy 8 Remastered! Mods\
      \ Setup Tutorial, Part 1* You'll use this method to apply about 5 mods -- Cards,\
      \ Squall, UI, Weapons, etc...\n2. Then follow up with *Modding Final Fantasy\
      \ 8 Remastered Guide - Battle Background Textures!* by the same YouTuber. This\
      \ video explains how to apply various HD models and textures. \n\nFPS IMPROVEMENT\n\
      This is where the Kaldaien's *Special K tool comes in. Search for *An Unofficial\
      \ Guide to Special K*. Download it. After that, the application will install\
      \ to your *Documents folder. As far as I know, you can't change the install\
      \ location, so you might want to *Hide the folder if that bothers you. \n\n\
      After you've applied all the proper downloads, follow the process below:\n\n\
      Run/Inject *Special K --> \nRun *FF8-R on Steam --> \nSpecial K will launch\
      \ automatically -->\nPress the hotkeys to open the *Control Panel --> \nFind\
      \ the *Framerate Limited Section --> \nFind *Advanced in the bottom right of\
      \ the section --> \nBox *Sleepless Window Thread --> \nMove down two sections\
      \ to *Compatibility Settings -->\nUnbox everything but *OpenGl -->\n\nThis greatly\
      \ reduces the framerate in most areas (mods or not), but the slowness is still\
      \ common. The last battle was especially problematic (even with the *3x Boost)\
      \ because it runs slow during the last boss & its HP is ridiculously high. \
      \ \n\nIts not necessary to keep the *Control Panel visible while playing. Simply\
      \ exit after making the changes and it will keep \"injecting\" in your system\
      \ tray. Your settings will also be saved, so just be sure to launch Special\
      \ K before playing the game from now on and it'll work fine. "
