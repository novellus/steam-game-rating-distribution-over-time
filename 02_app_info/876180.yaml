    review: "Skyscrapers or High Rise is one of those less well known Japanese logic\
      \ puzzles but they are great fun. It is not at all similar to Sudoku except\
      \ for the fact that they both use numbers. \n\n[code]PUZZLE INFO:\n- Each row\
      \ or column can never have a building with the same height\n- Numbers outside\
      \ the grid tells you how many buildings can be seen from that side\n- Taller\
      \ buildings block shorter ones\n\neg. in a row 21453, \nviewing from the left\
      \ you will see 3 buildings (245)\nviewing from the right you will see 2 buildings\
      \ (35)\n\nAll puzzles can be solved with logic alone. There is never a need\
      \ to guess. [/code]\n\nWhat you see from the screenshots is what you get. The\
      \ layout is really that simplistic but it does includes all the basic yet important\
      \ features one would require in a puzzle game:\n- notation system\n- mid puzzle\
      \ progress is saved automatically\n- handcrafted puzzles\n- windowed mode is\
      \ possible\n- turning off sounds & music is possible\n- extra: random level\
      \ generator = unlimited puzzles\n\nI was actually surprised to find a digital\
      \ adaptation and on steam to boot. This game however added in a (really redundant)\
      \ visual novel on the side. To be honest, I skimmed through as the plot was\
      \ crap. The puzzles on the other hand are great. \n\nNote: You do not have to\
      \ play the vn in order to play the puzzles but you have to finish most puzzles\
      \ in order to progress through the vn.\n\n[i]If you yearn for more, there is\
      \ a much more challenging variant known as [u]High Rise Suguru[/u] which can\
      \ be found in 'Beyond Sudoku' published by Puzzler.\n\nIf you like such (obscure)\
      \ Japanese logic puzzles, do check out [u]Hashi[/u], [u]Siltherlink[/u], [u]Hitori[/u].[/i]"
