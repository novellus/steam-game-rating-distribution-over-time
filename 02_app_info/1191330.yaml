      in development since 2016, with similarities to classic MMORPGs. It features
      a unique combat system which can be described as a mix of tab targeting and
      hack &amp; slash. The small indie developer team, consisting of MMO players,
      is especially interested in creating a free and fair game, where content is
      accessible without any purchase barriers. For this reason, the focus of the
      in-game store is on cosmetic items such as mounts, pets and skins.<h2 class="bb_tag">The
      world of Inferna</h2>Inferna, a living world with day/night cycle, weather effects,
      dangerous boss enemies and gloomy dungeons. Explore it on one of the numerous
      mounts. Face opposing factions in fast-paced PvP battles. Compete alone or with
      your guild for power, glory and resources.<h2 class="bb_tag">Map of Pangaeu</h2><img

      bring improvements into the game. Special attention is given to working closely
      with the community to develop an MMO that offers players a unique gaming experience.<h2

      implemented directly in the game.'
