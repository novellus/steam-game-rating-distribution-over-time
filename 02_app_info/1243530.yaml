    review: "I played the first game and loved it, and so far I'm loving the second\
      \ game. \n\nNice platforming. The videos don't indicate how difficult it can\
      \ be to get some of the stars. Completing a level is easy, but if you want to\
      \ collect the 3 stars hidden in each level you have to be prepared to redo a\
      \ section over and over until you land it right.\n\nWhat is nice about this\
      \ game is it lets you choose the difficulty and how much you get out of the\
      \ game is up to you. It also has a nice setting, and the ability set can be\
      \ interesting and with fun puzzles that also require reflexes."
