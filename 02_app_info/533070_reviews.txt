It's an older game, but high quality, set in a wonderful fantasy world (in a no surprises but makes you smile at all the tropes kind of way). There's a dark lord rising, and only you can stop the world from returning to cursed slavery under his dominion.  I hadn't expected to enjoy myself so much!\n\nPros:\n- nothing really special story-wise, but feels complete\n- customize the level for extra challenge\n- the right number of interesting and moderately challenging HO scenes\n- a variety of puzzles, a few that are challenging\n- nice art, perfect for that old school D&D - er, fantasy - vibe\n- interactive map that shows you rooms where the collectable item (owl) has been found (nice and clear)\n- enough back-tracking to be interesting, not enough to be annoying\n- you can interact with the whole map throughout\n- things that make sense generally work; some items can be used more than once\n- items in HO scenes are not \"hidden\" in darkness or brown colours\n\nCons:\n- only in-game achievements (but decent ones with a bonus for collecting all)\n- lower resolution (but full screen worked fine)\n- limited music\n- no bonus chapter and little in the way of true bonuses (can't replay scenes / puzzles etc)\n\n[b]Overall:[/b]  I liked it and found it very well made.  It has limited voice acting, and isn't a \"collector's edition\" in terms of what we're used to 4-5 years later, but it was fun.  I would (and will) buy it for my friends and family who enjoy these games. A great game to play when you're looking for \"comfort gaming\" (if you enjoy fantasy settings).","timestamp_created":1605170226,"timestamp_updated":1605170339,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.627914845943450928","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4y/Pm3fUCfMDyrQI="}
