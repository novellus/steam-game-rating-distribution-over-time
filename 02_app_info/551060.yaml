      \ /><br><strong>Stop the creeps in this nostalgic action roguelite!</strong><br><br>Halloween\
      \ night. A sleepy town called Creekside. A mysterious whirring jolts you from\
      \ your sugar coma. As you peer out the window, wiping the sleep from your eyes,\
      \ you question your sanity: Hordes of Creeps assemble around ominous antennas!\
      \ Where are the cops?! Where are the adults?! Is no one going to stop this?!\
      \ It turns out that the nefarious Dr. Apollyon opened a portal to the Bottomless\
      \ Pit. It\u2019s going to be up to you to stop Dr. Apollyon before he takes\
      \ over the world! But first, save Creekside so we can all get back to trick-or-treating!<br><br>You\
      \ play as a reluctant, middle-school hero named Squirt who awakens on Halloween\
      \ to discover his town overrun by Creeps. Squirt\u2019s weapons of warfare are\
      \ randomized guns and costumes with unique abilities. Squirt\u2019s gun has\
      \ randomized attributes; deplete Squirt\u2019s ammo, and Squirt will automatically\
      \ switch to another randomized gun. Collect upgrade tokens to permanently unlock\
      \ new ammo types. Roguelite means lots of deaths, but store upgrades, ammo unlocks,\
      \ costume unlocks and money carryover. Five distinct zones make up Creekside;\
      \ complete objectives to advance to the next zone.<br><br>Creekside Creep Invasion\
      \ garners inspiration from the gameplay of Binding of Isaac and Nuclear Throne;\

    review: This is a extremely fun action rogue-lite/rogue-like game with a  1980's
      Halloween theme that has become one of my all time favorites. It has procedural
      generation (No two runs the same) with hidden and very difficult areas throughout
      the game. Ability to shoot in any direction with crazy cool Halloween themed
      ammo (like eggs,candy corn, and the ability to make all  ammo explosive) that
      automatically changes to different ammo when current ammo is exhausted. You
      have gigantic bosses that drop gigantic loot. You have a 5 slot perk based armor
      that could give you good or bad effects. Controls work great on keyboard, which
      I play mainly.One of my favorite things beside all I have listed already is
      costumes.Yes....you get Halloween costumes that have active and passive abilities
      which make for some really fun runs. More are being added to the game frequently.I
      don't want to give to much information that may spoil others fun away so, I
      will just say again  the costumes really and I mean really change each run in
      a super fun way like no other rogue-lite/like has for me. All this plus an art
      style that has so many references and amusing through backs to the 80's that
      you have to take time to thoroughly look on each level  to catch every one of
      them to appreciate how cool it is.I keep seeing new things I missed run after
      run. Creekside Creep Invasion is a hidden gem so far that many more should discover.There
      is fun to be had for rogue-like veterans and anyone that enjoys a fun challenging
      game.To end it I'll say another one of the awesome perks of the game and one
      of the most important in my opinion is a really nice, informative and accessible
      developer. It has been a real treat to interact with and get to know him.
