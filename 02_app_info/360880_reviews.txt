I placed an object at a certain place (not going to spoil anything here), but the game still behaved as if I needed to place something there. So, object gone, game incompletable, five hours of my life wasted. The game also has a really annoying portal labyrinth which can take you quite some time if you're as unlucky as me. Furthermore, I had to play this on my Windows box as the Linux version would freeze when loading the first level. Posted at the board about this, no answer. So you get a severly broken game with no bug fixes in sight. This means? Right, 0/10 points. Don't get this.","timestamp_created":1541545067,"timestamp_updated":1562859232,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwsOvq8OsCf6eYrgE="}
