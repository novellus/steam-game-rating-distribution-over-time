We were introduced to it on the free Android version, and fell in love with it.  Was the first game I bought on Steam; it's actually how I found out about Steam.\n\nAbout the game, got to play split screen with your kids.  Never gets old.\n\nWhen playing alone, the championships are most fun.  Trying to allocate a chunk of time to do the 23 race championship.  That'll be an hour straight of crazy racing with concentration off the charts.  Will probably need a nap after that.\n\n","timestamp_created":1609986476,"timestamp_updated":1609986476,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJw/oCr7fYCfcyVwQI="}
