Of course, being made by \"Game for people\", the Achievements in \"Guess who ?\" have nothing to do with gameplay; they just come naturally overtime, making this a one-and-done run.\n\n...Or so it WOULD be, except that the game's two recently added Achievements cannot be gained no matter how long it's played and it doesn't look like the developers are ever gonna look into this, so it looks like we're stuck with another incompletable game in the Steam library. üôÑ At least the gameplay's good for a brief laugh or two. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è","timestamp_created":1604635612,"timestamp_updated":1604635612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwtorvzfUCc7bNrAI="}
