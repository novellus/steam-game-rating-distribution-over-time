      \ the Genre</h2>Everything takes place in real-time, with rogue like game progression\
      \ - everything you do is constantly saved, even during the battle. There are\
      \ no second chances, no turns, or multiple reloads. <br>This is a first game\

    developer_response: "Hey Silver, thanks for this informative and detailed review.\
      \ I really appreciate the constructive feedback and I'm sorry that you're having\
      \ trouble playing Medieval Kingdom Wars due to the poor UI choices. \n\nThis\
      \ is a major complaint that we have heard from our players. Clearly our UI is\
      \ not effective if our players cannot understand or use the icons. We're looking\
      \ to revise this in the near future and currently have testers providing us\
      \ feedback on this exact problem. \n\nI can't guarantee that the UI will be\
      \ revised right away -- we're a small studio of only 3 developers so sometimes\
      \ it takes us a while to develop updates. However I guarantee that this will\
      \ be changed in the future. I'll let you know when we've done some updates and\
      \ made some improvements. I would hate to lose a player because of something\
      \ like this! \n\nThanks again for your valuable input. Feel free to message\
      \ me whenever with more feedback/comments!\n"

    review: 'Tooltips please?  I can''t see any of the icons, and that is the primary
      reason I don''t play the game.  I can''t see the icons, and there is no explanation
      of what the UI DOES?  It''s great to have great artwork, but in the end, the
      GUI is a communication tool.  Even though the icons are suitable artistic, they
      are uninformative, and with the absence of tooltips, and the fact that the icons
      for tech etc are too small, it renders the content essentially useless.  Great
      game, good art, interesting structure and gameplay, good ideas, even a good
      GUI.  The problem is that you can''t see what is taking place in the icons,
      and that they are generally uninformative.


      To summarize, either redesign the tech icons etc or add tooltips that say what
      the item is, but also what it does when you buy it.  Please heavily consider
      adding tooltips, possibly linking them with game encyclopedia, as in other modern
      strategy games.  Good Luck!'
