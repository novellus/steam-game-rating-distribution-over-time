    review: "I don't want to sound like a baby, but...what is the point of stating\
      \ \"Partial Controller Support\" when you cannot even use the controller to\
      \ do anything but walk?  That's like having a car with no steering wheel. \n\
      \nWith the aforementioned paragraph in mind, I admit the jumping/platforming\
      \ parts in this game with keyboard/mouse is a tad frustrating.\n\nThe story/concept\
      \ is great, but I may not ever play it again because of the jumping/platformer\
      \ frustration, which is unfortunate because I just want to get past a certain\
      \ part and cant (ok now i really sound like a baby, waaaaaah!)."
