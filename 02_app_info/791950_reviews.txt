It seems thrown-together.\n\nHostile animals attack you with no means of defense.  I tried it, but fighting bears and boars with kicking is ridiculous.  I don't think there are any weapons to be found.  \n\nI looked at the forums for help-  there are 11 posts and the most recent is Aug 12, 2019. It is an advertisement for a cookstove.  The forum is so dead no one even reported it.   EDIT- I reported the ad post and it has been removed, so there's that- at least something works  LOL\n\nVisually, the game looks good, but that aspect is incomplete as well.  I ran the game on \"Ultra\" with a very nice system- I7 processor, 1080Ti, 32GB RAM.   Glitchy shadows with that moving sawtooth edge!  There is no movement to the aurora.  Animals are not optimized- they seem disconnected from the ground.  \n\nI cannot recommend this as a casual game, a survival game, or a simulator at all.","timestamp_created":1584464953,"timestamp_updated":1585011644,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.547325074672698975","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5sqDhfECdY3l+AE="}
