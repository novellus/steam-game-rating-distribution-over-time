And that's really hard for me to type, because I wanted to love this VN. Maoyuu Maou Yuusha is one of my favorite anime and seeing that AMBW took inspiration immediately piqued my interest, so much that I put off buying it until most of the game was put together so I'd have the best possible impression. While it's not entirely done, I eventually gave in and played for it. I'll try to keep this as spoiler-free as possible, but some overarching story details/motions will probably be referenced.\n\nThe first thing you notice is that AMBW is definitely a work of passion, but it's just... so rough around the edges. The opening scene is clearly supposed to familiarize us with Violetta (our closest thing to a main character), but the dialogue just feels stilted and abrupt. You get used to her personality and mood swings, but one of the things I was never able to get used to is the dialogue. AMBW clearly takes place in a medieval setting, but there's sprinkles of more \"modern\" dialogue that just take me out of it. Something along the lines of \"Anyways, tell His Majesty the Emperor that I'll see him later.\" It sounds petty when I read over it, but it stops me from being able to get fully immersed when it's constantly happening. On a similar note, the voice acting is much appreciated for giving the characters personalities, but it's also inconsistent. Some characters were clearly recorded on high-quality mics and sound great, but others sound like they were recorded on an Xbox headset and again, the difference takes me out of the experience. There's a few slip-ups in the recording, as well - one of the characters pronounces \"Marquis\" as \"mar-kwiss\" instead of \"mar-key\" and when that character is in conversation with others pronouncing it correctly, it feels a little amateur. Some of the recurring gags between the characters feel a little ham-fisted, like the Merchant's \"Have you ever considered becoming a...\" and the Farmer's family and their laughs. None of these complaints are absolute deal-breakers on their own, but they lower the quality of the experience.\n\nWith dialogue and speech out of the way, how is the story? ...I'm mixed. On the one hand, AMBW does indeed deliver on the similarities between itself and Spice And Wolf/Maoyuu with a political/economic drama set in medieval times. If someone described the story writ large, I'd be very interested, but as always, the devil is the details. Minor spoilers: Roughly half of the story is Violetta wandering around meeting characters, with the latter half describing those characters gradually coming together. The direction is nice and I like the characters, but my biggest issue is Violetta herself. Personality aside, she just feels forced. Her ability to commune with the heavens and tell characters exactly what they need to know to progress and nothing more, nearly constantly, is annoying. \"Do X.\" \"Why would I do X?\" \"The Heavens told me.\" [character does X and there is a positive outcome] \"How did you know to do X? Are you a fortune teller?\" On the contrary, most of the scenes WITHOUT Violetta were quite enjoyable, because dialogue and plot progression felt a lot more natural, especially towards the end.\n\nIf it feels like I'm nitpicking a bit, it's because I'm saving my biggest issue for last: the price and duration. I'm a big fan of the \"dollar per hour\" rule as a general guideline, but I'm aware that high quality gameplay is obviously worth more. Despite the aspects I do like, for all of the aforementioned reasons I don't think the time I spent with AMBW was \"high quality\" enough justify 20 dollars for an experience that I completed in under 3 hours (including both endings, one of which only happened because certain characters acted way against their established personalities). I'm a fast reader and the end went by even faster as there weren't voicelines to slow me down, but even if it took me double, I'm not sure I could recommend it with the issues it has. There are a few early access problems (mainly regarding sprite placements) that I'm sure can be fixed, but seeing as the price is set to increase after leaving early access it might be more worth it to play it now if you're REALLY looking for something to scratch that Maoyuu itch and don't care about the complaints I already listed. \n\nI never found a place to praise it, but the art throughout is very nice to look at and the soundtrack is fitting and well-made, if not overly memorable.\n\n","timestamp_created":1568334909,"timestamp_updated":1568334909,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":15,"votes_funny":3,"weighted_vote_score":"0.709902584552764893","comment_count":3,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ45PGClO0CcpeQ0gE="}
