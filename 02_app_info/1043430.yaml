    about_the_game: '<i>A relaxing God Game about Terraforming, Water and Farming</i><br><br>In
      classical god game fashion, Tidal Tribe gives you the power to shape the terrain.
      Raise and lower the land to protect your villages from waves and floods, all
      while using that very same water to build lakes and rivers, turning the desert
      land into a lively forest of trees and bushes.<br><br>And these trees are the
      key to your success: provide enough plants of all the different types to allow
      your people to satisfy their needs and make their village prosper. Oh, and make
      sure the paths to those trees don''t pass around a dozen lakes and mountains
      and stuff. There''s no point in having all these plantations if it takes ages
      to reach them. But if you''re not busy building, you can also just relax. Watch
      what kind of shenanigans your people are up too. Depending on the terrain you
      provide and their society stats, they may even start building factories. Or
      become criminals. Maybe wage war. Or just burn everything down again in a revolution.<h2

      missions, several side missions, parkour maps (incorporating the terraforming),
      minigames, treasure maps, photo quests and other surprises. Oh, and different
      endings. However you shape the world, decides what path the story takes.<br></li><li>
      Generally just relaxing gameplay where you build your irrigation channels, shape
      the farmland, build paths and maybe collect some fruits yourself.<br></li><li>
      Free Game and Challenge mode (okay, that one''s a bit less relaxing).<br></li><li>
      Completely dynamic worlds: shapeable terrain, waves flowing through said terrain

      villages expanding and shrinking.<br></li><li> NPC AI includes among others:
      collecting fruits, satisfying their needs, spending their free time, but also

    short_description: Tidal Tribe is a relaxing god game that gives you the power
      to shape the terrain. Raise and lower the land to protect your villages from
      waves and floods, all while using that very same water to build lakes and rivers,
      turning the desert land into a lively forest of trees and bushes.
