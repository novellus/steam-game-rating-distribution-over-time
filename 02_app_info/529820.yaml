    review: I love this game. I used the Oculus Rift S and It worked completely. It
      isn't even compatible yet. I bought it for myself and my friend. We played it
      for 1.6 hours and I'm about to buy it for my little bro. I recommend this for
      people who really want a VR game that's like Dragon Ball. I do wish that there
      was something you could do to charge your energy faster other than waiting,
      but at least it goes up. And even though it worked completely for Oculus, there
      are still some bugs so I ask for full Oculus support please.
