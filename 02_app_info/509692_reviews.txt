I'd put it somewhere between the high end of beginner and the low end of intermediate in terms of difficulty.  It uses all 4 strings without being overly complex, so it's good for getting some practice on the 3rd and 4th strings.\n\nDon't know for the Guitar.","timestamp_created":1498526470,"timestamp_updated":1498526470,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545454561710357666","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw9+nI89wCcvmhfQ=="}
