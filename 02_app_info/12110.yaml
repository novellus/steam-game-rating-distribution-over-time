    about_the_game: "Welcome to Vice City. Welcome to the 1980s.<br />\r\n<br />\r\
      \nFrom the decade of big hair, excess and pastel suits comes a story of one\
      \ man's rise to the top of the criminal pile. Vice City, a huge urban sprawl\
      \ ranging from the beach to the swamps and the glitz to the ghetto, was one\
      \ of the most varied, complete and alive digital cities ever created. Combining\
      \ open-world gameplay with a character driven narrative, you arrive in a town\
      \ brimming with delights and degradation and given the opportunity to take it\
      \ over as you choose.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHaving just made it back onto the streets\
      \ of Liberty City after a long stretch in maximum security, Tommy Vercetti is\
      \ sent to Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli. They were understandably\
      \ nervous about his re-appearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed\
      \ like a good idea. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous,\
      \ hedonistic metropolis of Vice City. He's set up and is left with no money\
      \ and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker gangs, Cuban\
      \ gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. Most of Vice City seems\
      \ to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and take over the city\
      \ himself."

    review: I really do love this game although you have to get around the steam version
      roadblocks. There is an issue with the sensitivity where the y-axis sensitivity
      does match the x-axis sensitivity making the game unplayable. There is a widescreen
      issue that needs to be fixed. These are the biggest problems to play the game
      and you have to fix them through external methods but beside that the game is
      great and a joy to play.
