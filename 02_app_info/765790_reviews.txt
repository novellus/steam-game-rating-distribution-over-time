No story, just do this or that, go there. I can't even see somewehere some small window or unitframe of any kind.\n\nTo be honest, this is maybe ok if you between 6 and 10 years old ,and want to learn how to play RTS, moba kinda of game. Either than this I wouldn't reccomend.\n\nWhat is the point of the game? that's what I keep asking myself.\nSomething like. Welcome this is de Arcade mode, in arcademode you play as a xxxxxx and than goal is to xxxxxxxx. You have xxx recourses just. (Something like this)\n\nAnd make it clear and vivid that you have to do a task, flashing text or quest or whatever. Some voice maybe. It just states on the right in small text kinda what you have to do, it's readable, but it just don't feel like a real challenge or quest. Everything in the game feels like not serious.\n\nSome small info at what things are or do. Im sitting in a portal with all of my team, what does this portal do? Im in it, what is it, do I need to use it? how?\n\nWhen you play on a map, and you click for example on some point, and your units walking, if they encounter an enemy even if they attacked they keep running, ending in alot op HP loss.\nThey could fight back when encountering enemies.. no?\n\nIt's hard to like the game, I try it anyways, but when I do, I feel i try to cheat myself.\nI just don't like it, it's kinda boring and lame.","timestamp_created":1524329189,"timestamp_updated":1525282237,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.541235148906707764","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJ4pP35kOMCd+DcngE="}
