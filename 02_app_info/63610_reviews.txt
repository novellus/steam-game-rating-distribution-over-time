Truly excellent. A perfect follow up to Myst that leaves openings to future games. \n\n   The only downsides I have found is it crashes on windows 7 every once in a great while, I have not had that problem on Windows 10. Also there's no more exploring when the game has been completed, but then the story line wouldn't work if you could still explore once completed. I made this spoiler free so no worries.  Make certain you feel you have finished doing everything you want before releasing the prisoner. The game blocks you from doing anything else except finishing the story once that has been done. It can just be rather annoying, but it is easier to deal with as long as you know that is the situation when releasing the prisoner. You understand what I am talking about once you get to a certain point into the game. Have questions feel free to send me a message.\n\n   There's one hidden movie in the folder of movies I could not find in game. There might not be a way to get it to play in game. Maybe someone can figure it out. The movie is just Gehn walking across the screen singing. You will not miss anything by not finding it, but it is fun. \n\n   Now they just need to remake it like they did realMyst: Masterpiece Edition.","timestamp_created":1586981711,"timestamp_updated":1610045867,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4v8iN7/YCd4WJgQI="}
