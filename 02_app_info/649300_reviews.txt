Buliding anything takes forever. Every enemy unit/building has a million hp and your units do no damage. You control one unit who has to do EVERYTHING: gathering resources, building, researching tech, reloading towers, deploying armies, launching missiles, repairing, etc. For each of those, you have to physically go to that building, pause the game, access the control hub for that building, and then do it. And it even pauses if you try to alt-tab to do something else while you wait for e.g. a building to finish. Also, info about units and structures is severly lacking.\n\nIt feels like the sort of game you'd create in a college programming course. Should've gone in early access at least to get feedback from people.","timestamp_created":1507895400,"timestamp_updated":1507895400,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.686767756938934326","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJw5Lrkit8CdN2SiAE="}
