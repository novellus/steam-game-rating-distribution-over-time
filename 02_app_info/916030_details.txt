Your choices matter - there are multiple drastic ways to change the fate of Shiba Island, with 10+ variants depending on how you treat the dogs you meet along the way.","supported_languages":"English","reviews":"“If I had to compare it to any other VN, I would have to say that it’s much more similar to Hatoful Boyfriend than anything else—not only for its sweet, animal-focused exterior, but also for the darker and more disturbing parts of the story hiding underneath. I’m impressed that such a small studio could produce a highly polished and unique game like this on their first effort, and I’m really looking forward to seeing what they do next.”<br><a
