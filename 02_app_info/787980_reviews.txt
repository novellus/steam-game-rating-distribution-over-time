I still like that there is a game on Steam about 4D, finally (I can't wait until Miegacure comes out btw). Though this game, since it's on Steam, should have at least to be better than free old apps out there..\n\nCons:\n- frequent crashes in the recent update (after you start new game and click on cell (0, 0, 0, 0) it seems to always crash\n- dull look, and all those \"0\" tiles which create clutter. Even the original Microsoft's game probably looked better than this one\n- I'm pretty sure that using \"Minesweeper\" in the title is not allowed since the name is Microsoft's trademark. Even on Linux this game was called \"Mines\" to avoid a lawsuit from M$\n- left+right click should open all tiles around the clicked one, if the number of flagged tiles around it is the same as the number on the tile - that's how the original Minesweeper worked\n\nOverall: finally something 4D on Steam, but needs work. So far it looks like a shool/student assignment, not ready for a commercial release both in presentation and in feature set.","timestamp_created":1538840356,"timestamp_updated":1543058508,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.453591793775558472","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwjondoucCf5aZrAE="}
