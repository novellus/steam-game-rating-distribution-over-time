      \ from the depths of the ocean to fight in Square-wide struggle, the underwater-breathing,\
      \ fish-like Aquarion have summoned their aquatic allies to take dominion over\
      \ their land-dwelling kin. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnlike the other tribes, the\
      \ Aquarion have a unique style of gameplay. Instead of getting Riders, Knights,\
      \ or Giants, the Aquarion are given replacements, the quick Amphibian, ranged\
      \ Tridention, and hardy Crab, respectively. These units are all amphibious,\
      \ meaning they can move from land to water tiles, and back, with ease! The Aquarion\
      \ are also given new replacement technologies to make this new gameplay style\
      \ possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Aquarion have a unique relationship with\
      \ the water that other tribes don\u2019t have. While they still have access\
      \ to the standard naval units, the Aquarion have new units that excel in amphibious\
      \ hit and run tactics. The Amphibian, Tridention, and Crab all have Escape,\
      \ meaning they are very hard to pin down when near a coast, as they can simply\
      \ retreat away from enemy attacks. Since Aquarion terrain is full of water,\
      \ they are able to get out onto the seas very easily!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf\
      \ you like a tribe that has a unique water-based gameplay, or you simply have\
      \ a fondness for the sea, then the Aquarion are the perfect tribe for you!"

    review: "[h1]Summary[/h1]\nThis Aquarion tribe is unique to play as! It has some\
      \ special units most other tribes do not get which can make it challenging to\
      \ play against. Now onto the review part of things. This review will also be\
      \ short as there isn't much to talk about.\n\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\nThis DLC's\
      \ only adds one new tribe called Aquarion which has some special units that\
      \ this tribe only has.\n\n[b]Aquarion Tribe[/b]\nThe Aquarion tribe contains\
      \ some various units that can go over water including its own unique super unit.\
      \ \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nI do recommend getting this DLC if you like the base\
      \ game quiet a bit! It's definitely a unique challenge if you seek a tough challenge!\
      \ Now that concluded this review and have a great day!"
