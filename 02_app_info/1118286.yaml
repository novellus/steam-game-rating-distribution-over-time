    about_the_game: The Peugeot 208 WRX was built in early 2018 and took its first
      victory at Mettet in Belgium. Team Hansen MJP returned in 2019 and were immediately
      competitive, with Kevin Hansen taking victory in Abu Dhabi. The car was extremely
      fast and stable in the corners, with both Timmy Hansen and Kevin Hansen making
      the most of this with their noticeably smooth driving styles.
