You have a weapon in one hand and a racket in the other (you can switch which one is in which hand).  Each stage (so far) consists of three waves where you defend against drones.  Use your weapon to destroy the drones, matching the color of your shots to the color of the drone.  Some drones will shoot projectiles at specific tiles in the arena, and you must defend these tiles by deflecting the projectiles with your racket, matching the color of the racket to the color of the projectile.  Other drones shoot directly at you.  These shots can't be deflected and must be dodged.  If a drone hits you or a tile, you take damage.  Take too much damage, and you lose.  Completing a stage earns you points that can be used to upgrade weapons or unlock new ones.\n\nThere are two difficulty settings.  On normal difficulty, it started out pretty easy but got challenging pretty quickly.  Later stages add multiple platforms that you must defend by teleporting back and forth between them, multiple simultaneous drones, and drones that fire multiple shots.  I currently have three different weapon types unlocked, which I'm guessing is all of them based on the selection interface, but there seems to be plenty of upgrades for them left.\n\nBased on my experience so far, I would definitely recommend this game.  The gameplay is fun and the visuals are quite good.  Played on an HTC Vive with the Vive controllers.  I do have Index controllers but haven't tried them yet, and I have the HP Reverb G2 on preorder, so I may update later with how it plays using these.\n\nUpdate:  Tested with Vive headset + Index controllers.  Works great.","timestamp_created":1604442172,"timestamp_updated":1604584930,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.583333313465118408","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":true}],"cursor":"AoJwrd+tzPUCeaqRrAI="}
