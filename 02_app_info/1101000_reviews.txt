For a moment, I thought the tutorial was over; it was the end credits.\n\nNot a point n' click.\nSomeone should educate Educa Thyssen about video games.\nThis is a puzzle-platformer where platforming poses zero challenge to your skills (only to your patience when waiting for slow platforms,) and where the half handful of puzzles practically solve themselves.\n\nMoreover, to my surprise, this has no educational value. Not a single piece of info included. Made by a museum. About that museum. Most likely subsidised by a ministerio de cultura.\n\nVapid.\nNot worth a dime.\nBarely worth a peseta.","timestamp_created":1580587339,"timestamp_updated":1580587339,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.466321229934692383","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4z5mWgfACcJzP7wE="}
