    about_the_game: "The Shu Warrior Bundle will get you a new outfit, which significantly\
      \ reduces the danger of being grabbed by zombies (both Biters and Volatiles),\
      \ a new buggy paint job (Metal Rat), and blueprints for three new weapons. The\
      \ Gust of Wind is the first crossbow you can craft (along with various bolts)\
      \ from base-game materials, which means it is available early in the game and\
      \ you don\u2019t need The Following expansion pack to enjoy it. The Leaping\
      \ Tiger Dao is an extraordinary sword that rewards skilled warriors. Its blade\
      \ is imbued with ancient power and lights up after you successfully land a couple\
      \ of consecutive hits, granting you a damage boost. The same goes for the Dragon\
      \ Ji polearm, which additionally lets you unleash an especially devastating\
      \ power attack.<br><br><i>Please note, buggy paint job requires Dying Light:\
      \ The Following expansion pack.</i>"
