    review: "Don't let my playtime fool you: I've logged many a night playing this\
      \ puppy offline.\n\nIn short, this is one of the most fun roguelikes I've seen\
      \ yet. The controls are not overtly-complicated yet the game remains very challenging\
      \ (I've yet to get even a single win, for example). I always play this as a\
      \ Human Warrior, because I am masochistic, and god damnit I WILL win as a Human\
      \ Warrior haha.\n\nGood points: \n[list]\n[*]A great dev who routinely updates\
      \ his game, perhaps a bit TOO much (more on this later) \n[*]Controls that don't\
      \ require a membership to MENSA to figure out\n[*]Good graphics, especially\
      \ for a genre that usually has either poor ones or none at all / ASCII\n[*]An\
      \ interesting array of different items, wands, armor, and weapons to find. Finding\
      \ a special piece of gear off some named enemy is very satisfying!\n[*]Even\
      \ though I use only 1 class and race there are a ton of different ones from\
      \ which to choose. Mummies don't need to eat, Ogres are really strong but can't\
      \ move diagonally, etc. I appreciate that they're in there, even if I'll never\
      \ play them.\n[*]Cool little 'side events' are littered throughout: Timed gates\
      \ for bonus treasure, Crystal chests that give you a choice between different\
      \ rewards, named monsters in special little rooms, etc. It really helps break\
      \ things up a lot.\n[/list]\n\nNot-so-good points:\n[list]\n[*]Updates SOMETIMES\
      \ make things a bit worse than before. By this I mean the UI is contantly changing,\
      \ not always for the better. I do realize that perfecting your game's UI is\
      \ difficult and it can never seem \"quite right\" but IMO the UI looked its\
      \ best maybe 2 or 3 updates ago. \n[*]I wish there were more merchants to find.\
      \ Dont' get me wrong- they're in there, but I never seem to find many at all.\
      \ I've had runs where my guy has traversed 10 floors or so and never saw anyplace\
      \ to spend my hard-earned money. And I explore basically 100% of every floor\
      \ too. That's RNG for ya!\n[*]Eventually projectile-shooting enemies will gang\
      \ bang you to death. If you happen upon the lava levels for example there are\
      \ many enemies you live in the lava you can't really get at and they'll shoot\
      \ you all the live long day.\n[*]I realize it's probably just a drawback for\
      \ the entire genre but I really notice having to click, click, click, click\
      \ in this to move around. This is mostly because your guy will auto-stop whenever\
      \ danger is spotted, which is nice, however it will keep happening even after\
      \ your guy has spotted trouble and you're moving to intercept the threat. I\
      \ don't know how else this could be programmed though.\n\n--\n\nBut overall,\
      \ this is a big YES. My favorite roguelikes lately would be both this and another\
      \ (free) game called The Ground Gives Way (TGGW for short). That one is colored\
      \ ASCII art but very well-worth a try. I just got my first win with that one\
      \ this past week. Maybe I'll get my RF3 win this week too!"
