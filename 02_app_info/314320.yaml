    review: "Com quase 100 horas de jogo e depois de 2 anos sem nem mesmo toc\xE1\
      -lo, resolvi vir aqui para fazer o que acredito que seja uma cr\xEDtica justa.\
      \ \n\n[h1] Gameplay: [/h1] \n\nO estilo de gameplay dele lembra muito Game Dev\
      \ Tycoon e segue o mesmo padr\xE3o na quest\xE3o do desenvolvimento de cada\
      \ jogo, onde voc\xEA precisa escolher em que \xE1rea deseja dar mais aten\xE7\
      \xE3o (Gameplay, UI, Som, Hist\xF3ria, etc). \nApesar de possuir algumas caracter\xED\
      sticas que o distingue de seu \"rival\", ele acaba caindo na mesma situa\xE7\
      \xE3o que o mesmo e entrega algo simpl\xF3rio, repetitivo e enjoativo. \n\n\
      [h1] Interface: [/h1] \n\nA interface deste jogo n\xE3o possui nada de atrativa,\
      \ tendo um design pregui\xE7oso e que da a impress\xE3o de que o desenvolvedor\
      \ n\xE3o deu a min\xEDma na hora de cria-la. Para novos usu\xE1rios ela \xE9\
      \ um desastre total, j\xE1 que muitos bot\xF5es como o que abre a aba do hist\xF3\
      rico de jogos ficam escondidos sobre determinados objetos em nosso escrit\xF3\
      rio inicial. N\xE3o s\xF3 isso, mas os bot\xF5es s\xE3o bem feios e podem ser\
      \ comparados aos de jogos web mais simples. \n\nComo conclus\xE3o, \xE9 poss\xED\
      vel dizer que a interface peca em entregar algo intuitivo e que agrade quem\
      \ est\xE1 jogando.\n\n[h1] Gr\xE1ficos: [/h1] \nTirando a interface, n\xE3o\
      \ h\xE1 muito o que dizer dos gr\xE1ficos em si. A escolha de arte do jogo \xE9\
      \ bem decente para o g\xEAnero e possui alguns detalhes bem interessantes em\
      \ determinados pontos.\n\n[h1] Nota final: 6/10 [/h1] \n\n[b] OBS: [/b]Caso\
      \ queira adquirir este jogo, saiba que o desenvolvedor o abandonou e o mesmo\
      \ n\xE3o recebe mais atualiza\xE7\xF5es."
