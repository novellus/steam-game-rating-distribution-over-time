    review: "AS IS a broken mess (for me) i tried contacting Pixel Games UK here and\
      \ on twitter with no reply, there is no support whatsoever.\nThe first part\
      \ was fine, but this seems to constantly crash on me, even though it runs through\
      \ Dosbox.\n\nThere are only 5 sports in part 2 compared to 6 sports in the first\
      \ part, and the sports in this one i personally didn't like as much as those\
      \ in the first one, this might still be okay if you are really nostalgic, but\
      \ atleast if the game would work.\n\n[Edit] It was a very uneasy way to get\
      \ contact with the publisher and they are very short, sometimes circumvent questions\
      \ (also questions i had with other games, like with Impossible Mission 1 that\
      \ was also a broken mess), while many publishers that give us old games they\
      \ are cracked but for reasons these don't crack their games, and not made very\
      \ clear so it's very easy to get confused on that, even though they provided\
      \ a manual, it's still tedious and unnecessary, so that's why it goes into some\
      \ demo mode and thus the quitting. \n\nI changed it to a postive for nostalgia\
      \ sake, even though there is little nostalgia, would be more a mixed review\
      \ for how the publisher handle certain things."
