The first three types are easy to come by and nothing special. Fight a couple of monsters and you find them. You can craft the other three or find them later in the campaign. This DLC adds unnecessary \"advantages\" that you can easily get on your own. You only need these jewels on the Expert difficulty and even then you find plenty of them in the game...\n\n[b]P.S.:[/b] To activate the Rough Oculi Pack install it on Steam and then launch the game while having uPlay on. It should ask you if you want to add it to your uPlay account and then confirm once you are in the game. You also have to start a new save in order for these rewards to appear.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]If you liked this DLC review you can find more in my [/b][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/srcorner][u]Review Corner[/u][/url][b].[/b]","timestamp_created":1586258081,"timestamp_updated":1586258081,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.611940324306488037","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4zq6WqvECc6bw/gE="}
