    about_the_game: '<h2 class="bb_tag"><strong>What Is Babel: tower to the Gods?</strong></h2>It''s
      a charming physics based puzzle game designed around room-scale VR for the HTC
      Vive, which will test your coordination and wits, as you battle physics while
      working out how to de-construct part of a tower <i>(to the gods)</i>.<br><br>You''ll
      have to approach the towers from every angle walk, crouch, and even possibly
      jump, using a range of divine tools &amp; weaponry to carefully disassemble
      &amp; thoroughly check the stability of each unique and bizarre monument built
      before you, all while protecting the sacred totem, to ensure it''s safety for
      it''s worshippers!<br><br>There''s a variety of different types of puzzles in
      it, requiring a range of different skills - precision, logic, speed &amp; more!<br>Examples:<br><ul
      class="bb_ul"><li><strong>Precision </strong>- Using careful movements of your
      Vive controllers, slide a sword between blocks and push out blocks whilst narrowly
      avoiding the volatile and <i>explosive bomb blocks</i>, which will detonate
      with the slightest of your touch!<br></li><li><strong>Logic </strong>- Work
      out the correct order &amp; method of deconstruction! Knock out blocks simultaneously
      to keep the tower balance! Or, is there a large amount of blocks ontop of a<i>
      slippery ice block</i>? Give it a fast &amp; hard whack from the side to sent
      it quickly sliding out of the tower without the blocks ontop falling off!<br></li><li><strong>Speed
      </strong>- Some towers may contain blocks that are being <i>burnt away</i>!
      Once these blocks finish burning, they''ll be reduced to ash &amp; disappear!
      Solve the tower fast enough that these burning blocks don''t cause it to topple!</li></ul><br>We''ll
      be adding more block types, features &amp; even new game-modes in the future!
      So an eye on those change logs to see what''s new!'
