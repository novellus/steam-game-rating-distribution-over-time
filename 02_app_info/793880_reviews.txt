Hop on, put on your music, and workout to a selection of beautiful and immersive atmospheres that react to your music.\n\nI only wish there were more scenes. A way to connect a bluetooth cadence sensor for a workout machine would also be an incredible addition to this. Imagine your stationary bike actually allowing you to pedal forward and move through these environments all while listening to your music. Turning this into a fully fledged fitness app + standalone music visualizer would be a worthwhile investment IMO.\n\nIn any case, if this sounds like something you might use it for I totally recommend trying it out. I've never felt so motivated to stay on that bike.","timestamp_created":1609441667,"timestamp_updated":1609441667,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4+9yM3fYCeeGXvwI="}
