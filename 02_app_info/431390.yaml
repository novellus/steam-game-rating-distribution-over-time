    review: 1 space buck too much. This is a unique product, made with love, and care.
      You basically get to stick your head inside a couple of diorama (boxes), one
      a small demo, and the other the Tetris themed room. I love when VR goes small
      scale like that, but you could easily spend more time in the free Gnomes and
      Goblins demo (more places to stick my head into). I liked this, but there's
      a strong chance you will feel burned if you buy it. [spoiler]Make this F2P to
      stimulate sales of the more expensive sequels, eh?[/spoiler] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlmiyDpw4sA
