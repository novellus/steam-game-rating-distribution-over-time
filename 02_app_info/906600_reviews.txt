The game just spawns random enemies at you in random places in huge quantities and gives you random guns and it often feels just unfair. All the levels are pretty repetitive too.\n- Levels are monotonous. Every level feels like a copy of each other. I thought that maybe at least the last levels of every world would be interesting as in there will be an exciting boss battle? Nope, the last level is just the same enemies but MORE for some bullshit reason.\n- The grind. After you beat the horrendous last level of a world you can't just go to the next world you HAVE TO grind this world more to get more \"points\" to unlock the next world. This sounds like the worst game idea ever? Yeah I mean it is.\n- A lot of redundant mechanics: dodge roll, wall climbing, reloading. Why does this game have such an unnecessary level of complexity? Why can guns be reloaded if you pick up a new gun every 5 seconds and thus almost always don't have a chance to use up all your ammo? Wall climbing ofteen feels like it just gets in my way. As for dodge roll... I completely forgot that it even existed after tutorial.\n- UI sucks. The word \"Achievements\" doesn't even fit into its button, button hover effect sucks, settings menu sucks, overall menus look completely unexciting.\n- No interesting extra gamemodes besides the main one.\n- No lore of any kind.\n- Music is boring, sound effects often feel out of place.\n\nAnd finally, the game lacks DEPTH. It feels really plain and boring and repetitive for no reason. Don't recommend buying it.","timestamp_created":1609536621,"timestamp_updated":1609536621,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJ4nPn23/YCe9vCvwI="}
